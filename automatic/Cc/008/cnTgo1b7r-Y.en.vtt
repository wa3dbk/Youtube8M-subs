 hello dear friends today i am 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.960
 I will tell you about all the chips I'm all 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.560
 remarkable but about samsung galaxy 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.560
 note 10.1 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.509
 as for the characteristic then 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.420
 the characteristic here is flawless 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:20.340
 quad exynos 4412 processor 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.000
 statues of 1 integer 4 tenths 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.490
 gigahertz 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.800
 together with the mali-400 mp4 accelerator 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.859
 superb graphics no lag in 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:37.019
 interface and frantic results 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.260
 benchmarks even included live 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:42.260
 wallpaper in the interface and we do not observe 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.449
 one lag 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.979
 everything is very smooth brakes not 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:53.809
 perhaps the most important feature is present 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:57.179
 This tablet is a pen with pam 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.190
 interaction with the program with laptop she 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.920
 allows you to reveal all your lines and 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.070
 potentials when we take out the pen s pen 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.670
 i.e. samsung ben gets pulled out 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.939
 socket 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.840
 and when we hang on the display Murochka 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.729
 appears small. 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:20.429
 let's run the program with but there are mine 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:24.450
 drawings my note which is shown 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.229
 quality front camera to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.750
 recognize 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.810
 pam pen in this tablet 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.679
 installed two touch screen one 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.960
 multitouch to 10 simultaneous touches and 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:40.219
 another from wacom for 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:45.409
 recognition this pen display 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:50.280
 reacts to 1024 levels of touch ie 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.789
 the display can even recognize the pen 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.159
 when I look at the water I press down a 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:00.909
 that's strong that's weak that's strong 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.499
 that is, it recognizes the level of depression 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.899
 display more precisely the tablet can 

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:08.599
 recognize formulas 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:11.299
 recognize shapes from square do 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:15.290
 even I draw a triangle 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:19.660
 and he aligns only draw a circle of ion 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.700
 aligns the arrow also aligns 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.910
 also the tablet can perfectly recognize 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:31.849
 handwriting input here and inline 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.980
 Photoshop touch application and also very 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.519
 good program called smart 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.250
 remout 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.170
 This program is using infrared 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.110
 the port of this tablet allows you to do 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.980
 from the tablet is absolutely universal 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.900
 remote control to any TV and divid 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.690
 device blue-ray players 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.109
 and so on now we will try to enable 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.109
 television 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.780
 ron switch channel 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:32.140
 louder there louder 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:32.140
 next channel previous channel and 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:40.370
 turn off the installed music 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.820
 The player has the function of music 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.940
 square 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.800
 which recognizes your music to 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.550
 mood 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:53.420
 passionate, exciting, joyful and calm 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:56.540
 let's look at the construction site tablet 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.420
 very powerful wifi receiver installed 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:06.680
 so that the file he catches very far 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:09.140
 if bluetooth 40 is installed in the section 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.170
 the display is an intelligent function 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.840
 waiting means that the screen remains 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.130
 enabled while you look at it 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.460
 front camera tracks 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.060
 your your face and when you look at 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.900
 display 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:28.270
 it does not go off and when you turn away the display 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.920
 goes off there is a function screen mode which 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.420
 can to which you can set the heat 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:39.950
 movie screens are the dimest standard and 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:43.010
 dynamic dynamic mode itself 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.780
 saturated with the tablet there is a section 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.020
 movement in which there is a slope 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.900
 move and swing what it is now I 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.150
 I'll show you the panorama made by the data 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.660
 tablet now I'll show you 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:00.640
 tilt sensor I put two fingers on 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:03.890
 display and bringing the display yourself 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.810
 the image is increasing and when 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:09.070
 cant 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.139
 down but decreases when i increased 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.389
 image as not necessary i can either this 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.400
 move like this here and can either 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:19.389
 put a finger and moves instead 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.400
 fingers tablet function is enough 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:25.740
 interesting 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.740
 as if the camera itself is on and you are watching 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.180
 using another sensor when i 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.910
 hold app 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:41.100
 I can move another page 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.100
 move by moving the tablet 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:50.559
 in the security section you can create 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:55.949
 screen lock in which there is 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:58.270
 face recognition signature and drawing 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:01.089
 facial recognition is peculiar 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.849
 face control in the handle section can 

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:05.349
 set some settings this sound in 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:08.110
 distraction pen connection 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:13.360
 energy saving and action after 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:18.490
 disable pen in the special section 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:22.659
 possibilities you see that there are parameters 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:25.389
 developer and in the settings more in 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:27.279
 Basically nothing interesting and no well 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:29.110
 so what , finally, let me show you and 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:31.120
 results from one of 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.180
 professional benchmarks antutu 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.180
 benchmark 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:42.430
 This tester showed us 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:45.399
 as many as fifteen thousand 914 this is very 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:48.069
 great result for mobile 

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:51.580
 devices but see here 

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:53.580
 tablet specifications well in 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.749
 principle told him everything he could 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.499
 The only useful nonsense . 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:07:02.439
 it can expand memory and 

00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:05.499
 this device using the slot for 

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:08.259
 micro sd cards what basically am i 

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:10.289
 told all the highlights of this 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:15.180
 tablet or 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:19.849
 with what I think you learned very well 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.849
 this tablet everyone thanks everyone bye
