they're online but yeah I've been raised
them<00:00:24.240> up<00:00:24.359> slowly<00:00:24.570> over<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.199> last<00:00:25.320> four<00:00:25.650> years

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
them up slowly over the last four years

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.599 
them up slowly over the last four years
and<00:00:26.400> they<00:00:27.180> kind<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.480> started<00:00:27.840> reading<00:00:28.609> last

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
and they kind of started reading last

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.179 
and they kind of started reading last
August<00:00:30.480> actually<00:00:30.960> first<00:00:31.230> time<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.470> saw<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.830> I

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
August actually first time I saw it I

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.030 
August actually first time I saw it I
just<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.850> them<00:00:33.030> together<00:00:33.380> change<00:00:34.380> their<00:00:34.910> and

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
just have them together change their and

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.619 
just have them together change their and
they've<00:00:38.040> run<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.250> few<00:00:38.489> more<00:00:38.640> times<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.480> then

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
they've run a few more times and then

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.700 
they've run a few more times and then
they<00:00:40.020> bred<00:00:40.290> once<00:00:40.500> before<00:00:40.739> Christmas<00:00:42.379> and<00:00:43.379> then

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
they bred once before Christmas and then

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.979 
they bred once before Christmas and then
I<00:00:44.219> kind<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.940> figured<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.329> she<00:00:45.600> was<00:00:45.719> grabbing

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
I kind of figured that she was grabbing

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.090 
I kind of figured that she was grabbing
but<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.350> hard<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.530> tell<00:00:46.770> with<00:00:46.860> Bloods

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
but it's hard to tell with Bloods

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.369 
but it's hard to tell with Bloods
because<00:00:47.460> they're<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:47.850> fat<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.930> hard<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.200> tell

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
because they're so fat it's hard to tell

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.060 
because they're so fat it's hard to tell
what's<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.010> with<00:00:50.219> them<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:52.010> kind<00:00:53.010> of

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
what's going on with them but I kind of

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.439 
what's going on with them but I kind of
figured<00:00:53.340> she<00:00:53.460> was<00:00:53.579> grounded<00:00:53.789> because<00:00:54.030> she<00:00:54.360> was

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
figured she was grounded because she was

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.650 
figured she was grounded because she was
really<00:00:54.719> roaming<00:00:55.170> around<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.559> cage<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.660> guess

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
really roaming around the cage I guess

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.450 
really roaming around the cage I guess
looking<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> place<00:00:58.410> suitable<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.190> lay<00:00:59.340> her

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
looking for a place suitable to lay her

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.150 
looking for a place suitable to lay her
eggs<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.809> put<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.109> nest<00:01:01.410> box<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.070> I

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
eggs and so I put this nest box in and I

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.310 
eggs and so I put this nest box in and I
mean<00:01:02.370> not<00:01:02.579> like<00:01:03.180> literally<00:01:03.539> within<00:01:03.960> five

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
mean not like literally within five

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.620 
mean not like literally within five
minutes<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.860> putting<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.400> she<00:01:05.580> was<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
minutes of putting it in she was in the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.960 
minutes of putting it in she was in the
nest<00:01:06.840> box<00:01:07.020> never<00:01:07.350> came<00:01:07.619> back<00:01:07.770> out<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> was
