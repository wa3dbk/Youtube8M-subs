00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
and in a microwave if your drying time

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.980 
and in a microwave if your drying time
is<00:01:32.929> one<00:01:33.319> to<00:01:33.860> three<00:01:34.280> minutes<00:01:35.060> that's<00:01:35.720> certainly

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
is one to three minutes that's certainly

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.719 
is one to three minutes that's certainly
a<00:01:36.080> lot<00:01:36.200> faster<00:01:36.709> than<00:01:36.830> what<00:01:36.979> we're<00:01:37.099> used<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.399> it

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
a lot faster than what we're used to it

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.359 
a lot faster than what we're used to it
is<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.390> conventional<00:01:39.170> method<00:01:39.590> is<00:01:39.770> seven<00:01:40.220> to

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
is the conventional method is seven to

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.639 
is the conventional method is seven to
ten<00:01:40.580> days<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.599> you<00:01:41.660> see<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.229> drying<00:01:42.560> process

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
ten days so you see the drying process

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.139 
ten days so you see the drying process
is<00:01:43.429> lessened<00:01:44.060> once<00:01:44.599> it<00:01:44.869> is<00:01:44.899> dry<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:47.090> the

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
is lessened once it is dry and the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.040 
is lessened once it is dry and the
silica<00:01:47.810> gel<00:01:47.840> has<00:01:48.319> cooled<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:49.880> very<00:01:50.509> slowly

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
silica gel has cooled you very slowly

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.380 
silica gel has cooled you very slowly
with<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.530> paintbrush<00:01:52.069> brush<00:01:52.729> away<00:01:52.970> the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
with the paintbrush brush away the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.260

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
there is any residue you still on the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.699 
there is any residue you still on the
flower<00:01:58.970> you<00:01:59.410> very<00:02:00.410> gently<00:02:00.759> brush<00:02:01.759> it<00:02:02.319> and<00:02:03.319> then

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
flower you very gently brush it and then

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.020 
flower you very gently brush it and then
and<00:02:04.099> it<00:02:04.190> will<00:02:04.340> come<00:02:04.580> right<00:02:05.060> off<00:02:06.489> there<00:02:07.489> is<00:02:07.700> one

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:44.749 
that comes to my mind can we dry all

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:46.899 
that comes to my mind can we dry all
different<00:02:45.260> types<00:02:45.469> of<00:02:45.620> flowers<00:02:46.099> at<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.700> same

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
different types of flowers at the same

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.229 
different types of flowers at the same
time<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.780> is<00:02:47.810> better<00:02:48.319> if<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:49.040> not<00:02:49.370> do<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:50.000> if

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
time it is better if you not do it if

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.500 
time it is better if you not do it if
you're<00:02:50.359> drying<00:02:50.780> roses<00:02:51.560> dry<00:02:51.889> all<00:02:52.189> roses<00:02:52.879> or<00:02:53.180> dry

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
you're drying roses dry all roses or dry

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.429

all pansies or orchids you should not

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.559 
all pansies or orchids you should not
mix<00:02:57.829> them<00:02:58.129> because<00:02:58.459> obviously<00:02:58.609> each<00:02:59.120> one<00:02:59.389> has

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
mix them because obviously each one has

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.479 
mix them because obviously each one has
a<00:02:59.599> different<00:02:59.719> drawing<00:03:00.260> time<00:03:00.560> okay<00:03:01.040> now<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.459> see

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
a different drawing time okay now I see

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.399 
a different drawing time okay now I see
that<00:03:01.879> you've<00:03:02.000> used<00:03:02.269> these<00:03:02.450> dry<00:03:02.689> flowers<00:03:03.109> in

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
that you've used these dry flowers in

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:04.929 
that you've used these dry flowers in
lots<00:03:03.739> of<00:03:03.889> different<00:03:04.219> ways<00:03:04.280> not<00:03:04.489> just<00:03:04.549> putting

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
lots of different ways not just putting

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.490 
lots of different ways not just putting
together<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.569> wedding<00:03:05.840> bouquet<00:03:06.139> again<00:03:06.469> I

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
together the wedding bouquet again I

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.140 
together the wedding bouquet again I
guess<00:03:06.739> you<00:03:06.859> just<00:03:07.040> copy<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.459> original<00:03:07.549> bouquet

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
guess you just copy the original bouquet

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.470 
guess you just copy the original bouquet
but<00:03:08.780> also<00:03:09.049> by<00:03:09.829> framing<00:03:10.430> them<00:03:10.609> and<00:03:10.879> then<00:03:11.359> this

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
but also by framing them and then this

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.809 
but also by framing them and then this
is<00:03:11.689> certainly<00:03:12.019> a<00:03:12.319> new<00:03:12.650> wrinkle<00:03:13.250> down<00:03:13.609> here

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
is certainly a new wrinkle down here

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.259 
is certainly a new wrinkle down here
