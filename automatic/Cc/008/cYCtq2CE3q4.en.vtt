 The purpose of the foundation is to help 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.710

 and we're doing crusades north of 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.150
 impenetrable chaqueño these crossed to 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.770
 favor the widgets in the chaco like 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.890
 they emerged as they were born emerged by a 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.760
 Chaco 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.819
 the wonderful human being who came up 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.280
 and he said look, I do not want to show you what 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.250
 what is happening in chanco he made a 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.000
 survey and I when I see in material 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.100
 byte 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.400
 that you find and I find 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.000
 with communities with basic needs 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.300
 the mochis north of the impenetrable 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.800
 and they are forgotten the first time 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.330
 we went we found many 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.250
 surprises like which and for example I 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.739
 they gave two lists a list of criollos 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.800
 a list of buzzi and if then it was the 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.500
 conflict to whom we left and how 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.430
 we really carry for all for all 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.989
 the families 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:59.760
 willis or is not everything much better each 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.760
 once the crusades are better 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.600
 how was it going back to the second year after 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.750
 from that first experience is that when 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.930
 you go there wants to go back 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.810
 you are going to give 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.680
 what you have and what are we going 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.150
 approximately 15 18 20 people 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.609
 we practically live with how much 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.590
 time they stay for example a week 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.959
 and you are getting to know the different 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.090
 families and covering the different 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.389
 needs totally agree here 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.599
 in the delivery such thing for example everything 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:46.189
 it has to do with agriculture 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.739
 the carpentry then the following year 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:51.019
 they are the same person to the same 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:55.389
 family, I will not give you the same and 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:04:00.319
 that 's how I'm covering the needs 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:02.329
 that we can originate tell me about 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.849
 this center of community integration 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.230
 who are building what their 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.739
 Finnish 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:13.069
 and how this idea came about did not arise because 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:16.900
 the cacique of three wells mariotto lamas 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:20.120
 he asked us for a place to meet 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.450
 where we can discuss the different 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.890
 communities 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.890
 and then we came up with 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.550
 Beyond being a center 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.860
 community we could make a center of 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.860
 community integration so that 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.840
 the curious participate after we said 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.710
 those who go from a community to the 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.300
 another relative the 35 or 40 kilometers that 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.080
 have a place to pay to eat 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.500
 for example 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.740
 or where to stay at night to get 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.819
 until 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.569
 instead we said they have to follow 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:57.580
 with the crafts they have to 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:00.190
 continue with the language that is wonderful 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.530
 it would be that they learn trades that there is a 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.110
 place where the kids can play 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:08.530
 where they can recreate 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.320
 they can have their library where 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.080
