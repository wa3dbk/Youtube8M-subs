00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
 video made specifically for the site here 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.649
 top point ru 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:10.080
 Hello everyone in this video, we will look at 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.870
 armor t-62 is a soviet medium tank 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.460
 tenth level old branch development and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.410
 so we have two possesses good 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.619
 armor in the tower but his body 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.420
 cardboard let's start 240 millimeters 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.740
 turret frontal part 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.019
 the cast tower is all so rounded 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.350
 rounded waste in general shells 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.710
 keeps just fine next thickness 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.250
 that's 214 millimeters a little further 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.120
 after this main frontal and 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.760
 turret commander 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.390
 which is left well or right if you look 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.510
 from the enemy 161 millimeters 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.340
 this is millimeter this is the back of the boards 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.640
 turrets and the back of the turrets 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.910
 the very commander 153 mm is 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.880
 already such a circle which is getting closer and 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.909
 closer to the top of the tower goes 102 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.869
 millimeter this is the frontal part and the upper 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.610
 and the lower ones make their way on dozens on 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.520
 hooray just from any angle 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.500
 Well, immediately that there are some random 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.119
 bounce 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.439
 95 millimeters is the tower roof itself 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.070
 75 millimeters is the bead 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.159
 all completely they go at an angle in without 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.820
 Return angle at 90 degrees for 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.729
 sign of the angle of the bow 70 millimeters is 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.970
 pens mehvoda holes here these in which 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:47.689
 and looks more and more as you can see there is nowhere 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:52.020
 nothing 65 millimeters 65 millimeters this 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.700
 nape of the tower feed 60 millimeters this 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.290
 these ones 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.200
 stand under the tower as you can see they are 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.310
 the boards are only present but 160 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.350
 here that 70 there is no difference fifty 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.469
 eight millimeters is the back 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.140
 the roof of the tower is and the turret of the commander 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.930
 top and 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.850
 2 turret 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.480
 55 millimeters is the back of the head already 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.520
 also at an angle is i think that not 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.180
 This is not this part of the problems with 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:30.570
 a breakthrough is not 50 millimeters this 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.050
 little holes on tower 48 this is right 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.340
 part 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.080
 left turret and right turret but not all 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.110
 but still 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:47.520
 closer to the turret, I do not even know how it is 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:50.670
 These places call so continue 40 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.660
 millimeters guns 30 millimeters more 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.660
 the nape of the head of the tower 25 here 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.950
 again nothing but there is no bead 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.950
 they are slightly sloping down there and here in 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.900
 this place has a thickness of twenty 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:13.800
 this is the bottom and the caterpillar of the tower is not visible but 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.390
 it is generally not necessary anywhere else to 15 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.769
 millimeters they are 16 feed 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.810
 karma roof 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.019
 but let's all look at this 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:29.430
 shelling him from a similar 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.050
 tank shoot t-62 we will be from exactly 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.110
 the same guns from exactly the same 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.760
 tank 200 all four millimeters breakdown 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.130
 you see him 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.010
 lower upper armor plates and forehead cases 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.470
 without any problems, but in 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.570
 the tower the problems do not break through 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.420
 turret commander thanks to different 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.570
 triplex and form your shells into it 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.660
 just plain hard to fall so not 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.790
 the forehead of the tower is positioned with a diamond position 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.010
 break through problems with a breakthrough at all 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.140
 occurs stitched as bottom 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.540
 armor sheet aki upper armor list 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.400
 and besides, it starts to be purged 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.650
 the tower because it turns out under 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.170
 right angle and projectile all rubles into it 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.230
 passes the hull board also make their way 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.570
 when shooting just in the board you can kill 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.940
 even where it does not even aiming 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.940
 everywhere thanks for your attention
