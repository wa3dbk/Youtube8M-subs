 some other models of frezerov this 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:43.450
 frezer has an outdoor installation account that 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:49.000
 makes it easier to check them so replace them 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:53.950
 this frezernoy cost practically 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.130
 450 dollars but considering reliability 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.400
 firms 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:03.579
