00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 roan 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.730
 deprive of victory 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.700
 to the Cuban richard april 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.879
 is called 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.119
 giving a river a boxer who like 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.790
 I said in my prediction it's just going towards 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.640
 go ahead and as a kid said donaire 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.529
 he gets hit and when he boxed 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.680
 find him got tired a bit like what 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.230
 did to the question and pto 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.110
 Acosta with a termination can win 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.410
 your fight 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.750
 but with laughter in April 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.660
 that's not because he has the Cuban school 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.660
 goal 0 that is totally different 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.050
 to america 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.960
 with this I am not discriminating against 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.650
 Mexicans because I have Mexican idols 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.470
 as Juan Manuel Marquez as the Siri 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.360
 come out that if they are tremendous or senators 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:04.140
 and a respect for them like the fires 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.140
 July Cesar Chavez 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.340
 I have a respect for school 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.710
 Mexican I am Cuban and for me Mexico I 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.170
 same 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.710
 a country that I really like acapulco 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.060
 df all the pristine 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.060
 but we are talking about boxing 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.460
 and the commentator a commentator or 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.830
 interviewer I do not know about him and he's friend 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.950
 of brandon is always doing in bla 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.850
 blah blah blah blah blah blah did not lose his 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.450
 Fight 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.400
 Now he means that he was already 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.000
 embracing that if it was a fight of 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.390
 element faith not in boxing your health 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.890
 then grip is used they are all used 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.890
 the professional uses all this 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:03.250
 you are not happy he and you are not a referee 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.820
 you are a fan of brandon rivers 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.820
 Y 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.050
 professionally 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.609
 brandon lost his fight that you know 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.609
 he also knows 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.280
 like the fight of Juan Manuel Marquez 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.890
 against pacquiao who were already saying 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.530
 what mark I was stepping on here 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.500
 absurd although the foot has standing the 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.160
 another foot forward and to the right being the 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.480
 another has to have a contact not 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.520
 pacquiao lost his fight 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.980
 cleansed 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.550
 you do not have to be a boxer to see those 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.000
 losses 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:51.010
 erislandy lara against paul 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.709
 williams lost wyn jones lost 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.709
 he lost wing to his fight he did not win 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.830
 then now they want to see talking a 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:06.280
 river against against Juan Manuel Marquez 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.640
 brandon is a message that I give you 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.100
 as a boxing fan and we 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.380
 amateurs because I was born in a family of 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:19.190
 boxing in tuba 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.520
 my father the theophilus coach 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.940
 stevenson de félix savón de los 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.760
 rodríguez de maldito martínez 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.400
 my father 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.530
 that is to say that I have a tremendous vision of 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.689
 amateur boxing game but I also have the 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.079
 vision because I was born I was born in debt 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:37.079
 solís 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.550
 he lost his fight and if you come across 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.700
 an ama juan manuel marquez you are going to lose 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.730
 in which you look for another associate of 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.610
 do not ride other others and if you 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.610
 they get it wrong to be with him with no exit 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.519
 gamboa we wrote they said and see if you 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.550
 take gamboa that hits harder than the 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.200
 river that yes that is April if you take 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.530
 gamboa and with the speed they have 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:17.389
 both in the fifth you go you left 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:19.730
 do not comment now wants with marquez not 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:23.090
 you 're going to win brands of looking to touch 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:26.400
 to the other arranged voceados and all that 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.100
 that does not have much is 16 things 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.800
 because with marquez will not give you the 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.400
 account and with wonder martínez either 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.919
 and with floyd with totally dies you 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.620
 because because you're not a good fighter you're 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.470
 Very talkative 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.930
 what you did in the pre-conference of 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.800
 want to smack the coach 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:52.229
 April that was why it was that 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.520
 you lost the fight boxing has to be 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.250
 more humble more calm 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.190
 and above rim prove it as 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.840
 do all the champions marquez 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.060
 mayweather speak a little but 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.280
 mayweather can speak the charismatic 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.980
 but ours are not calling gamboa q 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.650

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.230

 do not talk more than professional boxing 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:45.160
 to be elbowed in head butts 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:49.990
 all that 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:51.880
 yes brandon in diving to mateo 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.440
