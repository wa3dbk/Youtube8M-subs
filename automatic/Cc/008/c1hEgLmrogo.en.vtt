00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
of different resolutions out there so

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.470 
of different resolutions out there so
the<00:00:29.010> more<00:00:29.189> dots<00:00:29.490> make<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> better<00:00:30.330> the

the more dots make the better the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.299 
the more dots make the better the
picture<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.439> right<00:00:31.679> now<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.890> know<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
picture so right now you know in the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.220 
picture so right now you know in the
Sharptooth<00:00:32.610> we're<00:00:33.210> talking<00:00:33.480> about<00:00:33.690> bigger<00:00:34.050> is

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
Sharptooth we're talking about bigger is

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.200 
Sharptooth we're talking about bigger is
better<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.590> course<00:00:34.829> as<00:00:35.040> always<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.730> our<00:00:35.760> 60

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
better of course as always with our 60

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.389 
better of course as always with our 60
70<00:00:36.630> 80<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.870> 90<00:00:37.230> inch<00:00:37.380> TVs<00:00:37.710> but<00:00:38.190> more

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
70 80 and 90 inch TVs but more

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.680 
70 80 and 90 inch TVs but more
importantly<00:00:38.790> about<00:00:39.149> different<00:00:39.450> types<00:00:39.600> of

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
importantly about different types of

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.229 
importantly about different types of
resolution<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.950> 4k<00:00:41.280> TVs<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.120> about

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
resolution so with 4k TVs you have about

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.900 
resolution so with 4k TVs you have about
24<00:00:42.750> million<00:00:43.170> dots<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.620> information<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.460> with

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
24 million dots of information and with

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
24 million dots of information and with
our<00:00:45.270> lower<00:00:45.480> end<00:00:45.719> three<00:00:46.260> color<00:00:46.440> product<00:00:46.800> about

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
our lower end three color product about

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.590 
our lower end three color product about
six<00:00:47.250> million<00:00:47.430> dots<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.820> information<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
six million dots of information so the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.270 
six million dots of information so the
more<00:00:48.750> dots<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.410> better<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> picture<00:00:50.039> and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
more dots the better the picture and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.200 
more dots the better the picture and
we've<00:00:50.399> got<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> number<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.879> other<00:00:51.090> technologies

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
we've got a number of other technologies

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.400 
we've got a number of other technologies

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
what you should first know it's quattron

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.690 
what you should first know it's quattron
and<00:01:05.880> what's<00:01:06.299> wrong<00:01:06.720> that's<00:01:07.680> right<00:01:07.920> like<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
pixel to the RGB color gamut giving you

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.950 
pixel to the RGB color gamut giving you
a<00:01:14.189> billion<00:01:14.520> or<00:01:14.610> more<00:01:14.640> extra<00:01:15.210> colors<00:01:15.509> that's

a billion or more extra colors that's
the<00:01:16.080> first<00:01:16.290> key<00:01:16.409> piece<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:17.159> there<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.369> piece

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the first key piece but there are piece

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.710 
the first key piece but there are piece
that<00:01:17.700> people<00:01:17.939> don't<00:01:18.060> know<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.210> well<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.630> it

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
that people don't know so well is it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.240 
that people don't know so well is it
gives<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.020> extra<00:01:19.080> dot<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.009> gives<00:01:20.159> you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
gives you that extra dot so it gives you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.100 
gives you that extra dot so it gives you
more<00:01:20.280> resolution<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.450> what<00:01:21.600> shirts<00:01:21.840> been<00:01:21.990> able

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
more resolution so what shirts been able

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.270 
more resolution so what shirts been able
to<00:01:22.170> do<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.470> year<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.890> find<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> happy

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
to do this year is to find a happy

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.950 
to do this year is to find a happy
medium<00:01:23.430> from<00:01:24.240> individuals<00:01:24.810> who<00:01:24.869> are

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
medium from individuals who are

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.480 
medium from individuals who are
interested<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.320> 4k<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:25.950> maybe<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.400> bit

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
interested in 4k but maybe a bit

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.859 
interested in 4k but maybe a bit
concerned<00:01:26.759> about<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> price<00:01:27.180> point<00:01:27.450> or<00:01:27.630> maybe

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
concerned about the price point or maybe

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.149 
concerned about the price point or maybe
understanding<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:28.560> for<00:01:28.860> them

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
understanding it's not for them

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.490 
understanding it's not for them
so<00:01:29.549> quattron<00:01:30.030> plus<00:01:30.329> from<00:01:30.900> sharp<00:01:31.140> just

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
so quattron plus from sharp just
