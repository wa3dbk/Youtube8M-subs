00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.790
 have you asked what would happen if 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.510
 our greatest heroes would become 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:23.290
 our most fearsome threat if beings 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:27.520
 most powerful will face 11 between 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.029
 they answer you find it justice 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.900
 league 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.090
 force waiting for another dance game for 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.950
 dates from that fantastic golden age 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.870
 where everyone wanted to make clones 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.420
 from street fighter 2 however I would 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.950
 I wonder why you would want to buy a 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.579
 mediocre clone of street fighter 2 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.649
 released in 1995 taking in the catalog 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.300
 the super nintendo not one but three 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.300
 street fighter 2 games 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:02.450
 well yes I know not king of fighters 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.450
 It's a street fighter 2 plan 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.970
 yes yes you like it a lot 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.350
 which is better than street fighter 2 but 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.290
 Well, maybe king of fighters came out 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.370
 for the super nintendo 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.810
 then all that league is has not 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.820
 foundation or if he did not say transform was 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.650
 released by song soft during the era 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.510
 of its restructuring and exploiting the 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.500
 already very singed warner license 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.270
 good brothers 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.680
 that the league of justice is not of 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.680
 warner and dc comics 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.039
 if as well as the spiderman give us 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.469
 disney is marvel I do not know and of course bait 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.810
 they know they have in common the force two 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.189
 devil 3 and world of warcraft that the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.130
 three were developed by blizzard 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.810
 a petite and insignificant empresita 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.939
 that would eventually become another 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.179
 already more insignificant and more 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.069
 flatulent call activision blizzard 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.750
 almost nothing the fighting games with 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.090
 marvel characters developed by 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.380
 capcom had been a huge success so 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.909
 to make a game with the characters of 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.149
 the small store opposite was 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.690
 sure gain there is no place where 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.970
 start 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.099
 good in case someone still has not left 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.510
 clear after force is a fighting game 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.959
 with the characters of the universe of dc 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.489
 comics like superman 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:27.720
 'the batman' hand peterpan sheldon cooper 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:31.019
 in Mayas the cat of the thundercats the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.010
 Tapailla woman and others contains 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.189
 various game modes 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.110
 let's see let's see the story mode 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.120
 story tells that darkside a being 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.129
 Alien comes to earth with not very 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.200
 good intentions and between your legacy of 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.180
 mischief decides to destroy a base 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.739
 military so it runs on behalf of 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.140
 one of the members of the super friends 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.549
 stop this serious threat despite 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.500
 it is assumed that the other members of 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.510
 the league are your friends as soon as they see 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.310
 your flying mouse will let you go to tip 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.870
 of carpets and mounts party 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.579
 maybe they will be jealous that it is the 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.680
 only character with possibilities of 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.319
 generate here in the cinema the rest of the 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.819
 history has two sides the first 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.829
 batman complaining like a quinceaÃ±era 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.889
 planted of how his colleagues do not 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.870
 help in the face of such a crisis and the second 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.940
 must look for the next super friend 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.459
 to naively request your help 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.829
 so you can fill it up and leave it with 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.750
 tremendous account to the hospital and at the end 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.299
 again complain about the bad milk that 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.190
 are his super ex friends pushing him to 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.010
 eventually begin to suspect that 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.769
 Darkside is possibly involved 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.220
 in this saint bolton de chu pirul batman 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.810
 do not tell me my dear batman who does not 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.210
 you saw the rotary newspaper of 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.510
 start that clearly said 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.580
 dark side is the bad guy of the ladies game and 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.650
 gentlemen, I present to you the greatest 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.950
 Gothic city detective know what it is 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.960
 the bad of the good story mode now 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.900
 that I think about it there is very little redeemable in 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.870
 this game but the bad points are 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.120
 point 1 no matter which character you choose 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.340
 the story always exactly the same 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.430
 even the screen texts are 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.840
 exactly the same texts that 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.820
 they are nothing more than a bunch of letters 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.510
 white on a blue background with the logo 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.050
 of the game 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:17.140
 let's ninja gaiden of the month with everything and 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.210
 which is a game of 1988 you had in the 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.800
 display was very complicated to add 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:24.820
 scenes display to a super game 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.470
 nintendo of 1995 point 2 is pretty 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.150
 common in this type of games that if of 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.650
 soon that all with an enemy 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.970
 you can change the character for one with 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.330
 that you can defeat him with more 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.400
 ease but here there was no how are you going to 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.750
 change character will not be that 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.970
 go to alter the course of this 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.550
 interesting story mode when changing 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.890
 of character who knows maybe if 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.780
 you choose superman as he works in the 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.440
 daily the planet the possibly 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.630
 go direct 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.630
 to run around while giving 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.580
 another game mode is the battle 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.099
 where you can use any 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.719
 character including the bad guys and even 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.180
 You can take you to clones of the same 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:06.939
 character that you're using that said 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.300
 by the way are soft had the great 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:12.400
 occurrence of differentiating both monkeys 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.349
 making one of them a little bit more 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.270
 dark which is not good for much 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.860
 because sooner or later finished 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.349
 confusing you with which of the two is 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.840
 your character and what is the clone are 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.400
 software this is for you I'm from 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.139
 agreement that superman is a character 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.389
 strongly established in the collective 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.279
 popular and more confident I am that you should 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.020
 respect the Pantone colors in which 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:35.349
 established in the order of registration of 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.060
 US patents and if we know that 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.740
 is patented since in the box of the 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.840
 game puts is a trademark sign 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.449
 registered in each row but for 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.939
 please nothing that consisted to put another 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.789
 little color that will differentiate it more or if 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:51.099
 but out of all that, it's a game 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:53.349
 of fighting the truth not the powers are 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:56.650
 difficult to remove the characters are 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:58.900
 very few special powers are the 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.000
 combos are non-existent and I know not 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.220
 I am the best with vero in history 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.740
 but it will be done without much effort the 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:10.540
 hit hard and abu that in this game 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:13.720
 never never came out and that more like that 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.000
 brings absolutely nothing to the genre 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.500
 of fighting games other fighting games 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.720
 contemporaries as author of mails 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.180
 fighters brought the bar of power 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.790
 super special that would eventually be 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.530
 standard in the genre or chÃ¡vez that 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.960
 provided the cure for insomnia in all 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.220
 mexico in conclusion if you really 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.170
 you die for playing a street clone 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:36.390
 fighter 2 buy yourself one called 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.390
 street fighter 2 obvious turbo 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.760
 I 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.350
 and me
