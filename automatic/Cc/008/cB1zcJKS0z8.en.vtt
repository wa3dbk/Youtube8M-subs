00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello together because the film factory today 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.370
 I introduce you to the classics 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.340
 children of men before is a movie of 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.620
 alfonso cuarón from the year 2006 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.320
 By the way, this year gravity made and 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.880
 playing in england england in 2027 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.440
 has completely changed from the outside world 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.060
 what's wrong with me too ? 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.800
 that people are not anymore 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.779
 have been able to reproduce for 18 years 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.310
 no human being was born anymore 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.619
 There is still breeding and breeding in england 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.500
 Reason enough for all foreigners 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.500
 to throw out of the country than suddenly 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.719
 just one of the illegal seemingly 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.760
 pregnant means she is now the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.200
 hope of mankind and one can 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.600
 Admit that the last few years 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.579
 wrong policy has been like 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.890
 We can not be an illegal one in the country 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.469
 At the same time have hope of the people 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.420
 be pretty complex story like 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.750
 she looks and how gloomy it is 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.309
 dystopia for the year 2027 looks like this 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.210
 he sees here 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.610
 I do not remember when I last 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.719
 had something like hope and me 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.100
 certainly not when 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.359
 Anyone else had hope 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.370
 because seriously 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.920
 since the women no more children 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.979
 we can get on it 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.979
 to hope 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.080
 Today the world was destroyed by the death of 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.430
 Diego Ricardo shakes the youngest 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.380
 people on this planet 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.259
 the youngest man in the world became 18 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.550
 years four months 20 days 16 hours and 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.220
 eight minutes old 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.480
 the ultimate bezzel why are they 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.160
 women barren 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.140
 some say it's six budding 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.490
 experiments polluting what 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.530
 do you believe why we no longer have children? 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.270
 can not be witnesses and does not matter 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.660
 It's all over for 50 years anyway 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.660
 is too late 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.850
 hello how are you 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.570
 excuse the whole theater of the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.770
 police night extreme last time 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.850
 I did not see you for 20 years 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.760
 I need your help 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.110
 not for me for a girl we 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.939
 you have to bring to the coast 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.020
 checkpoints over 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.600
 funny feeling to see you again 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.289
 he had your eyes why are you too 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.140
 come to me 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.140
 I trust you, it shows him 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.840
 Now you know what's after the game 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.780
 we have to reach the boat what is 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.370
 that for a good the people otherwise young 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.150
 Project have sent a boat that 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.620
 youth red 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.220
 the biggest candle in the world works for 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.220
 a new society 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.180
 your child is the miracle on that 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.180
 whole world has been waiting 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.580
 I promise you that we will get away 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.970
 find you to the young project 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.970
 bring 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.280
 we almost made it 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.280
 almost there 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.370
 why is portray on manage for me 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.080
 a couch classic that's easy 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.390
 that logically first 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.570
 good movie is synonymous but this disco pi 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.550
 So this negative vision of the future 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.470
 just so incredibly enthralling realistic 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.020
 and it really works 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.100
 the filthy here today and now and 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.460
 if you think about it always comes 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.050
 closer this dystopia has it 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.360
 just something where I feel that 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.160
 okay, what would really be if 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.140
 which also happens fantastic 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.950
 Actors clive owen good as long 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.870
 not julian merger of michael caine 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.960
 fantastic cars at the same time 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.540
 criticism also in our way of life today 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.630
 but also brings if you have so many 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.580
 approaches family all must go out and we 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.090
 put the first time any stock 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.100
 Of course, rhine is also so easy 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.690
 Nazi holocaust 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.370
 Bonds or approaches where the film 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.990
 that works fantastic that works 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.730
 is actually not a problem that you 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.290
 something led so yes that will now 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.780
 just brought another year 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.850
 no, not at all, and it comes to that 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.460
 even that alfonso cuarón such a 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.930
 brilliant director it is always up to the 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.370
 right places rainer always goes 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.160
 the right places out he gets that 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.530
 Best of the performers and make it 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.260
 Also to instruct a cameraman so 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.180
 that in the last third of it one of the 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.460
 most gigantic scenes for me the 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.130
 film history is an eighth 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.380
 to nine-minute plan sequence in it 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.940
 no cut gives all in the 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.700
 Air is flying it's grief 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.710
 It will just be so many different 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.960
 There are emotions in one go through 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.520
 a big scandal that the film no 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.200
 Oscar has won for the best camera 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.150
 though pans labyrinth alright 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.700
 It was then that he won but that is 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.230
 for me one of the most blatant crassest 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.070
 attitudes I've ever been in the movie 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.760
 have seen 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.050
 By the way, the movie leaves one extremely 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.460
 Depressed back one has to say there are 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.080
 maybe in one or one 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.450
 but that is hopeful 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.150
 a movie that does not make a good mood but 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.270
 that's why there is simply no good 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.070
 two me too 10 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.560
 ten points it is one of the best 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.540
 movies that I personally know therefore 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.030
 also one of my favorite movies super 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.510
 played a hammer outfit the 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.910
 world is really so real 2027 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.250
 and there is no weakness 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.960
 really no weakness no matter how much 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.770
 I want to search and that's just what 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.980
 from me 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.080
 ten out of ten points for children of the 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.170
 has a review children of men from you 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.450
 I would like to know what are yours 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.550
 darkest future visions where he thinks 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.800
 oh god, if that happens, hopefully 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.820
 I'm not curious down here 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.380
 Do you have the opportunity to get one? 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.060
 other card classic to look at 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.920
 if she would rather go to the cinema 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.900
 I linked something else for you 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.490
 We'll see each other again soon 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.440
 a new couch classic next week 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.210
 sunday or just to a new one 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.580
 Film criticism soon here again 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.580
