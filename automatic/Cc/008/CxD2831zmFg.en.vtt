so<00:01:55.170> now<00:01:55.320> after<00:01:55.680> I've<00:01:56.010> curled<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.490> I'm<00:01:56.640> just

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
so now after I've curled it I'm just

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.399 
so now after I've curled it I'm just
going<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.060> go<00:01:57.150> ahead<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.450> twist<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.840> bit<00:01:58.260> of

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
going to go ahead and twist that bit of

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.649 
going to go ahead and twist that bit of
hair<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.890> then<00:01:59.850> I'm<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.180> going<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.360> pinch

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
hair and then I'm just going to pinch

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.040 
hair and then I'm just going to pinch
and<00:02:00.900> pull<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.350> for<00:02:01.740> some<00:02:01.920> volume<00:02:02.400> and<00:02:02.580> texture

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
and pull it for some volume and texture

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.450 
and pull it for some volume and texture
now<00:02:04.050> we're<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.440> actually<00:02:04.830> place<00:02:05.160> this

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
now we're going to actually place this

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.810 
now we're going to actually place this
curl<00:02:05.790> inside<00:02:06.720> of<00:02:06.870> our<00:02:07.020> braid<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:08.580> I'm<00:02:08.670> just

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
curl inside of our braid so I'm just

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.660 
curl inside of our braid so I'm just
going<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.030> open<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.509> up<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:10.009> then<00:02:11.009> simply<00:02:11.400> pull

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
going to open it up and then simply pull

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.340 
going to open it up and then simply pull
this<00:02:11.820> curl<00:02:12.150> through<00:02:18.020> I'm<00:02:19.020> going<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.230> go<00:02:19.290> ahead

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
this curl through I'm going to go ahead

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.170 
this curl through I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:19.530> do<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.709> same<00:02:19.950> thing<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.640> opposite

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
and do the same thing on the opposite

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:32.640 
and do the same thing on the opposite
side

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.899

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
I'm going to add a little bit of texture

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.729 
I'm going to add a little bit of texture
spray<00:02:35.239> for<00:02:35.540> some<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.870> these<00:02:35.989> this<00:02:36.290> is<00:02:36.409> really

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
spray for some of these this is really

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.800 
spray for some of these this is really
going<00:02:36.829> to<00:02:36.920> help<00:02:37.040> Corson<00:02:37.970> up<00:02:38.090> her<00:02:38.209> hair<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.659> add

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
a lot of texture to it so I'm just going

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.390 
a lot of texture to it so I'm just going
to<00:02:41.329> spray<00:02:41.569> it<00:02:41.659> all<00:02:41.780> over<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.290> then<00:02:42.890> pinch<00:02:43.189> and

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
to spray it all over and then pinch and

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.360 
to spray it all over and then pinch and
pull<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.939> then<00:02:44.510> weave<00:02:44.989> it<00:02:45.019> through<00:02:45.470> our<00:02:45.709> braid

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
pull and then weave it through our braid

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.699 
pull and then weave it through our braid
here<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:47.420> can<00:02:47.569> see<00:02:47.780> how<00:02:47.900> much<00:02:48.049> texture<00:02:48.530> that's

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
here you can see how much texture that's

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.430 
here you can see how much texture that's
given<00:02:49.099> it<00:02:49.390> open<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.450> piece<00:02:50.659> of<00:02:50.810> our<00:02:50.959> braid<00:02:51.200> and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
given it open a piece of our braid and

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.070 
given it open a piece of our braid and
just<00:02:51.530> simply<00:02:52.099> pull<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.430> through

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.840 

so<00:02:56.740> now<00:02:56.860> we're<00:02:57.040> just<00:02:57.070> getting<00:02:57.490> to<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.700> last

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
so now we're just getting to the last

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.790 
so now we're just getting to the last
bit<00:02:58.210> I'm<00:02:58.570> using<00:02:58.960> a<00:02:59.110> little<00:02:59.320> bit<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.500> texture

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
bit I'm using a little bit of texture

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.220 
bit I'm using a little bit of texture
spray<00:03:00.130> just<00:03:01.090> kind<00:03:01.300> of<00:03:01.360> pinch<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:01.870> pulling<00:03:02.110> it

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
spray just kind of pinch and pulling it

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.560 
spray just kind of pinch and pulling it
out<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:02.620> then<00:03:02.860> interweaving<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:03.940> into<00:03:04.300> our

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
out and then interweaving it into our

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.130 
out and then interweaving it into our
braid<00:03:05.290> here<00:03:05.830> and<00:03:06.420> that's<00:03:07.420> basically<00:03:07.870> what

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
braid here and that's basically what

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.170 
braid here and that's basically what
we're<00:03:08.320> gonna<00:03:08.410> do<00:03:08.680> throughout<00:03:09.040> because<00:03:10.030> we

we're gonna do throughout because we

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.880 
we're gonna do throughout because we
want<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.480> hide<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.900> braid<00:03:11.140> we<00:03:11.320> don't<00:03:11.680> want<00:03:11.830> it

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
want to hide the braid we don't want it

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.660 
want to hide the braid we don't want it
to<00:03:12.040> show<00:03:13.740> go<00:03:14.740> through<00:03:15.070> and<00:03:15.310> then<00:03:15.520> I'm<00:03:15.640> just

gonna go ahead and go through and

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.940 
gonna go ahead and go through and
pancake<00:03:17.710> the<00:03:17.860> braid<00:03:18.100> out<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:20.080> then<00:03:20.410> pull<00:03:20.710> any

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
pancake the braid out and then pull any

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.770 
pancake the braid out and then pull any
of<00:03:21.070> these<00:03:21.190> loose<00:03:21.550> ends<00:03:21.850> into<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.630> hairstyle
