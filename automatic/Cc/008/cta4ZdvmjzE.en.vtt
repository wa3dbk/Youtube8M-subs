00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 today we make roast pork in 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.740
 clay pot we need a piece to 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:12.679
 to advise my neck what we salt with 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.059
 and pepper and paprika 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.640
 if the freestanding is beautiful with the seasoning 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.020
 covered we leave it for half 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.390
 hour by hour rest and in the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.689
 In the meantime we will prepare 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.220
 the vegetables in front 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:34.669
 what exactly vegetables do you find? 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.669
 of course again on www kfw de 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:44.930
 then the vegetables can be in the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.920
 already be cut in the meantime 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.329
 we need that later than 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.329
 Flavor and underlay in the 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.329
 earthenware pot 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.670
 good that with the spice I would have now 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.710
 can cut a bit 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.360
 but I thought I'll show you this 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.360
 make it complete again 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.390
 so that it gives a nice crust it is 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:58.330
 important the paprika powder really nice 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.780
 easy to incorporate into the meat 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.350
 put 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:06.190
 Now let it and finish the vegetables 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.330
 there we are already it just needs roughly 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:15.580
 the vegetables are cut 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:20.020
 also celeriac tomatoes may carrot yes 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:24.190
 actually soup vegetables if the meat 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.810
 then it is still with one 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.130
 Mustard layer rubbed 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.520
 we take an extra hot mustard 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.520
 but that is a matter of taste 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.370
 Again, evenly everywhere 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.370
 distribute are thick 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:15.239
 yes to clay pot again the clay pot must 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.849
 Of course at least half to one 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.349
 hour before use properly extensively 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:24.260
 it will be watered in the oven 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:26.129
 does not break and the clay pot comes 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.170
 of course in the cold 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.349
 oven 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.620
 so now we are still pouring about touch 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:39.450
 half to three quarters to half 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:42.230
 Let's say the vegetables should be like that 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.230
 be covered 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:52.709
 Finally, a big two 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:57.590
 arteries on top and then for 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.590
 about an hour in the oven 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:19.170
 the hour is over now we take that 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:22.860
 Meat from the pot and give the sud 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.890
 collected through a sieve and from the 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.850
 South we will make a sauce afterwards 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:34.380
 you can with sauce binder or with 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:37.980
 Strength bind a little and there is one 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.340
 excellent sauce who wants to 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.470
 also puree and bind the vegetables 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.730
 use 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:51.180
 pure taste thing it tries out 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:53.720
 What you like the most meat 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:05:02.180
 then go again without a lid 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:02.180
 into the hoven so that the crust becomes beautiful 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.560
 when the meat is completely finished afterwards 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.020
 then you should consume it form still 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.310
 by about ten minutes in 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.800
 wrapping alufoil and outside of 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.919
 let rouge then collect 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:39.560
 the juices and tastes so very good 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.560
