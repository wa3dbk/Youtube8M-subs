00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
that information in the play and it's

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.520 
that information in the play and it's
interesting<00:03:11.420> because<00:03:11.690> mark<00:03:12.019> having<00:03:12.290> played

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
interesting because mark having played

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.190 
interesting because mark having played
last<00:03:13.010> year<00:03:13.280> actually<00:03:13.629> he<00:03:14.629> was<00:03:14.780> out<00:03:14.930> night

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
last year actually he was out night

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.900 
last year actually he was out night
though<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:15.620> there's<00:03:15.709> less<00:03:16.099> information<00:03:16.459> on

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
though so there's less information on

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.729 
though so there's less information on
him<00:03:17.120> then<00:03:17.299> maybe<00:03:17.450> one<00:03:17.720> would<00:03:17.870> hope<00:03:18.049> dealing

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
him then maybe one would hope dealing

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.259 
him then maybe one would hope dealing
with<00:03:18.859> someone<00:03:19.040> coming<00:03:19.400> back<00:03:19.519> again<00:03:19.700> he's

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
with someone coming back again he's
