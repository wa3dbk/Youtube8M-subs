00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.880
 hello everyone today we will do 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:11.630
 review on some weird anboxing 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:15.260
 headphones from sony sony playstation pulse 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.340
 This is a wireless headset for headphones 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.939
 sony playstation 3 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.789
 with the new patch it will be available and how 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.170
 would be on playstation 4 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.060
 but can also be used on 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.430
 computer and there any mobile 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:36.770
 devices we will probably reveal 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:38.480
 how we are going but I took it as a box 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.710
 fucked up 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.020
 boxes are now nothing so box 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.239
 beautiful stylish which is quite 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.640
 compact pre-release headphones only 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:57.079
 what is the current topic in general 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.649
 our boxing and review here such here 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:04.350
 Headsets also kit included under 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.170
 use three and a half jacks for 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.700
 connections either to the computer or me so 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.960
 I think more with mobile devices 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.140
 adapter that connects to 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.750
 connects to at station 3 or 4 for 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.460
 connections of the ears themselves in general then with 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.799
 prefix and standard goes here 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.189
 little book 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.960
 thick pancake tongues for 20 just horseradish 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.650
 understand 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:38.700
 you can learn languages ​​on a hike so than 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:43.399
 Interest headphones there are new headphones 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.380
 bsmp technology function 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.799
 generally using today's 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.159
 of the day I realized that this feature gives us 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:56.280
 more such surround sound and and no matter how 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.820
 strange bitch don't vibrate during 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.820
 enable this feature here it is where we 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.280
 such a right and water 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.259
 impact on the right here is a bulk wound 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:13.269
 guilt but such a runner 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.970
 bass impact this crap already start bitch 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.860

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.900
 vibrate as if you are a bitch joystick 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.579
 no fucking on your head here but really 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.129
 In fact, the feeling is very funny and 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:30.340
 because they play some joker 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:33.220
 when the grenade explodes fucking under 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.790
 feet I thought I would turn gray there 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:41.680
 fuck lose fuck but it's certainly very 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:45.730
 cool feeling very cool here bass 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.519
 Infect a bunch of different settings that is 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.519
 here's the mpeg bass here to tune its power 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.489
 so to speak mode switching under 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.690
 cinema to the music to various even genres 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.480
 games oddly enough 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.609
 i.e. playstation 3 times when you play 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.200
 you can make a fit for shoot an ipod 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:06.930
 something I don't know about anything in general 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.760
 sounds like 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.959
 setting at normal volume 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.180
 voices inclusion standard wajib 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.620
 charging starts 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.500
 you can turn on the microphone can be changed from 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.250
 mode and turn off the feature that's still 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.250
 surround sound 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.199
 about the design in principle aluminum 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.389
 Likely here used some but 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:34.930
 I am a little embarrassed of course 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:39.549
 thin he some well hopefully not 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.519
 raskhrenachil it fast price price about 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:46.930
 at the price I wanted to say price 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:49.239
 awesome overestimated almost 7,000 rubles this 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.629
 in russia anyway in america 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:57.310
 you can either order for $ 400 not 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:04:00.310
 4 to 100 tons 150-160 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.549
 but for Russia 7000 it is very very very 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.290
 much for the ears 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:08.680
 the more gaming as they themselves 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.220
 position the same headset here is my 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.069
 the former headset it costs a thousand rubles 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:21.370
 thousand bitch he can be a half right now 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:23.050
 new version here and this is 7 so the price 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.340
 perceptibly not everyone can afford 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:30.070
 such an expensive headset but the price 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.380
 quality i think from sony sony in general 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.789
 great always done things like 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:43.389
 playstation 3 2 1 any other 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:46.389
 features for them well about the sound played 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:49.000
 only a couple of hours today so nothing 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.659
 I can not speak intelligently but the sound 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.580
 very pleasantly very pleasantly felt 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:55.029
 7 channel system that is those din 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.450
 sound 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:05:01.050
 volumetric this is very cool from all 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.570
 the parties can be heard where the enemies are in battle 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.370
 straight you can take back and when 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.190
 shoot near something explodes this 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.830
 just straight goosebumps 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.349
 so to all game lovers everyone 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.680
 holders of the playstation 3 platform either 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:20.260
 4 moby I can well recommend this 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.180
 I don’t know the model yet, it seems they said 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.330
 announces new to bed four more 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.950
 so far nothing but this pisyulka 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:32.159
 which goes complete i think 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:34.630
 suits nobody will thank you all 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:38.130
 If something new will appear
