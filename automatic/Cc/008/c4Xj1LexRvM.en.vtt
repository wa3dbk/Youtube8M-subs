00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.340 
actually nano-sized particles that are
extremely<00:01:21.000> extremely<00:01:21.330> tidy<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:22.110> what<00:01:22.229> they

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
extremely extremely tidy but what they

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.600 
extremely extremely tidy but what they
do<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.500> they<00:01:22.830> fill<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.340> all<00:01:23.490> those

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
do is they fill in all those

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.160 
do is they fill in all those
imperfections<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.689> creates<00:01:25.020> an

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
imperfections so it creates an

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.230 
imperfections so it creates an
incredibly<00:01:25.740> slick<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.250> smooth<00:01:26.580> surface<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
incredibly slick and smooth surface and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.390 
incredibly slick and smooth surface and
then<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.810> means<00:01:27.930> less<00:01:28.259> loop<00:01:28.500> chain<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.250> you're

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
then it means less loop chain so you're

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.280 
then it means less loop chain so you're
getting<00:01:29.490> more<00:01:29.939> miles<00:01:30.299> something<00:01:31.170> that's

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
getting more miles something that's

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.140 
getting more miles something that's
quieter<00:01:31.680> who<00:01:31.829> these<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.880> where<00:01:33.060> you're

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
quieter who these that's where you're

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.399 
quieter who these that's where you're
truly<00:01:33.479> getting<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> benefits<00:01:34.170> from<00:01:34.259> those

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
truly getting the benefits from those

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.319 
truly getting the benefits from those
loops<00:01:34.590> yeah<00:01:35.159> say<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.640> get<00:01:35.700> our<00:01:36.060> pedal

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
loops yeah say that you get our pedal

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.030 
loops yeah say that you get our pedal
and<00:01:36.420> Clete<00:01:36.570> loop<00:01:36.720> which<00:01:36.900> uses<00:01:37.470> dupont<00:01:37.890> teflon

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and Clete loop which uses dupont teflon

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.219 
and Clete loop which uses dupont teflon
in<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.880> brand<00:01:39.420> new<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.600> us<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.049> goes

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
in it and it is brand new for us it goes

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.609 
in it and it is brand new for us it goes
on<00:01:40.439> sets<00:01:41.159> up<00:01:41.899> absolutely<00:01:42.899> completely<00:01:43.380> dry

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
on sets up absolutely completely dry

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.560 
on sets up absolutely completely dry
it's<00:01:44.549> kind<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.790> thing<00:01:44.909> it's<00:01:45.060> fun<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.329> put<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it's kind of thing it's fun to put on a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.880 
it's kind of thing it's fun to put on a
metal<00:01:45.750> surface<00:01:45.930> actually<00:01:46.380> see<00:01:46.560> how<00:01:46.649> quickly

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
metal surface actually see how quickly

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.920 
metal surface actually see how quickly
it<00:01:47.070> dries<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.549> how<00:01:47.729> solid<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.479> becomes<00:01:48.780> it

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
it dries and how solid it becomes it

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.080 
it dries and how solid it becomes it
creates<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.409> really<00:01:49.619> really<00:01:50.520> nice<00:01:50.670> film

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
creates this really really nice film

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.450 
creates this really really nice film
that<00:01:51.590> nothing's<00:01:52.590> going<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:52.890> stuck<00:01:53.070> too<00:01:53.250> I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
that nothing's going to get stuck too I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.889 
that nothing's going to get stuck too I
think<00:01:53.850> one<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> best<00:01:54.420> way<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.570> drive<00:01:54.810> it

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
think one of the best way to drive it

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.330 
think one of the best way to drive it
almost<00:01:55.079> feels<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.350> being<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.860> ball<00:01:56.189> bearing

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
almost feels like being a ball bearing

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.590 
almost feels like being a ball bearing
it<00:01:56.549> feels<00:01:56.700> like<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.880> get<00:01:57.000> more<00:01:57.149> flowed<00:01:57.450> out<00:01:57.570> of

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
it feels like you get more flowed out of

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.240 
it feels like you get more flowed out of
the<00:01:57.689> paddle<00:01:57.960> when<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.170> used<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.530> any<00:01:58.950> part

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the paddle when you used it any part

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.950 
the paddle when you used it any part
that<00:01:59.369> moves<00:01:59.549> need<00:01:59.880> some<00:02:00.180> sort<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.420> lubricant<00:02:00.810> I

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
that moves need some sort of lubricant I

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.200 
that moves need some sort of lubricant I
need<00:02:01.380> something<00:02:01.649> cuz<00:02:01.890> there's<00:02:02.040> their<00:02:02.280> arsenal

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
need something cuz there's their arsenal

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.700 
need something cuz there's their arsenal
surfaces<00:02:03.600> touching<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.079> way<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.229> get<00:02:04.409> in

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
surfaces touching in this way you get in

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.649 
surfaces touching in this way you get in
force<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.340> get<00:02:05.460> though<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.000> wipers<00:02:06.180> steals

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
force you get though the wipers steals

force you get though the wipers steals
all<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.930> kind<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.110> stuff<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.560> creating

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
all that kind of stuff it's creating

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.850 
all that kind of stuff it's creating
friction<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:09.000> wanted<00:02:09.300> something<00:02:09.509> to

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
friction so we wanted something to

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.650 
friction so we wanted something to
overcome<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.039> and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
overcome that and

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.060 
overcome that and
give<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.900> little<00:02:12.020> bit<00:02:12.260> better<00:02:12.410> fuel<00:02:12.770> so<00:02:13.040> the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
give you a little bit better fuel so the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.980 
give you a little bit better fuel so the
Maxis<00:02:13.520> mr.<00:02:13.790> Bray<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.120> silicone<00:02:14.600> based

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
Maxis mr. Bray is the silicone based

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.840 
Maxis mr. Bray is the silicone based
lube<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:15.710> it's<00:02:15.830> great<00:02:15.920> for<00:02:16.130> any<00:02:16.310> conditions

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850

it's going to set up dry enough you're

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.030 
it's going to set up dry enough you're

your<00:02:19.310> fork<00:02:19.550> ed<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.780> just<00:02:21.140> works<00:02:21.440> really<00:02:21.860> really

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
your fork ed it just works really really

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.710 
your fork ed it just works really really
really<00:02:22.460> well<00:02:22.670> what<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:22.940> does<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.270> overcomes

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
really well what it does is overcomes

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.300 
really well what it does is overcomes
that<00:02:23.780> initial<00:02:24.260> friction<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.070> when<00:02:25.220> you're

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
that initial friction so when you're

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.500 
that initial friction so when you're
going<00:02:25.520> over<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.760> little<00:02:25.940> stuff<00:02:26.090> little<00:02:26.330> roots

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
going over the little stuff little roots

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.730 
going over the little stuff little roots
that<00:02:26.690> kind<00:02:26.990> of<00:02:27.020> thing<00:02:27.170> we're<00:02:27.320> normally<00:02:27.620> you're

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
that kind of thing we're normally you're

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.350 
that kind of thing we're normally you're
just<00:02:27.860> pumping<00:02:28.400> right<00:02:28.520> over<00:02:28.820> it<00:02:28.910> it's<00:02:29.270> actually

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
just pumping right over it it's actually

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.780 
just pumping right over it it's actually
absorbing<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:29.990> so<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.170> get<00:02:30.320> motion<00:02:31.130> from<00:02:31.370> the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
absorbing it so you get motion from the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.230 
absorbing it so you get motion from the
get<00:02:31.940> go<00:02:31.970> with<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:32.420> chains<00:02:32.870> are<00:02:33.140> shipped<00:02:33.470> with<00:02:33.680> a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
get go with it chains are shipped with a

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.040 
get go with it chains are shipped with a
anti-rust<00:02:35.240> agent<00:02:35.600> on<00:02:35.690> them<00:02:35.810> it's<00:02:35.960> because

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
anti-rust agent on them it's because

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.900 
anti-rust agent on them it's because
they're<00:02:36.290> all<00:02:36.410> being<00:02:36.590> shipped<00:02:36.890> by<00:02:37.010> sea<00:02:37.250> so

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
they're all being shipped by sea so

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.640 
they're all being shipped by sea so
what's<00:02:38.270> on<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:39.050> get<00:02:39.200> people<00:02:39.350> say<00:02:39.530> oh<00:02:39.560> it's

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
what's on it you get people say oh it's

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.750 
what's on it you get people say oh it's
the<00:02:39.860> best<00:02:40.040> lube<00:02:40.220> that's<00:02:40.370> on<00:02:40.460> there<00:02:40.580> it's<00:02:40.670> the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
the best lube that's on there it's the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.150
