known as the roamer really on impact

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.350 
known as the roamer really on impact

bit<00:01:07.600> or<00:01:07.780> kind<00:01:08.110> of<00:01:08.200> adapt<00:01:08.500> to<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.770> new<00:01:08.890> team<00:01:09.100> I

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
bit or kind of adapt to the new team I

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.530 
bit or kind of adapt to the new team I
thought<00:01:09.640> yeah<00:01:09.790> I've<00:01:09.820> had<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.210> definitely

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
thought yeah I've had to definitely

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.620 
thought yeah I've had to definitely
adapt<00:01:10.900> I<00:01:11.260> can't<00:01:11.890> grow<00:01:12.100> as<00:01:12.430> much<00:01:12.670> simply

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
adapt I can't grow as much simply

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.260 
adapt I can't grow as much simply
because

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.450 

it's<00:01:16.810> kind<00:01:17.079> of<00:01:17.170> different<00:01:17.350> with<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:18.039> a<00:01:18.070> ours

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
it's kind of different with to a ours

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.760 
it's kind of different with to a ours
and<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.939> set<00:01:19.179> so<00:01:19.390> you<00:01:19.509> can't<00:01:19.719> really<00:01:19.750> run

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
and to set so you can't really run

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.919 
and to set so you can't really run
I'm<00:01:21.280> definitely<00:01:21.520> adapted<00:01:22.180> we're<00:01:22.719> slowly

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
I'm definitely adapted we're slowly

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:24.749 
I'm definitely adapted we're slowly
getting<00:01:23.170> better<00:01:23.439> but<00:01:24.159> I<00:01:24.219> think<00:01:24.429> I<00:01:24.490> think<00:01:24.640> it'll

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
getting better but I think I think it'll

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.120 
getting better but I think I think it'll
work<00:01:25.020> awesome<00:01:26.020> so<00:01:26.649> what<00:01:26.950> are<00:01:27.039> your

keep holding those big tournaments and
keep<00:02:32.510> supporting<00:02:32.959> us<00:02:33.260> because<00:02:33.530> we're<00:02:33.680> going

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.469 
to support them I know sometimes where

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.920 
to support them I know sometimes where
communities<00:02:36.799> get<00:02:36.920> drastic<00:02:37.280> when<00:02:37.909> it<00:02:37.999> comes

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
communities get drastic when it comes

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.199 
communities get drastic when it comes
so<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:40.040> could<00:02:40.459> be<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.579> problem<00:02:40.790> because

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
so that could be a problem because

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.209 
so that could be a problem because
nobody<00:02:41.599> knows<00:02:41.840> how<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:42.620> game<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.040> going<00:02:43.159> to

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 
nobody knows how that game is going to

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.059 
nobody knows how that game is going to
be<00:02:43.280> yet<00:02:43.579> I<00:02:43.819> think<00:02:44.510> we<00:02:44.569> find<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:44.989> four<00:02:45.560> days<00:02:45.769> five

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
be yet I think we find it four days five

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.130 
be yet I think we find it four days five
days<00:02:46.129> something<00:02:46.609> like<00:02:46.700> that<00:02:46.969> so<00:02:47.269> uh<00:02:47.299> it'll<00:02:48.049> be

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
days something like that so uh it'll be

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.589 
days something like that so uh it'll be
nice<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.349> see<00:02:48.650> all<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.920> pros<00:02:49.299> input<00:02:50.299> from<00:02:50.540> the

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
nice to see all the pros input from the

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.070 
nice to see all the pros input from the
game

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.200 

but<00:02:53.620> yeah<00:02:53.800> I<00:02:53.890> think<00:02:54.010> we<00:02:54.850> just<00:02:54.880> got<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.180> keep

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
but yeah I think we just got to keep

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.400 
but yeah I think we just got to keep
supporting<00:02:55.630> them

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.510 

fashion<00:03:00.190> that

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
fashion that

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.860 
fashion that
because<00:03:01.880> obviously<00:03:02.120> they<00:03:02.480> can't<00:03:02.720> change

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
because obviously they can't change

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.450 
because obviously they can't change
everything

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
everything

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.850 
everything
yep<00:03:05.060> we<00:03:05.180> can't<00:03:05.360> change<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.660> past<00:03:05.780> we<00:03:06.650> had<00:03:06.770> to

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
yep we can't change the past we had to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.590 
yep we can't change the past we had to
have<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.010> connection<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.910> that's<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.390> biggest

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600
