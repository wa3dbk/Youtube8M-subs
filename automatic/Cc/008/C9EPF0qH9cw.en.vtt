the watchers or to create a dial and at

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.780 
the watchers or to create a dial and at
the<00:01:31.680> very<00:01:31.890> beginning<00:01:32.400> okay<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.880> were<00:01:33.299> using

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
the very beginning okay we were using

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.899 
the very beginning okay we were using
only<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.329> pencil<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.799> piece<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.189> paper<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
only the pencil and a piece of paper and

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.429 
only the pencil and a piece of paper and
after<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:39.990> started<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.439> create<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.369> 2d

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
after that we started to create in 2d

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.969 
after that we started to create in 2d
and<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:44.340> was<00:01:44.579> maybe<00:01:44.790> something<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:45.979> 10-15

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
and it was maybe something like 10-15

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.280 
and it was maybe something like 10-15
years<00:01:47.009> ago<00:01:47.280> most<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> different

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
years ago most of the different

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.370 
years ago most of the different
companies<00:01:49.500> using<00:01:50.340> 2d<00:01:50.880> they<00:01:51.149> have<00:01:51.329> started<00:01:52.200> to

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
companies using 2d they have started to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.230 
companies using 2d they have started to
switch<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.189> 3d<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:55.500> now<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.159> what<00:01:56.460> we

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
switch to 3d and and now this is what we

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.859 
switch to 3d and and now this is what we
are<00:01:57.390> using<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:58.290> mainly<00:01:58.829> 3d<00:01:59.430> CAD<00:02:00.270> design<00:02:00.659> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
are using it's mainly 3d CAD design and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.679 
are using it's mainly 3d CAD design and
why<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:02.070> really<00:02:02.280> useful<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.000> necessary<00:02:03.149> to

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
why it is really useful and necessary to

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.590 
why it is really useful and necessary to
use<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.020> kind<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.579> visualization<00:02:05.579> tools<00:02:06.329> I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
use this kind of visualization tools I

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.229 
use this kind of visualization tools I
think<00:02:07.439> maybe<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.979> main<00:02:08.190> goal<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.759> avoid

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
think maybe the main goal is to avoid

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.809 
think maybe the main goal is to avoid
the<00:02:09.750> mistakes<00:02:10.220> with<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.520> 3d<00:02:11.819> tool<00:02:12.120> you

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
the mistakes with the 3d tool you

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.690 
the mistakes with the 3d tool you
we'll<00:02:12.969> see<00:02:13.239> very<00:02:13.540> easily<00:02:14.319> if<00:02:14.859> you<00:02:14.920> have<00:02:15.400> maybe

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
we'll see very easily if you have maybe

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.929 
we'll see very easily if you have maybe
two<00:02:16.090> parts<00:02:16.810> are<00:02:17.109> touching<00:02:17.439> and<00:02:17.799> if<00:02:18.489> they<00:02:18.700> don't

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
two parts are touching and if they don't

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.349 
two parts are touching and if they don't
they<00:02:19.659> don't<00:02:19.810> have<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:20.200> touch<00:02:20.379> or<00:02:20.879> you<00:02:21.879> can<00:02:22.090> see

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
they don't have to touch or you can see

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.179 
they don't have to touch or you can see
the<00:02:22.840> connections<00:02:23.379> between<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:24.159> different

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
the connections between the different

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.360 
the connections between the different
part<00:02:24.730> exactly<00:02:25.359> what<00:02:25.540> we<00:02:25.930> have<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.829> screen

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
part exactly what we have on the screen

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.129 
part exactly what we have on the screen
here<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:29.280> also<00:02:30.280> it's<00:02:30.670> it's<00:02:31.269> a<00:02:31.510> big<00:02:31.719> time-saver

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:32.139 
here and also it's it's a big time-saver

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:35.729 
here and also it's it's a big time-saver
in<00:02:32.889> 2d<00:02:33.250> only<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.209> engineers<00:02:34.719> were<00:02:35.109> able<00:02:35.139> to

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
in 2d only the engineers were able to

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.759 
in 2d only the engineers were able to
understand<00:02:36.250> with<00:02:37.209> 3d<00:02:37.629> you<00:02:37.900> have<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.349> perfect

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
understand with 3d you have the perfect

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.599 
understand with 3d you have the perfect
picture<00:02:38.889> to<00:02:39.159> see<00:02:40.379> how<00:02:41.379> it's<00:02:41.590> working<00:02:41.709> and

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
picture to see how it's working and

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.509 
picture to see how it's working and
nearly<00:02:43.180> everybody<00:02:43.689> can<00:02:43.989> understand<00:02:44.519> actually

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
nearly everybody can understand actually

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.050 
nearly everybody can understand actually
what<00:02:45.790> we<00:02:46.000> are<00:02:46.150> showing<00:02:46.389> today<00:02:47.609> it's<00:02:48.609> a<00:02:48.819> new

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
what we are showing today it's a new

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.459 
what we are showing today it's a new
tool<00:02:49.299> that<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:51.340> will<00:02:51.549> help<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.469> developers

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:53.469 
tool that that will help the developers

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:57.599 
tool that that will help the developers
to<00:02:54.159> create<00:02:54.340> very<00:02:54.909> quickly<00:02:55.239> very<00:02:55.659> complex<00:02:56.609> gear

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
to create very quickly very complex gear

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.369 
to create very quickly very complex gear
systems<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.449> they<00:02:59.260> are<00:02:59.439> interconnected<00:03:00.189> and

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
systems and they are interconnected and

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.129 
systems and they are interconnected and
if<00:03:02.379> you<00:03:02.620> change<00:03:02.919> one<00:03:03.250> gear<00:03:03.549> all<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.719> different

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
if you change one gear all the different

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.979 
if you change one gear all the different
other<00:03:05.379> gears<00:03:05.859> will<00:03:06.219> also<00:03:06.669> adapt<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:07.689> and

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
other gears will also adapt to this and

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.339 
other gears will also adapt to this and
I<00:03:08.980> think<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.489> can<00:03:09.730> be<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.969> very<00:03:10.329> big<00:03:10.750> time-saver

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
I think it can be a very big time-saver

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.989 
I think it can be a very big time-saver
