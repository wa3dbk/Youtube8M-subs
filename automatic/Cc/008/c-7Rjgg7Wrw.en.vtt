00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello technocratic as it is I do not know how 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.890
 stop fanatic dotcom and like 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.230
 you already know the day February 24 goes 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.830
 to be a presentation by 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.039
 samsung on behalf of the invitation is 5 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.550
 and many already begin to rumor that 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.199
 would be the presentation of galaxy s 5 here 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.420
 I 'm going to give my comments and my 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.970
 point of view regarding this 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.529
 event that I'm sure is not going to be the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.160
 presentation of this device 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.160
 let's go with the video 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.480
 samsung is characterized by presenting its 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.510
 smart cell phone we hate your little horse 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.480
 of battle at the beginning of the year 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.159
 in this case following the routine 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.559
 typical of samsung would be them 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.899
 presenting us in the month of March in 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.850
 April last year I think it was 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.239
 in the month of March they made a 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.440
 presentation that is transmitting that 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.019
 live from new york I think that 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.360
 also in england then they 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.090
 they use these two practically 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.470
 platforms to be able to present to what 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:17.170
 big your smart galaxy s 4 cell 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.240
 in this case we talk about the galaxy is 5 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.940
 because I do not think it's going to be presented 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.700
 in the mobile world congress especially 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.250
 when they put the ampa 5 as a title 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.950
 is it gives us to understand how that could be 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.080
 present this non samsung device the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.420
 last is that he presented a cell phone 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.330
 event like this as we say that if it is 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.990
 a new group that was him 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.520
 galaxy s2 after that the galaxy s3 and 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.340
 the galaxy of 4 has been presented in 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.970
 individual form as it should be since 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.770
 they represent the burden of what 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.050
 do the company in terms of 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.160
 mobile devices to galaxy 5 is the 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.290
 of the galaxy s 5 is the device that goes 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.150
 to be presented then by samsung about 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.980
 everyone who must do the competition 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.460
 to the rest of smartphones in 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.520
 high end now because I keep saying 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.150
 that 's not going to make this event which 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.200
 samsung is going to present his cell phone 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.209
 smart galaxy s 5 because that 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.490
 being what this product represents 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.220
 has to be presented then in form 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.590
 individual as they did in the galaxy 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.370
 s3 and as they did in the galaxy s 4 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.430
 I do not think they decide to present a 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.110
 product like the galaxy s 5 in an event 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.870
 as the mobile world congress where 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.700
 they will present any amount of 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.620
 new devices of different brands 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.530
 what he would do is 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.360
 a little to introduce yourself but it's going to be one 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.480
 from the bunch of cell phones or 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.900
 possibly it is the one that really 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.909
 grab all the attention then you can 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.920
 be as it may be that I do not consider 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.959
 that what is going to be samsung 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.519
 present maybe a new product 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.549
 because anyway according to what I have 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.319
 I have been reading in engadget they say 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.060
 that they are going to present 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.459
 they a device 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.430
 battle horse is not known if to do 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.130
 the galaxy s 5 can be out there the 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.810
 New galaxy class can also be 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.750
 that has been speculating a lot with 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.849
 regarding a new smart watch 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.739
 that samsung would be presenting then 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.840
 there are some alternatives that could 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.959
 present in this event as scoop 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.810
 but that the galaxy s 5 has been presented 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.690
 personally I 'm doing it with the 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.330
 rumors something interesting happened the day of 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.420
 today tuesday I'm recording this video 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.090
 and it is with respect to a failure that has 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.920
 filtering that comes from a company 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.700
 I could do nothing more research 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.640
 known as here db in which gives the 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.750
 information or specifications both 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.790
 of the Galaxy S 5 as well as the iPhone 6 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.819
 but in this case, let's talk about 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.010
 how well do the galaxy s 5 according to this 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.630
 Research company and according to the ruling 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.000
 what they have 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.550
 Saleh that the specifications would be 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.130
 the following the galaxy s 5 would come with 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.739
 a 5.2-inch screen with a 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:21.320
 resolution of 2560 x 1440 with 560 pp 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.380
 pixels per inch make to grind the 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.790
 processor would be a snapdragon qualcomm 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.620
 805 would be one of the versions would be 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.000
 for the American market and for the 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.910
 rest the world because you know that 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.270
 with the exynos 6 processor in this case 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.810
 is the opta for the new 3 gb version of 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.050
 ram 32 see coming in three versions 32 gb 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.270
 64 leads and 128 GB of internal memory 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.060
 expandable the posterior chamber is going to be 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.250
 16 megapixel front camera if 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.260
 keep doing 3.2 megapixels 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.980
 lavÃ­n jr of box with the system 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.460
 operative android 4.4 kitkat when going to 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.670
 be presented according to this ruling on 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.010
 galaxy s 5 would be presented at the end 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.600
 of the first quarter of 2014 or 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.690
 principles of 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.610
 second quarter of 2014 a question 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.350
 that many have been doing is if it is 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.050
 that samsung would be presenting the 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.870
 galaxy s 5 with curved screen type 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.210
 galaxy round I personally doubt it and 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.910
 I always speak in a personal capacity and my 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.950
 personal opinion now because I doubt that 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.510
 samsung present this device with 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.890
 a very simple curved screen and it's 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.440
 something that I have also been reading in 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.020
 internet is the fact that samsung does not 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.870
 has the ability to produce the 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.200
 amount of flexible displays for 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.440
 demand that the galaxy s 5 could have 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:46.520
 it's more with what the galaxy is 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:49.340
 and the round they have been able to produce the 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.740
 amount to be able to sell within what 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.450
 that will be born in South Korea but as 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.210
 you have seen out of South Korea 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:59.060
 Well, they are not selling this 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.730
 smart cellular and not possibly 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.340
 because they do not have the reception or demand 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:07.040
 but they do not have the capacity to be able 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:10.820
 produce the amount they would want 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.360
 to be able to sell what would be the 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.400
 galaxy 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.439
 5 that as you know then the sale 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.270
 of this level device 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:20.120
 international as we talk about millions 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.490
 and millions of units then I think that 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.229
 that would be one of the reasons the other one is 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.689
 the fact that right now we are going through 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:28.669
 of what was going to be the full hd something 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.930
 than in making two faces and according to 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:34.520
 specifications that we have mentioned 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:38.150
 which are a 2560 x 1440 screen 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.849
 with 560 bp and we are already talking about another 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.490
 level and if samsung presents a screen 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:46.219
 curve I still believe I have not arrived 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:49.909
 then to that kind of maximum resolution neither 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:51.439
 to 2009 20 x 1080 then I think that such 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:54.379
 they would be giving me a step back 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:56.629
 instead of taking a step forward and also 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:58.039
 something I was hearing is that no 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:59.990
 he was very welcome what comes to be 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:01.879
 a screen with is mostly the way 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.500
 as sant only presents that for me not 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:06.020
 it makes a lot of sense I think it has more 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.819
 meaning as he has presented today and this 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.439
 has been like a test with what you should 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:11.539
 do the galaxy run has been a test 

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:12.650
 to see how people react in front 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:14.060
 what this kind of 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.900
 screens 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:21.080
 I repeat, I do not think it comes to us in the 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.310
 galaxy s 5 a curved screen by the 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.350
 reasons I just mentioned 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.540
 Well that's all for about the galaxy 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:31.560
 s 5 some rumors that we have heard 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:34.320
 during this week plus the invitation to 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.030

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.310
 event and what it could be 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.990
 presenting later I'm going to have 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.610
 more information as soon as I see a little 

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.110
 more than rumors or news that you consider 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.790
