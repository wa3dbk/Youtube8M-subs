kill<00:01:43.950> things<00:01:44.189> like<00:01:44.340> crazy<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.820> they<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.659> also

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
kill things like crazy and they can also

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.780 
kill things like crazy and they can also
do<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> bit<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.380> Intel<00:01:46.710> work<00:01:47.220> as<00:01:47.369> well<00:01:47.549> you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
do like a bit of Intel work as well you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
do like a bit of Intel work as well you
know<00:01:47.880> why<00:01:48.720> not<00:01:48.899> um<00:01:49.460> good<00:01:50.460> thing<00:01:50.610> about<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
know why not um good thing about the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.749 
know why not um good thing about the
rifleman<00:01:52.170> though<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.530> frag<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.100> there<00:01:53.640> are

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
rifleman though a frag is there are

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.810 
rifleman though a frag is there are
eight<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.270> i'm<00:01:54.360> when<00:01:54.810> i<00:01:54.840> was<00:01:54.960> using<00:01:55.110> among

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
eight but i'm when i was using among

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.260 
eight but i'm when i was using among
guard<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:56.540> all<00:01:56.990> right<00:01:57.170> right<00:01:57.350> i<00:01:57.380> guess<00:01:57.650> on<00:01:57.830> them

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
guard it all right right i guess on them

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.670 
guard it all right right i guess on them
and<00:01:59.270> they<00:01:59.390> don't<00:01:59.570> always<00:01:59.750> kill<00:02:00.140> but<00:02:00.470> they<00:02:00.560> do

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
and they don't always kill but they do

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.520 
and they don't always kill but they do
stun<00:02:01.670> them<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:01.850> bit<00:02:02.000> but<00:02:02.300> i'd<00:02:02.690> rather<00:02:02.720> go<00:02:03.050> to<00:02:03.140> EMP

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
stun them a bit but i'd rather go to EMP

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.160 
stun them a bit but i'd rather go to EMP
because<00:02:03.800> engineers<00:02:04.190> they<00:02:04.550> have<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.570> eat<00:02:05.780> they

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
because engineers they have to eat they

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.600 
because engineers they have to eat they
have<00:02:06.260> two<00:02:06.440> sensors<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.040> let<00:02:07.250> go<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.370> use<00:02:07.490> them

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
have two sensors and let go to use them

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.760 
have two sensors and let go to use them
a<00:02:07.670> lot<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.570> any<00:02:08.929> people<00:02:09.229> get<00:02:09.350> just<00:02:09.500> get<00:02:09.619> rid<00:02:09.709> of

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
a lot so any people get just get rid of

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.820 
a lot so any people get just get rid of
the<00:02:10.420> vm<00:02:11.420> what<00:02:11.540> do<00:02:11.600> you<00:02:11.660> call<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:12.380> sensor

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
the vm what do you call it the sensor

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.800 
the vm what do you call it the sensor
easily<00:02:13.520> that's<00:02:13.970> why<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.120> use<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.390> on<00:02:14.420> my<00:02:14.480> sniper

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
easily that's why I use it on my sniper

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.670 
easily that's why I use it on my sniper
so<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.650> don't<00:02:15.860> get<00:02:15.920> caught<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.840> if<00:02:17.840> saying

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
so I don't get caught and if saying

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.560 
so I don't get caught and if saying
you're<00:02:18.890> exchanging<00:02:19.250> fire<00:02:19.640> with<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:20.030> enemy<00:02:20.390> and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
you're exchanging fire with a enemy and

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.199 
you're exchanging fire with a enemy and
they're<00:02:21.410> not<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.620> rifleman<00:02:22.160> unless<00:02:23.030> they're<00:02:23.180> a

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
they're not a rifleman unless they're a

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.240 
they're not a rifleman unless they're a
sniper<00:02:23.480> be<00:02:23.840> careful<00:02:24.140> if<00:02:24.470> they're<00:02:24.800> an<00:02:24.890> engineer

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
sniper be careful if they're an engineer

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.820 
sniper be careful if they're an engineer
you<00:02:26.090> most<00:02:26.420> likely<00:02:26.630> have<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.900> range<00:02:27.410> on<00:02:27.680> them

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
you most likely have the range on them

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.030 
you most likely have the range on them
and<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.340> power<00:02:28.550> on<00:02:28.820> them<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.690> if<00:02:30.050> you<00:02:30.140> guys<00:02:30.890> are

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
and the power on them so if you guys are

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.860 
and the power on them so if you guys are
you<00:02:31.190> know<00:02:31.280> picking<00:02:31.489> out<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:32.480> know<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.690> wall

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
you know picking out you know the wall

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.170 
you know picking out you know the wall
you<00:02:33.080> know<00:02:33.200> just<00:02:33.350> peeking<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.709> out<00:02:33.860> just<00:02:34.640> pick

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
you know just peeking it out just pick

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.880 
you know just peeking it out just pick
up<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.360> wall<00:02:35.600> away<00:02:35.690> from<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.260> peek<00:02:36.620> out<00:02:36.739> his

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
up the wall away from to peek out his

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.470 
up the wall away from to peek out his
head<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.250> just<00:02:37.430> shoot<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:37.910> you're<00:02:38.239> probably

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
head and just shoot and you're probably

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.760 
head and just shoot and you're probably
first<00:02:38.900> bullets<00:02:39.200> gonna<00:02:39.290> take<00:02:39.530> them<00:02:39.620> down

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
first bullets gonna take them down

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.250 
first bullets gonna take them down
that's<00:02:40.310> how<00:02:40.430> powerful<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:41.330> weapon<00:02:41.930> i'm<00:02:42.020> using

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
that's how powerful the weapon i'm using

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.410 
that's how powerful the weapon i'm using
as<00:02:42.380> a<00:02:42.410> ref<00:02:42.560> minutes<00:02:42.980> but<00:02:43.730> um<00:02:43.880> I'm<00:02:44.180> pretty<00:02:44.239> much

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
as a ref minutes but um I'm pretty much

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.000 
as a ref minutes but um I'm pretty much
almost<00:02:44.660> out<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:44.930> time<00:02:45.110> for<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.500> rifleman

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
almost out of time for the rifleman

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.140 
almost out of time for the rifleman
gameplay<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.520> I've<00:02:46.640> got<00:02:46.760> right<00:02:46.880> here<00:02:46.940> for

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
gameplay that I've got right here for

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.720 
gameplay that I've got right here for
you<00:02:47.239> guys<00:02:47.300> so<00:02:48.170> at<00:02:48.560> three<00:02:49.130> minutes<00:02:49.459> it's<00:02:49.610> going

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
you guys so at three minutes it's going

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.300 
you guys so at three minutes it's going
to<00:02:49.820> switch<00:02:49.940> over<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.180> engineer<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.840> um<00:02:51.650> so

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
to switch over to engineer and um so

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.410 
to switch over to engineer and um so
let's<00:02:52.489> go<00:02:52.610> into<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.850> engineering<00:02:53.120> the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
let's go into the engineering the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.440 
let's go into the engineering the
typical<00:02:53.840> engineer<00:02:55.090> alright<00:02:56.090> so<00:02:56.180> what<00:02:56.300> I<00:02:56.360> know

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
typical engineer alright so what I know

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.090 
typical engineer alright so what I know
is<00:02:56.570> supposed<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:56.870> engineer<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:57.380> um<00:02:57.590> they're

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
is supposed to engineer is um they're

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.620 
is supposed to engineer is um they're
basically<00:02:58.220> just<00:02:58.459> like<00:02:58.880> snipers<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.510> know

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
basically just like snipers you know

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.410 
basically just like snipers you know
Scouts<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.260> some<00:03:00.580> mostly<00:03:01.580> getting<00:03:02.090> in<00:03:02.209> self

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
Scouts and some mostly getting in self

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.320 
Scouts and some mostly getting in self
the<00:03:02.600> riflemen<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.680> snipers<00:03:04.130> but<00:03:04.940> um<00:03:05.090> they

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
the riflemen and snipers but um they

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.910 
the riflemen and snipers but um they
could<00:03:05.450> do<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.540> little<00:03:05.690> damage<00:03:05.900> whatnot<00:03:06.440> you

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
could do a little damage whatnot you

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.380 
could do a little damage whatnot you
know<00:03:06.950> they<00:03:07.160> have<00:03:07.280> different<00:03:07.700> weapons<00:03:08.150> went<00:03:08.330> up

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
know they have different weapons went up

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.360 
know they have different weapons went up
but<00:03:08.510> their<00:03:08.660> weapons<00:03:08.959> are<00:03:09.049> very<00:03:09.320> very<00:03:09.560> weak

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
but their weapons are very very weak

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.699 
but their weapons are very very weak
especially<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:11.329> one<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.540> start<00:03:11.780> off<00:03:11.840> with<00:03:12.079> AK

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
especially the one you start off with AK

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.280 
especially the one you start off with AK
74<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.250> actually<00:03:13.640> I<00:03:13.670> think<00:03:13.970> it<00:03:14.209> is<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:15.019> power

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
74 you actually I think it is the power

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.770 
74 you actually I think it is the power
the<00:03:15.650> range<00:03:15.890> is<00:03:16.310> very<00:03:16.760> low<00:03:17.120> in<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.390> control<00:03:17.750> i

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
the range is very low in the control i

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.330 
the range is very low in the control i
believe<00:03:18.019> is<00:03:18.140> pretty<00:03:18.680> low<00:03:18.799> as<00:03:18.950> well<00:03:19.100> but<00:03:19.250> the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
believe is pretty low as well but the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.199 
believe is pretty low as well but the
maneuverability<00:03:20.060> is<00:03:20.269> a<00:03:21.049> very<00:03:21.799> good<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.910> mean

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
maneuverability is a very good I mean

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.680 
maneuverability is a very good I mean
you're<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:24.260> guy<00:03:24.440> running<00:03:25.250> gets<00:03:25.910> into<00:03:26.239> run<00:03:26.540> out

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
you're the guy running gets into run out

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.199 
you're the guy running gets into run out
and<00:03:27.040> that's<00:03:28.040> pretty<00:03:28.340> much<00:03:28.459> your<00:03:28.610> job<00:03:28.820> get<00:03:29.090> in

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
and that's pretty much your job get in

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.229 
and that's pretty much your job get in
so<00:03:29.420> stun<00:03:30.170> your<00:03:30.320> enemies<00:03:30.920> don't<00:03:31.820> use<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.000> pistol

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
so stun your enemies don't use a pistol

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.870 
so stun your enemies don't use a pistol
because<00:03:32.690> your<00:03:33.079> job<00:03:33.260> is<00:03:33.470> Intel<00:03:33.799> so<00:03:34.519> you'll<00:03:34.670> use

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
because your job is Intel so you'll use

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.090 
because your job is Intel so you'll use
the<00:03:35.180> stun<00:03:35.390> gun<00:03:35.600> sneak<00:03:35.989> up<00:03:36.140> on<00:03:36.350> guys<00:03:36.530> use<00:03:36.950> your

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
the stun gun sneak up on guys use your

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.710 
the stun gun sneak up on guys use your
sense<00:03:37.340> there<00:03:37.489> to<00:03:37.579> find<00:03:37.700> out<00:03:37.820> what<00:03:37.940> they<00:03:38.030> are<00:03:38.060> so

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
sense there to find out what they are so

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.600 
sense there to find out what they are so
your<00:03:38.900> riflemen<00:03:39.350> know<00:03:39.500> where<00:03:40.190> they<00:03:40.280> are<00:03:40.310> and

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
your riflemen know where they are and

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.039 
your riflemen know where they are and
your<00:03:40.760> snipers<00:03:41.120> know<00:03:41.239> where<00:03:41.360> they<00:03:41.450> are<00:03:41.480> so<00:03:42.019> they

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
your snipers know where they are so they

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.390 
your snipers know where they are so they
can<00:03:42.290> take<00:03:42.410> em<00:03:42.530> out<00:03:42.650> especially<00:03:42.799> for<00:03:43.190> siege

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
can take em out especially for siege

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.350 
can take em out especially for siege
mode<00:03:43.610> you<00:03:43.790> definitely<00:03:44.090> only<00:03:44.150> use<00:03:44.329> your

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
mode you definitely only use your

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.060 
mode you definitely only use your
sensors<00:03:44.780> also<00:03:46.299> with<00:03:47.299> a<00:03:47.329> stun<00:03:47.570> gun<00:03:47.600> if<00:03:47.989> you<00:03:48.799> can

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
sensors also with a stun gun if you can

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.069 
sensors also with a stun gun if you can
sneak<00:03:49.310> up<00:03:49.370> on<00:03:49.519> a<00:03:49.549> guy<00:03:49.610> stun<00:03:50.090> them<00:03:50.209> sales<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:50.959> so

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
sneak up on a guy stun them sales and so

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.270 
sneak up on a guy stun them sales and so
now<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:51.350> know<00:03:51.470> where<00:03:51.620> all<00:03:51.799> the<00:03:51.920> enemies<00:03:52.070> are

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
now you know where all the enemies are

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.380 
now you know where all the enemies are
on<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.549> mini-map<00:03:52.760> and<00:03:53.150> that's<00:03:53.630> a<00:03:53.810> pretty<00:03:54.290> much

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
on the mini-map and that's a pretty much

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.840 
on the mini-map and that's a pretty much
the<00:03:55.780> job<00:03:56.080> of<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.319> engineer<00:03:56.740> um<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.520> can<00:03:57.670> do

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
the job of the engineer um you can do

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.809 
the job of the engineer um you can do
you<00:03:58.240> know<00:03:58.360> Rush<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.200> kill<00:03:59.680> but<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.520> chances

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
you know Rush and kill but the chances

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.160 
you know Rush and kill but the chances
of<00:04:00.880> you<00:04:01.000> winning<00:04:01.090> against<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.750> rifleman

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
of you winning against a rifleman

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.770 
of you winning against a rifleman
head-on<00:04:02.620> with<00:04:02.980> a<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.790> know<00:04:03.910> what<00:04:04.120> they're

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
head-on with a you know what they're

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.930 
head-on with a you know what they're
with<00:04:05.080> their<00:04:05.230> guns<00:04:05.410> are<00:04:05.650> pretty<00:04:05.830> powerful<00:04:06.100> is<00:04:06.700> a

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
with their guns are pretty powerful is a

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.550 
with their guns are pretty powerful is a
very<00:04:07.209> low<00:04:07.360> chance<00:04:07.390> you<00:04:07.870> can<00:04:08.050> probably<00:04:08.350> take<00:04:08.440> on

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
very low chance you can probably take on

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.930 
very low chance you can probably take on
a<00:04:08.590> sniper<00:04:08.920> if<00:04:09.250> you<00:04:10.150> can<00:04:10.530> not<00:04:11.530> get<00:04:11.709> sniped<00:04:11.980> and

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
a sniper if you can not get sniped and

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.510 
a sniper if you can not get sniped and
that's<00:04:13.780> a<00:04:14.020> you<00:04:14.560> know<00:04:14.650> all<00:04:14.800> right<00:04:14.980> but<00:04:15.310> don't

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
that's a you know all right but don't

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.009 
that's a you know all right but don't
take<00:04:15.910> them<00:04:16.030> from<00:04:16.150> long<00:04:16.329> range<00:04:16.359> because<00:04:16.870> you're

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
take them from long range because you're

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.069 
take them from long range because you're
a<00:04:17.130> little<00:04:18.130> submachine<00:04:18.549> gun<00:04:18.700> shooting<00:04:19.600> will

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
a little submachine gun shooting will

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.380 
a little submachine gun shooting will
not<00:04:20.230> make<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:20.760> all<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.820> way<00:04:21.970> to<00:04:22.030> where<00:04:22.270> they

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
not make it all the way to where they

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.030 
not make it all the way to where they
are<00:04:22.419> probably<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.590> snipers<00:04:23.919> are

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
are probably and the snipers are

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.460 
are probably and the snipers are
probably<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.370> be<00:04:24.490> up<00:04:24.580> high<00:04:24.790> in<00:04:25.060> far<00:04:25.510> so<00:04:26.169> get

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
probably to be up high in far so get

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.890 
probably to be up high in far so get
close<00:04:26.740> throw<00:04:27.730> your<00:04:27.880> sensors<00:04:28.270> find<00:04:28.690> out<00:04:28.780> what

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
close throw your sensors find out what

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.650 
close throw your sensors find out what
they<00:04:28.990> are<00:04:29.220> you're<00:04:30.220> basically<00:04:30.400> your<00:04:30.760> job<00:04:31.090> I'm
