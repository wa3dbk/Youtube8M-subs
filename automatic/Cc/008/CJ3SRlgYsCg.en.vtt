00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
have multiple situations then we've

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.030 
have multiple situations then we've
built<00:01:26.180> in<00:01:26.420> this<00:01:26.750> reactive<00:01:27.409> behavior<00:01:27.890> that

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
built in this reactive behavior that

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.070 
built in this reactive behavior that
spirals<00:01:28.580> out<00:01:28.760> of<00:01:28.820> control<00:01:28.940> then<00:01:29.659> they<00:01:29.870> call<00:01:30.050> a

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
spirals out of control then they call a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.110 
spirals out of control then they call a
dog<00:01:30.320> trainer<00:01:30.650> up<00:01:30.860> it's<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.400> little<00:01:31.610> late<00:01:31.790> you

it's<00:01:34.040> really<00:01:34.550> important<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.150> do<00:01:35.270> early

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
it's really important to do early

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.180 
it's really important to do early
intervention<00:01:36.200> with<00:01:36.229> some<00:01:36.710> of<00:01:36.830> your<00:01:36.979> larger

and the important thing about that is to

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.680 
and the important thing about that is to
is<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.940> really<00:02:31.120> focus<00:02:31.239> on<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.569> dog

they're<00:02:33.580> at<00:02:33.670> behavior<00:02:34.000> early<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.360> we<00:02:34.480> do<00:02:34.599> a

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
they're at behavior early so we do a

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.110 
they're at behavior early so we do a
full<00:02:34.900> behavioral<00:02:35.349> test<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:36.580> figure<00:02:36.700> out<00:02:36.940> if

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
full behavioral test to figure out if

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.550 
full behavioral test to figure out if
it's<00:02:37.300> true<00:02:37.480> regression<00:02:37.810> or<00:02:38.200> if<00:02:38.349> it's<00:02:38.470> a

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
it's true regression or if it's a

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.920 
it's true regression or if it's a
reactive<00:02:39.010> behavior<00:02:39.430> what<00:02:39.940> would<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.540> say<00:02:40.750> is

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
reactive behavior what would you say is

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.600 
reactive behavior what would you say is
your<00:02:41.200> number<00:02:41.890> one<00:02:42.040> tip<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.459> can<00:02:42.519> give
