okay Pastor Mike what's going on today
there's<00:00:03.899> how<00:00:04.110> we<00:00:04.170> put<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.620> panels<00:00:05.009> together

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
there's how we put the panels together

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.240 
there's how we put the panels together
we<00:00:05.670> took<00:00:05.879> an<00:00:06.060> 8-foot<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.690> before<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.919> we<00:00:08.040> left

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
we took an 8-foot to before and we left

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.940 
we took an 8-foot to before and we left
at<00:00:08.429> eight-foot<00:00:08.910> so<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.480> we<00:00:09.599> can<00:00:09.840> recycle<00:00:10.830> it

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
at eight-foot so that we can recycle it

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.820 
at eight-foot so that we can recycle it
later<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:12.179> put<00:00:12.389> together<00:00:12.540> with<00:00:12.990> pocket<00:00:13.469> screws

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
later we put together with pocket screws

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.900 
later we put together with pocket screws
and<00:00:14.130> we<00:00:14.250> can<00:00:14.280> undo<00:00:16.490> basically<00:00:17.490> all<00:00:17.670> we're

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
and we can undo basically all we're

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.750 
and we can undo basically all we're
doing<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.240> just<00:00:18.300> building<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.960> box<00:00:19.760> that's

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
doing is just building a box that's

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.250 
doing is just building a box that's
pretty<00:00:20.970> cool<00:00:23.210> and<00:00:24.210> putting<00:00:27.080> putting<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
pretty cool and putting putting the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.710 
pretty cool and putting putting the
board<00:00:28.500> there<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.920> clamp<00:00:29.160> just<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.670> just<00:00:30.630> to

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
board there with a clamp just to just to

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.440 
board there with a clamp just to just to
hold<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.380> make<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.740> easy<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.160> make<00:00:33.149> sure<00:00:33.360> it

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
hold it to make it easy to make sure it

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.380 
hold it to make it easy to make sure it
stays<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.200> right<00:00:34.380> place<00:00:34.800> right<00:00:35.360> these<00:00:36.360> are

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
stays in the right place right these are

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.119 
stays in the right place right these are
the<00:00:36.630> feet<00:00:39.980> build<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.190> base<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:43.710> we'll<00:00:43.890> do<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the feet build the base and we'll do the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.950 
the feet build the base and we'll do the
same<00:00:44.370> thing

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
same thing

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.900 
same thing
at<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> very<00:00:46.559> top<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.280> all<00:00:47.460> put

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
at the very top and it's all put

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.709 
at the very top and it's all put
together<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.539> screws<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.329> take<00:00:51.540> it

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
together with screws so we can take it

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.180 
together with screws so we can take it
apart<00:00:53.420> okay<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.930> tried<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.379> leave<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.980> I'll

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
apart okay we tried to leave that I'll

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.750 
apart okay we tried to leave that I'll
leave<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.730> lumber<00:00:57.559> in<00:00:58.559> pieces<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.610> can

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
leave the lumber in pieces that we can

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.289 
leave the lumber in pieces that we can
reuse<00:01:00.210> lenses

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.789 

and<00:01:06.310> I'll<00:01:07.310> just<00:01:07.579> do<00:01:07.789> that<00:01:08.590> okay

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
and I'll just do that okay

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.480 
and I'll just do that okay
on<00:01:09.859> the<00:01:10.250> other<00:01:10.369> side<00:01:11.649> usually<00:01:12.649> I<00:01:12.890> do<00:01:12.950> two<00:01:13.310> on

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
on the other side usually I do two on

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.760 
on the other side usually I do two on
each<00:01:13.640> one<00:01:13.969> but<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:14.689> need<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.110> watch<00:01:15.320> me<00:01:15.560> do

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
each one but you need to watch me do

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.469 
each one but you need to watch me do
that

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.090 

I'll<00:01:23.479> come<00:01:23.780> back<00:01:23.930> later<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.409> do<00:01:24.560> one<00:01:24.770> more<00:01:24.799> on

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
I'll come back later and do one more on

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.460 
I'll come back later and do one more on
each<00:01:25.340> side

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
each side

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.550 
each side
then<00:01:27.470> we're<00:01:27.590> going<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.770> take<00:01:27.950> these<00:01:28.190> sheets<00:01:28.490> of

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
then we're going to take these sheets of

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.210 
then we're going to take these sheets of
styrofoam<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:30.890> we<00:01:31.159> got<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.580> styrofoam<00:01:33.220> it

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
styrofoam and we got the styrofoam it

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.600 
styrofoam and we got the styrofoam it
was<00:01:34.400> donated<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:35.119> was<00:01:35.240> on<00:01:35.420> its<00:01:35.570> way<00:01:36.280> that<00:01:37.280> Evan

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
was donated it was on its way that Evan

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.210 
was donated it was on its way that Evan
bill<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.090> Jill<00:01:38.420> they<00:01:38.899> were<00:01:38.960> redoing<00:01:39.530> the

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
bill and Jill they were redoing the

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.480 
bill and Jill they were redoing the
schools<00:01:40.580> in<00:01:40.880> Oakland<00:01:41.270> City<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:42.250> there<00:01:43.250> were

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
schools in Oakland City and there were

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.330 
schools in Oakland City and there were
tens<00:01:44.119> of<00:01:44.390> thousands<00:01:45.170> of<00:01:45.380> cubic<00:01:45.830> feet<00:01:46.070> of

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
tens of thousands of cubic feet of

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.359 
tens of thousands of cubic feet of
styrofoam<00:01:46.960> we<00:01:47.960> haul<00:01:48.200> for<00:01:48.500> weeks<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.190> it<00:01:49.280> was

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
styrofoam we haul for weeks and it was

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.630 
styrofoam we haul for weeks and it was
all<00:01:49.580> it<00:01:49.940> was<00:01:50.000> all<00:01:50.380> for<00:01:51.380> Bank<00:01:51.649> sheets<00:01:52.100> mostly

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
all it was all for Bank sheets mostly

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.730 
all it was all for Bank sheets mostly
but<00:01:52.820> all<00:01:53.000> different<00:01:53.479> thicknesses<00:01:54.049> so<00:01:54.259> the

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
but all different thicknesses so the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.669 
but all different thicknesses so the
Lord<00:01:54.890> helped<00:01:55.190> us<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.460> build<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.850> machine<00:01:56.649> with<00:01:57.649> a

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
Lord helped us to build a machine with a

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.830 
Lord helped us to build a machine with a
hot<00:01:57.890> wire<00:01:58.160> to<00:01:58.369> slice<00:01:58.850> them<00:01:59.149> to<00:01:59.360> make<00:01:59.539> them<00:01:59.690> all

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
hot wire to slice them to make them all

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.630 
hot wire to slice them to make them all
the<00:01:59.869> same<00:01:59.990> thickness<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:01.130> really<00:02:01.460> just

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
the same thickness and really just

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.690 
the same thickness and really just
operated<00:02:02.300> like<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.450> giant<00:02:03.020> cheese<00:02:03.920> slicer<00:02:04.460> like

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
operated like a giant cheese slicer like

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.760 
operated like a giant cheese slicer like
each<00:02:04.909> slice<00:02:05.240> no<00:02:05.539> heat<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:05.960> except<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:06.560> wire

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
each slice no heat it except the wire

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.219 
each slice no heat it except the wire
was<00:02:07.009> hot<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:08.239> this<00:02:08.450> sheet<00:02:08.720> might<00:02:08.959> have<00:02:09.110> been

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
was hot so this sheet might have been

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.920 
was hot so this sheet might have been
six<00:02:09.560> or<00:02:09.739> eight<00:02:09.800> inches<00:02:09.830> thick<00:02:10.550> but<00:02:11.360> we<00:02:11.540> sliced

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
six or eight inches thick but we sliced

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.440 
six or eight inches thick but we sliced
it<00:02:12.230> now<00:02:12.410> this<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.370> same<00:02:13.640> stuff<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:14.060> we're

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
it now this is the same stuff that we're

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.750 
it now this is the same stuff that we're
using<00:02:14.690> under<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.440> floor<00:02:15.769> that<00:02:16.459> all<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
using under the floor that all the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.790 
using under the floor that all the
concrete's<00:02:17.360> going<00:02:17.720> on<00:02:17.870> with<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.230> heat<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.650> it

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
concrete's going on with the heat in it

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.100 
concrete's going on with the heat in it
and<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.700> but<00:02:19.940> this<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:20.330> going<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.540> be<00:02:20.630> used<00:02:20.870> for

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
and so but this is going to be used for

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.960 
and so but this is going to be used for
something<00:02:21.350> else<00:02:21.620> before<00:02:22.130> that<00:02:22.370> happens<00:02:22.819> and

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
something else before that happens and

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.490 
something else before that happens and

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
something about that so it's not too

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.880 
something about that so it's not too
unusual

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.470 

now<00:03:42.890> once<00:03:43.190> it<00:03:43.340> started<00:03:43.879> little<00:03:44.180> hole<00:03:46.480> using

screws three and a half inches long so

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.490 
screws three and a half inches long so
once<00:03:51.230> they're<00:03:51.470> in<00:03:51.620> place<00:03:51.830> they<00:03:52.250> pull<00:03:52.580> it<00:03:52.760> tight

once they're in place they pull it tight

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.630 
once they're in place they pull it tight
so<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.590> have<00:03:54.799> to<00:03:54.920> wear<00:03:55.159> it<00:03:55.190> slip<00:03:55.730> in<00:03:55.970> there

we've got all the we cut all the parts
out<00:05:11.419> and<00:05:11.449> pieces<00:05:11.990> out<00:05:12.169> ahead<00:05:12.469> like<00:05:12.770> it<00:05:13.009> so<00:05:13.550> when

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
out and pieces out ahead like it so when

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.100 
out and pieces out ahead like it so when
you<00:05:13.759> put<00:05:13.789> it<00:05:14.029> together<00:05:14.149> it's<00:05:14.479> like<00:05:14.569> building

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
you put it together it's like building

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.529 
you put it together it's like building
the<00:05:15.199> model<00:05:15.619> and<00:05:16.249> the<00:05:16.339> last<00:05:16.580> thing<00:05:16.879> is<00:05:17.059> the<00:05:17.240> star

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
the model and the last thing is the star

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.409 
the model and the last thing is the star
foam<00:05:17.839> is<00:05:18.080> not<00:05:18.889> actually<00:05:19.369> attached<00:05:19.759> it's<00:05:20.149> just

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
foam is not actually attached it's just

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.749 
foam is not actually attached it's just
squeezed<00:05:20.809> in<00:05:21.110> place<00:05:21.409> wrong<00:05:22.159> time<00:05:22.189> so<00:05:22.459> because

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 
squeezed in place wrong time so because

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.730 
squeezed in place wrong time so because
we<00:05:23.389> don't<00:05:23.419> want<00:05:23.689> to<00:05:23.719> damage<00:05:23.990> it<00:05:24.319> because<00:05:24.589> we're

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740
