00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
high-tech science here upset I'm sorry I

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.190 
high-tech science here upset I'm sorry I
never<00:00:38.489> took<00:00:38.700> science<00:00:39.059> class<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.390> my<00:00:39.480> life<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.170> I

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
never took science class in my life so I

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.440 
never took science class in my life so I
needed<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.980> brought<00:00:41.250> down<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> what's<00:00:42.270> this

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
different than other things that I'm

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.510 
different than other things that I'm
using<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.350> Dana's<00:00:46.710> brilliant<00:00:47.129> at<00:00:47.219> explaining

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
using and Dana's brilliant at explaining

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.459 
using and Dana's brilliant at explaining
all<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.629> start<00:00:48.960> out<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.230> your<00:00:49.440> eye

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
all of that we start out with your eye

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.410 
all of that we start out with your eye
area<00:00:49.920> which<00:00:50.370> i<00:00:50.489> think<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> great<00:00:51.090> place<00:00:51.390> to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
area which i think is a great place to

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.939 
area which i think is a great place to
start<00:00:51.870> because<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.199> think<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.710> if<00:00:52.800> you're

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
start because I think that if you're

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.279 
start because I think that if you're
concerned<00:00:53.399> about<00:00:53.579> aging<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.719> first<00:00:55.020> place

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
concerned about aging the first place

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.869 
concerned about aging the first place
you<00:00:55.500> started<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.039> notice<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.550> may<00:00:56.820> be

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
you started to notice that I may be

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.029 
you started to notice that I may be
looking<00:00:57.270> older<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.780> around<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.410> eye<00:00:58.469> area

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
looking older is around that eye area

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.160 
looking older is around that eye area
but<00:00:59.579> dr.<00:00:59.910> Perricone<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.600> addressing<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> eye

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
but dr. Perricone is addressing the eye

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.439 
but dr. Perricone is addressing the eye
area<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.829> little<00:01:02.070> bit<00:01:02.190> differently<00:01:02.670> first<00:01:03.300> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
area a little bit differently first of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.630 
area a little bit differently first of
all<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.989> 360<00:01:04.830> degrees<00:01:05.159> around<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.580> eye

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
all this is 360 degrees around the eye

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.420 
all this is 360 degrees around the eye
and<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.750> really<00:01:07.080> an<00:01:07.229> amazing<00:01:07.560> way<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> not

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
and this is really an amazing way to not

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.000 
and this is really an amazing way to not
only<00:01:08.640> treat<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.299> eye<00:01:09.360> area<00:01:09.560> but<00:01:10.560> also<00:01:10.799> to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
only treat that eye area but also to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.820 
only treat that eye area but also to
gently<00:01:11.580> exfoliate<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.390> area<00:01:12.960> which<00:01:13.470> that

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
gently exfoliate that area which that

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.520 
gently exfoliate that area which that
right<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.520> those<00:01:14.909> words<00:01:15.500> exfoliating<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
right there those words exfoliating the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.039 
right there those words exfoliating the
eye<00:01:16.650> area<00:01:17.369> are<00:01:17.909> something<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.479> really<00:01:18.840> don't

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
eye area are something you really don't

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.380 
eye area are something you really don't
hear<00:01:19.290> from<00:01:19.350> any<00:01:19.830> other<00:01:20.100> skin<00:01:20.490> care<00:01:20.700> brand<00:01:21.030> no

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
hear from any other skin care brand no

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.719 
hear from any other skin care brand no
cuz<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:21.869> really<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.229> kind<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.950> quite<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> scary

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
cuz it's really a kind of quite a scary

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.359 
cuz it's really a kind of quite a scary
area<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.659> fragile<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.860> has<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.250> be

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
area but it's so fragile it has to be

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.980 
area but it's so fragile it has to be
done<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.700> right<00:01:26.729> way<00:01:26.939> right<00:01:27.509> well<00:01:27.810> you've

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
done the right way right well you've

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.380 
done the right way right well you've
always<00:01:28.229> heard<00:01:28.650> most<00:01:29.250> eye<00:01:29.460> area<00:01:29.790> products<00:01:30.240> they

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
always heard most eye area products they

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.929 
always heard most eye area products they
always<00:01:30.659> say<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:31.500> or<00:01:31.740> when<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.040> exfoliate<00:01:32.280> do

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
always say do or when you exfoliate do

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.850 
always say do or when you exfoliate do
not<00:01:33.180> put<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.630> around<00:01:33.840> your<00:01:34.110> eye<00:01:34.170> area<00:01:34.290> do<00:01:34.829> not

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
not put this around your eye area do not

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.580 
not put this around your eye area do not
tug<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> eye<00:01:35.549> area<00:01:35.720> here<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.320> why<00:01:37.560> I

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
tug on the eye area here here is why I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.410 
tug on the eye area here here is why I
think<00:01:37.860> dr.<00:01:38.400> Perricone<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.970> probably<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
think dr. Perricone is probably the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.450 
think dr. Perricone is probably the
greatest<00:01:39.560> anti-aging<00:01:40.560> scientist<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.340> we

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
greatest anti-aging scientist that we

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.100 
greatest anti-aging scientist that we
will<00:01:41.640> ever<00:01:41.970> know<00:01:42.920> he<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.100> such<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.549> pioneer<00:01:45.360> he

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
will ever know he is such a pioneer he

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.039 
will ever know he is such a pioneer he
is<00:01:46.290> such<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> forefather<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.450> whole<00:01:48.720> field

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
is such a forefather in the whole field

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.840 
is such a forefather in the whole field

area<00:05:47.510> and<00:05:47.780> I<00:05:48.139> think<00:05:48.199> the<00:05:48.470> answer<00:05:48.770> for<00:05:48.949> most<00:05:49.159> of

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
area and I think the answer for most of

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.520 
area and I think the answer for most of
you<00:05:49.400> is<00:05:49.520> no<00:05:49.760> which<00:05:50.360> is<00:05:50.510> why<00:05:50.780> this<00:05:50.840> is<00:05:51.229> something

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
you is no which is why this is something

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.870 
you is no which is why this is something
that<00:05:51.560> I<00:05:51.710> think<00:05:51.740> you<00:05:52.010> should<00:05:52.159> incorporate<00:05:52.430> into

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
that I think you should incorporate into

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.339 
that I think you should incorporate into
the<00:05:52.970> regime<00:05:53.240> I<00:05:53.389> think<00:05:53.449> if<00:05:53.750> you<00:05:53.840> want<00:05:54.020> to<00:05:54.080> start

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
the regime I think if you want to start

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.200 
the regime I think if you want to start
anywhere<00:05:54.800> start<00:05:55.310> here<00:05:55.580> and<00:05:55.760> then<00:05:55.909> you<00:05:56.030> can

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
anywhere start here and then you can

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.730 
anywhere start here and then you can
start<00:05:56.539> adding<00:05:56.750> I'd<00:05:57.110> love<00:05:57.320> to<00:05:57.440> show<00:05:57.620> that
