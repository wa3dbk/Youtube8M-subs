00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770 
maybe it has no flutes but if you

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.860 
maybe it has no flutes but if you
actually<00:07:04.130> put<00:07:04.400> the<00:07:04.460> tab<00:07:05.420> between<00:07:05.570> your

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
actually put the tab between your

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.380 
actually put the tab between your
fingers<00:07:06.230> it's<00:07:06.590> not<00:07:06.800> round<00:07:07.100> even<00:07:07.340> it's<00:07:08.120> kind<00:07:08.330> of

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.390 
fingers it's not round even it's kind of

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.130 
fingers it's not round even it's kind of
square<00:07:08.720> shaped<00:07:10.090> so<00:07:11.090> one<00:07:11.210> goes<00:07:11.450> through<00:07:11.720> it

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:12.140 
square shaped so one goes through it

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.730 
square shaped so one goes through it
expands<00:07:12.740> the<00:07:12.920> bottom<00:07:13.280> of<00:07:13.400> the<00:07:13.580> insert<00:07:14.360> out

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:14.740 
expands the bottom of the insert out

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.110
