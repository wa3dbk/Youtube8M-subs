00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.800
Turtle's Flute

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.883
A Brazilian folktale

00:00:22.883 --> 00:00:25.050
Once upon a time,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.550
on the banks of a river,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.300
Turtle played her flute.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.300
When Turtle played,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.633
When Turtle played,

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:42.217
lions,

00:00:42.217 --> 00:00:44.217
elephants,

00:00:44.217 --> 00:00:46.633
butterflies,

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:49.133
snakes and monkeys

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.550
danced to Turtle's music.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.133
danced to Turtle's music.

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.550
One day,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.883
a man

00:00:56.883 --> 00:01:00.800
heard Turtle's music.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.717
"Ahh," he thought.

00:01:03.717 --> 00:01:06.050
“That must be Turtle

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.883
making music.

00:01:08.883 --> 00:01:11.217
Turtle would taste very good right now."

00:01:11.217 --> 00:01:14.050
Turtle would taste very good right now."

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.300
So he called out:

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.967
"Turtle!

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:25.800
Show me your beautiful flute."

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.633
Turtle slowly walked

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:29.967
to the door

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:33.883
and held out her flute.

00:01:33.883 --> 00:01:34.800
But

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.633
the moment the man saw

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:38.550
Turtle,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.550
he grabbed her by the neck

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.633
and began to run.

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:48.967
Turtle

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:50.467
tried to cry

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.217
for help,

00:01:52.217 --> 00:01:54.050
but she couldn't make a sound.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.217
but she couldn't make a sound.

00:01:57.217 --> 00:02:00.050
She closed her eyes,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.467
holding tightly to her flute

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:05.883
for good luck.

00:02:05.883 --> 00:02:07.383
When the man

00:02:07.383 --> 00:02:09.883
reached his hut,

00:02:09.883 --> 00:02:12.217
he put Turtle

00:02:12.217 --> 00:02:13.717
into a cage

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:17.383
and shut it.

00:02:17.383 --> 00:02:19.133
Then

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:21.383
he turned to his children:

00:02:21.383 --> 00:02:23.383
he turned to his children:

00:02:23.383 --> 00:02:25.967
"Don't let Turtle

00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:28.383
out of her cage."

00:02:28.383 --> 00:02:33.800
And off he went to the fields.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.217
The children

00:02:35.217 --> 00:02:39.467
began to play outside.

00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:40.550
Turtle

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.800
sat very still

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.633
inside her cage,

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:45.883
thinking

00:02:45.883 --> 00:02:50.633
about the father's words.

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:52.467
She began to play

00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:54.550
a sweet tune

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.467
on her flute,

00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:58.467
and the children

00:02:58.467 --> 00:03:02.383
ran to the cage.

00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:04.467
"Is that you playing,

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:06.300
Turtle?"

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.967
they asked,

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:13.300
their eyes wide with wonder.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.300
"Yes,"

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.133
Turtle said.

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:19.467
She kept on playing,

00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:20.633
for she could see

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:22.467
the children were

00:03:22.467 --> 00:03:26.883
delighted.

00:03:26.883 --> 00:03:33.717
At last she stopped.

00:03:33.717 --> 00:03:35.217
"I can dance

00:03:35.217 --> 00:03:36.133
even better

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:39.217
than I can play," she said.

00:03:39.217 --> 00:03:44.383
"Would you like to see?"

00:03:44.383 --> 00:03:45.967
"Oh, please!"

00:03:45.967 --> 00:03:50.300
the little boy cried.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.050
"I'll show you

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.217
how to dance and play

00:03:54.217 --> 00:03:56.050
at the same time,"

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.300
said Turtle.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.967
"But

00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:02.717
you must open the cage.

00:04:02.717 --> 00:04:07.717
There is no room in here."

00:04:07.717 --> 00:04:08.800
So

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.133
the little boy opened the cage

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:13.800
and Turtle

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.467
began to dance and play.

00:04:52.717 --> 00:04:54.050
The children laughed

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.800
and clapped their hands,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.217
for never had they seen

00:04:58.217 --> 00:05:00.217
for never had they seen

00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:03.633
such a wonderful thing.

00:05:03.633 --> 00:05:05.217
Then

00:05:05.217 --> 00:05:08.967
Turtle stopped.

00:05:08.967 --> 00:05:10.383
"Don't stop!"

00:05:10.383 --> 00:05:12.883
the children cried.

00:05:12.883 --> 00:05:16.133
"Oh," Turtle groaned.

00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:19.383
"My legs are stiff.

00:05:19.383 --> 00:05:21.717
If I could just walk

00:05:21.717 --> 00:05:23.300
a little bit

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.467
to loosen them ..."

00:05:27.467 --> 00:05:29.800
"Don't go too far,"

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.717
the little girl cautioned.

00:05:32.717 --> 00:05:36.550
“Come right back."

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.467
"Never fear,"

00:05:38.467 --> 00:05:40.633
said Turtle.

00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:44.383
"You wait right here."

00:05:44.383 --> 00:05:46.717
Turtle crawled off

00:05:46.717 --> 00:05:50.967
toward the jungle.

00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:53.300
The moment she was out of sight,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.300
she raced

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.133
all

00:05:56.133 --> 00:06:00.383
the way back to her house.

00:06:00.383 --> 00:06:02.633
Nobody ever found

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:05.383
Turtle again.

00:06:05.383 --> 00:06:08.717
But to this day,

00:06:08.717 --> 00:06:11.967
if you strain your ear,

00:06:11.967 --> 00:06:14.717
you can hear the sweet sound

00:06:14.717 --> 00:06:16.217
of a flute

00:06:16.217 --> 00:06:19.133
in the forest.
