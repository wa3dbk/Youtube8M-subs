thing we do is we got to establish the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.220 
thing we do is we got to establish the
speed<00:02:30.639> on<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:30.879> machine<00:02:31.269> and<00:02:31.569> this<00:02:31.959> is<00:02:32.019> a

speed on the machine and this is a

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.500 
speed on the machine and this is a
variable<00:02:32.650> machine<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:33.549> never<00:02:33.909> use<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.269> nor

you<00:02:36.340> want<00:02:36.519> to<00:02:36.549> do<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.790> you<00:02:36.849> want<00:02:36.999> to<00:02:37.030> start<00:02:37.239> off

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
you want to do is you want to start off

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.170 
you want to do is you want to start off
with<00:02:37.359> a<00:02:37.510> slow<00:02:37.719> speed<00:02:38.489> how<00:02:39.489> they<00:02:39.639> start<00:02:39.939> like<00:02:40.090> at

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
with a slow speed how they start like at

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.360 
with a slow speed how they start like at
three<00:02:40.209> steam<00:02:40.959> which<00:02:41.769> is<00:02:41.920> going<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.099> eat<00:02:42.189> your

three steam which is going to eat your
coverage<00:02:42.790> first<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.299> let's<00:02:43.450> go<00:02:43.599> ahead<00:02:43.719> and

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
coverage first so let's go ahead and

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.929 
coverage first so let's go ahead and
select<00:02:44.500> three<00:02:44.859> on<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.099> dial<00:02:45.310> as<00:02:45.519> you<00:02:45.609> can<00:02:45.760> see

select three on the dial as you can see

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.300 
select three on the dial as you can see
here<00:02:46.209> now<00:02:46.900> once<00:02:47.170> we<00:02:47.260> get<00:02:47.349> three<00:02:47.590> selected<00:02:48.159> you

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
here now once we get three selected you

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.440 
here now once we get three selected you
want<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.519> go<00:02:48.639> ahead<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.000> make<00:02:49.090> sure<00:02:49.209> you<00:02:49.329> get

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
want to go ahead and make sure you get

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.080 
want to go ahead and make sure you get
the<00:02:49.510> core<00:02:49.750> for<00:02:49.959> your<00:02:50.169> left<00:02:50.409> shoulder<00:02:50.859> and<00:02:51.250> when

the core for your left shoulder and when

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.520 
the core for your left shoulder and when
you<00:02:52.239> start<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.689> machine<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:53.169> want<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.409> make

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
you start the machine you want to make

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.050 
you start the machine you want to make
sure<00:02:53.739> that<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.099> machine<00:02:54.219> is<00:02:54.400> on<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.849> vehicle

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
sure that the machine is on the vehicle

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.179 
sure that the machine is on the vehicle
when<00:02:55.419> we<00:02:55.510> started<00:02:55.900> this<00:02:56.379> is<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.650> safety<00:02:57.040> feature

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
when we started this is a safety feature

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.530 
when we started this is a safety feature
to<00:02:57.489> make<00:02:57.519> sure<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:57.879> don't<00:02:58.060> damage<00:02:58.209> the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
to make sure you don't damage the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.869 
to make sure you don't damage the
vehicle<00:02:58.689> or<00:02:59.500> it<00:02:59.799> doesn't<00:02:59.950> take<00:03:00.250> off<00:03:00.430> by<00:03:00.579> itself

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
vehicle or it doesn't take off by itself
