00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello lately there are 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.390
 Chassis a few problems and that 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.420
 most people do not know what 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.610
 for cars or something for combination 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.849
 car and trailer you are allowed to drive 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.060
 and afterwards also want yes and quite often 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.369
 there is the problem when it comes to the b 96 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.230
 license is that we offer to 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.880
 this little explanation video 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.670
 first we go from the normal one 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.099
 Car license from a normal car 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.660
 with a permissible total weight of 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.030
 three and a half tons 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.180
 this is also class b three and a half 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.070
 tons is the permissible total mass 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.809
 already a problem for most of them 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.430
 permissible total mass settles 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.829
 together from the empty weight plus the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.780
 maximum load so you get that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.370
 you do not have to work out, you just have to look 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.050
 in the vehicle papers that is in 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.960
 vehicle certificate is in it 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.690
 yes and there you know what my car 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.219
 for permissible total mass, the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.859
 most do not know that one 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.660
 in the class b already a trailer with 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.519
 can drive in the class b comes 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.070
 this little trailer of it may 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.119
 a permissible total mass of 750 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.030
 have kilograms 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.670
 if he has greater always here 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.640
 Also greater than 750 may be the combination 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.869
 from trailer and towing vehicle three and a half 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.689
 Do not exceed tons 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.420
 yes that means when the trailer for 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.280
 For example, one and a half tons weighs and that 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.720
 Traction vehicle allowed two tons 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.210
 total mass then we come to exactly 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.650
 three and a half and it would fit the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.600
 a little more because you would have one 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.740
 problem 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.020
 then there is the class b made 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.490
 a trailer on it 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.920
 the one permissible total mass of 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.420
 Three and a half tons is what we mean 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:52.880
 come together here for seven tons 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:55.619
 maximum plus the trailer baths and 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.880
 now comes this little tweak 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.540
 if I turn this down a bit 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.009
 pull 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.520
 now comes the class b 96 to the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.110
 Class B 96 uses this combination 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.860
 at b 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.200
 that's why b 96 yes there will be three and a half 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.510
 metric tons 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.989
 42 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.629
 by made in the combination b 96 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.700
 It is called because the key number 96 the 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.890
 license comes and the big one 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.780
 advantage of that is that at one 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.450
 be made Saturday in the driving school 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.930
 if you ask other driving schools 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.890
 they 'll say oh b96 total scrap 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.989
 prefers b 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.879
 that's basically right it is 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.709
 of course much cooler abi too 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.909
 Of course, it also costs more money 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.430
 between 5 and 7 100 euro 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.799
 b 96 you have no test while it is 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.650
 a saturday and board household 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.280
 on 425 tons this combination 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.879
 both 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.129
 yes that's really worth it only if 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.989
 you want to drive certain vehicles 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.510
 and indeed a small trailer 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.340
 or a trailer with wood on it is 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.980
 No matter what's on it, reason starts 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.879
 the combination only 425 tons not 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.250
 exceed 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.709
 yes and that means it's only going to happen 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.090
 the class b expanded a bit without 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.370
 Examination without nothing 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.049
 yes you have to afterwards only with the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.510
 Certificate from chassis to go to the office 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.699
 to the public transport office and you 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.769
 register 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:25.900
 for me personally sb 619 cool 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.239
 Solutions for people who are not much more 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.910
 want to know and know exactly what 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.769
 a combination they drive and b is 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.030
 a solution for people who are not 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.620
 worry about wanting to do more 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.620
 So that's your decision
