it<00:01:29.220> back<00:01:29.369> thought<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:30.090> go<00:01:30.210> we've<00:01:30.360> hit

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.710 
it back thought I we go we've hit
something<00:01:30.660> again<00:01:31.820> turns<00:01:32.820> out<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.330> wasn't

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.520 
the case what would happen somehow I'd
reach<00:01:36.510> the<00:01:36.900> engines

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
reach the engines

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.530 
reach the engines
this<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.220> botany<00:01:38.580> push<00:01:38.910> up<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.270> bring<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
this is botany push up you can bring the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.330 
this is botany push up you can bring the
engines<00:01:39.750> right<00:01:40.050> up<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.410> they<00:01:40.500> were<00:01:40.890> literally

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
engines right up and they were literally

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.390 
engines right up and they were literally
there<00:01:41.520> prop<00:01:41.759> was<00:01:41.910> sticking<00:01:42.150> out<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.420> water<00:01:42.630> so

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
there prop was sticking out the water so

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.890 
there prop was sticking out the water so
yeah<00:01:44.400> we<00:01:44.640> sounded<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.330> was<00:01:45.390> cavitating

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
yeah we sounded like it was cavitating

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.310 
yeah we sounded like it was cavitating
and<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:47.970> we're<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.300> oh<00:01:48.450> that's<00:01:48.690> odd<00:01:48.869> turn<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
and so we're like oh that's odd turn the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.170 
and so we're like oh that's odd turn the
engine<00:01:49.530> off<00:01:49.650> turn<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.160> back<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.520> put<00:01:50.940> it<00:01:51.030> back

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
engine off turn it back on put it back

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.550 
engine off turn it back on put it back
down<00:01:51.360> all<00:01:51.540> about<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.930> was<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.140> wouldn't<00:01:52.380> work

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
down all about that was it wouldn't work

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.590 
down all about that was it wouldn't work
at<00:01:52.800> first<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.190> turned<00:01:53.400> it<00:01:53.490> off<00:01:53.580> turn<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:53.940> and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
at first we turned it off turn it on and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.790 
at first we turned it off turn it on and
put<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.869> back<00:01:54.960> down<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:55.200> carried<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.619> like

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
put it back down and carried on like

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.550 
put it back down and carried on like
literally<00:01:56.160> that<00:01:56.700> two<00:01:56.970> seconds<00:01:57.510> later<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
literally that two seconds later the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.770 
literally that two seconds later the
engines<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.010> beached<00:01:59.700> itself<00:01:59.970> straight<00:02:00.600> up

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
engines just beached itself straight up

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.390 
engines just beached itself straight up
and<00:02:01.020> cavitate<00:02:01.680> what<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:04.530> basically<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:05.159> kept

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
and cavitate what and basically it kept

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.930 
and cavitate what and basically it kept
doing<00:02:05.580> it

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
doing it

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.359 
doing it
we<00:02:06.659> started<00:02:07.110> chugging<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.680> engine<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.310> we

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
we started chugging on one engine but we

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.859 
we started chugging on one engine but we
had<00:02:08.459> quite<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.790> way<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.030> go<00:02:09.269> and<00:02:09.510> we<00:02:09.600> heard<00:02:09.750> on

headland so like ya know immense that
have<00:02:16.800> an<00:02:16.890> engine<00:02:17.130> problems<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:18.300> was<00:02:18.420> pretty

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
have an engine problems it was pretty

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.660 
have an engine problems it was pretty
interested<00:02:19.080> in<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.470> got<00:02:19.620> bloody<00:02:19.980> wet<00:02:20.430> like

soaked so basically yeah we made it

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.150 
soaked so basically yeah we made it
there<00:02:23.970> by<00:02:24.269> John<00:02:24.660> forcibly<00:02:25.500> holding<00:02:26.040> the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
there by John forcibly holding the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.039 
there by John forcibly holding the
button<00:02:26.310> down<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.910> keeping<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.540> engines<00:02:27.870> in

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
button down and keeping the engines in

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.320 
button down and keeping the engines in
check<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.860> was<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:28.980> constant<00:02:29.190> battle<00:02:29.489> we

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
check and it was a constant battle we

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.729 
check and it was a constant battle we
figure<00:02:30.630> those<00:02:30.720> fifteen<00:02:31.080> miles<00:02:31.320> once<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.590> get

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
figure those fifteen miles once you get

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.590 
figure those fifteen miles once you get
around<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.980> corner<00:02:32.340> we<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.850> head<00:02:32.970> south<00:02:33.269> into

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
around the corner we can head south into

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.560 
around the corner we can head south into
the<00:02:33.780> bay<00:02:33.930> here<00:02:34.200> at<00:02:34.320> Dingle<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.000> we<00:02:36.000> did<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.450> and

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
the bay here at Dingle and we did it and

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.970 
the bay here at Dingle and we did it and
I<00:02:36.630> feeling<00:02:36.900> good<00:02:36.989> now<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.350> British<00:02:37.769> star

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
because we left left her with the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.259 
because we left left her with the

what he's told me basically is get the

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.580 
what he's told me basically is get the
engine<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:54.150> where<00:02:54.450> we<00:02:54.660> want<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.019> trim<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.410> be

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
engine to where we want the trim to be

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.949 
engine to where we want the trim to be
and<00:02:55.860> then<00:02:56.519> disconnect<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.570> solenoids

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
and then disconnect the solenoids

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.860 
and then disconnect the solenoids
disconnect<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.890> switches<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.790> that<00:03:00.030> way<00:03:00.209> it

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
disconnect the switches and that way it

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.290 
disconnect the switches and that way it
won't<00:03:01.020> go<00:03:01.200> up<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.500> won't<00:03:01.620> go<00:03:01.770> down<00:03:01.800> but<00:03:02.610> it

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
won't go up and it won't go down but it

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.490 
won't go up and it won't go down but it
should<00:03:03.510> stay<00:03:03.690> in<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.840> right<00:03:03.990> place<00:03:04.230> all<00:03:04.410> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
should stay in the right place all the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.040 
should stay in the right place all the
time<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.640> we<00:03:05.700> found<00:03:05.940> more<00:03:06.090> a

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
time so we found more a

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.559 
time so we found more a
talking<00:03:07.500> about<00:03:07.590> here's<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.430> pump<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.940> here's

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
talking about here's the pump and here's

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.240 
talking about here's the pump and here's
the<00:03:09.720> two<00:03:09.900> relays<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.709> two<00:03:11.400> plugs<00:03:12.920> yes<00:03:13.920> the

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
the two relays and the two plugs yes the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.430 
the two relays and the two plugs yes the
electric<00:03:14.610> is<00:03:14.730> still<00:03:14.879> being<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.690> bit<00:03:15.810> weird<00:03:16.110> but

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
electric is still being a bit weird but

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.660 
electric is still being a bit weird but
we've<00:03:16.590> managed<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:16.860> get<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.069> engine<00:03:17.280> where<00:03:17.519> we

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
we've managed to get the engine where we

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.729 
we've managed to get the engine where we
want<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:18.360> we're<00:03:19.080> going<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.230> pull<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.500> plug

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
want it so we're going to pull the plug

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.830 
want it so we're going to pull the plug
and<00:03:19.980> hopefully<00:03:20.580> that's<00:03:20.760> where<00:03:20.879> I'll<00:03:21.000> stay<00:03:21.209> so

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
and hopefully that's where I'll stay so

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.360 
and hopefully that's where I'll stay so
quick<00:03:22.230> fix<00:03:22.500> until<00:03:22.890> we<00:03:22.980> get<00:03:23.130> back

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
quick fix until we get back

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:31.820 
quick fix until we get back
hopefully<00:03:29.510> it<00:03:30.510> was<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.660> temporary<00:03:30.959> fix<00:03:31.080> but<00:03:31.530> the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
hopefully it was a temporary fix but the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.370 
hopefully it was a temporary fix but the
problem<00:03:32.160> was<00:03:32.250> sold<00:03:32.489> for<00:03:32.730> now<00:03:33.140> with<00:03:34.140> winds

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
problem was sold for now with winds

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.470 
problem was sold for now with winds
still<00:03:34.739> increasing<00:03:35.340> we<00:03:35.700> decided<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.239> overnight

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
still increasing we decided to overnight

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:49.480 
still increasing we decided to overnight
here<00:03:36.870> in<00:03:36.989> Dingle

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.860 

one<00:03:50.490> thing<00:03:50.700> we've<00:03:50.820> learned<00:03:50.850> on<00:03:51.270> this<00:03:51.390> trip<00:03:51.690> is

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
one thing we've learned on this trip is

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.690 
one thing we've learned on this trip is
you<00:03:52.020> go<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.230> bed<00:03:52.470> on<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.740> bad<00:03:52.950> weather<00:03:53.190> forecast

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
you go to bed on a bad weather forecast

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.210 
you go to bed on a bad weather forecast
and<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.480> ignore<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:55.530> because<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.890> just<00:03:56.070> get

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
and you ignore it because you just get

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
and you ignore it because you just get
up<00:03:56.310> in<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.490> morning<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.820> see<00:03:57.000> what<00:03:57.030> the

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
up in the morning to see what the

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.360 
up in the morning to see what the
weather's<00:03:57.480> actually<00:03:58.290> like<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:59.070> this<00:03:59.160> is<00:03:59.220> one

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
weather's actually like and this is one
