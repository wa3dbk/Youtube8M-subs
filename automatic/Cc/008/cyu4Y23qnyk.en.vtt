version and he has a different wheel

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.310 
version and he has a different wheel
configuration<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:09.149> looks<00:02:09.360> like<00:02:09.570> two<00:02:09.869> smaller

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320

wheels<00:02:10.590> at<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.800> back<00:02:11.100> so<00:02:12.030> we'll<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:12.810> to

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
wheels at the back so we'll have to

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.920 
wheels at the back so we'll have to
compare<00:02:13.350> this<00:02:13.590> with<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:15.209> real<00:02:15.420> version<00:02:15.840> of

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
compare this with the real version of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.920 
compare this with the real version of
kana<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.470> see<00:02:16.709> which<00:02:16.980> one<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.580> more<00:02:18.180> accurate

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
kana to see which one is more accurate

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.900 
kana to see which one is more accurate
okay<00:02:20.090> let's<00:02:21.090> see<00:02:21.330> design<00:02:21.750> wise<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:23.580> pretty

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
okay let's see design wise the pretty

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.320 
okay let's see design wise the pretty
much<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.360> designed<00:02:24.780> very<00:02:25.130> similar<00:02:26.130> what<00:02:26.760> all

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
much is designed very similar what all

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.320 
much is designed very similar what all
right<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:28.730> there<00:02:29.730> they<00:02:29.850> are<00:02:29.880> side<00:02:30.360> by<00:02:30.390> side

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
right so there they are side by side

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.420 
right so there they are side by side
Connor<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.690> Connor<00:02:35.540> my<00:02:36.540> Bad's<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.530> taking
