 instructions 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:43.140
 you need to specify the foil here first to 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:47.970
 juice water did not hit the fan itself 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:52.300
 fluid ingress not recommended there 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.880
 Well, we have a lid drawn on the lid 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.659
 what products can be dried here 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.210
 mushrooms for example are dried from four to 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.320
 six o'clock 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:09.840

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:30.420
 halves here are pear slices from 16 to 20 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:36.519
 these are halves from 16 to 20 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:43.120

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.489
 such a dryer now show how she is 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.240
 works 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.570
 what sound and 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.570
 gives 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.330
 here goes 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.280
 warm air comes out 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.280
 not immediately the brain will heat up 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.760
 the edges are so cool 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.570
 of course the dryer 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:23.550
 it doesn't make much noise but if it is 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:27.120
 last 10 hours certainly not very 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:31.670
 nice so we put it in the kitchen 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.670
 close the door to not be heard 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.810
 so she works she she 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.610
 and you can work for a long time something 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:49.830
 heats up on nothing overheats 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.830

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.500
