00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.479
 Seven things you should know about 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.880
 fiber you've probably heard that the 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.790
 fiber is very good for digestion and 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.830
 can reduce your cholesterol level 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.019
 but you knew that it can also help 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.869
 control the weight by making you 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.310
 you feel fuller the fiber can also 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.249
 help in the treatment of 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.239
 constipation hemorrhoids 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.499
 diverticulitis and bowel syndrome 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.019
 irritable 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:30.869
 at the same time reducing the risk of 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.530
 type 2 diabetes heart disease 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.260
 and some cancers then what 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.330
 is the fiber the fiber is a hydrate 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.310
 carbon impossible to digest by the 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.730
 body since we do not have the 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.680
 enzymes needed to metabolize what 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.990
 fiber is found only in food 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.930
 that contain plant matter such as 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.630
 whole grains fruits vegetables and 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.579
 pulses the fiber does not appear in a 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:01.239
 natural in dairy products or meats 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.519
 there is soluble and insoluble fiber both 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.350
 they are important for health and they have 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.100
 its own characteristics and benefits 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.470
 Only soluble fiber absorbs water at 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.659
 as it moves through the tract 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.990
 gastrointestinal and it becomes a 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.670
 gel promoting digestion this gel is 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.039
 binds part of the cholesterol in the 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.740
 small intestine and to take it out 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.450
 of the body the soluble fiber is also 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.610
 useful in sugar regulation 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.710
 blood as it delays the time in 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.720
 that it reaches the blood after 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.880
 to be ingested this is very useful and 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.640
 important for people with diabetes or 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.440
 for those at risk the sources 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.560
 of soluble fiber are glucomannan 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.789
 found in products like pasta 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.280
 barley oats beans nuts seeds 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.570
 lentils pears strawberries and 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.940
 cranberries 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.090
 the insoluble fiber works from a 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.220
 way very different from soluble fiber 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.380
 although it does not dissolve in water it pushes the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.810
 food more quickly through the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.510
 stomach and intestines while 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.550
 adds volume to the stool this promotes 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.009
 regularity and helps prevent the 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.560
 constipation fiber sources 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.230
 insoluble include whole grain bread 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.959
 the couscous also known as sea 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.410
 brown barley brown rice 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.520
 wheat seeds carrots 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.730
 zucchini cucumbers 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.700
 celery and tomatoes how many grams of fiber 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.890
 I must eat the recommended consumption per day 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.430
 of fiber depends on the amount of 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.020
 calories consumed per day 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.300
 Current recommendations suggest that in 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.100
 general older children and adults 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:45.100
 should aim from 20 to 35 grams per day 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.560
 how to add more fiber to the diet choose 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.170
 cereals bread rice and wholegrain pasta 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.290
 instead of the processed varieties 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.069
 white eats whole fruits instead of 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.409
 drink fruit juices 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.620
 eat fruits and vegetables instead of 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.189
 cookies or chips when you increase your 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.069
 fiber 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.379
 gradually make it eat more fiber than 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.439
 that we are used to can cause 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.689
 swelling and cramping gases too 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:14.120
 make sure you drink enough water 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:17.120
 this helps the fiber pass through 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.150
 of the digestive system and what about the 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.639
 fiber supplements supplements 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.310
 fiber can be used to improve 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:27.680
 the consumption of fiber as a general rule 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.540
 fiber powder supplements are 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.819
 soluble fiber while the 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.409
 Solid fiber supplements can be 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.469
 soluble or insoluble 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.510
 depending on the product it is important 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:41.120
 look at the source of the fiber before 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.340
 of buying any supplement has been 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.949
 seen that the following types of fibers 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.019
 they have health benefits the rubber 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:53.810
 of glucomannan ward followed pectin cm3 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:56.840
 cellulose fiber of wheat and alginate that 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.030
 causes excess fiber to eat fiber in 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.730
 excess may cause some discomfort 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.250
 Gastrointestinal constipation 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.069
 or reduce the absorption of certain 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.220
 minerals like calcium iron zinc and 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.220
 magnesium
