00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.459
 hello everyone you did not make this video how to share uaifai network 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:11.999
 and with annexes 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.509
 now I do it for him too, in fact, many messages have not arrived 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.190
 you can't do with windos you can do it with windos because 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.169
 in fact windows though 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.029
 and it is not that it is the best operating system 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.399
 however much used 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:31.949
 and therefore not immediately to see how this is done creates an ovaries and per network 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.430
 also share other phones with our pontaccio 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.890
 and because we don't have the possibility of having a wi-fi modem 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.340
 and therefore 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.320
 however, we want to use it on the internet and on our devices 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.020
 portable 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.020
 to do it we just need to go 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.980
 below sure 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.390
 on the internet icon and here we come to open network connections center e 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.850
 sharing 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.980
 arrives on configures new direct connection 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.510
 and then 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.869
 when this will open and that 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.570
 this window we go down 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.799
 configure the voir les hale-bopp network from computer to computer 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.800
 click here we go on ahead 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.930
 we can also not read this blog ahead 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.640
 hey apple this chant in these fields we put the data present the straight name 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.390
 we put 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.840
 windows seven 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.420
 kind of security in council to use 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.850
 mvp ao2 personal but you can do what you want in this case a 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.270
 open friend because so we put ourselves d - 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.820
 for greater protection, however, I recommend using 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.110
 or too much plain 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.270
 if you want 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.990
 keep this network saved so you can quickly create it each time 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.890
 that you want to work on your calf 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.960
 click save this age in which I'm messing up 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.960
 let's go ahead waiting for it to configure this network 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.600
 after creating it we go to patty sharing internet connection 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:15.010
 and immediately after when it will be activated 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.229
 I won't be able to see it on our calf 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:19.470
 we click close 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.940
 also here pd and now let's move on our ipod to keep silent 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.310
 and how to set up this computer network 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.180
 even on our ipod it is very simple to configure it 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.669
 let's go into settings 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:38.429
 and as you see in the uaifai lines that we find immediately above we will find a 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.259
 windows se7en to connect to 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:46.179
 if you have put the password here, you have some padlock but in the case 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:51.029
 minors in which I did not put any protection there will be no padlock 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:53.809
 click on it and his 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:59.279
 will connect and at the top left of the writing to ipod we can 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:04.400
 see the lion the symbol of the connection to the network if you don't see it 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:10.159
 as in my case, wait until you find all the information for and 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.429
 connect to this part 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:17.729
 now how can you win in the upper right corner to the left you can see that of 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.729
 next to the word apa ipod celti via 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.659
 the symbol of uaifai 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.979
 I hope you enjoyed this video and above all it helped you 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.580

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.100

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.030
