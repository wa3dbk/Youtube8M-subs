fighter I can see the split second
difference<00:01:09.970> in<00:01:10.119> childishness<00:01:10.540> reflexes<00:01:11.229> and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
difference in childishness reflexes and

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.929 
difference in childishness reflexes and
historic<00:01:11.979> so<00:01:12.070> I<00:01:12.100> could<00:01:12.340> seem<00:01:12.520> thinking

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
historic so I could seem thinking

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.789 
historic so I could seem thinking
something<00:01:13.329> before<00:01:13.930> he<00:01:13.960> gets<00:01:14.170> off<00:01:14.350> getting<00:01:14.560> it

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
something before he gets off getting it

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.469 
something before he gets off getting it
and<00:01:15.009> it's<00:01:15.369> just<00:01:15.759> one<00:01:15.880> of<00:01:15.909> those<00:01:15.970> things<00:01:16.090> father

and it's just one of those things father

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.539 
and it's just one of those things father
time<00:01:16.780> will<00:01:16.990> slow<00:01:17.140> of<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.530> walk<00:01:17.860> you<00:01:17.979> down<00:01:18.189> it<00:01:18.369> is
