00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 today when they were the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.580
 criteria will speak of criteria which 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.700
 were the criteria for saying what it was 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.070
 canonical and after ball we only go to the first 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.750
 criterion since churches and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.460
 you have content written by a 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.220
 I bet I had started the program 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.740
 since the Christian churches were 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.800
 founded on the apostles 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.890
 it is obvious that his writings were 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.590
 truth of the teachings of Jesus and the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.320
 events of the early church 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.390
 however the problem is to determine what 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.930
 really constitutes a genuine 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.469
 gospel and the apostolic inscription geninho 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.590
 The way that constituted this is but what? 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.350
 tell of books that are in the bible the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.550
 which were not written by an apostle 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.129
 there the question 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.070
 the first question for 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.570
 this canonization this closing accept 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.520
 the true books 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.109
 unlike the fake books the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.300
 first point was that it should have 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.320
 been with after my question as well 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.960
 milestones and lucas were not apostles like 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.950
 then they entered the bible as 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.740
 may then landmarks and lucas be in your 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.790
 the Bible were not the same 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.740
 apostles 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.950
 Can you answer that question? 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.560
 now you have a gospel of landmarks and 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.960
 of lucas by apostles not because he is 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.759
 In your life, then, you are a teacher. 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.530
 I never stopped to think about it because 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.100
 well you're going with the bible she in 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.350
 her hands ready but the historicity of 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.100
 construction says you call the bible 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.350
 am or because you have or you think God 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.090
 send from heaven under the arm of 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.460
 someone 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.390
 we who are not right then this story 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.030
 good there to not come cheap it is 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.640
 all creation of men what I go 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.850
 say here there is no landmarks lucas 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.490
 bet then break-break the first 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.680
 understanding of the parents of the churches is 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.140
 God're not God came and cried 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.649
 it inflates the books that you go 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.680
 form the bible you parents the church 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:19.079
 I'll make the canon over my 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.170
 the apostles neither god nor jesus did this 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.769
 Jesus said look when I climb to 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.900
 heavens 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.069
 you what each of you will write 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.069
 books but I'll only accept the book 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.439
 of mine after you that are true 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.780
 and you guys will make the front 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.510
 before you die canonize in creating 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.950
 a bible for the people for the people 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.359
 after the 21st century also not what 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.120
 You have beauty hands on 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:50.040
 So let's talk let's try now you 'll see the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.500
 the parents' maneuver the churches they 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.409
 made in 2011 after ready 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.450
 Marcos and mateus at the end I can not but it was 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.319
 endorsed by a door is who from the south 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.659
 but let's go 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.409
 it is important to understand that for 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:07.019
 document have apostolic authority 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:10.919
 it was not necessary for an apostle to have it 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:14.760
 writing but have the authority 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:16.530
 apostolic and today a text the cushion in 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.199
 a conference on authority after the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.389
 height is full out there right bunch of leaves 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.099
 For there you are clearing the 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.599
 I will neither discuss this reference 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.790
 bibliographical all you want after 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.870
 with the sketch on my site is the case 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.079
 will talk a little bit about 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:36.599
 Marcos believes that milestones have become 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:39.720
 foot believes it is believed accept that but 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.780
 became an interpreter of pedro although not 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.540
 proof does not approve what 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.479
 be used as an argument is as follows 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.180
 paper citation only this because frames 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:53.970
 I was not betting there to not go cheap and 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.280
 takes a paper saying and so frames 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.479
 having become an interpreter of Pedro 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.120
 wrote accurately all that they 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:05.159
 It reminded the cabin that a qi 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.479
 so everything if he remembered it 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:10.560
 wrote accurately 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:13.199
 it was not however in exact order that 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.009
 he reported the words the act of christ 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:20.789
 for he neither heard you nor the 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:23.490
 accompanied but later as I said 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:27.180
 he accompanied Pedro who accommodated his 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.630
 instructions for the needs but yes 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.479
 the intention to give a regular narrative 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.699
 what you say about the landmarks 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.340
 made any mistake in writing the 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.430
 saying 'there's no mistake for 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.880
 written of one thing he took care of 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.669
 especially not to omit anything that 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.060
 he had heard and not put 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:53.130
 nothing fictitious in the statements 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.340
 this is argument comes from who of man 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.560
 called pussies then what you have 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.210
 in hands 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.880
 first as to whether a rule should be 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.130
 written proposal the most macro was after the 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.789
 so let's create a rule from someone else 's 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.199
 south but Pedro did not endorse who 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.479
 is endorsing his father already steps 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:15.720
 roles people everything that comes from the hand of those 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:19.500
 men continue lucas quote from parents 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.139
 of the church now begins or let's go 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.620
 summarize here then in the first second 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:28.979
 century should accept a book 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.460
 to fight the fermentations we go 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:35.729
 so that the heresies of Marcion 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.020
 basilides of so many other branches 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.840
 It would have to be a book written by 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.720
 an apostle only people that Jesus had 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.110
 when after 1212 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.020
 according to the bible ok a even paulo doing 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.949
 who looks who paulo the beast or I love 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.470
 Paulo 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:55.979
 I'm a fan of paulo there paulo writes 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:58.800
 so himself jesus is in the book of 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:02.970
 of cool gals that grab and feces 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:07.169
 Ephesians himself from some to apostles 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:09.570
 pastors doctors there for him gave 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.669
 At that time Jesus gave 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.380
 apostles and pastor Jesus gave 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.509
 ministry and pastor to anyone 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.460
 Jesus gave doctor's ministry to 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.180
 someone jesus gave evangelist ministry 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.789
 to someone 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.590
 you have that good question arms 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:24.900
 want to know the answer goes on my website and 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.110
 will buy the five ministries and Ephesians 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.110
 OK
