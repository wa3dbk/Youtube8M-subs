see the haircut massage color done just

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.570 
see the haircut massage color done just
a<00:01:08.340> hair<00:01:08.580> cut<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.090> nothing<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.470> crazy<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.340> I

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
a hair cut here nothing so crazy but I

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.609 
a hair cut here nothing so crazy but I
think<00:01:11.640> what<00:01:12.030> would<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.150> good<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.960> her<00:01:13.350> hair

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
think what would be good is her hair

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.310 
think what would be good is her hair
grows<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:13.950> fast<00:01:14.220> when<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:14.880> short<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.869> doesn't

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
grows so fast when it's short it doesn't

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.920 
grows so fast when it's short it doesn't
take<00:01:16.530> much<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.100> shape<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.549> get<00:01:17.759> out<00:01:18.659> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
take much for the shape to get out of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.090 
take much for the shape to get out of
there<00:01:19.110> so

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.520 

a<00:01:24.130> little<00:01:24.820> closer<00:01:25.180> you<00:01:25.480> can<00:01:25.720> see<00:01:25.960> I've<00:01:26.110> gotten

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
a little closer you can see I've gotten

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.530

some<00:01:26.710> good<00:01:26.920> lift<00:01:27.190> on<00:01:27.550> these<00:01:27.700> rings<00:01:28.090> from<00:01:28.420> you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
little closer and you can see how that

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.310 
little closer and you can see how that
just<00:02:05.500> takes<00:02:05.979> out<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.430> weight<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.900> it<00:02:08.050> really

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
just takes out the weight and it really

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.400

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
taking that in a little closer it didn't

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.400 
taking that in a little closer it didn't
look<00:02:15.910> like<00:02:15.970> she<00:02:16.330> had<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.720> much<00:02:16.930> hair<00:02:17.200> until

thicker<00:02:20.200> here<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:23.200> like<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.190> said<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:24.550> was

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
thicker here is and like I said it was

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.340 
thicker here is and like I said it was
super<00:02:25.959> fast<00:02:26.610> but<00:02:27.610> sure<00:02:27.910> this<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.870> nicer<00:02:29.320> it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
super fast but sure this is the nicer it

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.479

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
lays on the neckline and - you see how

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.979 
lays on the neckline and - you see how
strong<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.630> growth<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.290> it's<00:02:35.739> really<00:02:36.070> pretty

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
strong that growth is it's really pretty

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.160
