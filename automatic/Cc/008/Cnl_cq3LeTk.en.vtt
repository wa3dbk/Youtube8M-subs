 club of the ventoux one comes from the summit there one 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.520
 was a little bit see the state of the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.020
 ground then as you can see 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.599
 there is still a lot of snow 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.669
 still it's not bad bus a lot 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.230
 product because the temperatures have 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.450
 started to increase since three-four 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.700
 days so now the uncertainty 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.329
 is it okay to know 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.540
 fLANDERS 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.290
 is it going to lay but it's not going 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.180
 not to get through 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.710
 so we stick to the ground we try to 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.289
 give you the most information 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.539

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.469
 two that they are but so far the 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.530
 delicate parts of course to be located 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.319
 for the moment like every year when 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.809
 there is this commitment between the 14 100 m 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:02.269
 and the 200 m 2 under las brings a lot 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.800
 the less cold it is at night so 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.040
 in any case we stick to the 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.050
 field so here we will take some 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.140
 decisions in the last week for 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.210
