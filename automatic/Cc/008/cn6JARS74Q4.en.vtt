some of them definitely will and one

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.070 
some of them definitely will and one
thing<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.270> school<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.600> really<00:03:15.780> trying

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
to do is expand their horizons because

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.270 
to do is expand their horizons because
you<00:03:18.420> know<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:19.230> trucking<00:03:19.590> industry<00:03:19.680> is

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
you know the the trucking industry is

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.920 
you know the the trucking industry is
very<00:03:20.520> limited<00:03:20.940> right<00:03:21.090> now<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:21.540> it's<00:03:21.660> probably

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
very limited right now and it's probably

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.480 
very limited right now and it's probably
going<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.440> go<00:03:22.560> through<00:03:22.770> some<00:03:22.980> changes<00:03:23.160> we've

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
going to go through some changes we've

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.550 
going to go through some changes we've
seen<00:03:23.520> a<00:03:23.880> lot<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.600> criticism<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.260> heard<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.530> lot

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
seen a lot of criticism and heard a lot

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.230 
seen a lot of criticism and heard a lot
of<00:03:25.680> criticism<00:03:25.890> as<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.640> late<00:03:26.790> because<00:03:26.940> it's

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
of criticism as of late because it's

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.580 
of criticism as of late because it's
getting<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:27.570> crowded<00:03:27.810> up<00:03:28.080> in<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.260> mountain

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
getting so crowded up in that mountain

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.470 
getting so crowded up in that mountain
and<00:03:28.770> that<00:03:29.040> means<00:03:29.220> it's<00:03:29.400> much<00:03:29.670> more<00:03:29.940> dangerous

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
and that means it's much more dangerous

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.300 
and that means it's much more dangerous
for<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.810> Sherpas<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.380> for<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.710> climbers<00:03:31.980> so

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
for the Sherpas and for the climbers so

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.790 
for the Sherpas and for the climbers so
a<00:03:32.490> lot<00:03:32.940> more<00:03:32.970> are<00:03:33.480> looking<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.410> other<00:03:34.560> ways

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
a lot more are looking to to other ways
