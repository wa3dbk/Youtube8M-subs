00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.520
 in this video tutorial we are going to see the 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.910
 configuration 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.350
 the use and different applications for 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.880
 the image gallery module for 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.610
 lend 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.110
 right now we are looking at a template 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.350
 standard of this area where it has 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.390
 installed the gallery module now 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.400
 same we have selected an image that 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.310
 is the one that will take the customer to know 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.810
 he does here what he will see is 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.039
 a gallery of images of our 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.529
 products 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.170
 click right now with the products 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.760
 standard of provision would see the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.199
 six products that have to be alone 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.010
 with a configurable action page 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.010
 we go to the next page 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.500
 if we go back to the beginning 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.480
 we would see the image of the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.100
 product gallery let's go to the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.390
 configuration of the module to see the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.460
 different options 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.250
 that this module provides we go to the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.250
 module tab we look for the module 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:10.000
 and press configure 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.100
 the first option that shows us is the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.500
 number of products per page 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.300
 in this case we have six posts 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.800
 we can easily change this number 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.920
 we also have the picture to show 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:31.060
 we have all the images that are created 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:35.070
 from the preferences tab 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:39.630
 images we can create new sizes 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.790
 to show correctly adjusted the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.790
 images that we want from our 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.830
 store we can create any size and 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.370
 from here select the one that most 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.370
 interest 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.090
 the next option is we can dial 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.100
 the categories that we want that 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.140
 appear right now they are all 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.090
 marked with which I will see all the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.100
 products that I have the store to make 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.830
 click here to see all the products 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.900
 but if I'm only interested in seeing 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.900
 the gallery of the iphones 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.230
 update 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.870
 and clicking will only see the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.380
 products that you have inside that 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.380
 category 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.459
 let's continue with the next 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.459
 settings to redial all 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.880
 we can choose to show the menu by 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.170
 categories or show an image that 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.020
 can we load directly 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.220
 from here in this case it is this that is 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.080
 what we saw at the beginning that is 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.670
 completely configurable with us 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.670
 given we can upload any image 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.690
 if we want to show instead of an image 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.480
 the name of the categories 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.520
 we simply show you show us the 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.950
 name of categories press update 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.070
 and now instead of seeing instead of seeing this 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.070
 image 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.010
 let's see the name of the categories 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.709
 we are already seeing the categories that 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.690
 we want to show instead of in an image 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.870
 a single image that would take us all 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.560
 we distinguish them by 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.790
 his name is also possible to change 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.970
 these names to make them more 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.720
 descriptive and assign to each 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.180
 category a name so that the gallery 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.239
 will be much more descriptive for the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.049
 user last this module also 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.790
 brings the option of friendly urls to 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.730
 make it much easier to index 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.870
 by google images for it 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.940
 all we have to do is mark 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:55.030
 this chef box and copy this code 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.470
 now we will press to update and now what 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.500
 what we have to do is add these 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.470
 lines that we have copied to the htc for that 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.990
 we would go to generating tools 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.260
 and here we will paste this code 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.690
 and we could already generate the aces h and 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.940
 our image gallery module at 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.370
 open any image 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.829
 I would be with friendly url 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.330
 any of these products is already going to 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.330
 have your friendly url
