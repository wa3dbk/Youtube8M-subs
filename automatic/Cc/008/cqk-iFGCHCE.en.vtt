ridge that way she actually builds the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.490 
ridge that way she actually builds the
perfect<00:01:54.899> edge<00:01:55.579> shape<00:01:57.020> it's<00:01:58.020> gonna<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.289> much

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
perfect edge shape it's gonna be much

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.620 
perfect edge shape it's gonna be much
easier<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.520> file<00:01:59.909> into<00:02:00.180> shape<00:02:00.420> if<00:02:00.600> you

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
added it to the very top edge where she

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.540 
added it to the very top edge where she
needed<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.650> she's<00:02:10.650> just<00:02:10.710> gonna<00:02:10.890> make<00:02:11.160> sure<00:02:11.340> she
