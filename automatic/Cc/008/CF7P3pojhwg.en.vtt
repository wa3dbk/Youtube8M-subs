00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.139
 welcome to minecraft before starting 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.639
 But I have to get out of this trap 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.400
 hell that are created with 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.600
 same hands are surrounded by clipper 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.500
 handcuffs will be 56 and cows then 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.119

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.510

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.510
 I'm sorry I'm so sorry eh thanks wing 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:39.750
 then we create the bed and try to 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.350
 run away from this newspaper or bed post 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.140
 cazzano areas where it is or not you 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.340
 embrace finds this dies 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.649
 out all 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.559
 But first let's see , I can go there 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.539
 I'm fucking magical moments are known 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.180
 thyssen q we put it elected we come back ok 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.039
 from there in no just no 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.010
 let's talk about today's pod topic 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.570
 placement then hands forward like al 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.790
 usually before the risk varies 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.650
 various complaints 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.939
 if you do not agree then in the comments 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.750
 as usual I am in favor of 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.960
 placement 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.680
 yes i am not against this method of 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.020
 gain or sewn but let's talk a little 1 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.159
 youtuber but also in movies also in 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.409
 television there is this thing 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.280
 flab a product in this case can 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.950
 being a video game can be a card 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.820
 video processor however advertises a 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.549
 product behind profit or a home yes 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.130
 I have a home 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.570
 let us free lady johnny reasons why 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.090
 lately we hear a lot about it 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.490
 youtube and parrano also that of this 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.399
 product placement that they do that they are 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.990
 willing to do so or are favorable 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.600
 also for example I did ford 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.100
 placement with king then went as it is 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.000
 But I did it too 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.490
 I admit 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.770
 I am not ashamed we pass in the store of 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.720
 games you pass the games for free from 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.880
 download and where you get a percentage 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.340
 based on how many games you download stores 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.649
 of fifa credits for example there 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.830
 There are various ways to make this money 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.959
 and it's not a sin it's not wrong 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.570
 I think it's very important that 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.500
 we begin to bomb the writings 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.900
 of spam 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.330
 download the game download cation 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.670
 or type from each time he says look 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.260
 buy this movie on the product 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.989
 also produced on the products 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.270
 okay the problem is enough that it's done 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.070
 so show the product for that 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.070
 which is and not for what it can do 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.260
 believe but above all be sincere and 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.290
 transparent with writings try to 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.320
 do not care because many times that fetus 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.600
 sites are recommended at the limit 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.360
 of the lawyer in the sense of betting or 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.680
 dangerous sites because they can be 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.540
 misleading 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.550
 because I promise to find this 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.800
 character of this game on my site 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.989
 instead it is not so simple and one 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.209
 rip off so you have to be honest 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.180
 transparent because they are not okay not 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.000
 it is more advice taken the fact well but it is 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.549
 a rip off the scam I think it is 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.360
 a means of making profits between the 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.790
 tarallo youtube 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.400
 obviously you risk becoming like 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.750
 turn it there are youtubers who tend to 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.000
 seems to be that the situation 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.660
 because I explain you in the breaking TV series 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.810
 bad 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.910
 he has to find some money for the 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.799
 family because he wanted, however, provides a 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.079
 he earned that money at some point 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.480
 but it goes on or is always more than ever 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.880
 more because it doesn't end badly 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.620
 sometimes I'm noticing that some youtuber 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.720
 that I earn on youtube because 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.000
 let's say you can earn on youtube 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.180
 also live ie sent many of tube 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.299
 very famous very great tend to 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.690
 even more spam can be said in 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.549
 this case to sell off and liris titles 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.970
 youtuber that you sell yourself to lose the 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.880
 face 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.910
 because it's okay for us to make it right 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.980
 which makes the good one too risky 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.110
 more than making you lose money 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.080
 I heard a noise the credibility 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.030

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.480
