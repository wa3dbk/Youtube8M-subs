oily since since I started breaking out

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:29.639 
oily since since I started breaking out
that's<00:00:28.659> the<00:00:28.720> first<00:00:28.960> thing<00:00:29.109> that<00:00:29.259> I<00:00:29.289> noticed

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
that's the first thing that I noticed

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.200 
that's the first thing that I noticed
was<00:00:29.769> actually<00:00:30.069> he<00:00:30.130> just<00:00:30.310> got<00:00:30.519> really<00:00:30.729> oily<00:00:30.880> and

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
was actually he just got really oily and

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.420 
was actually he just got really oily and
then<00:00:31.329> the<00:00:32.020> Redcoats<00:00:32.439> came<00:00:32.710> shortly<00:00:33.100> after

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
then the Redcoats came shortly after

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.780 
then the Redcoats came shortly after
that<00:00:34.740> story<00:00:35.740> actually<00:00:36.100> seems<00:00:36.310> very<00:00:36.490> similar

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
that story actually seems very similar

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.560 
that story actually seems very similar
to<00:00:36.910> trigger<00:00:37.180> to<00:00:37.480> your<00:00:37.630> own<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:39.430> the<00:00:39.910> condition

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
to trigger to your own in the condition

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.130 
to trigger to your own in the condition
of<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.750> skin

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
of the skin

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.630 
of the skin
I<00:00:42.270> tried<00:00:43.270> basically<00:00:44.370> everything<00:00:45.370> all<00:00:45.520> the

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
I tried basically everything all the

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
antibiotic at 20 21 I believe was I

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.900 
antibiotic at 20 21 I believe was I
tried<00:00:52.720> accutane<00:00:53.140> which<00:00:53.860> did<00:00:54.340> work<00:00:55.470> initially

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
tried accutane which did work initially

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.819 
tried accutane which did work initially
worked<00:00:57.910> while<00:00:58.120> I<00:00:58.150> was<00:00:58.329> on<00:00:58.480> it<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.720> then<00:00:58.930> about

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
worked while I was on it and then about

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.440 
worked while I was on it and then about
six<00:01:00.160> months<00:01:00.430> after<00:01:00.550> I<00:01:00.730> got<00:01:00.850> off<00:01:01.030> at<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.329> oil

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
six months after I got off at the oil

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.880 
six months after I got off at the oil
started<00:01:02.110> coming<00:01:02.350> back<00:01:02.380> and<00:01:02.739> then<00:01:02.829> the

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
started coming back and then the

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.160 
started coming back and then the
breakouts<00:01:03.250> followed<00:01:03.820> shortly<00:01:04.659> after<00:01:05.049> that

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
breakouts followed shortly after that

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.789 
breakouts followed shortly after that
again<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.420> from<00:01:07.689> there<00:01:07.899> I<00:01:07.929> just<00:01:08.140> did<00:01:08.530> the

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
again so from there I just did the

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.200 
again so from there I just did the
topical<00:01:09.549> route<00:01:09.729> again<00:01:09.969> and<00:01:10.649> was<00:01:11.649> able<00:01:11.799> to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
topical route again and was able to

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.419 
topical route again and was able to
somewhat<00:01:13.210> control<00:01:13.569> it<00:01:13.749> pretty<00:01:14.619> good<00:01:14.679> by<00:01:15.219> using

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
somewhat control it pretty good by using

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.669 
somewhat control it pretty good by using
different<00:01:15.729> topicals<00:01:16.359> and<00:01:16.569> then<00:01:17.289> I<00:01:17.380> started

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
different topicals and then I started

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:21.149 
different topicals and then I started
using<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:18.189> acne<00:01:18.850> org<00:01:19.299> regimen

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
using the acne org regimen

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.899 
using the acne org regimen
I<00:01:21.219> think<00:01:21.819> I<00:01:21.909> was<00:01:21.999> about<00:01:22.139> 26<00:01:23.399> when<00:01:24.399> I<00:01:24.429> stay<00:01:24.850> on

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
I think I was about 26 when I stay on

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.660 
I think I was about 26 when I stay on
that<00:01:25.119> started<00:01:26.109> using<00:01:26.259> that<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:27.249> actually

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
that started using that that actually

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.969 
that started using that that actually
worked<00:01:28.149> pretty<00:01:28.270> well<00:01:28.689> for<00:01:28.749> me<00:01:29.049> my<00:01:29.259> skin<00:01:29.679> seems

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
worked pretty well for me my skin seems

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.789 
worked pretty well for me my skin seems
to<00:01:30.219> respond<00:01:30.670> quite<00:01:31.600> well<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:32.079> benzoyl

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
to respond quite well to benzoyl

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.849 
to respond quite well to benzoyl
peroxide<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.630> I've<00:01:34.840> been<00:01:35.200> using<00:01:35.409> that<00:01:35.590> ever

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:35.859 
peroxide so I've been using that ever

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:37.999 
peroxide so I've been using that ever
since<00:01:36.189> and<00:01:36.639> it's<00:01:36.759> been<00:01:36.880> controlling<00:01:37.600> it

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
since and it's been controlling it

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.690 
since and it's been controlling it
pretty<00:01:39.009> well<00:01:39.189> probably<00:01:39.729> 95<00:01:41.249> greater<00:01:42.249> percent

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
pretty well probably 95 greater percent

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.849 
pretty well probably 95 greater percent

still not overly dry so I was supposed
to<00:02:40.330> get<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.470> dose<00:02:41.620> increased<00:02:42.130> in<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.180> next

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
to get the dose increased in the next

to get the dose increased in the next
few<00:02:43.540> days<00:02:43.720> here<00:02:44.110> but<00:02:45.660> when<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.690> think<00:02:46.810> I'd

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
few days here but when I think I'd

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.400 
few days here but when I think I'd
rather<00:02:47.380> do<00:02:47.620> was<00:02:47.860> start<00:02:48.490> on<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.180> bootcamp<00:02:49.540> and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
rather do was start on the bootcamp and

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.920 
rather do was start on the bootcamp and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
do that topical route and just keep a

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.370 
do that topical route and just keep a
low<00:02:53.140> dose<00:02:53.350> of<00:02:53.530> accutane<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.780> holy<00:02:55.780> both<00:02:56.050> work

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
low dose of accutane and holy both work

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.010 
low dose of accutane and holy both work
well<00:02:56.650> together<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.340> then<00:02:57.660> eventually<00:02:58.660> come

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.830 
I guess it's kind of part of my
personality<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.610> that's<00:03:48.610> so<00:03:49.209> like<00:03:49.329> I<00:03:49.480> said<00:03:49.540> the

personality so that's so like I said the

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.440 
personality so that's so like I said the
big<00:03:50.019> thing<00:03:50.290> for<00:03:50.500> me<00:03:50.560> is<00:03:50.829> it's<00:03:51.280> just<00:03:51.730> feels<00:03:52.239> like

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
big thing for me is it's just feels like

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.319 
big thing for me is it's just feels like
a<00:03:52.510> loss<00:03:52.750> of<00:03:52.930> control<00:03:53.140> it's<00:03:54.130> one<00:03:54.400> thing<00:03:54.579> I<00:03:54.760> can't

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329
