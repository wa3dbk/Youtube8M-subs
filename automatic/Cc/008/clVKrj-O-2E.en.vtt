going to hold off on the police theme
loadouts<00:00:33.120> until<00:00:33.480> hardline<00:00:33.930> comes<00:00:34.200> out<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:34.920> i

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
loadouts until hardline comes out but i

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.680 
loadouts until hardline comes out but i
was<00:00:35.190> still<00:00:35.340> really<00:00:35.670> keen<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.090> try<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.360> gun

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
was still really keen to try this gun

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.780 
was still really keen to try this gun
out<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.350> figured<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.980> hell<00:00:38.280> I'll<00:00:38.579> just

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
out so I figured what the hell I'll just

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.940 
out so I figured what the hell I'll just
make<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.000> weapon<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> week<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:40.680> anyway

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
make it weapon of the week but anyway

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.799 
make it weapon of the week but anyway
when<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> say<00:00:41.489> modular<00:00:42.000> assault<00:00:42.329> rifle<00:00:42.690> what

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
when I say modular assault rifle what

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.450 
when I say modular assault rifle what
I'm<00:00:42.930> talking<00:00:43.290> about<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> ability<00:00:44.129> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
I'm talking about is the ability to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.520 
I'm talking about is the ability to
quickly<00:00:44.640> change<00:00:45.030> barrels<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.719> other<00:00:46.050> parts

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
quickly change barrels and other parts

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.619 
quickly change barrels and other parts
to<00:00:46.680> suit<00:00:46.890> different<00:00:47.100> missions<00:00:47.760> quite<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> few

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
to suit different missions quite a few

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.450 
to suit different missions quite a few
other<00:00:49.020> weapon<00:00:49.350> platforms<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.219> ability

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
other weapon platforms have this ability

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.910 
other weapon platforms have this ability
but<00:00:51.030> very<00:00:51.300> few<00:00:51.570> inactive<00:00:52.199> servers<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
but very few inactive servers have the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040 
but very few inactive servers have the
ability<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.309> use<00:00:53.640> both<00:00:53.850> NATO<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.539> Russian

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050

countries and it only made sense that

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.229 
countries and it only made sense that
their<00:01:01.829> standard<00:01:02.280> assault<00:01:02.550> rifle<00:01:02.940> should<00:01:03.120> be

Special Forces units often use captured

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.260 
Special Forces units often use captured
enemy<00:01:07.799> weapons<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.369> avoid<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.850> sound<00:01:09.090> of

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
enemy weapons to avoid the sound of

their own ammunition drawing suspicion

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.950 
their own ammunition drawing suspicion
and<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.700> benefit<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.270> modular<00:01:12.659> weapon

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
and the benefit of a modular weapon

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.420 
and the benefit of a modular weapon
system<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:14.040> use<00:01:14.100> your

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
system is that you can just use your

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.179 
system is that you can just use your
enemies<00:01:14.729> ammo<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.420> own<00:01:15.540> gun<00:01:15.860> now<00:01:16.860> this

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
enemies ammo in your own gun now this

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.070 
enemies ammo in your own gun now this
modularity<00:01:17.790> unfortunately<00:01:18.570> doesn't<00:01:18.780> make<00:01:19.049> a

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
almost exclusively I don't know what it

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.789 
almost exclusively I don't know what it
is<00:02:00.299> about<00:02:00.509> burst<00:02:00.930> fire<00:02:01.200> weapons<00:02:01.560> but<00:02:01.710> they

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
is about burst fire weapons but they

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.530 
is about burst fire weapons but they
just<00:02:01.950> seem<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.340> consistent<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.299> feel

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
just seem to be consistent and I feel

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.090 
just seem to be consistent and I feel
like<00:02:03.689> they<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.020> little<00:02:04.259> better<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.710> mid<00:02:04.950> to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
like they do a little better and mid to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.069 
like they do a little better and mid to
long<00:02:05.219> range<00:02:05.520> if<00:02:06.270> you're<00:02:06.509> someone<00:02:06.780> who<00:02:06.930> can

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
long range if you're someone who can

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.839 
long range if you're someone who can
time<00:02:07.229> your<00:02:07.409> trigger<00:02:07.619> pulls<00:02:07.860> perfectly<00:02:08.429> then

this<00:02:09.000> mode<00:02:09.209> might<00:02:09.509> not<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> huge<00:02:10.170> benefit

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
this mode might not be a huge benefit

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.229 
this mode might not be a huge benefit
but<00:02:10.770> if<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.979> like<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.400> consists<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.819> recoil

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239

but if you like and consists of recoil
pattern<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.989> transfers

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.970 
pattern the transfers
easily<00:02:14.150> into<00:02:14.390> muscle<00:02:14.720> memory<00:02:14.900> then<00:02:15.380> burst<00:02:15.740> by

is<00:02:16.250> definitely<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.880> way<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.030> go<00:02:17.210> I<00:02:17.720> still

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
is definitely the way to go I still

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.170 
is definitely the way to go I still
wouldn't<00:02:18.620> say<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.130> cz<00:02:19.550> is<00:02:19.790> better<00:02:20.030> than

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
wouldn't say that the cz is better than

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.180 
wouldn't say that the cz is better than
the<00:02:20.300> AI<00:02:20.510> 160<00:02:21.260> but<00:02:21.440> it's<00:02:21.560> definitely<00:02:21.770> better

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
the AI 160 but it's definitely better

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.670 
the AI 160 but it's definitely better
than<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.550> much<00:02:22.700> more<00:02:22.910> popular<00:02:23.150> or<00:02:23.540> gate<00:02:23.810> 3<00:02:24.170> so

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
than the much more popular or gate 3 so

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.440 
than the much more popular or gate 3 so
in<00:02:25.010> my<00:02:25.160> opinion<00:02:25.310> it's<00:02:25.790> definitely<00:02:26.270> worth

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
in my opinion it's definitely worth

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.230 
in my opinion it's definitely worth

I'm running with the Russian pkas holo

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
sight the heavy barrel laser light combo

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.740 
sight the heavy barrel laser light combo
and<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.830> ogo<00:02:37.310> grip<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:37.820> should<00:02:38.330> mention<00:02:38.540> that

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
and the ogo grip I should mention that

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.540

he did originally suggest the standard

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
barrel but the heavy barrel still looks

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.540 
barrel but the heavy barrel still looks
the<00:02:42.440> same<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:42.980> think<00:02:43.160> it's<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.370> nice

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
the same and I think it's a nice

common with the u.s. holo sight so I

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.950 
common with the u.s. holo sight so I
didn't<00:02:52.460> really<00:02:52.580> have<00:02:52.850> too<00:02:53.060> many<00:02:53.210> issues<00:02:53.630> here

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.870 
didn't really have too many issues here
I<00:02:54.260> think<00:02:54.770> if<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:54.980> was<00:02:55.130> trying<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.430> get<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.670> best

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
I think if I was trying to get the best

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.430 
I think if I was trying to get the best
performance<00:02:56.060> out<00:02:56.510> of<00:02:56.570> this<00:02:56.780> gun<00:02:56.990> though<00:02:57.230> I

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
performance out of this gun though I

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.780 
performance out of this gun though I
would<00:02:57.740> have<00:02:57.800> just<00:02:57.860> run<00:02:58.130> with<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.430> standard

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
would have just run with the standard

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.580 
would have just run with the standard
laser<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.270> I<00:02:59.300> could<00:02:59.540> turn<00:02:59.690> it<00:02:59.870> off<00:02:59.990> and<00:03:00.230> maybe

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
laser so I could turn it off and maybe

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.590 
laser so I could turn it off and maybe
even<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.190> angled<00:03:01.610> grip<00:03:01.610> to<00:03:01.910> control<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.390> kick

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
even the angled grip to control the kick

in burst fire mode all in all though the
cz<00:03:05.390> 805<00:03:06.110> is<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.410> decent<00:03:06.740> gun<00:03:07.100> for<00:03:07.340> mid-range<00:03:07.490> but

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
cz 805 is a decent gun for mid-range but

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.910 
cz 805 is a decent gun for mid-range but
it<00:03:08.540> will<00:03:08.750> tend<00:03:08.990> to<00:03:09.080> let<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:09.350> down<00:03:09.530> in<00:03:09.740> close

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920

it will tend to let you down in close
quarters<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.430> like<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.820> said<00:03:10.880> before<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.480> AR

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
quarters and like I said before the AR

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.230 
quarters and like I said before the AR
160<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:12.590> probably<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.070> better<00:03:13.280> choice<00:03:13.400> in<00:03:13.640> every

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
160 is probably a better choice in every

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.960 
160 is probably a better choice in every
respect<00:03:14.440> for<00:03:15.440> burst<00:03:15.680> fire<00:03:15.980> alone<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.490> ak-12

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
respect for burst fire alone the ak-12

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.420 
respect for burst fire alone the ak-12
is<00:03:17.360> probably<00:03:17.750> also<00:03:18.050> a<00:03:18.290> better<00:03:18.500> choice<00:03:18.770> because

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
is probably also a better choice because

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.250 
is probably also a better choice because
it<00:03:19.520> gets<00:03:19.670> above<00:03:19.940> towards<00:03:20.270> RPM<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:20.900> this<00:03:21.020> mode

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
it gets above towards RPM in this mode

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.500 
it gets above towards RPM in this mode
but<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:21.860> cz<00:03:22.100> is<00:03:22.490> probably<00:03:22.880> still<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.360> better

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
but the cz is probably still a better

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.420 
but the cz is probably still a better
all-around<00:03:23.810> weapon<00:03:24.230> there's<00:03:25.220> something

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
all-around weapon there's something

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.190 
all-around weapon there's something
about<00:03:25.640> this<00:03:25.970> gun<00:03:26.210> that<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:26.420> just<00:03:26.660> like<00:03:26.900> though

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
about this gun that I just like though

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.200 
about this gun that I just like though
I'm<00:03:27.650> not<00:03:27.710> sure<00:03:28.040> why<00:03:28.310> but<00:03:28.550> I<00:03:28.640> don't<00:03:28.790> tend<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.120> get

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
I'm not sure why but I don't tend to get

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.880 
I'm not sure why but I don't tend to get
frustrated<00:03:29.900> with<00:03:30.020> it<00:03:30.200> like<00:03:30.350> I<00:03:30.380> do<00:03:30.590> similar

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
frustrated with it like I do similar

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.190 
frustrated with it like I do similar
weapons<00:03:31.340> like<00:03:31.550> the<00:03:31.670> org<00:03:31.970> it<00:03:32.630> just<00:03:32.840> goes<00:03:32.990> to

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
weapons like the org it just goes to

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.900 
weapons like the org it just goes to
show<00:03:33.230> that<00:03:33.380> starts<00:03:33.950> alone<00:03:34.220> aren't<00:03:34.520> the<00:03:34.700> only

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
show that starts alone aren't the only

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.090 
show that starts alone aren't the only
thing<00:03:35.300> that<00:03:35.420> makes<00:03:35.570> a<00:03:35.720> gun<00:03:35.900> good<00:03:36.200> so<00:03:36.680> if<00:03:36.980> you
