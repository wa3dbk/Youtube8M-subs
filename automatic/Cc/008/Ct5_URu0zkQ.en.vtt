 the megane I have not bought any 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.760
 package give them there was a shock and then at 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.489
 start is not so profitable but right now 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.020
 that the last change that was made 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.390
 that left us all zero goes 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.700
 This is highly recommended to buy it 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.200
 right now since you can to most of 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.290
 user will be buying up a 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.200
 maximum of 5 dollars allowed and allowed 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.540
 Well, this package is going to receive several 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.510
 earnings 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.150
 I have some friends who used it as 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.050
 I said they bought it from the day 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.660
 10 that was when the change was made and 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.620
 well enough income has been generated 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.440
 they have already doubled they arrive like 27 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.090
 dollars although remember that for 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.090
 we remain of profit we also have 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.270
 to have bat points 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:55.469
 I already bought preschoolers in 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.130
 points will reach 31,000 as this is 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:01.829
 what I would process as I saw them 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.880
 announcements of this day is that he stayed in 29 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.119
 thousand 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.300
 who do a rough calculation would be 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:15.849
 around 12 or 13 dollars that 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:18.970
 I have bat points and as many have 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:22.930
 been buying what is this so that 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.060
 I ended up losing eight thousand 223 88 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.660
 users have bought it 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.910
 and then I do not tell you now you can 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.910
 buy up to a total of 5 dollars 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.980
 this package would be the most recommended 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.610
 if you want to invest in what 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.790
 They are packages right now, nobody is going 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:49.220
 to spend more than 50 dollars since then 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:52.870
 it's not allowed so we're going to see 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.390
 how is the purchase we are going to give 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.950
 select the payment method I will 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.290
 do with my green country balance 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:06.470
 and then remember that this is going to 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:10.040
 give 1% of all purchases and we have 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.550
 that is 168 hours that will be the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.240
 active time this package and if not 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.910
 we manage up to 3 dollars 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.280
 let's go out to the plan a little bit 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.350
 this time but the goal is not 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.120
 get back to our area 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.400
 we would be losing remember I know what 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.150
 moment class this package is give new 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.210
 to traditional because we already 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.480
 activate them I would have to have 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.569
 to get more or less 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.230
 to big 78 dollars for this 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:47.230
 package be profitable if they are not 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.180

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.650
