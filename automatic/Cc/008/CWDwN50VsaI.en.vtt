00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.899 
rusted up put some oil on it let it sit
it<00:02:18.870> penetrates<00:02:19.379> in<00:02:19.560> there<00:02:19.769> separates<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.640> the

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
it penetrates in there separates the the

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.089 
it penetrates in there separates the the
metal<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.599> then<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:21.900> go<00:02:22.019> back<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.560> get

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
metal and then you can go back and get

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.729 
metal and then you can go back and get
the<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.459> screw<00:02:23.730> out<00:02:23.760> or<00:02:24.090> remove<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.959> metal<00:02:25.140> so

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
the the screw out or remove the metal so

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.330 
the the screw out or remove the metal so
you<00:02:25.830> got<00:02:25.980> sites<00:02:26.340> there's<00:02:27.120> talk<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:28.590> famous<00:02:28.950> XD

to to move in harmony along with that
it's<00:02:49.470> also<00:02:49.650> used<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.489> force<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.720> feel<00:02:52.349> free<00:02:52.379> to

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
it's also used in force so feel free to

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.819 
it's also used in force so feel free to
use<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.099> JB<00:02:53.430> Boer<00:02:53.609> compound<00:02:54.150> use<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> patch<00:02:55.560> so

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
use the JB Boer compound use a patch so

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.449 
use the JB Boer compound use a patch so
clove<00:02:56.280> get<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:57.030> majority<00:02:57.629> of<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.959> crud<00:02:58.170> out

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
clove get the majority of the crud out

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.220 
clove get the majority of the crud out
and<00:02:59.459> then<00:02:59.970> following<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.750> JB<00:03:01.049> blower

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
and then following the JB blower

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.229 
and then following the JB blower
compound<00:03:01.799> you<00:03:02.459> pass<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.849> through<00:03:02.879> with<00:03:03.120> some

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
compound you pass it through with some

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.199 
compound you pass it through with some
coil<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:04.650> will<00:03:04.799> protect<00:03:05.150> basically<00:03:06.150> a

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
coil and this will protect basically a

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.080 
coil and this will protect basically a
little<00:03:06.420> preserve<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.079> prevent<00:03:07.379> rust<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.489> this

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
little preserve and prevent rust so this

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.240 
little preserve and prevent rust so this
isn't<00:03:09.269> a<00:03:09.540> penetrating<00:03:10.170> oil<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.129> to

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
isn't a penetrating oil that you have to

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.729 
isn't a penetrating oil that you have to
worry<00:03:11.400> about<00:03:11.519> leave<00:03:11.819> it<00:03:11.940> on<00:03:12.319> that's<00:03:13.319> gonna<00:03:13.470> dry

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
worry about leave it on that's gonna dry

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.280 
worry about leave it on that's gonna dry
out<00:03:13.769> your<00:03:14.190> your<00:03:14.609> metals<00:03:14.940> or<00:03:15.359> destroy<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.200> in

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
out your your metals or destroy you in

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.000 
out your your metals or destroy you in
plastics<00:03:16.799> under<00:03:17.010> your<00:03:17.129> gun<00:03:17.930> use<00:03:18.930> this<00:03:19.169> it's

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
plastics under your gun use this it's

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.500 
plastics under your gun use this it's
it's<00:03:20.639> going<00:03:20.819> to<00:03:20.880> be<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.000> nice<00:03:21.209> rust

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510
