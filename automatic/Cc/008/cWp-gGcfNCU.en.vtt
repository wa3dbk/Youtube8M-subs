00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.210
 we are going to dispute the first cup of the king 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.500
 the first game so really not 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.680
 I really want to be there because 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.660
 Really 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.920
 we have the opportunity as well as the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.510
 other teams win but as in 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.210
 all equipment and in all countries 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.570
 and in all the leagues of the world the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.160
 priority first and foremost is the league first 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.770
 win the league 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.420
 and the second place also be in 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.580
 Europe 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:15.090
 and really try not to be him down 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.800
 not that they do not eliminate you and then the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.320
 position that we have in the league is not the 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.149
 that we wish we wish you have but 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.420
 I would really love to win the cup 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.420
 King 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:36.920
 I give importance to the contests 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.820
 contests are there to win 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.200
 but also and then what we have 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.240
 to do everything possible to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.090
 remain in the high positions of the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.630
 league and stay in the league this is 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.020
 our coast of everything possible to 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.420
 win the cup 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.600
 it's straw and chic for this and if it gave 200 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.250
 but I have to see from the others 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.380
 players I have to give them a 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:08.080
 opportunity for you to show me your 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:10.830
 all skills are players how 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.440
 shin hyung-min first but also 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.670
 we will choose players from subsidiary two 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.060
 speakers are two games at home and 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.470
 outside of his team he ratified week is but 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.599
 it's also about a week 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.180
 complicated three parties in which 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:32.440
 radio week you listen so we will try 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.510
 set priorities and really 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.420
 book good players for the 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.790
 Sunday not one of his heroes 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.500
 not necessarily Indian Ski 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.900
 afraid if a guy is earl this 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.390
 party without disease the pro 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.579
 possibility of seeing him blue and I have not 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.060
 I am seen have told me it's a little young 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:54.480
 good goalkeeper so I'm looking forward to 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.480
 watch him play 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:05.360
 and I do not know the team I know some 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.590
 of the players have been training 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.120
 with me 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.120
 James two three or four times 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.970
 but I have not seen them play their team 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.790
 we are number one a match so it is 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.190
 a good opportunity for them 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.660
 listen and change and if I owe but for 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.530
 course I 'm going to have 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:31.630
 time to see everyone and so that I 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:36.350
 can understand and really get to 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:40.010
 appreciate the level at which they are and if 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.000
 I've been watching videos I've been watching 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.330
 to the players 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.830
 I tried to collect the maximum number 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:51.710
 of information I really know it's a 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:55.220
 Experienced team but I 'll do it again 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.920
 to say and then repeat your priority is 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.730
 of course I am and I am convinced is 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.730
 go up
