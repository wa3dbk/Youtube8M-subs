these things you know I think we're more

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:55.869 
these things you know I think we're more
like<00:04:53.930> a<00:04:53.979> distant<00:04:54.979> observer<00:04:55.129> co-main

00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:55.879 
like a distant observer co-main

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.519 
like a distant observer co-main
commenting<00:04:56.719> on<00:04:56.870> it<00:04:56.990> base<00:04:57.169> bait<00:04:57.379> you<00:04:57.469> know

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:57.529 
commenting on it base bait you know

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.350 
commenting on it base bait you know
especially<00:04:57.740> because<00:04:58.009> we're<00:04:58.340> we're<00:04:59.180> not

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
especially because we're we're not

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.119 
especially because we're we're not
really<00:04:59.509> living<00:04:59.719> in<00:04:59.960> a<00:04:59.990> I'm<00:05:00.650> not<00:05:00.800> really<00:05:01.039> living

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:01.129 
really living in a I'm not really living

in England much so when I'm outside of

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.360 
in England much so when I'm outside of
England<00:05:02.569> I<00:05:02.810> see<00:05:03.020> it<00:05:03.139> through<00:05:03.409> like<00:05:03.590> a<00:05:03.620> through

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
England I see it through like a through

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.550 
England I see it through like a through
a<00:05:04.400> distorted<00:05:04.819> version<00:05:05.120> of<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.539> newspapers<00:05:06.289> or

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
a distorted version of the newspapers or

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.019 
a distorted version of the newspapers or
through<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.889> news<00:05:07.370> you<00:05:07.550> know<00:05:07.639> so<00:05:07.789> I'm<00:05:07.849> seeing

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:08.029 
through the news you know so I'm seeing

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:09.670 
through the news you know so I'm seeing
like<00:05:08.210> a<00:05:08.240> slightly<00:05:08.689> distorted<00:05:09.110> version<00:05:09.469> of

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
like a slightly distorted version of

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.260 
like a slightly distorted version of
reality<00:05:09.800> so<00:05:10.189> I'm<00:05:10.550> sort<00:05:10.819> of<00:05:10.849> singing<00:05:11.090> about

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
reality so I'm sort of singing about

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.570 
reality so I'm sort of singing about
this<00:05:11.590> but<00:05:12.590> I<00:05:12.620> think<00:05:13.009> I<00:05:13.069> think<00:05:13.219> I<00:05:13.310> think<00:05:13.460> there's

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
this but I think I think I think there's

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.369 
this but I think I think I think there's
a<00:05:13.639> duty<00:05:13.849> what's<00:05:14.300> not<00:05:14.419> duty<00:05:14.779> but<00:05:14.990> if<00:05:15.110> you<00:05:15.199> want

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:15.379 
a duty what's not duty but if you want

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:16.659 
a duty what's not duty but if you want
to<00:05:15.529> it's<00:05:15.680> good<00:05:15.860> to<00:05:16.009> express<00:05:16.460> your<00:05:16.639> own

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
to it's good to express your own

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.610 
to it's good to express your own
feelings<00:05:16.759> in<00:05:17.330> your<00:05:17.479> music<00:05:17.750> you<00:05:17.870> know<00:05:17.990> your<00:05:18.500> own

anything like that it's just it's just

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.010 
anything like that it's just it's just
expressing<00:05:27.740> how<00:05:27.860> we<00:05:27.919> feel<00:05:28.250> and<00:05:28.779> but<00:05:29.779> we<00:05:29.900> are

self-expression they probably really

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:41.739 
self-expression they probably really
ties<00:05:38.960> in<00:05:39.169> to<00:05:39.379> the<00:05:40.189> general<00:05:40.610> feeling<00:05:40.879> of<00:05:41.180> a<00:05:41.419> lot
