those baffles really really wide at

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.010 
those baffles really really wide at
about<00:00:43.059> 3000<00:00:43.570> rpm<00:00:44.610> let's<00:00:45.610> just<00:00:45.820> see

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.290 

these<00:00:49.590> cars<00:00:49.830> are<00:00:50.010> really<00:00:50.040> fun<00:00:50.490> it's<00:00:50.850> raining

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
these cars are really fun it's raining

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.990 
these cars are really fun it's raining
it's<00:00:51.420> really<00:00:51.660> slick<00:00:51.960> out<00:00:52.140> um<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
it's really slick out um and the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.670 
it's really slick out um and the
traction<00:00:54.390> control<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.720> on<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.200> mean<00:00:55.350> everything

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
traction control is on I mean everything

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.970 
traction control is on I mean everything
is<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.980> right<00:00:56.220> now<00:00:56.750> but<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.990> the<00:00:58.260> Camaro<00:00:58.680> even

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
is on right now but the the Camaro even

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.979 
is on right now but the the Camaro even
in<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.190> v6<00:00:59.580> RS<00:00:59.850> model<00:01:00.150> has<00:01:00.330> so<00:01:00.630> much<00:01:00.750> power

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
in this v6 RS model has so much power

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.410 
in this v6 RS model has so much power
that<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.560> can<00:01:02.040> momentarily<00:01:02.520> overwhelm<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
that it can momentarily overwhelm the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.360 
that it can momentarily overwhelm the
traction<00:01:03.810> systems<00:01:04.260> but<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.949> know<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.250> about

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
traction systems but you know it's about

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.730 
traction systems but you know it's about
it's<00:01:05.820> about<00:01:05.910> a<00:01:06.090> two-second<00:01:06.900> thing<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.260> you

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
it's about a two-second thing of you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.800 
it's about a two-second thing of you
know<00:01:07.770> well<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.670> know<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.910> tail<00:01:09.120> snaps<00:01:09.300> out

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
know well you know the tail snaps out

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.050 
know well you know the tail snaps out
but<00:01:10.229> then<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.500> all<00:01:10.650> steps<00:01:11.400> right<00:01:11.670> back<00:01:11.850> into

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
but then it all steps right back into

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.630 
but then it all steps right back into
place<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.710> that's<00:01:13.710> really<00:01:13.950> speaks<00:01:14.370> to<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
place and that's really speaks to the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:33.250 
place and that's really speaks to the
sophistication<00:01:15.479> of

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.450 

pretty<00:01:34.260> nice<00:01:34.410> so<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.070> basing<00:01:35.370> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
pretty nice so it's basing the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.830 
pretty nice so it's basing the
sophistication<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.330> performance

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
sophistication of the performance

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.290 
sophistication of the performance
traction<00:01:37.050> management<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:38.430> also<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.030> you

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
traction management and also the you

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.810 
traction management and also the you
know<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.480> grip<00:01:39.750> setup<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.670> tires<00:01:41.670> that

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
know the grip setup on the tires that

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.960 
know the grip setup on the tires that
are<00:01:42.000> coming<00:01:42.330> on<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.570> RS<00:01:42.960> Camaro<00:01:43.320> v6<00:01:43.970> because

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
are coming on this RS Camaro v6 because

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.790 
are coming on this RS Camaro v6 because
obviously<00:01:45.150> it<00:01:45.570> might<00:01:45.960> have<00:01:46.080> been<00:01:46.200> tempting<00:01:46.590> to

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
obviously it might have been tempting to

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.820 
obviously it might have been tempting to
put<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.190> some<00:01:47.370> it<00:01:47.520> some<00:01:47.790> eco<00:01:48.060> tires<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.080> RS

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
put on some it some eco tires but the RS

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.770 
put on some it some eco tires but the RS
package<00:01:50.160> really<00:01:50.340> does<00:01:50.610> bring<00:01:50.940> a<00:01:51.210> lot<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
package really does bring a lot of the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.650 
package really does bring a lot of the
performance<00:01:52.200> benefits<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.860> are<00:01:53.660> so

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
performance benefits that are so

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.140 
performance benefits that are so
instrumental<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.350> making<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:55.710> zl1<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.190> z28<00:01:56.670> so

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
instrumental to making the zl1 a z28 so

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.510 
instrumental to making the zl1 a z28 so
fast<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.440> know<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> day<00:01:58.800> like<00:01:58.950> today<00:01:59.009> it

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
fast and you know a day like today it

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.070 
fast and you know a day like today it
kinda<00:01:59.790> reminds<00:02:00.030> me<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.330> video<00:02:00.540> from<00:02:00.840> last

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
kinda reminds me of the video from last

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.040 
kinda reminds me of the video from last
night<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.860> Camaro<00:02:02.280> z28<00:02:02.940> on<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
night of the Camaro z28 on the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.690 
night of the Camaro z28 on the
Nurburgring<00:02:04.560> where<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.890> literally<00:02:05.310> starts

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
Nurburgring where it literally starts

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.820 
Nurburgring where it literally starts
pouring<00:02:06.030> rain<00:02:06.420> at<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.690> end<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.619> poor

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
pouring rain at the end and the poor

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.499 
pouring rain at the end and the poor
driver<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.459> know<00:02:08.580> has<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.850> wipers<00:02:09.179> on<00:02:09.330> like

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
driver you know has the wipers on like

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.940 
driver you know has the wipers on like
this<00:02:09.690> but<00:02:09.929> they're<00:02:10.080> flapping<00:02:10.590> against<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
this but they're flapping against the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.070 
this but they're flapping against the
windshield<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.610> know<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.540> way<00:02:12.660> wipers

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
windshield you know that the way wipers

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.930 
windshield you know that the way wipers
like<00:02:13.260> lift<00:02:13.530> off<00:02:13.740> sometimes<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.400> high<00:02:14.520> speeds

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
like lift off sometimes in high speeds

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.130 
like lift off sometimes in high speeds
and<00:02:16.940> definitely<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.450> driver<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:18.989> video

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
and definitely the driver of that video

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.250 
and definitely the driver of that video
who<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.500> think<00:02:19.830> was<00:02:19.920> Sabine<00:02:20.280> Schmitt<00:02:20.610> but<00:02:21.260> no

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
who I think was Sabine Schmitt but no

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.740 
who I think was Sabine Schmitt but no
