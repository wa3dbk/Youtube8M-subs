 and yes torn it up 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.759
 really the right decision is 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.420
 or not because you will be the limelight 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.420
 already missing 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.620
 a music that immediately goes to the blood 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.740
 makes you dance with and 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.330
 Dancing is the keyword for all 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.030

 fox tango as a classical dance and out 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.600
 all these elements are used by the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.100
 music to the bunch extremely great hand 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.480
 with new fresh melodies the gar 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.150
 do not suspect that the musical 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.510
 actually only been composed in 2006 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.510
 is 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.370
 the dance styles I used in the 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.200
 Pieces are famous steps out of the 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.250
 time, for example, missed that 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.120
 district everything very energetic and 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.640
 very sexy 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.280
 if alcohol drinks feel at that time 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.900
 Gave up before the bad crash and I have 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.150
 then it really tries a week 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.780
 to do justice to the piece so on 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.780
 the table 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.099

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.739
 time for the mask it was the make up 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.720

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.160
 shape or the water wave wall very much 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:32.250
 crucial for this 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:35.160
 time the man in the chair is the narrator 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.739
