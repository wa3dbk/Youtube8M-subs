because<00:05:01.280> it's<00:05:02.030> just<00:05:02.180> very<00:05:02.300> clever<00:05:02.690> very<00:05:02.960> witty

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
because it's just very clever very witty

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.460 
because it's just very clever very witty
so<00:05:03.620> like<00:05:04.190> I<00:05:04.340> said<00:05:04.400> I<00:05:04.880> enjoyed<00:05:05.360> this<00:05:05.990> short<00:05:06.350> I

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
so like I said I enjoyed this short I

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.840 
so like I said I enjoyed this short I
sort<00:05:06.680> of<00:05:06.770> sat<00:05:06.950> there<00:05:07.190> and<00:05:07.220> I<00:05:07.370> took<00:05:07.550> it<00:05:07.670> in<00:05:07.820> and

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
sort of sat there and I took it in and

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.370 
sort of sat there and I took it in and
then<00:05:08.180> it<00:05:08.210> was<00:05:08.390> over<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:08.720> I<00:05:08.960> didn't<00:05:09.200> think<00:05:09.290> much

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
then it was over and I didn't think much

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.480 
then it was over and I didn't think much
of<00:05:09.530> it<00:05:09.680> since<00:05:09.950> um<00:05:11.860> that's<00:05:12.860> not<00:05:13.010> a<00:05:13.070> good<00:05:13.250> sign

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
of it since um that's not a good sign

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.580 
of it since um that's not a good sign
for<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.760> Pixar<00:05:14.090> short<00:05:14.360> I'm<00:05:14.900> just<00:05:15.290> saying

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
for a Pixar short I'm just saying

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.810 
for a Pixar short I'm just saying
and<00:05:15.680> there<00:05:16.190> was<00:05:16.310> nothing<00:05:16.460> revolutionary

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
and there was nothing revolutionary

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.690 
and there was nothing revolutionary
about<00:05:17.780> this<00:05:17.960> short<00:05:18.230> so<00:05:18.470> I<00:05:18.500> have<00:05:18.830> no<00:05:19.100> doubt<00:05:19.130> that

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
about this short so I have no doubt that

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.240 
about this short so I have no doubt that
it's<00:05:19.880> not<00:05:20.210> going<00:05:20.780> to<00:05:21.140> get<00:05:21.260> nominated<00:05:21.770> for<00:05:21.980> an

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
it's not going to get nominated for an

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.880 
it's not going to get nominated for an
Academy<00:05:22.700> Award<00:05:22.730> but<00:05:23.390> we<00:05:23.780> do<00:05:23.900> have<00:05:24.080> a<00:05:24.140> toy<00:05:24.500> story

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
Academy Award but we do have a toy story

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.620 
Academy Award but we do have a toy story
short<00:05:25.280> that's<00:05:25.520> being<00:05:25.669> released<00:05:26.000> in<00:05:26.180> December

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
short that's being released in December

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.330 
short that's being released in December
and<00:05:26.900> so<00:05:27.260> maybe<00:05:27.560> that<00:05:27.770> one<00:05:27.890> will<00:05:28.010> be<00:05:28.100> really

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
and so maybe that one will be really

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.500 
and so maybe that one will be really
good<00:05:28.490> cuz<00:05:28.730> I'm<00:05:28.820> really<00:05:29.060> excited<00:05:29.240> and

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510
