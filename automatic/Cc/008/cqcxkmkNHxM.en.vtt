 new deluxe version both models out there 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.470
 It has been around for a few years now 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.480
 Market and they are extremely successful 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.120
 which, of course, a very good one 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.530
 price performance ratio is now 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.960
 have they been reworked that is 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.239
 you have taken something good and still 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.280
 a little bit better the sound 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.260
 So it was optimized again and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.750

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.640
 So visually and from the sound 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.399
 a real highlight but over the sound 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.530
 Talking is the one thing I would say 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.530
 now listen to us for example 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:26.010

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.660

 Supply voltage can be operated 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.710

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.950
 they are very much like acoustic instruments 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.840

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.020
