00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.930
 Yes 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.860
 Hello everyone, sirius from oleg vlog 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.219
 and we will talk again today 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.810
 fakes and you know it seems to me that 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.000
 it was necessary to give a slightly different name 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.539
 brick show or something else in it 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.580
 kind of but what gave such up ul so not 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.740
 we will dwell on it and so you all 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.150
 remember this little disappointment in 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.419
 harry potter who 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.460
 disguised as a hulk or imagines 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.800
 themselves the hulk were put some spell 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.940
 I do not know this is a very small figure and 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.100
 i don't like her at all well 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.559
 8 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.019
 come up but the fact is that this 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.170
 figurine there is an alternative for her 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:54.460
 which is really ready to give her a ban 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.699
 this is a real hulk or almost 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:02.059
 real first go out of here and let's 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:06.830
 today consider our hulk and yet 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:10.000
 one hulk and one more hulk as you 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.210
 everyone noticed they differ in colors and 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.920
 Naturally this is not the original hulk 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.780
 I'll do a little intro to 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.820
 get the original hulk need 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.820
 buy a healthy set of designer 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.920
 which I don't need for one 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.950
 figurines can participate in 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.610
 some auction and take for the price 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.700
 recruitment 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.220
 designer figure hulk 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.460
 original but why if i can get 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.890
 three hulk of three times cheaper and 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.900
 and they look great i'm a little 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.100
 different from the original and so expensive 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.290
 friends here he is big green 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.890
 hulk the only thing that his pants 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.420
 gray they are purple as in 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.500
 the original figure but there is with 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.390
 purple are the same fakes in the hands 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.460
 he holds the wrench basically in 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.420
 In this form, he came only exploded 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.050
 I will explain means to disassemble his hand and 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.260
 hand disassembled in two parts this 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.660
 everything is connected here such a detail from 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.519
 lego technician or whatever his 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.760
 Well, in general, I think you understand this 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.910
 hands biomechanics on her hands 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.370
 he moves everything fine in what 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.510
 noticed frightening us at the key can 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.070
 pick up various items as well 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.090
 his hands are spinning 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.100
 legs the head is motionless and the same with 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.910
 other figures they differ 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.380
 only in color but god 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.090
 the finest figures I am nothing better 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.870
 probably in his hands did not hold at 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.450
 least fakes so sure yes there 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.989
 errors and to them we are now 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.670
 get to the bottom but believe that the errors 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.209
 here are small 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.890
 and pay attention to them I 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.950
 I do not consider it necessary but just need to 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.850
 something to dig up otherwise tell me what 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.940
 Here I am so bad propagandize here 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.620
 all sorts of piracy and so what's wrong with 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.070
 This figure well , firstly, it's like 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.560
 always paint paint is not everywhere 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.560
 trump here for example this hulk 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.920
 here is this hulk 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.550
 you may notice a small one 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.280
 it flowed on his face like a scar and 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.310
 this is just this here is negligence 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.950
 which is dominated by the Chinese when creating 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.230
 of similar figures all other figures 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.910
 painted wonderful the only thing that 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.650
 you can see the errors somewhere 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.860
 here on the pants here for example 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.770
 slightly there I don't know 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.970
 see a little bit of green 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.610
 instead 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:06.430
 This is the skin color of the hulk pants 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.110
 forever not torn here probably here 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.590
 also here is the opposite here a little bit 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.080
 blue more yes these are the little things 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.350
 also all sorts of bumps that can 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:21.100
 to be inaccuracies when creating figures 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.350
 or do not know there is tight plastic or 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.120
 something in lego immediately such details 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.660
 written off here they certainly go for 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.110
 export 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.990
 well and still bream or standing here 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.430
 much more and more noticeable than in 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.950
 original but 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.900
 it's just because you have to dig in 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.840
 This figure, for example, in general, these chili 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.710
 virtually no you pay attention to them 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.950
 turn naked eye in red 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.870
 figurines but a little bigger here 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.630
 in fact, and all all the disadvantages that 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:59.350
 can be found in the well and of course 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:05:03.220
 suffers all fakes it's heard for you 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.620
 it is a little loose parts that is 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.490
 they turn too easy not 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.290
 need to make efforts like for example in 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.550
 original lego where to turn 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:17.440
 his head needs to be clamped with two hands 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.210
 everything else is just wonderful 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.530
 thing and I put them on the most prominent 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.420
 place and sometimes I just take to 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.670
 hold them in your arms because it's 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.530
 quite a nice pleasure to hold such 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:34.690
 figure in the hands if suddenly you are at it 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:36.970
 stumble don't buy money buy 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.110
 and you will be completely happy I 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.960
 seriously talking 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.380
 considering that it is not worth it 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.620
 expensive of course if ordered for 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.690
 abroad for example directly from china it 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:54.520
 will be much cheaper we can 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:59.260
 rubles for 50 and will make more expensive though at us 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.970
 I still have not seen, here's 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.740
 all that can be said for these figures 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.710
 dear friends they are wonderful and 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.890
 look compared to this hulk he 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:12.940
 looks like real harry potter and 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:18.450
 now they will probably whitewash him but 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:21.540
 we channel without violence so far 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:24.310
 with you was Sirius dear friends and 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:27.760
 See the following issues for more. 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.860
 fakes more than any cool curiosities and 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.860
 at the same time you make for yourself the conclusion that 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.870
 better original or fake but of course 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.820
 the original is always better than the original always 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.180
 more let's not forget about it 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.740
 since we are all friends of friends about the budget 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.530
 therefore we are content with steep hills 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.700
 to new meetings 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:49.480
 because well so that everything looked 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:53.060
 spectacularly so inside they were a little 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:56.180
 in the other beat so get that 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.810
 blowjob in the package and we have here 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.340
 such a small figure by Michelangelo 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.820
 done at first glance she is pretty 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.740
 not bad if not for one but expensive 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.540
 friends in the first place it is not very 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.870
 high-quality plastic and not very 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.870
 quality paint but I remember my 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:17.860
 childhood and honestly i'm on such things 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.860
 therefore scored
