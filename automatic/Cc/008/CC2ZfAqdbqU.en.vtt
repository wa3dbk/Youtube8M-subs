guess<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> expulsion<00:01:28.080> 60<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.560> well<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.479> I

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
guess for the expulsion 60 as well so I

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.520 
guess for the expulsion 60 as well so I
put<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> 30-pound<00:01:32.670> I

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
put this up for just on a 30-pound I

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.499 
put this up for just on a 30-pound I
didn't<00:01:34.530> pre-order<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:35.100> think<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.670> dead<00:01:36.090> p<00:01:36.299> order

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
didn't pre-order I think a dead p order

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.969 
didn't pre-order I think a dead p order
on<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.869> site<00:01:37.079> but<00:01:37.290> then<00:01:37.470> there<00:01:37.619> wasn't<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.950> a

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
on the site but then there wasn't on a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.280 
on the site but then there wasn't on a
safe<00:01:38.220> for<00:01:38.400> some<00:01:38.520> reason<00:01:38.790> then<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> came<00:01:39.840> back<00:01:39.900> on

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
safe for some reason then I came back on

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.899 
safe for some reason then I came back on
the<00:01:40.409> city<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.770> buy<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:40.950> as<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.189> ok<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.640> weird

so I went back top there was a little

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.740 
so I went back top there was a little
additions<00:01:44.369> for<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.390> was<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.659> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
additions for this but it was just a
