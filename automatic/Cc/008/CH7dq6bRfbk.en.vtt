see<00:03:18.090> if<00:03:18.240> we've<00:03:18.390> covered<00:03:18.720> our<00:03:19.640> our<00:03:20.640> leaks

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
see if we've covered our our leaks

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
see if we've covered our our leaks
theory<00:03:22.430> but<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.490> don't<00:03:23.730> see<00:03:23.940> any<00:03:24.090> leaks<00:03:24.360> yet<00:03:24.600> I

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
theory but I don't see any leaks yet I

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.840 
theory but I don't see any leaks yet I
don't<00:03:25.920> know<00:03:26.040> if<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.160> guys<00:03:26.250> can<00:03:26.460> see<00:03:26.640> what<00:03:26.760> I've

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
don't know if you guys can see what I've

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.950 
don't know if you guys can see what I've
done<00:03:26.880> here<00:03:27.240> you<00:03:27.300> get<00:03:27.390> this<00:03:27.540> little<00:03:27.720> white

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
done here you get this little white

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.180 
done here you get this little white
streaking<00:03:28.560> going<00:03:28.800> on<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.940> that's<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.660> inner

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
streaking going on and that's the inner

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.410 
streaking going on and that's the inner
seal<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.460> put<00:03:32.670> on<00:03:33.260> three<00:03:34.260> layers<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:35.970> then

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
seal that I put on three layers and then

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.850 
seal that I put on three layers and then
on<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.630> outside<00:03:36.780> like<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.230> said<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:37.410> sprayed<00:03:37.830> it

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
on the outside like I said I sprayed it

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.330 
on the outside like I said I sprayed it
with<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.330> right

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
with that right

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.530 

hopefully<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:42.460> will<00:03:42.610> be<00:03:42.730> enough<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.240> keep<00:03:43.390> it

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
hopefully this will be enough to keep it

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.530 
hopefully this will be enough to keep it
from<00:03:43.630> leaking<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:44.850> was<00:03:45.850> hoping<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.150> didn't

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
from leaking I was hoping that didn't

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.760 
from leaking I was hoping that didn't
mess<00:03:46.660> with<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.900> inside<00:03:47.170> of<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.319> tarp<00:03:47.560> when<00:03:47.740> I

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
mess with the inside of the tarp when I

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.740 
mess with the inside of the tarp when I
did<00:03:47.950> that<00:03:48.069> stuff<00:03:48.370> so

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.670 

maybe<00:03:51.230> doing

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.530

decent job so far but we're going to let

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.820 
decent job so far but we're going to let

room on the disk for when I get it so

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.780 
room on the disk for when I get it so
good<00:04:04.860> all<00:04:05.860> right<00:04:05.980> we've<00:04:06.159> been<00:04:06.190> going<00:04:06.549> for<00:04:06.730> a

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
good all right we've been going for a

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.789 
good all right we've been going for a
good<00:04:07.030> 10<00:04:07.269> minutes<00:04:07.299> here<00:04:07.750> I've<00:04:07.930> got<00:04:08.080> a<00:04:08.110> float<00:04:08.680> on

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
good 10 minutes here I've got a float on

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.380 
good 10 minutes here I've got a float on
the<00:04:08.920> ground<00:04:09.159> here<00:04:09.489> from<00:04:09.700> water<00:04:09.909> running<00:04:10.090> off

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
the ground here from water running off

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.899 
the ground here from water running off
the<00:04:10.840> sides<00:04:11.140> of<00:04:11.409> it<00:04:11.640> but<00:04:12.640> with<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.569> being<00:04:13.900> said

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
the sides of it but with that being said

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:23.930 
the sides of it but with that being said
so<00:04:15.909> far<00:04:17.820> drop<00:04:18.820> of<00:04:18.970> water<00:04:19.120> inside<00:04:19.570> this<00:04:19.840> time

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.820 

so<00:04:24.540> I<00:04:24.930> think<00:04:25.050> that

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
so I think that

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.740 
so I think that
this<00:04:27.460> time<00:04:27.699> I've<00:04:27.879> actually<00:04:28.060> done<00:04:28.419> it<00:04:28.599> I've

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
this time I've actually done it I've

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.719 
this time I've actually done it I've
actually<00:04:28.960> sealed<00:04:29.439> the<00:04:29.560> tarp

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:39.820 

I'm<00:04:33.059> pretty<00:04:33.360> happy<00:04:33.599> now

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.469 

it's<00:04:40.130> pretty<00:04:40.370> windy<00:04:40.699> out<00:04:40.729> tonight<00:04:41.180> too<00:04:41.449> so

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
it's pretty windy out tonight too so

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.129 
it's pretty windy out tonight too so
that's<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.990> good<00:04:42.860> tough<00:04:43.720> tension<00:04:44.720> on<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:44.960> line

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
that's a good tough tension on the line

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.350 
that's a good tough tension on the line
then<00:04:45.440> we<00:04:45.500> turn<00:04:45.650> around<00:04:45.860> here<00:04:46.069> and<00:04:47.060> walk<00:04:47.210> out

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
then we turn around here and walk out

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.640 
then we turn around here and walk out
the<00:04:47.419> back<00:04:47.569> I'll<00:04:47.720> get<00:04:47.810> soaked<00:04:48.080> so<00:04:48.259> walk<00:04:48.410> out<00:04:48.560> the

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
the back I'll get soaked so walk out the

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.010 
the back I'll get soaked so walk out the
back

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.300 

but<00:04:53.020> I<00:04:53.050> think<00:04:53.230> we've<00:04:53.590> done<00:04:53.620> it<00:04:53.919> what's<00:04:54.100> that

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
but I think we've done it what's that

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.310 
but I think we've done it what's that
that's<00:04:55.060> a<00:04:55.180> bug<00:04:55.389> crawling<00:04:55.720> up<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:55.960> outside

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
that's a bug crawling up the outside

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.100 
that's a bug crawling up the outside
chili<00:04:56.980> bug<00:04:57.220> no<00:04:58.120> leakage<00:04:58.480> on<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.690> wall<00:04:58.900> at<00:04:59.230> all

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
chili bug no leakage on the wall at all

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:08.490 
chili bug no leakage on the wall at all
water<00:05:02.110> die<00:05:03.810> huh<00:05:04.810> okay<00:05:06.660> so<00:05:07.660> this<00:05:07.870> is<00:05:08.050> pretty

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
water die huh okay so this is pretty

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.420 
water die huh okay so this is pretty
good<00:05:08.800> test<00:05:10.590> obviously<00:05:11.590> it's<00:05:11.740> not<00:05:11.889> a<00:05:12.130> real

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
good test obviously it's not a real

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.520 
good test obviously it's not a real
storm<00:05:12.850> test<00:05:13.270> because<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:13.840> know<00:05:14.139> we'd<00:05:14.290> be<00:05:14.410> out

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
storm test because you know we'd be out

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.110 
storm test because you know we'd be out
here<00:05:14.710> for<00:05:14.919> a<00:05:15.010> whole<00:05:15.460> night<00:05:17.190> but<00:05:18.190> at<00:05:18.639> this<00:05:18.850> point

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
here for a whole night but at this point

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.370 
here for a whole night but at this point
I<00:05:19.240> think<00:05:19.330> I'd<00:05:19.600> be<00:05:19.750> willing<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.020> risk<00:05:20.260> it<00:05:20.530> and

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
I think I'd be willing to risk it and

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:29.029 
I think I'd be willing to risk it and
take<00:05:23.380> it<00:05:23.410> out<00:05:23.620> for<00:05:24.070> a<00:05:24.130> spin<00:05:24.639> on<00:05:24.700> a<00:05:24.910> camping<00:05:25.330> trip

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
you see we're getting a good wind sign

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.749

no pull off on this start so other than
a<00:05:47.460> heads<00:05:47.610> out<00:05:47.849> them<00:05:48.089> to<00:05:48.210> pull<00:05:48.389> at<00:05:48.479> the<00:05:48.539> top<00:05:48.779> so

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:49.559 
a heads out them to pull at the top so

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:52.939 
a heads out them to pull at the top so
in<00:05:49.710> a<00:05:49.770> hammock<00:05:50.129> you<00:05:50.399> could<00:05:50.639> get<00:05:50.819> a<00:05:51.949> squeeze

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
in a hammock you could get a squeeze

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:54.079 
in a hammock you could get a squeeze
down<00:05:53.129> a<00:05:53.189> little<00:05:53.369> bit<00:05:53.520> here<00:05:53.729> if<00:05:53.819> the<00:05:53.909> wind

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:54.089 
down a little bit here if the wind

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:59.149 
down a little bit here if the wind
starts<00:05:54.330> with<00:05:54.449> him<00:05:54.539> around<00:05:58.159> otherwise

00:05:59.149 --> 00:05:59.159 
starts with him around otherwise

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.189 
starts with him around otherwise
nothing's<00:05:59.969> getting<00:06:00.149> through<00:06:00.300> water<00:06:00.689> wise<00:06:00.899> and

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
nothing's getting through water wise and

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:07.760 
nothing's getting through water wise and
that<00:06:01.289> was<00:06:01.499> the<00:06:02.029> whole<00:06:03.029> goal<00:06:03.300> of<00:06:04.009> doing<00:06:05.009> it<00:06:06.770> and

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
that was the whole goal of doing it and

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.139 
that was the whole goal of doing it and
he's<00:06:07.949> still<00:06:08.189> spraying<00:06:08.520> it<00:06:08.669> right<00:06:08.789> on<00:06:08.909> the<00:06:08.999> rim

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:09.149 
he's still spraying it right on the rim

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:12.860 
he's still spraying it right on the rim
of<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:09.449> tent<00:06:11.240> so<00:06:12.240> I<00:06:12.270> think<00:06:12.509> we're<00:06:12.599> good<00:06:12.749> this

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
of the tent so I think we're good this

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:23.279 
of the tent so I think we're good this
time

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:24.929 

trying<00:06:23.830> to<00:06:23.889> go<00:06:24.009> into<00:06:24.159> that<00:06:24.249> macro<00:06:24.610> so<00:06:24.729> you<00:06:24.789> can

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:24.939 
trying to go into that macro so you can

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:29.070 
trying to go into that macro so you can
show<00:06:25.029> you<00:06:25.120> that<00:06:25.210> real<00:06:25.389> quick<00:06:25.419> if<00:06:25.599> I<00:06:25.689> can<00:06:28.080> just

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
show you that real quick if I can just

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.330 
show you that real quick if I can just
kind<00:06:29.259> of<00:06:29.319> a<00:06:29.349> hard<00:06:29.529> setting<00:06:29.770> to<00:06:29.949> do<00:06:30.099> while

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
kind of a hard setting to do while

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.420 
kind of a hard setting to do while
you're<00:06:30.460> walking<00:06:30.639> is<00:06:30.969> so<00:06:31.210> tight<00:06:31.419> in<00:06:31.659> there<00:06:32.430> I'm

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
you're walking is so tight in there I'm

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.589 
you're walking is so tight in there I'm
trying<00:06:33.699> to<00:06:33.849> show<00:06:33.969> you<00:06:33.999> that<00:06:34.090> we<00:06:34.360> don't<00:06:34.449> have

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 
trying to show you that we don't have

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:35.999 
trying to show you that we don't have
any<00:06:34.719> dripping<00:06:34.930> even<00:06:35.349> though<00:06:35.469> it<00:06:35.620> may<00:06:35.770> look

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:36.009 
any dripping even though it may look

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:39.149 
any dripping even though it may look
like<00:06:36.960> this<00:06:37.960> water<00:06:38.199> there<00:06:38.409> that's<00:06:38.680> not<00:06:38.830> on<00:06:39.009> the

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:39.159 
like this water there that's not on the

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:41.179 
like this water there that's not on the
inside<00:06:39.430> is<00:06:39.550> on<00:06:39.669> the<00:06:39.759> outside<00:06:40.150> as<00:06:40.419> you<00:06:40.449> can<00:06:40.689> see

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:41.189 
inside is on the outside as you can see

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:43.140 
inside is on the outside as you can see
so<00:06:42.189> this<00:06:42.340> time<00:06:42.580> I<00:06:42.610> think<00:06:42.759> we've<00:06:42.969> actually

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
so this time I think we've actually

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:59.260 
so this time I think we've actually
sealed<00:06:43.599> it<00:06:43.779> I'm<00:06:44.740> pretty<00:06:45.039> happy<00:06:45.279> with<00:06:45.490> this<00:06:45.610> one

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.940 

I<00:06:59.410> think<00:07:00.410> I'm<00:07:00.530> pretty<00:07:00.740> happy<00:07:00.920> now<00:07:01.330> so<00:07:02.950> that's

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:03.950 
I think I'm pretty happy now so that's

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:09.550 
I think I'm pretty happy now so that's
the<00:07:04.190> gist<00:07:04.370> of<00:07:04.550> what<00:07:04.730> we<00:07:04.850> did<00:07:05.000> there<00:07:08.290> so<00:07:09.290> just<00:07:09.470> to

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560 
the gist of what we did there so just to

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.720 
the gist of what we did there so just to
give<00:07:09.710> you<00:07:09.740> an<00:07:09.890> idea<00:07:10.100> of<00:07:10.340> what<00:07:10.460> we're<00:07:10.610> doing

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:10.730 
give you an idea of what we're doing

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.540 
give you an idea of what we're doing
here<00:07:11.560> we've<00:07:12.560> just<00:07:12.680> been<00:07:12.860> spraying<00:07:13.160> water<00:07:13.400> on

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.550 
here we've just been spraying water on

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.810 
here we've just been spraying water on
it<00:07:13.790> like<00:07:13.910> this<00:07:14.120> for<00:07:14.360> the<00:07:14.450> last<00:07:14.660> 15<00:07:15.140> minutes

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:15.820 
it like this for the last 15 minutes

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.670 
it like this for the last 15 minutes
I'm<00:07:16.820> hoping<00:07:17.390> you<00:07:17.510> can<00:07:17.630> see<00:07:17.750> that<00:07:17.930> it's<00:07:18.470> kind<00:07:18.560> of

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 
I'm hoping you can see that it's kind of

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.920 
I'm hoping you can see that it's kind of
hard<00:07:18.830> to<00:07:18.890> tell<00:07:19.070> from<00:07:19.190> down<00:07:19.400> here<00:07:19.700> but<00:07:19.940> the

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:20.930 
hard to tell from down here but the

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.600 
hard to tell from down here but the
spraying<00:07:21.260> water<00:07:21.470> on<00:07:21.650> your<00:07:21.800> left<00:07:22.070> 15<00:07:22.490> minutes

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:22.610 
spraying water on your left 15 minutes

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.110 
spraying water on your left 15 minutes
got<00:07:23.150> my<00:07:23.270> ground<00:07:23.450> all<00:07:23.750> soaked<00:07:24.080> out<00:07:24.320> here<00:07:24.560> and

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 
got my ground all soaked out here and

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.190 
got my ground all soaked out here and
nothing<00:07:26.120> leaked<00:07:26.300> through<00:07:26.600> so<00:07:26.900> it's<00:07:27.050> a<00:07:27.080> good

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.200 
nothing leaked through so it's a good

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.590
