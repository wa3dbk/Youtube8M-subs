all<00:00:01.319> right<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.659> 7.3<00:00:04.160> diesel<00:00:05.160> engine<00:00:06.140> to

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
all right this is a 7.3 diesel engine to

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.629 
all right this is a 7.3 diesel engine to
t44<00:00:08.880> II<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.510> International<00:00:10.050> connotation

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
t44 II the International connotation

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.459 
t44 II the International connotation
it's<00:00:11.639> four<00:00:11.969> hundred<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.300> forty<00:00:12.570> four<00:00:12.990> cubic

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
it's four hundred and forty four cubic

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.220 
it's four hundred and forty four cubic
inches<00:00:13.910> turbocharged<00:00:14.910> just<00:00:15.269> see<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> turbo

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
inches turbocharged just see a turbo

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.370 
inches turbocharged just see a turbo
right<00:00:16.379> there<00:00:16.680> uh<00:00:17.660> this<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.840> valve<00:00:19.080> cover

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
right there uh this is valve cover

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.720 
right there uh this is valve cover
that's<00:00:19.560> where<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> injector<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
that's where the injector is this the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.679 
that's where the injector is this the
PCM<00:00:22.760> it<00:00:23.760> uh<00:00:23.960> makes<00:00:25.400> once<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.490> 230<00:00:27.300> horsepower

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
PCM it uh makes once a 230 horsepower

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.800 
PCM it uh makes once a 230 horsepower
ish<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.680> area<00:00:29.039> different<00:00:30.029> designs<00:00:30.330> that

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
ish in that area different designs that

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.450 
ish in that area different designs that
go<00:00:30.869> anywhere<00:00:31.470> from<00:00:31.679> like<00:00:31.969> 190<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.120> 270

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
go anywhere from like 190 to 270

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.709 
go anywhere from like 190 to 270
basically<00:00:35.460> they<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:35.640> flash<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.270> PCM

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
basically they just flash the PCM

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.639 
basically they just flash the PCM
differently<00:00:37.380> um<00:00:38.540> this<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> truck<00:00:40.260> so

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
differently um this is on a truck so

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.410 
differently um this is on a truck so
it's<00:00:41.280> blue<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.910> your<00:00:42.300> Ford<00:00:42.870> truck<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:44.100> black

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
it's blue on your Ford truck it be black

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.930 
it's blue on your Ford truck it be black
came<00:00:45.420> out<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.809> 94<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:47.250> did<00:00:47.460> away<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.670> these

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
came out in 94 they did away with these

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.560 
came out in 94 they did away with these
in<00:00:48.210> 2000<00:00:48.809> 3.5<00:00:49.559> model<00:00:50.250> year<00:00:50.460> they<00:00:51.120> switched<00:00:51.420> out

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
in 2000 3.5 model year they switched out

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.560 
in 2000 3.5 model year they switched out
for<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.809> 6<00:00:52.079> liter<00:00:52.320> VT<00:00:52.800> 65<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.699> believe<00:00:54.149> that

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
for the 6 liter VT 65 I believe that

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.000 
for the 6 liter VT 65 I believe that
might<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> sixth<00:00:55.379> floor<00:00:55.469> I'm<00:00:55.649> not<00:00:55.680> sure

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
might be the sixth floor I'm not sure

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.920 
might be the sixth floor I'm not sure
still<00:00:56.760> any<00:00:56.940> either<00:00:57.300> way<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.539> slice<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
still any either way you slice a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.130 
still any either way you slice a
terrible<00:00:58.590> terrible<00:00:58.890> engine<00:01:00.079> it's<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
terrible terrible engine it's the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.529 
terrible terrible engine it's the
manifold<00:01:01.680> right<00:01:01.920> there<00:01:02.239> you<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.359> see<00:01:03.510> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
manifold right there you can see a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.759 
manifold right there you can see a
little<00:01:03.840> bit<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> transmission<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.589> bell

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
little bit of the transmission the bell

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.870 
little bit of the transmission the bell
housing<00:01:07.040> I'll<00:01:08.040> come<00:01:08.310> around<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> other

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
housing I'll come around to the other

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.160 
housing I'll come around to the other
side<00:01:11.270> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.540> valve<00:01:13.290> cover<00:01:13.590> better<00:01:14.090> fan

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
side you can see valve cover better fan

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.870 
side you can see valve cover better fan
know<00:01:16.820> this<00:01:17.820> crap<00:01:18.060> matters<00:01:18.299> power<00:01:18.750> steering<00:01:19.229> um

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
know this crap matters power steering um

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.240 
know this crap matters power steering um
basically<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.570> was<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.380> best<00:01:22.710> engine

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
basically this was the best engine

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.100 
basically this was the best engine
really<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> best<00:01:24.150> diesel<00:01:24.509> engine<00:01:24.810> they<00:01:24.930> ever

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
really the best diesel engine they ever

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.819 
really the best diesel engine they ever
could<00:01:25.350> make<00:01:25.759> it<00:01:26.759> was<00:01:27.080> amazingly<00:01:28.080> reliable

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
could make it was amazingly reliable

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.980 
could make it was amazingly reliable
powerful<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.150> couldn't<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.720> don't<00:01:30.869> need

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
powerful you couldn't you don't need

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.469 
powerful you couldn't you don't need
this<00:01:31.140> much<00:01:31.350> power<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.950> pickup<00:01:32.250> truck<00:01:32.479> right

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
this much power in a pickup truck right

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.020 
this much power in a pickup truck right
here's<00:01:33.720> where<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.110> here's<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:35.430> channel<00:01:35.909> as

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
here's where the here's the channel as

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.600 
here's where the here's the channel as
you<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.270> see<00:01:36.479> or<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.220> high<00:01:38.220> pressure<00:01:38.520> oil

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
you can see or the high pressure oil

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.149 
you can see or the high pressure oil
pump<00:01:39.030> sends<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.509> oil<00:01:39.689> goes<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.650> an<00:01:40.710> injector

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
pump sends the oil goes in an injector

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.590 
pump sends the oil goes in an injector
which<00:01:41.369> would<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:41.729> right<00:01:42.119> here<00:01:42.150> 1<00:01:42.990> 2<00:01:43.500> 3<00:01:43.950> &amp;<00:01:44.159> 4<00:01:44.600> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
which would be right here 1 2 3 &amp; 4 the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.120 
which would be right here 1 2 3 &amp; 4 the
sense<00:01:47.450> PCM<00:01:48.450> tells<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.229> solenoid<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.009> open

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
sense PCM tells a solenoid one to open

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.789 
sense PCM tells a solenoid one to open
up<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.490> plunger<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.930> plunger<00:01:52.320> shoots

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
up that plunger and the plunger shoots

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.730 
up that plunger and the plunger shoots
the<00:01:53.100> fuel<00:01:54.000> into<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> cylinder<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the fuel into the cylinder and the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.490 
the fuel into the cylinder and the
cylinder<00:01:55.770> combust<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.640> trucks<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.000> 99<00:01:57.930> model

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
cylinder combust this trucks a 99 model

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.120 
cylinder combust this trucks a 99 model
so<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.430> has<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.000> stage<00:02:00.960> 2<00:02:01.290> injectors<00:02:01.829> which

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
so it has the stage 2 injectors which

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.499 
so it has the stage 2 injectors which
inject<00:02:02.790> 3<00:02:03.450> percent<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> fuel<00:02:04.200> sooner

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
inject 3 percent of the fuel sooner

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.969 
inject 3 percent of the fuel sooner
first<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:06.899> inject<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.259> other<00:02:07.320> 97

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
first and then inject the other 97

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.380 
first and then inject the other 97
percent<00:02:08.399> to

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
percent to

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.380 
percent to
improve<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.810> sound<00:02:10.460> there's<00:02:11.460> really<00:02:11.880> nothing

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
improve the sound there's really nothing

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.120 
improve the sound there's really nothing
else<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.750> can<00:02:12.810> show<00:02:12.990> you<00:02:13.260> on<00:02:13.380> this<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.980> nice

five-speed<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:17.340> know<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.550> does<00:02:17.760> great<00:02:17.970> for

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
five-speed you know it does great for

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.550 
five-speed you know it does great for
what<00:02:18.270> we<00:02:18.360> need<00:02:18.569> we<00:02:18.870> don't<00:02:19.050> really<00:02:19.200> use<00:02:19.319> it<00:02:19.530> that

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
what we need we don't really use it that
