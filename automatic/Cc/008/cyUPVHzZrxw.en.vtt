 now if we start with the days 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.200
 curiosities that maybe you did not know about 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.200
 batman 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.560
 Batman first appeared in 1939 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.930
 in number 27 of the detective magazine 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.540
 comics that was released by the editorial 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.030
 national publications whose branch 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.390
 would then go to dizzy so batman 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.030
 he has nothing more and nothing less than 76 years 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.950
 protecting your city and according to 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.680
 batman batman authors was created by 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.440
 a combination of the shadow the fox and 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.940
 dracula giving an appearance next to 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.790
 Superman on a cover of a comic 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.950
 throwing the tennis balls to hitler 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.140
 in the Second World War it was very 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.030
 common that comic book characters or drawings 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.490
 animated serve as propaganda 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.040
 to be able to encourage the support of 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.950
 citizens and talking about strooper man and 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.690
 although it sounds super weird ben affleck 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.979
 he has been the only batman who has also 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.630
 been super mate in 1996 says comics 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.610
 next to marvel they made a series 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.220
 cross where the character appeared 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.950
 dark the good this character is a 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.790
 combination of batman with wolverine 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.100
 keeps the guinness record of 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.470
 character with more action figures and 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.500
 with more than 300 figures 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.540
 different action the actor and singer 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.000
 frank sinatra wanted to play the role of 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.800
 joker in the batman animated series 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.479
 played by adam west 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.430
 however when he showed interest in the 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.560
 paper unfortunately the paper had already 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.910
 subsidized to cesc a rosemary 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.050
 thing that angered frank sinatra very much 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.320
 taking into account the cost of 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.050
 cars the costumes the secret caves and 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.660
 Batman's other gadget is calculated to 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.660
 see more would cost around 300 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.400
 million dollars the first 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.680
 batman stories had like 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.900
 location the city of new york but of 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.750
 where the name of lake otan came out yes 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.790
 well this name comes from because 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.380
 they saw in a new phone book 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.620
 york an advertisement for a jewelry called 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.480
 cotÃ¡n jules and this happened in full 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.520
 creative process where they were 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.270
 looking for him a fictitious space section 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.700
 and they decided to call it gotham city 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.890
 the backgrounds of the batman animated series 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.060
 they were drawn on black paper in 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.340
 white time 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.810
 the idea was to create as an atmosphere what 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.520
 darker as possible and go achieve it 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.760
 this seems super curious to me and it's that 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.500
 christian bale hated death to role a 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.210
 such a point that warned the producers 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.790
 that if robin comes out in the movie he 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.950
 I was going to leave the trilogy remember 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.540
 that robin makes an indirect appearance 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.820
 about the end of the knight of the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.270
 night ascends however can not 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.520
 considered to have appeared as such mark 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.590
 look also interpret will not be walker 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.240
 in star wars he also lent his voice to 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.300
 the character of the joker in the popular 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.300
