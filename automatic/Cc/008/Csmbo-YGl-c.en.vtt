who I bought this secondhand off of

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.500 
who I bought this secondhand off of
Facebook<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.469> whoever<00:00:56.340> had<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:58.070> 4.6<00:00:59.070> before

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
Facebook and whoever had this 4.6 before

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.170 
Facebook and whoever had this 4.6 before
Fred<00:01:00.510> Lots<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.440> nuts<00:01:02.719> onto<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.170> axles<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.180> I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
Fred Lots the nuts onto the axles and I

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.469 
Fred Lots the nuts onto the axles and I
had<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.659> cut<00:01:07.380> them<00:01:07.530> off<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:08.060> dremel<00:01:09.060> drill

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
to push the flap of the back of the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.730 
to push the flap of the back of the
remote<00:01:47.850> back<00:01:48.030> off<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:49.250> good<00:01:50.250> radio<00:01:50.869> now<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.500> is
