00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.129
 this recipe is very simple to 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.480
 prepare and I assure you it is a lot 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:13.150

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.960
 same a sachet of vanillin one 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:36.399
 baking powder sachet 150 ml of 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.620
 milk and 150 ml of oil then you will need 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.269
 a cake pan I use this form of 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.140
 donut however wanted to use 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:48.010
 very well a simple round wheel 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.260
 so now let's go and prepare how 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.800
 first thing you need to set the oven to 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.899
 180 degrees static to anger 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.729
 now I will use the handpiece though 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.809
 you want you can also use one 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:09.580
 electric mixer 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:12.540
 then we first put the eggs 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.210
 add the sugar and put it 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.950
 everything 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.080
 now we operate the planetary e 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.810
 let's mix everything well until 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:34.729
 make it become a yellow cream 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:37.110
 very clear that the sugar will be well 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.070
 absorbed with Europe must 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.580
 add the flour 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.580
 we are all 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:54.770
 add the milk and we design it 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:01.520
 now we are going to knead the motive 10 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.180
 now we are ready to reach the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.180
 yeast 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.970
 the sachet of vanillin 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:36.230
 now let 's put the grip of the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:40.550
 planetary in the next step mi 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:43.690
 they will hear two bowls ten split into 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.190
 one of the parts we pour that bitter cocoa 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.360
 and let's absorb it well 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:54.050
 stirring is composed of overcoming a 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:58.100
 a little too dense add a 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.530
 a little amusing the two compounds are 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.290
 ready take the cake tin mi 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:08.870
 I recommend buttered and floured and 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:12.350
 however we pour the components one to the 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:17.900
 fight or we are making a layer of 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:22.820
 this is where the Libyan race is a layer of 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:26.930
 this one in chocolate until you finish 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:29.240
 and all two compounds once 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.460
 we have finished the compound we put it 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.750
 the oven as I said before fresh 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.700
 went at 180 degrees for about 45 minutes 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.520
 after 45 minutes and with which mine 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.730

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.000
 the whole surface 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.590
 then I show the inside as it will be 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.590
 fast 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.099
