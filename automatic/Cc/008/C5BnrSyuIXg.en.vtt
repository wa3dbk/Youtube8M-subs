Knight Returns thing as an inspiration
but<00:01:59.100> that's<00:01:59.280> not<00:01:59.460> supposed<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.090> what<00:02:00.240> this

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
but that's not supposed to be what this

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.870 
but that's not supposed to be what this
movie<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.750> going<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:00.990> be<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:02.340> kind<00:02:02.729> of

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.719 
movie is going to be and this kind of
seems<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.479> contradict<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.200> little<00:02:04.619> bit<00:02:04.770> so

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
seems to contradict that a little bit so

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.059 
seems to contradict that a little bit so
I'm<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> little<00:02:06.060> hesitant<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.960> jump<00:02:07.320> for<00:02:07.619> joy<00:02:07.649> as

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
I'm a little hesitant to jump for joy as

I'm a little hesitant to jump for joy as
yet<00:02:08.250> because<00:02:08.459> as<00:02:08.610> awesome<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.119> seemed<00:02:09.509> I

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
yet because as awesome as it seemed I

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.010

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.590 
the classic
everyone<00:02:13.920> usually<00:02:14.310> says<00:02:14.820> that<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.210> and

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
everyone usually says that it is and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.530 
everyone usually says that it is and
considers<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.470> be<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.860> think<00:02:17.490> it's<00:02:17.580> okay<00:02:18.000> but

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
considers it to be I think it's okay but

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.300 
considers it to be I think it's okay but
it's<00:02:18.570> definitely<00:02:18.930> nowhere<00:02:19.470> near<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:20.070> top

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
it's definitely nowhere near the top

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.190 
it's definitely nowhere near the top
tier<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.640> my<00:02:20.880> favorite<00:02:21.240> Batman<00:02:21.420> stories<00:02:22.020> and

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
stuff like that and I think it was good

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.790 
stuff like that and I think it was good
for<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.600> time<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.020> came<00:02:25.290> out<00:02:25.500> what<00:02:25.770> I

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
for the time that it came out what I

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.250 
for the time that it came out what I
mean<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.250> don't<00:02:27.030> want<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.840> be<00:02:27.960> what<00:02:28.110> this

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260
