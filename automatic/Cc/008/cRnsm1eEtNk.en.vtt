00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 you have heard many times lately 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.189
 things about stem cells and the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.679
 regenerative medicine that are the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.400
 stem cells are said to be the cell 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.619
 that has the ability to regenerate from 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.070
 divide multiply and become 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.260
 tissue from areas that are damaged 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.320
 Normally the stem cells are from 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.269
 two types the embryonic and the cells 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.519
 adults that are all those cells 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.949
 that are forming continuously in 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.190
 our body and that many times are 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.829
 there preparing or waiting while circulating 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.430
 in peripheral blood waiting for there 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.950
 a damaged tissue for them to come and 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.450
 restore it normally has always been 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.730
 considered that stem cells 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.739
 adults are those that belong to the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.649
 bone marrow 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.660
 the marrow of the bone that is just 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.270
 often they are taken out and can be 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.829
 manipulate and work to return it to 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.410
 the person when you are going to do a 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.850
 bone marrow transplant for the purpose of 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.939
 treat diseases 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.909
 like lymphomas leukemia and so on but in 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.030
 recent years it has been seen that there is a 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.220
 cell I felt bad that is in the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.350
 Adipose tissue that was formerly believed 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.390
 that it was a simple warehouse fabric of 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.909
 fat but today you know that 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.899
 It's practically a tissue 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.289
 endocrinological that have many 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.840
 substances with functions that still some 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:32.039
 nor are they known to influence our 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.710
 everyday life in our up in the 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.710
 regulation of our metabolism and those 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.220
 tiny cells that rest between 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.210
 the fat tissue cells it is known that 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.700
 can be taken out of there manipulated and 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.250
 before activated and returned to the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.039
 circulation can stimulate 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.039
 tissue regeneration today there are 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.990
 serious studies showing how you are 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.200
 cells can regenerate damaged tissues 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.320
 in joints especially knees 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.380
 hips 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.340
 shoulders in the lower back in the neck 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.280
 and also because there are treatments 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.830
 do intravenous that can allow 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.310
 that those cells are isolated are put in 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.900
 a serum and they are transplanted bone 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.000
 autotransplant again in the 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.660
 individual and these cells can travel 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.540
 throughout the body identify areas that 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.900
 are damaged and automatically help 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.440
 restore I've seen them in articles 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.750
 reports is scientific evidence of 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.430
 which improves on the whole system 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.070
 immune that is a system 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.290
 important key to prevent 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.810
 diseases since many times 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.360
 up to many cancers neoplasms 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.340
 that happen in our body are formed 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.890
 because our killer cells 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.610
 natural the famous natural killers 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.140
 they are lost by something 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.600
 reason that we do not know well the 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.830
 immune surveillance and then you're 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.650
 stimulus cells 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.770
 the production of these cells from the 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.120
 macrophages that help us detect 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.490
 diseases that help regenerate 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.590
 tissues that are damaged that can 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.480
 travel potentially as the 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.660
 blood circulation bathes all the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.460
 body because they can go through the kidney 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.890
 determine that there are structures that are 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.050
 being damaged from the nephron and stimulate 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.480
 regeneration in the kidney may 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.030
 stimulate regeneration at the level of 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.220
 pancreas I have seen cases of patients 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.010
 diabetics who were well wrong 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.560
 controlled and has improved them in cases 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.020
 of patients with disease 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.050
 cardiovascular I have seen cases where 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.790
 improved the ejection fraction that is 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.160
 the indicator that we use when a 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.080
 person is in heart failure and 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.570
 it is really believed that these cells 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.760
 have the ability to stimulate 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.250
 regeneration at all levels 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.080
 even at the brain level it is believed that 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.310
 also these cells can improve in 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.060
 patients who are already having 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.550
 problems in euros 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.250
 degenerative memory disorders 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.630
 Parkinson's disorders etc. not 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.310
 we can promise nothing in the 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.050
 treatments because they are still in a 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.120
 experimental base 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.310
 remember that many times when one 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.220
 returns these cells to the circulation 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.160
 and they travel and detect tissues that 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.130
 they are damaged and regenerated but 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.080
 we really do not know where 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.260
 they go directly unless we could 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.780
 use certain markers as they are 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.280
 they use to make let's say a pet scan and 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.920
 be able to mark the areas where there 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.230
 inflammation would be interesting if one 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.910
 could have that resource to mark those 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.250
 cells that one is putting in 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.990
 circulation and then do a study 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.790
 nuclear to see where were the 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.620
 cells since one could infer 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.570
 directly that those cells are in 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.400
 the brain or they are in other tissues 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.830
 of the body but what we are 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.129
 sure that this is the promise of the century 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.139
 21 and what will he give 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:02.989
 really the key to many 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.610
 treatments because until now we know 

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:06.199
 than more than 70 percent of 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.550
 treatments that we have available 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.699
 for most diseases 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.819
 Chronic are treatments for 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.649
 symptoms do not cause and that's why a lot 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:17.899
 people get frustrated because they can not see 

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:20.119
 really that no disease is cured 

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:22.369
 who have a hard time putting a 

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:24.949
 disease in remission that only 

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:26.809
 sometimes manage to control them but that 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.729
 we also have many adverse effects 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:30.379
 of most medicines that 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.599
 we are taking if in the long run the 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:34.399
 patient does not feel comfortable with 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.659
 long-term treatments and many 

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:38.659
 sometimes they abandon the therapies 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:41.959
 conventional to go behind the 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:44.539
 alternative medicine when really not 

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:46.639
 there is a scientific basis for it more 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.830
 that certain generalized reports like that 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.889
 that really the subject of the cells 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.839
 mother is a promising topic and therefore 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.849
 I invite you to investigate and if someone 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:59.149
 want to make a query and see if your 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:00.829
 medical condition would need or could be 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:04.869
 benefit from any of these 

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:04.869
 treatments are welcome 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.560
 the mother cell and the others
