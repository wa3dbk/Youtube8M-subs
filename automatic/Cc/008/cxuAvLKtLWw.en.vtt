out there saving businesses or homes
from<00:00:43.140> fires<00:00:43.320> well<00:00:43.770> usually<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.190> computer

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
from fires well usually the computer

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.979 
from fires well usually the computer
equipment<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:45.000> completely<00:00:45.420> destroyed<00:00:45.809> and

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
equipment is completely destroyed and

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.200 
equipment is completely destroyed and
the<00:00:46.289> data<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.829> irretrievable<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.969> that

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the data can be irretrievable and that

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.670 
the data can be irretrievable and that
can<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> pretty<00:00:48.870> upsetting<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> lot<00:00:49.559> of

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
can be a pretty upsetting to a lot of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.350 
can be a pretty upsetting to a lot of
people<00:00:49.950> because<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> data<00:00:51.090> that's

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
people because it's the data that's

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.000 
people because it's the data that's
probably<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> most<00:00:51.870> valuable<00:00:52.050> absolutely

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
probably the most valuable absolutely

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.189 
probably the most valuable absolutely
and<00:00:53.160> not<00:00:53.699> not<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.149> lot<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.420> people<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.899> get

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
and not not a lot of people that get

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.040 
and not not a lot of people that get
back<00:00:55.559> data<00:00:55.829> up<00:00:56.039> off-site<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.449> ultimately<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
back data up off-site so ultimately it

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.380 
back data up off-site so ultimately it
sits<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.980> humdrum<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.699> was<00:00:59.820> there<00:01:00.030> so

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
sits on the humdrum and it was there so

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.849 
sits on the humdrum and it was there so
what<00:01:00.570> are<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.780> gonna<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.079> today<00:01:01.260> well<00:01:01.829> today

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
what are we gonna do today well today

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.100 
what are we gonna do today well today
we're<00:01:02.280> going<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.670> put<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.300> right<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.600> top<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
we're going to put it right on top of a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.530 
we're going to put it right on top of a
fire<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.369> burning<00:01:05.400> up<00:01:05.820> 12<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> 1500

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
fire that is burning up 12 to 1500

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.600 
fire that is burning up 12 to 1500
degrees<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.200> give<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.740> shot<00:01:07.770> okay<00:01:08.100> well

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
degrees so give it a shot okay well

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.580 
degrees so give it a shot okay well
let's<00:01:08.820> see<00:01:09.119> what<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.360> thing<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.630> do

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.910

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
and what we're burning in the fire is a

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.859 
and what we're burning in the fire is a
one<00:01:18.250> terabyte<00:01:18.670> storage<00:01:18.880> device<00:01:19.420> that<00:01:19.450> claims

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
one terabyte storage device that claims

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.870 
one terabyte storage device that claims
to<00:01:20.140> be<00:01:20.229> fireproof<00:01:20.649> up<00:01:21.159> to<00:01:21.369> fifteen<00:01:21.850> hundred

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
to be fireproof up to fifteen hundred

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.330 
to be fireproof up to fifteen hundred
and<00:01:22.329> fifty<00:01:22.659> degrees<00:01:22.990> Fahrenheit<00:01:23.470> for<00:01:24.009> up<00:01:24.159> to

studio and now it's time to figure out
whether<00:02:04.340> or<00:02:04.490> not<00:02:04.579> we<00:02:04.729> can<00:02:04.849> recover<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.390> data

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
whether or not we can recover the data

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.719 
whether or not we can recover the data
as<00:02:05.959> you<00:02:06.020> can<00:02:06.349> see<00:02:06.530> this<00:02:06.979> thing<00:02:07.189> is<00:02:07.219> completely

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
as you can see this thing is completely

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.699 
as you can see this thing is completely
torched<00:02:08.149> there's<00:02:08.450> no<00:02:08.629> way<00:02:08.869> we're<00:02:09.410> gonna<00:02:09.470> be

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
torched there's no way we're gonna be

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.110 
torched there's no way we're gonna be
able<00:02:09.769> to<00:02:09.920> connect<00:02:10.280> this<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.670> any<00:02:10.819> type<00:02:11.090> of

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
able to connect this to any type of

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.600 
able to connect this to any type of
computer<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:12.079> we<00:02:12.230> have<00:02:12.349> to<00:02:12.470> go<00:02:12.590> inside<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.459> it

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
computer so we have to go inside of it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.699 
computer so we have to go inside of it
in<00:02:13.819> order<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.209> get<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.629> innards<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.410> see<00:02:15.620> if

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
in order to get to the innards to see if

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.770 
in order to get to the innards to see if
our<00:02:15.890> data<00:02:16.099> is<00:02:16.340> actually<00:02:16.549> secure<00:02:17.150> I'm<00:02:17.599> gonna

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
our data is actually secure I'm gonna

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.330 
our data is actually secure I'm gonna
pull<00:02:17.989> off<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.319> screws<00:02:18.650> we've<00:02:18.890> got<00:02:19.040> most<00:02:19.250> of

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
pull off the screws we've got most of

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.940 
pull off the screws we've got most of
them<00:02:19.430> done<00:02:19.489> already<00:02:20.560> I'm<00:02:21.560> just<00:02:21.590> gonna<00:02:21.799> pull

have to do is you actually have to peel
this<00:02:25.489> entire<00:02:25.849> piece<00:02:26.269> away<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:27.349> can<00:02:27.500> see<00:02:27.680> there

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
this entire piece away you can see there

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.890 
this entire piece away you can see there
and<00:02:28.340> all<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:28.579> melting<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.000> taking<00:02:29.329> place<00:02:29.450> I'm

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
and all that melting is taking place I'm

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.990 
and all that melting is taking place I'm
gonna<00:02:30.079> rip<00:02:30.290> open<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.920> side<00:02:31.519> of<00:02:31.640> this<00:02:31.760> drive

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
gonna rip open the side of this drive

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.479 
gonna rip open the side of this drive
here<00:02:32.390> like<00:02:32.750> this<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.799> allows<00:02:34.099> me<00:02:34.310> to

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
here like this and that allows me to

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.759 
here like this and that allows me to
pull<00:02:34.730> out<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:35.390> this<00:02:36.170> is<00:02:36.379> the<00:02:36.470> material

that's essentially kept our drive safe
from<00:02:39.170> both<00:02:39.319> heat<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.650> water<00:02:40.099> and<00:02:40.310> as<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.549> can

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
from both heat and water and as you can

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.789 
from both heat and water and as you can
see<00:02:40.730> all<00:02:41.269> this<00:02:41.540> black<00:02:41.930> torching<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:42.530> all

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
see all this black torching it all

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.440 
see all this black torching it all
around<00:02:43.069> here<00:02:43.340> this<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:43.760> actually<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.209> heat

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
around here this is actually the heat

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.539 
around here this is actually the heat
damaged<00:02:44.900> but<00:02:45.470> what<00:02:45.620> we<00:02:45.709> want<00:02:45.889> to<00:02:45.980> do<00:02:46.069> is<00:02:46.190> pull

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
damaged but what we want to do is pull

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.240 
damaged but what we want to do is pull
this<00:02:46.730> apart<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.709> actually<00:02:48.709> take<00:02:48.889> a<00:02:48.920> look<00:02:49.190> at

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
this apart and actually take a look at

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.699 
this apart and actually take a look at
the<00:02:49.730> drive<00:02:50.030> if<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.599> take<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.810> look<00:02:50.959> there<00:02:51.200> this

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
the drive if you take a look there this

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.740 
the drive if you take a look there this
is<00:02:51.889> the<00:02:51.980> hard<00:02:52.220> drive<00:02:52.489> that's<00:02:52.700> safely<00:02:53.359> stored

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
is the hard drive that's safely stored

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.330 
is the hard drive that's safely stored
inside<00:02:54.170> here<00:02:54.560> but<00:02:54.709> you<00:02:54.829> can<00:02:54.950> already<00:02:55.130> see

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
inside here but you can already see

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.530 
inside here but you can already see
there's<00:02:55.579> a<00:02:55.609> little<00:02:55.760> bit<00:02:55.910> of<00:02:56.090> water<00:02:56.329> and

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
there's a little bit of water and

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.720 
there's a little bit of water and
moisture<00:02:56.690> still<00:02:57.200> on<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:57.799> we're<00:02:58.370> gonna<00:02:58.430> pull

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
moisture still on it so we're gonna pull

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.300 
moisture still on it so we're gonna pull
it<00:02:58.880> out<00:03:02.260> this<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.410> protecting<00:03:03.829> against<00:03:04.069> heat

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
it out this is protecting against heat

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.120 
it out this is protecting against heat
this<00:03:04.760> is<00:03:04.970> protecting<00:03:05.480> against<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.870> water

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
this is protecting against the water

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.940 
this is protecting against the water
we're<00:03:07.130> gonna<00:03:07.190> cut<00:03:07.459> down<00:03:07.639> the<00:03:07.760> sides<00:03:08.000> here<00:03:08.950> like

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
we're gonna cut down the sides here like

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.069 
we're gonna cut down the sides here like
this<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:11.120> now<00:03:11.299> what<00:03:11.480> I'm<00:03:11.569> going<00:03:11.599> to<00:03:11.720> do<00:03:11.870> is<00:03:11.959> I'm

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
this and now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.970 
this and now what I'm going to do is I'm
the<00:03:12.169> safely<00:03:12.620> pull<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.790> hard<00:03:14.030> drive<00:03:14.769> out<00:03:15.769> of

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
the safely pull the hard drive out of

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.650 
the safely pull the hard drive out of
that<00:03:16.099> casing<00:03:16.400> now<00:03:16.849> this<00:03:17.060> is<00:03:17.209> pretty

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
that casing now this is pretty

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.140 
that casing now this is pretty
impressive<00:03:17.959> take<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.470> look<00:03:18.680> at<00:03:18.799> that<00:03:19.150> no

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
impressive take a look at that no

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.000 
impressive take a look at that no
scarring<00:03:20.599> from<00:03:20.900> any<00:03:21.079> heat<00:03:21.380> damage<00:03:21.410> whatsoever

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
scarring from any heat damage whatsoever

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.030 
scarring from any heat damage whatsoever
no<00:03:22.819> water<00:03:23.120> has<00:03:23.359> penetrated<00:03:23.630> this<00:03:24.260> Drive<00:03:24.560> our

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
no water has penetrated this Drive our

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.069 
no water has penetrated this Drive our
next<00:03:25.459> step<00:03:25.639> is<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.299> actually<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.750> see<00:03:26.900> if<00:03:26.989> we

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
next step is to actually to see if we

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.629 
next step is to actually to see if we
can<00:03:27.200> read<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.560> data<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:28.069> was<00:03:28.220> torched

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
can read the data that was torched

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.400 
can read the data that was torched
inside<00:03:28.940> of<00:03:29.060> this<00:03:29.120> fire

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
inside of this fire

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.800 
inside of this fire
so<00:03:31.310> we've<00:03:31.460> got<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.760> drive<00:03:32.060> plugged<00:03:32.420> into<00:03:32.600> this

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
so we've got the drive plugged into this

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.750 
so we've got the drive plugged into this
hard<00:03:33.080> drive<00:03:33.230> dock<00:03:33.620> bay<00:03:33.890> it's<00:03:34.340> connected<00:03:34.730> via
