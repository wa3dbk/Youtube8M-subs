00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:04.379
 and fields on the last matchday we put the league save and on 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:07.379
 after all, should be cheap 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:10.229
 voted for him 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:14.259
 the situation was difficult and it did not look like it would work for one 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.070
 long evening expected 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.269
 ca 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.779
 the flight became frequent 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.199
 it broke my heart when it was in a dungeon but it was easy 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.039
 no longer possible with the club bosses so I continue 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.029
 I felt too young regretted to die for regret 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.480
 there was only one direction left for scheduled 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.160
 again the services under the living room then we decide then suddenly came 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.810
 The call if I do not want to go to lunch with one of their boats 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.350
 he came home as a 17-year-old like a father to me 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.680
 had been 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.060
 Some know sunny weather outside on the terrace in the summer of 1976 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.610
 Certainly not holding back and I have zero goals for research 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.520
 and who 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.880
 are constantly Laufenburg 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.550
 back in the seventies 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.750
 Red Colombo 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.430
 much compared 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.750
 Heldt 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.270
 Westerwelle 15 15 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.330
 In 1986, they took a landmark decision at Arsenal 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.310
 the former made that a whole player jump there was the new one 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.700
 Unit At the end of the 80's at the beginning of the 90's we have again very good football 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.800
 George Cohen's second lesson showed his team the self 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.270
 had put it together now we can see but present exactly 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.890
 Although Barcelona was at this time an influential boring draw 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.890
 but fans players and coaches got from Volkshilfe 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.390
 Honeywell used everything you could hear from the athletes fans 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.829
 was 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.179
 but this course boring support we had won a lot but we were 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.320
 also very very boring 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.220
 The fans of Geneva are simply helping too much 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.950
 eleven percent of the land roads they have always looked after the old town 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.629
 we were the first British club to win the European Cup and they have 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.430
 Once again, we once wanted one 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.730
 we were the first club to win the double this century, we say 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.379
 they wanted to imitate it, we were the first to win the DFL Cup 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.409
 we already have the data behind the league cup twice in a row 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.810
 brought to the request they bring home Evian always hit the mark 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.810
 given by Josef Holler 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.969
 the driving force in north London is now Arsenal 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:41.479
 this new coach at the spots had to accept that 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:47.669
 but the TCM we come from but you have to be it they would assign them and 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:51.729
 Asia at this time had a great balance here everything was right they were 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:53.629
 better and we tried to stay 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.679
 which was not easy 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:59.669
 but when both succeeded in the arch rival in the background 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:00.349
 press 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.349
 it was four years later than usual 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:07.429
 Rasenschach 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.950
 In January 1991, Gary Lineker had impressed his team 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.790
 after performances semi-final suddenly raced was really strong but we did 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.230
 she just played out I think you can say that 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.000
 this would have to be live rock this year again is a highlight for us 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 a new semi-final also with burlesque 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:35.590
 especially as Wintersteller 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.670
 No wonder the stadium is full of atmosphere 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.670
 sensational what the quality 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:48.409
 from the league one before the reading trip others went into the game and bookmakers 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.719
 have Ostmann as correct though if we already had the league in the league 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.569
 At the time we were all mixed up on the topic, it was our turn to go first 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.569
 times before that 'friends' and what a prelude 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.979
 he would have hurt him like a rocket that would be injured at the time 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.079
 hope now 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.510
 This crosses the field of Michael Schlieben for English 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:14.959
 National Team celebrates is in fact trying to keep it up to date 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.590
 In those eyes, when he saw this at night, I have myself 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.590
 partially do not slow it down 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:26.569
 Experts completely empty the semifinals in which nothing was there 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:28.599
 but somehow did not play 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.990
 4 second behind this day 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:40.410
 Red that can be forgotten quickly 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.350
 while in a school I was the only one from Manchester 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.930
 since one of the best song Iran followers that already the day after I only 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.010
 I cried a few days ago and my self embedded the whole thing 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.460
 School to be funny when I realized he was trying the same thing 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.640
 not sure what to guess for me what map of Xiaolu Guo 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.510
 Rosemann 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.050
 that was an outstanding player of this team has theirs is over and 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.060
 because I have the entire team even if the gastro- once before 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.330
 That Cola had to get through before it was a great team performance 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.730
 Peter hoe promise of the city about ten sparked 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.729
 to clarify what our friends beat and then this one too 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.259
 The BG has had that account for a long time once again the case that 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.069
 she did not judge us as the judge condemned our country so unfortunately it lasted 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:37.080
 that now two years that we can borrow money again semifinal forward
