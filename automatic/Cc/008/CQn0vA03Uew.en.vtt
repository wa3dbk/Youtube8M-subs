00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.460 

all<00:00:01.890> right<00:00:02.159> so<00:00:02.700> I've<00:00:03.120> started<00:00:03.389> in<00:00:03.689> on<00:00:04.020> the

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
all right so I've started in on the

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.010 
all right so I've started in on the
construction<00:00:04.890> of<00:00:05.100> it<00:00:05.279> just<00:00:06.089> barely<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.660> haven't

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
construction of it just barely I haven't

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.350 
construction of it just barely I haven't
gotten<00:00:07.140> very<00:00:07.319> far<00:00:07.440> at<00:00:07.770> all<00:00:08.000> but<00:00:09.000> just<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.210> kind

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
gotten very far at all but just to kind

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.360 
gotten very far at all but just to kind
of<00:00:09.389> give<00:00:09.510> you<00:00:09.540> an<00:00:09.660> idea<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.769> process<00:00:10.950> that

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
of give you an idea of the process that

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.950 
of give you an idea of the process that
I'm<00:00:11.490> using<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.940> do<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.360> at<00:00:12.630> least<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:12.900> this

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
I'm using to do that at least for this

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.770 
I'm using to do that at least for this
initial<00:00:13.440> one<00:00:13.670> I<00:00:14.670> figured<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.360> cheapest<00:00:15.690> way

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
initial one I figured the cheapest way

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.269 
initial one I figured the cheapest way
to<00:00:15.839> do<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.139> would<00:00:16.230> be<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.410> make<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.740> at<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> two<00:00:17.100> by

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
to do it would be to make it at a two by

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.990 
to do it would be to make it at a two by
four<00:00:17.310> stock<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:19.050> basically<00:00:19.619> all<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.859> did<00:00:20.010> so

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
four stock and basically all I did so

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.670 
four stock and basically all I did so
far<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.630> ripped<00:00:21.900> down<00:00:22.080> some<00:00:22.380> two<00:00:22.500> by<00:00:22.650> fours

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
far is I ripped down some two by fours

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.820 
far is I ripped down some two by fours
to<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.460> size<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.880> wanted<00:00:24.269> for<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.500> actual

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
to the size I wanted for the the actual

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.029 
to the size I wanted for the the actual
size<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.430> bike<00:00:26.699> frame<00:00:27.800> there's<00:00:28.800> like<00:00:28.920> an

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
size of the bike frame there's like an

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.350 
size of the bike frame there's like an
inch<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.340> an<00:00:29.429> eighth<00:00:29.609> by<00:00:29.939> an<00:00:30.420> inch<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.779> half

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
inch and an eighth by an inch and a half

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.520 
inch and an eighth by an inch and a half
which<00:00:33.360> will<00:00:33.480> then<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.840> mean<00:00:33.989> that'll<00:00:34.170> be<00:00:34.260> shaped

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
which will then I mean that'll be shaped

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.380 
which will then I mean that'll be shaped
afterwards<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.340> had<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.700> square<00:00:35.940> now<00:00:36.149> for

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
afterwards so I had this square now for

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.049 
afterwards so I had this square now for
construction<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.190> then<00:00:38.190> all<00:00:38.430> I'm<00:00:38.550> doing<00:00:38.879> is

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
construction and then all I'm doing is

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.869 
construction and then all I'm doing is
I'm<00:00:39.450> just<00:00:39.750> putting<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.350> up<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.129> template

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
I'm just putting it up to the template

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.319 
I'm just putting it up to the template
that<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.120> drew<00:00:42.800> measuring<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.760> next<00:00:45.030> block

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
that I drew measuring for the next block

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.590 
that I drew measuring for the next block
and<00:00:46.280> just<00:00:47.280> cutting<00:00:47.640> them<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.420> is

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
and just cutting them in all this is

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.260 
and just cutting them in all this is
just<00:00:48.629> stacking<00:00:49.280> now<00:00:50.280> normally<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.940> would<00:00:51.120> be

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
just stacking now normally this would be

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.799 
just stacking now normally this would be
a<00:00:51.480> very<00:00:51.719> fragile<00:00:53.270> not<00:00:54.270> very<00:00:54.480> strong

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
a very fragile not very strong

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.029 
a very fragile not very strong
construction<00:00:55.379> tactic<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.360> not<00:00:58.039> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
construction tactic and it's not the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.040 
construction tactic and it's not the
only<00:00:59.160> thing<00:00:59.370> that<00:01:00.000> will<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.570> different<00:01:00.750> about

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
only thing that will be different about

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.049 
only thing that will be different about
this<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.559> reason<00:01:01.859> why<00:01:02.039> I'm<00:01:02.280> even<00:01:02.579> you

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
this and the reason why I'm even you

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.450 
this and the reason why I'm even you
know<00:01:03.180> thinking<00:01:03.809> about<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.470> because

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
know thinking about this is because

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.330 
know thinking about this is because
there<00:01:06.060> will<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.420> dowel<00:01:07.100> you<00:01:08.100> might<00:01:08.220> have

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
there will be a dowel you might have

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.590 
there will be a dowel you might have
heard<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.520> mentioned<00:01:08.790> dowel<00:01:09.000> construction<00:01:09.510> in

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
heard we mentioned dowel construction in

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.600 
heard we mentioned dowel construction in
an<00:01:09.689> earlier<00:01:09.960> video<00:01:10.250> basically<00:01:11.250> all<00:01:11.460> that

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
an earlier video basically all that

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.399 
an earlier video basically all that
means<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.090> I'm<00:01:12.510> gluing<00:01:12.900> these<00:01:13.140> pieces

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
means is that I'm gluing these pieces

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.130 
means is that I'm gluing these pieces
down<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:15.030> order<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.420> increase<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.020> amount

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
down and in order to increase the amount

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.679 
down and in order to increase the amount
of<00:01:16.290> strength<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.799> these<00:01:16.920> joints<00:01:17.430> have

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
of strength that these joints have

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.660 
of strength that these joints have
they're<00:01:18.689> glued<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.470> wood<00:01:19.890> glue<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.250> actually

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
they're glued and wood glue is actually

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.539 
they're glued and wood glue is actually
a<00:01:20.700> very<00:01:21.090> strong<00:01:21.360> bond<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.659> begin<00:01:21.900> with<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.950> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
a very strong bond to begin with but to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.460 
a very strong bond to begin with but to
add<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.970> I'm<00:01:24.570> also<00:01:24.689> going<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.140> run<00:01:25.409> a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
add to that I'm also going to run a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.410 
add to that I'm also going to run a
dowel<00:01:25.740> rod<00:01:26.070> all<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> way<00:01:26.640> through<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.270> once

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
dowel rod all the way through so once

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.120 
dowel rod all the way through so once
this<00:01:27.570> starts<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> curve<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.470> little<00:01:28.560> bit<00:01:28.710> more

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
this starts to curve a little bit more

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.160 
this starts to curve a little bit more
I'm<00:01:29.729> actually<00:01:29.909> going<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.210> drill<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> hole<00:01:30.600> all

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
I'm actually going to drill a hole all

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.649 
I'm actually going to drill a hole all
the<00:01:31.200> way<00:01:31.350> through<00:01:31.520> for<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> 1/2<00:01:32.759> inch<00:01:32.970> dowel<00:01:33.360> rod

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
the way through for a 1/2 inch dowel rod

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.620 
the way through for a 1/2 inch dowel rod
and<00:01:34.020> run<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.100> through<00:01:35.400> there<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.479> will

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
and run that through there and that will

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.200 
and run that through there and that will
increase<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.259> joint<00:01:37.560> strength<00:01:37.860> for<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.280> so

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
increase the joint strength for this so

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.289 
increase the joint strength for this so
that<00:01:39.390> will<00:01:39.509> basically<00:01:39.860> disallow<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.700> lot<00:01:42.180> of

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
that will basically disallow a lot of

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.120 
that will basically disallow a lot of
you<00:01:42.479> know<00:01:42.509> any<00:01:42.750> shifting<00:01:43.170> here<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.619> any<00:01:43.799> force

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
you know any shifting here so any force

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.670 
you know any shifting here so any force
that's<00:01:44.399> applied<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.939> way<00:01:45.409> isn't<00:01:46.409> just

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that's applied this way isn't just

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.410 
that's applied this way isn't just
splitting<00:01:47.159> along<00:01:47.430> these<00:01:47.579> joints<00:01:48.030> anymore

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
splitting along these joints anymore

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.350 
splitting along these joints anymore
it's<00:01:48.869> also<00:01:49.369> it's<00:01:50.369> being<00:01:50.579> reinforced<00:01:51.119> by<00:01:51.149> that

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
it's also it's being reinforced by that

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.300 
it's also it's being reinforced by that
dowel<00:01:51.689> rod<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.619> that's<00:01:52.770> pretty<00:01:52.920> much<00:01:53.070> how<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
dowel rod so that's pretty much how the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.420 
dowel rod so that's pretty much how the
construction<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:56.130> then<00:01:56.280> there's

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
construction is going and then there's

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.950 
construction is going and then there's
some<00:01:56.729> as<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.360> see<00:01:57.509> some<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.780> these<00:01:57.869> are

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
some as you can see some of these are

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.679 
some as you can see some of these are
going<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.200> long<00:01:58.439> pieces<00:01:59.390> just<00:02:00.390> because<00:02:00.600> of

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
going to be long pieces just because of

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.389 
going to be long pieces just because of
the<00:02:00.750> way<00:02:00.840> they<00:02:00.990> are<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.469> even<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.250> little

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
the way they are and even this little

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.740 
the way they are and even this little
curved<00:02:02.700> section<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.600> be<00:02:03.719> a

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
curved section this is going to be a

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.319 
curved section this is going to be a
bunch<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.079> little<00:02:04.320> pieces<00:02:05.119> building<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
bunch of little pieces building up the

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.619 
bunch of little pieces building up the
curve<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.849> afterwards<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.179> do<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
curve and then afterwards I can do the

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.029 
curve and then afterwards I can do the
shaping<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.590> all<00:02:10.739> going<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:11.009> a

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
shaping so this is all going to be a

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.900 
shaping so this is all going to be a
rough<00:02:11.310> instruct

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
rough instruct

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.990 
rough instruct
which<00:02:13.750> will<00:02:13.930> then<00:02:14.050> be<00:02:14.230> shaped<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:15.640> then

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
which will then be shaped and then

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.570 
which will then be shaped and then
turned<00:02:16.599> into<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.050> round<00:02:17.290> bike<00:02:17.560> frame<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.130> I

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
turned into the round bike frame that I

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.110 
turned into the round bike frame that I
really<00:02:19.420> wanted<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.720> see<00:02:20.020> so<00:02:20.950> that's<00:02:21.849> basically

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
really wanted to see so that's basically

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.330 
really wanted to see so that's basically
I<00:02:22.209> was<00:02:22.330> going<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.599> be<00:02:22.780> I've<00:02:23.739> still<00:02:24.010> got<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.160> lot

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
I was going to be I've still got a lot

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.220 
I was going to be I've still got a lot
of<00:02:24.400> work<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.730> do<00:02:24.849> obviously<00:02:25.150> I've<00:02:25.750> just<00:02:25.959> barely

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
of work to do obviously I've just barely

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.380 
of work to do obviously I've just barely
started<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.790> just<00:02:27.940> kind<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.150> give<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.330> an

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
started but just kind of give you an

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.170 
started but just kind of give you an
idea<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.110> tools<00:02:29.350> I'm<00:02:29.560> using<00:02:29.590> for<00:02:30.040> this

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
idea to the tools I'm using for this

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.000 
idea to the tools I'm using for this
using<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.480> hand<00:02:32.220> saw<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:34.510> coping<00:02:35.260> saw<00:02:35.440> or<00:02:35.739> some<00:02:35.890> of

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
using a hand saw a coping saw or some of

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.600 
using a hand saw a coping saw or some of
the<00:02:36.069> curvier<00:02:36.459> parts<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:38.709> basically<00:02:39.069> just<00:02:39.190> a

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
the curvier parts but basically just a

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.229 
the curvier parts but basically just a
hand<00:02:40.000> saw<00:02:40.989> for<00:02:41.500> all<00:02:41.709> of<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.069> so<00:02:42.700> it's<00:02:42.880> taking<00:02:43.150> me

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
hand saw for all of it so it's taking me

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.340 
hand saw for all of it so it's taking me
a<00:02:43.269> lot<00:02:43.450> longer<00:02:43.569> than<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.870> could<00:02:44.050> with<00:02:44.080> power

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
a lot longer than you could with power

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.650 
a lot longer than you could with power
saw<00:02:44.650> you've<00:02:45.489> got<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.670> power<00:02:45.910> saw<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.450> would

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
saw you've got a power saw I would

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.130 
saw you've got a power saw I would
recommend<00:02:47.050> using<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.410> because<00:02:48.220> there's<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.140> lot

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
recommend using it because there's a lot

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.620 
recommend using it because there's a lot
of<00:02:50.230> frame<00:02:50.440> components<00:02:50.769> to<00:02:51.010> do<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:52.510> that's

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
of frame components to do so that's

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.350 
of frame components to do so that's
pretty<00:02:52.750> much<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.790> when<00:02:55.090> I've<00:02:55.209> done<00:02:55.299> a

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
pretty much it and when I've done a

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.600 
pretty much it and when I've done a
little<00:02:55.540> bit<00:02:55.660> more<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.170> will<00:02:56.590> put<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.340> up<00:02:57.400> another

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
little bit more I will put it up another

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.390 
little bit more I will put it up another
little<00:02:57.850> progress<00:02:58.000> vid
