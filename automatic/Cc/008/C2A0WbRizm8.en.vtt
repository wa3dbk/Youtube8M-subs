00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.139
 then if we talked about free 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.150
 integral we are seeing in the opening 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.730
 of this test as forerunner we want 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.070
 comment on it together and certainly this 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.869
 is the entrance of who plate reverses that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.369
 the first coat of my complete defect 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.080
 here is about flat life yes 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.730
 I interrupt immediately because I know you and have 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.609
 most recently achieved a record in 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.849
 this sense even if a record of 46 laps 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.109
 of stone screw starting from 3000 m here 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.210
 then we continue in the comment of 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.620
 market because the point of view is 10 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.199
 white 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.210
 we see here is that this other 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.969
 vertical ascent for this la 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.370
 vertical that trust started but 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:50.680
 I ca n't say a man here who says I have 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.750
 found figure in fact is a name that 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.970
 however it makes the idea very much will find much e 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.780
 very picturesque silva did not call 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.970
 and that's how you get a petrol figure 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.550
 on this quite complicated period 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.790
 however convince it gathers lovers 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.289
 of the left pedal at the end of the stroke 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.560
 this instead this point narrated in 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.850
 vertical for July happen because the 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.560
 airplane scroll history 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.350
 practically rare content stopped for 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.490
 then the air which ends with a 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.350
 flared starts on the back 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.420
 that's to keep them steady 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.429
 practically in the air if you have to do 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.619
 save the need only the third one 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:32.729
 managed to cure a little with the help of 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.729
 engine with sizes 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.930
 for this you know it in the cabin also seems 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.460
 quite relaxed during the flight 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.619
 despite only the fingers millions not 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.060
 worried, here for example surely 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.049
 it does not concern the nature of this or not 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.330
 but here is the maneuver that you get 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.729
 turning the crust the belly and always 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.009
 putting a right left foot 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.020
 the case in Turin was positive 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.360
 seraph this is another name that makes 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.310
 very the idea of ​​practices from what 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.500
 he didn't even have to represent a little 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.569
 I waited here, I 'm behind someone 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.160
 so to put hand it seems there was the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.830
 he used to take a nail 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.989
 this is another confidence but tie 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.450
 another figure appears under the node of 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.239
 a really old tie 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.459
 rarely certain we are seeing 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.100
 these images on a musical basis 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.610
 I know many pilots during this type 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.170
 of performances they hear music on headphones 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.750
 again allowed also recommended 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.840
 a musical base that everyone 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.970
 chooses flies we say ripudie music 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.069
 therefore practically entertainment in ballets 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.300
 ballet workers that music can be 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.220
 also felt outside however from 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.550
 public feels the block in headphones and 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.430
 from the speakers from the audience , that's it 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.800
 this resumption of the performed cabin 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.660
 slow motion and despite this the 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.790
 ground approaches in an incredible way 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.250
 that is if I had way vertigo the door 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.450
 at altitude in the many it is approached and 400 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.040
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.770
 then anyway you can never go to 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.290
 below 100 meters at 2 the 100 mm height 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.400
 meters to this is a somersault forward 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.170
 for a further development of papa mosa 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.959
 figure as it does not seem that in others indeed 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.390
 other versions and is very complicated with 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.850
 le havre is always complicated and then not 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.200
 I don't even make her daughter 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:31.450
 here is this you are upside down but 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.450
 ancient an eraser actually wrong 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.560
 in fact the face can be seen that really 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.230
 to see the effect of the strength of 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.640
 severity 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.099
 you have to merge in the store and all this 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.719
 in four minutes this is the goal 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.060
 very beautiful because it is a new figure 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:52.040
 that the entrance from an old square 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.790
 positive life and negative square 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.400
 without it is not easy for 6 1 of the last 9 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:06.760
 as I'm point then year they have lived 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:10.120
 a novelty a golo knife is called 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.120
 this morning
