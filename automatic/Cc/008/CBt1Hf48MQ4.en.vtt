00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.230
 very good to all the ladies 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:07.630
 commented I am a teacher and welcome to 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.789
 sixth episode of blackmail with we 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:14.320
 quirÃ³s and today we have with all of us 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:16.270
 to the man of good pirouettes all and 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.470
 joker commented gentlemen I hope that you 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.630
 I like it very good, what good is it? 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.000
 we here we have the best 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.020
 assembly that has been made of call of duty 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.840
 but yes 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.960
 and the one that you like well and the one that does not 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.540
 go pick poppies obviously that 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.040
 for me you also know that I have 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.530
 more years that castolo here in the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.690
 community so it was also my 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.840
 favorite so this also has 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.980
 a double score actually in this I 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.870
 I think this is the best thing that has been 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.239
 managed to do in what is call of duty 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.370
 of the first and the most original as well 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.500
 say it and if this is what caused that 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.379
 from here everyone started 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.460
 to do montages or everything that has 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.710
 made assembly this assembly has been seen 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.080
 imagine that this assembly has three 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.790
 million visits or are and I think that 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.680
 neither face nor any other clan or has 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.180
 got never got three 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.200
 millions of visits in a montage that I 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.240
 remember let's go 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.010
 have you seen the windows interview 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.270
 with the double pistols I do not know how 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.990
 they made that effect the truth 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.730
 I guess I would take it and make a 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.500
 pistol mask would stick on the other 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.810
 side but the truth is that little weird that 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.730
 in 2008 and this type were made 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.740
 things that was super original besides 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.170
 do it from the computer and all that you know 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.810
 because this edition was 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.330
 like everything good starts the party of 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.970
 the party this moment the spaces of 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.689
 be gray but that blues is the one that gets 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.460
 there, that is, makes me run, it's just that 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.500
 he did these valuable things imagine 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.060
 which is that no one has been 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.180
 happened to do this kind of thing and 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:02:03.610
 less well triple that triple 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:07.340
 remember like this in 2008 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.500
 it was after his first local montage 2 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.430
 what funcas the 24 that was pretty 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.080
 trash I do not know if you saw it I've seen 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.209
 until the first video that went up that was 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.129
 a demo imagined is that I do not know 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.840
 what when I see it this montage in 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.530
 actually the hairlines are with 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.510
 collateral with singles with little host 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.190
 I run because it is that you imagine that 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.110
 is that before nobody went to sniper 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.090
 they did not all go there with machine guns either 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.880
 it's true that they saw this man and 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.100
 they were all playing 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.290
 usually and everyone and when you treat me is 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.360
 much more difficult to remove that is 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.500
 is that what I tell you while this 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.099
 writes 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.099
 this present 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.670
 they seem to me better clicks while I see it 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.670
 that we fall now I do not know why 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.020
 I did not know how he did this when I saw him 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.510
 the armed triangle triangle me that 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.620
 I said this man has hat and 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.340
 done and a lot of people telling him that 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.340
 I did tricks because 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.430
 When I started I started seeing friends 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.260
 and such 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.940
 I said that it was impossible to paste in the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.940
 copies of shrubs that I am 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.610
 this is epic when he is defending 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.530
 part of just day and everyone screaming 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.519
 everyone ran they were always like 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.459
 maicon 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.459
 everyone else apart if you were 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.879
 I for example I remember that it was going 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.280
 to start a game in confrontation 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.799
 in soda or they made me a triple that 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.220
 nothing is to do the triple march of the 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.220
 departure 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.810
 I had laterals across the man 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.920
 but of course this is not even before you 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.599
 you imagined not be 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.090
 the time comes that everyone 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.239
 I know I've been trying this shot 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.280
 three years is not that this has been imitated 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.079
 that is tip tweet to think about how many people 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:25.240
 has been imitated this and another how many people 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:27.130
 I will have seen or how many people have planned 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.410
 trying this 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.600
 of the campaign that was there with him is 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.510
 the super known trauma so in off and 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:38.760
 trauma that in addition to there went up a 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.760
 bonus clip that is heard as seriously 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.380
 what great strength or super music 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.970
 educational as long as you do not use it 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.520
 I 've always wanted room for something 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.520
 but never never 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.500
 the truth is that it's a bit funny 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.670
 in the next 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.990
 mother out 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.250
 imagine how we saw this those who 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.630
 we started playing call of duty and 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:18.849
 we had sensitivity 3 yes that is 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.849
 I remember that I got a team tutorial 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.370
 that's not it 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.780
 this served and I defend the strong 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.750
 when 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.790
 it is not a montage they 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:52.520
 they bite me and I see myself all by the way this 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:55.280
 is the premiere of the 720 that I tell and 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.590
 I was blown away because imagine 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.840
 that it did not even occur to me to do a 360 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.180
 sniper cross was the kids 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.110
 they would finish then I believed or that is for me 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.400
 it was impossible 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.710
 some ladies up to here the episode the 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.330
 matrix spouse I hope you have 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.830
 liked and by the way look at others 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.870
 do not matrix because they are the host 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.880
 look for it with normal audio but that 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.500
 French put link down because it's 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.460
 difficult to find them with normal audio 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.280
 because that was taken away 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.140
 that you will have in the description the 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.890
 part of original matrix so that you go 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:31.650
 to see it and as I say that the 3 for me 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.820
 better than 2 but good the other two 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:39.660
 but none 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.660
 It is very clear until after the cans
