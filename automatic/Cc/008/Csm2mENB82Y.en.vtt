00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.679
 suddenly 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.800
 well I will show you how to be a user 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:25.619
 root in your in your game 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.309
 510 or in any model of the jagua 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.750
 so first of all first of all we 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:32.750
 we must go to configurations 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:42.810
 we will go down 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.810
 up what is development options 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:51.020
 and activate usb debugging 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.020
 we activate 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.520
 and we accept to activate it 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.570
 after 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:07.460
 we will proceed to connect the usb cable 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.460
 to the computer and our device 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.160
 ready 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.720
 good now that we have the phone 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.700
 connected we will go to the page that they 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.040
 I will leave here below in the link what 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.040
 will unload on this blue door 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.640
 will install it 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.950
 after installing it and the installer 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.730
 then already after you what 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.010
 install 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.010
 they have the phone connected they have 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.550
 activated on him 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.940
 debug usb 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.020
 and now they will go to the application that 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.020
 has this icon then we click on it 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.020
 let's hope 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.370
 then in the application here below we 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.490
 it appears that it is connected to 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.350
 device and that is not rooted that 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.630
 it is not to activate it 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.630
 what we will do would be en route now 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.989
 I repeat this only this works for 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.510
 all jaguars for all 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.349
 models of the jagua and then you 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.349
 we will root 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.459
 and let's wait for a recommendation 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.989
 uninstall the antivirus because the 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.989
 antivirus will not let you do anything 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.770
 let's hope 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.770
 fifteen% 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.290
 at the end of the video I will show you what 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.100
 happens what happens to the phone when 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.460
 is surrounding 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.010
 the phone 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.470
 it rebooted was going to recovery mode then 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.590
 here are finished go around the 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.750
 we close and already here it says connected and already 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.610
 is surrounded you already have root administrator 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.790
 the phone will reboot 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.480
 automatically as or at this moment 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.480
 I will show you 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:17.100
 good when you are in 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.550
 activating and realizing what the 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:24.450
 application on the phone only with the 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.110
 cart with usb cable 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.000
 It will turn off 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.860
 in this case already when it is the second 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.190
 third time 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:38.480
 that surround him and defeat him and everything 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.660
 sat the first time the phone was 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.870
 restart 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.480
 the phone restarts the first 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.850
 alone goes off in this case I'll 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.350
 I will show how it is the first time 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.350
 that the phone is surrounded 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.400
 turns off 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.520
 and cut the video because it does you a lot 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.520
 more pay 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.170
 and will show them this once then 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.700
 this part appears to you, do not move 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:25.030
 nothing absolutely nothing will be removed and 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:28.980
 alone without being moved by anything 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.980
 restart without burning anything you 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.040
 when it is done for the first time then 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.060
 let's hope it does not take long 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.060
 restart the phone 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.820
 you do not move in anything absolutely 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.130
 nothing you from people run the phone 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.520
 is connected is once is a 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:56.740
 representation when it's the first time 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.740
 what is this procedure to surround it 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.800
 exit 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.050
 after I started the phone and 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.819
 after having rooted 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.210
 April and will have a new 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:14.210
 application 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.830
 called king or be 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:24.750
 this will be the administrator of the 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.750
 Permits that will be granted 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.280
 root permissions 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.590
