 all about strawberries cream and pins is going to 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.820

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.179
 grams of frozen strawberries and I want the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.580
 same amount of yogurt without sugar and what 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.580
 let's sweeten with a little honey 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:43.050
 a spoonful will be fine alright 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.050

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.030
 a little trick gets a spoon and 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.580
 put it in hot water and then 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.680
 simply pass it through the ice cream and 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.780
 will turn into something beautiful homemade ice cream 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.259
 without any cream without milk only yoghurt 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.240

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.030
 teach a couple of easy things to do 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.610
 with the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.770
 the first thing will be to take some ice cream 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:57.810
 of this spoon and 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:03.420
 we will put it here that more can ask 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.850
 well now I think of a meringue 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.610
 break the top in this way 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.039
 and we'll put it that way if they can 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.620
 add a little balsamic vinegar and 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.630
 it will be very nice do not you think I'm 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.180
