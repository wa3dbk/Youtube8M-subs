watered the pots over this summer

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.529 
watered the pots over this summer
because<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.489> never<00:00:47.640> want<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> let<00:00:48.180> them<00:00:48.329> get

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
because you never want to let them get

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.930 
because you never want to let them get
be<00:00:48.809> too<00:00:49.050> dry<00:00:49.350> either<00:00:49.520> because<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.640> think<00:00:50.700> that's

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
be too dry either because I think that's

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.639 
be too dry either because I think that's
the<00:00:51.090> number<00:00:51.210> one<00:00:51.510> thing<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:52.079> lose<00:00:52.440> our

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649

tulips<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.789> northwest<00:00:54.360> because<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.110> never

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
tulips in the northwest because we never

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.619 
tulips in the northwest because we never
water<00:00:55.649> them<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.280> summer<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.360> put<00:00:57.510> them

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
water them in the summer so we put them

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.299 
water them in the summer so we put them
in<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> bed<00:00:58.020> that's<00:00:58.260> far<00:00:58.530> away<00:00:58.770> or<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.100> leave

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
in a bed that's far away or we leave

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.619

them<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.609> pot<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.000> they<00:01:00.059> dry<00:01:00.329> out<00:01:00.480> and

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
them in the pot and they dry out and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.660 
them in the pot and they dry out and
just<00:01:00.780> cook<00:01:00.989> over<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> summer<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.370> trick

if you
-<00:02:13.960> but<00:02:14.560> not<00:02:14.680> too<00:02:14.950> dry<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.460> they<00:02:15.580> just<00:02:15.730> burn<00:02:16.030> up

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
- but not too dry that they just burn up

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.270 
- but not too dry that they just burn up
in<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.960> same<00:02:17.170> time<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.410> don't<00:02:17.620> leave<00:02:17.860> them<00:02:18.040> in

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
in the same time you don't leave them in

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.190 
in the same time you don't leave them in
mud<00:02:18.970> or<00:02:19.000> somewhere<00:02:19.660> where<00:02:19.750> they're<00:02:19.930> not<00:02:20.020> going

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
mud or somewhere where they're not going

mud or somewhere where they're not going
to<00:02:20.290> get<00:02:20.410> any<00:02:20.560> air<00:02:21.120> because<00:02:22.120> then<00:02:22.300> they<00:02:22.420> might

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
to get any air because then they might

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.350 
to get any air because then they might
start<00:02:22.960> rotting<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.400> safest<00:02:24.880> place<00:02:25.150> is

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
start rotting so the safest place is

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.180 
start rotting so the safest place is
always<00:02:25.750> in<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:25.990> ground<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:26.980> when<00:02:27.130> you

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
always in the ground so when you

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.890 
always in the ground so when you
transplant<00:02:27.820> your<00:02:27.940> tulips<00:02:28.300> do<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.660> anytime

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
winter of course is the best time but

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.820
