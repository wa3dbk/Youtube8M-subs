00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.320
 people and welcome to the next 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.480
 small car review of the second partners 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.070
 over the one bmw I had one 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.760
 use in both the standard edition 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.280
 to her as brown can see where and 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.650
 one in the sport edition both as me 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.650
 think 118 but soon see still on 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.200
 the next photo and yes you can 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.200
 Moreover, a number say I find very 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.470
 very sporty kept the whole thing 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.170
 So very modern was very youthful 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.210
 very excited especially in the 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.550
 city ​​inside you could always 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.350
 drive a bit faster and one 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.570
 bit back and forth what he wagging 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.370
 other cars the longer wheelbase 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.070
 have not been so great 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.500
 works and I found it very chic 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.770
 the use of the sport edition the now 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.299
 right in the interior was still 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.209
 really a round chic with the 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.060
 red with the accent and the 

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:16.189
 small fabric is approaching and that's it 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.810
 much fancier than that 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.139
 normal edition so the sport edition 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.939
 he had a lot of fun yet 

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:25.209
 Sometimes , of course, the driving skills 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.179
 I think I can hardly tell 

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:31.310
 in each bmw meanwhile this blocked 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:34.880
 driving experience switch to switch to 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.509
 a sport comfort eco pro in fact 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.609
 really can call eco pro because 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.380
 that's awesome if you look at that 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.869
 Gas pressure does not happen 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.340
 By the way, that's the sport edition 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.799
 she also has my own 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.770
 Lighting internal this sport 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.259
 edition lighting have 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.420
 and yes, I did not think so either 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.759
 Everything is very very chic about that 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.740
 very modern very youthful kept that 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.429
 is also the sport edition with 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:09.440
 red half or three quarters circle there 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:11.510
 in the interior in the speedometer and that's me 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.879
 found when you buy the insert 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.400
 want and the money for the sport 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:19.180
 edition wants then is definitely 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.890
 I suppose it was clear 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.330
 higher quality in the interior or so it 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.010
 just made more fun somehow 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.349
 although that's exactly the engine power ident 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.900
 but it was somehow more fun 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.000
 made yes the thing he has the navi 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.019
 professional in it only very briefly become 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.090
 maybe someday later 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.209
 make another review 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.280
 with the bmw online service and where to go 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.799
 So, share quotes all 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.480
 possible favorites as favorites 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.590
 I can and must save then 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.530
 can call 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.750
 so it sometimes takes forever 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.549
 until it 's loaded 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.459
 the weather function on the right is very nice 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.989
 By the way, that works all about me 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.850
 take a look at your own sim card 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.470
 car so it's not a sim card from me 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.700
 been or did not run via bluetooth 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:08.030
 via my smartphone but becomes internal 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.310
 somehow used and yes is but one 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.290
 bauble so that 's it with the 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.540
 short tutorial I find the insert 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.140
 drives very well very comfortable 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.270
 sporty teen modern 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.340
 offers accordingly a lot of space 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.150
 what you like to a bmw too 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.090
 expect has comparable to the a3 and 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.580
 all around successful car and for clear am 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.340
 Cape again and yes, thank you 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.350
 for to see wish you a great 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.700
 a great week and up to the day 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.700
