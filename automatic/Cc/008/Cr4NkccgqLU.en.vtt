00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.689

 welcome be this name or of 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.130
 minecraft and I are back with 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.550
 another as you wrote and this mode 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.880
 it's about a boss as well as some helpers 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.770
 for this mode this style is called 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.539
 the boss charged and I think it's called and 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.130
 aside I told him petra joos of a sword 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.519
 of diamond a diamond spa where is 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.710
 paranormal you have a diamond and this one 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.010
 erector that good first I'm going to 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.800
 teach this the sword and the army and 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.809
 then the boss let's move on to it 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.630
 for this we need we are going to grace 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.719
 the back we need this gold that 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.059
 It is not so much but yes to not walk 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.750
 pulling more and more pulled more is not for 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.030
 diamond and a diamond or one that does not 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.030
 and first for the sword we are going to 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.850
 need 7 diamonds a sword of 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.559
 diamond and this the wand of laws that 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.030
 the candle wand clássica the character 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:03.190
 that speak to us well with 2 gold face 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.870
 Seattle total lacaste masters and there's the 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.010
 sword and is based at night 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.510
 ok this and this sword does a lot 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.340
 damage from what I'm seeing can 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.650
 recommend using it with the boss since 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.530
 could almost not lower it so much and here the 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.530
 mods kill them with one blow and the sheep 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.159
 that more than they killed them beaten 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.469
 the engines as I tell them not to be 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.119
 advisable to use it with the boss and good 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.920
 do this for here and let's character 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.020
 the armor but first first of all 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.659
 I must say that asthma now the armor 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.069
 that you can not craft jean in the pongo 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.890
 here a kraft table and today put 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.020
 madryn not not be character today 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.250
 not here and maybe sometimes this one 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.400
 can grow up to this 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.440
 may not touch but I'm not going to do that 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.090
 so that video is not fucked because the 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.220
 third time I record this video can 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.730
 Cidade do that damn show the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.560
 pillow 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.560
 and good nothing more than once 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.860
 that they can get it out of 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.780
 of tumán items 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.700
 and then he is the equivalent of 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.580
 mesh armor nothing more than if it has 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.260
 worse faces 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.300
 here we need redzone and well go 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.150
 leaving all the armado of then they are 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.370
 let's move on to the summoner of the boss who 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.870
 for this we are going to need 9 diamonds 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.120
 that the equivalent of a block of 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.860
 diamond but here it's much more expensive than 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.870
 the diamond block because then no no 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.180
 is going to leave the boss of that week of 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.330
 this way but how did you give it as 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.980
 we said of the scorpion chief that if you 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.780
 you want your parents fear I suggest you 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.640
 that you put it at the end of your world 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.590
 when you want to finish it 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:50.150
 epic well what we are going to expose it and 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:54.780
 is a spider passes a spider and but it has 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.490
 more than 8000 lives and if you attack us a lot 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.490
 so let's put in creative let's 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.650
 to get the weak mod weapon 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.880
 steve that if he wants it hand I'm going to 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.310
 leave in the description 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:12.400
 and here is the box player and here what 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.840
 we are going to be able to kill this rodeo and how 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.070
 I say it does not leave anything so for that reason 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.020
 I will put a diamond sword 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.700
 so that it does not leave anything stock already 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.910
 They know how good those who know about us 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.560
 of this that is the phone yesterday that comes out 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.320
 with the mold level steve this those that 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.170
 Know that if you kill someone with him 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.090
 with this with this step it will not leave you 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.090
 what the chicken wants if it 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.860
 killed with this we get off the chicken and 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.450
 Well, if it 's a ship, it might work 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.190
 with that but let's try to kill ourselves 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.570
 with the diamond sword 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.570
 I think nobody understood me but well 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.040
 in you but as I tell you this this boss 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.629
 it leaves nothing 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.629
 no more than the duck does not look very good 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.350
 I think it's a kind of electric with 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:02.080
 electric kripper but they will not 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.710
 decline electrical nothing else the expensive thing 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.820
 of flu in turn 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:13.340
 to me life is not so low since 900 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.340
 up to 900 and the diamonds 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.270
 the good thing anyway this this gp not 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.710
 leave nothing and I already killed him it could be to 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.539
 things that you occupy in case 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.120
 They want to find out whether to leave something but not 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.740
 Well, I who know does not leave anything so 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.599
 will be all for this video you know that 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.060
 you can leave your light subscribe is what 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.460
 that you believe and the mod is going to be the link 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.590
 of the blog of the mocase of the mod is enough in the 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.270
 direction decided and if they have any 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.009
 doubt mediateka in the comments and I 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.310
 they can be exposed to the extent 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:52.400
 possible and I was surprised that they emerge and 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:57.289
 see you until the next goodbye 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:01.000
 I am red and enough of bullshit 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.000
 lost will be syndicated
