like this thing is awesome asked me

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.070 
like this thing is awesome asked me
about<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:20.000> if<00:00:21.000> we<00:00:21.150> go<00:00:21.270> back<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.720> beginning

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
about it if we go back to the beginning

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.630 
about it if we go back to the beginning
of<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.230> game<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.500> lot<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.920> us<00:00:23.070> were<00:00:23.220> using<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
of the game a lot of us were using the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.029 
of the game a lot of us were using the
carbine<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.269> Satchel<00:00:24.779> mines<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.740> reason

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
carbine and Satchel mines and the reason

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.500 
carbine and Satchel mines and the reason
for<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.250> was<00:00:26.490> because<00:00:26.789> they<00:00:26.939> were<00:00:27.000> actually

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
for that was because they were actually

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.240 
for that was because they were actually
really<00:00:27.810> easy<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.349> use<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.949> they<00:00:29.189> were

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
really easy to use and they were

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.150 
really easy to use and they were
efficient<00:00:29.960> bear<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.080> mind<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.439> used<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.890> for<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
efficient bear in mind I used it for the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.920 
efficient bear in mind I used it for the
longest<00:00:32.430> time<00:00:32.700> because<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.239> was<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.719> easy

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
longest time because it was just so easy

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.080 
longest time because it was just so easy
you<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.290> actually<00:00:34.620> use<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.399> when<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.880> came

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
you can actually use it when you came

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.729 
you can actually use it when you came
around<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.510> corner<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.989> gunfight<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.590> was

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
around a corner in a gunfight it was

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.680 
around a corner in a gunfight it was
faster<00:00:38.250> than<00:00:38.280> actually<00:00:38.879> shooting<00:00:39.270> at<00:00:39.420> times

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
faster than actually shooting at times

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.720 
faster than actually shooting at times
so<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.410> was<00:00:40.530> pretty<00:00:40.710> crazy<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.280> laid<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.610> at

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
so it was pretty crazy you laid it at

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.490 
so it was pretty crazy you laid it at
people's<00:00:42.120> feet<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.690> then<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.050> blew<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.410> up

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
people's feet and then you blew it up

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.810 
people's feet and then you blew it up
you<00:00:43.739> didn't<00:00:43.920> even<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.520> gun<00:00:44.789> oh

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
you didn't even have to have your gun oh

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.069 
you didn't even have to have your gun oh
you<00:00:45.149> could<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.539> DoubleTap

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
you could just DoubleTap

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.350 
you could just DoubleTap
X<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.590> they<00:00:46.680> would<00:00:46.800> blow<00:00:47.010> up<00:00:47.210> but<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.239> think

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
X and they would blow up but I think

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.330 
X and they would blow up but I think
this<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> main<00:00:49.230> difference<00:00:49.469> between<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
this is the main difference between the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.740 
this is the main difference between the
satchel<00:00:50.789> charge<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.210> grenade<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
satchel charge and the grenade and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.990 
satchel charge and the grenade and
that's<00:00:51.899> control<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.399> yes<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:53.940> very

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
that's control it's like yes it's very

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.939 
that's control it's like yes it's very
awesome<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:54.989> situations<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.620> this

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949

four seconds for it to cooks and you're

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.750 
four seconds for it to cooks and you're

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
to get some feel for it and this is the

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.800 
to get some feel for it and this is the

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.810 
are grenades very strong I started using
more<00:03:00.680> grenades<00:03:01.070> when<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.310> started<00:03:01.640> playing

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
more grenades when I started playing

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.670 
more grenades when I started playing

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
more capture the flag and when marked

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.740 
more capture the flag and when marked
for<00:03:03.829> death<00:03:04.010> came<00:03:04.280> out<00:03:04.459> because<00:03:05.090> I'm<00:03:05.269> like<00:03:05.299> wow

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
for death came out because I'm like wow

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.330 
for death came out because I'm like wow
you<00:03:05.810> can<00:03:06.200> just<00:03:06.380> whip<00:03:06.590> these<00:03:06.799> at<00:03:06.980> people's

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
you can just whip these at people's

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.979 
you can just whip these at people's
marks<00:03:07.730> like<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:08.030> don't<00:03:08.090> even<00:03:08.269> have<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.570> see<00:03:08.810> them

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
marks like I don't even have to see them

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.310 
marks like I don't even have to see them
I'm<00:03:09.170> like<00:03:09.290> this<00:03:09.440> is<00:03:09.620> too<00:03:09.890> easy<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:11.170> that's<00:03:12.170> the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
I'm like this is too easy and that's the

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.220 
I'm like this is too easy and that's the
same<00:03:12.500> way<00:03:12.680> I<00:03:12.709> feel<00:03:12.950> about<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.340> crabber<00:03:14.230> this

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
same way I feel about the crabber this

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.780 
same way I feel about the crabber this
is<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.380> pretty<00:03:15.590> nice<00:03:15.739> grenade<00:03:15.950> here<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.459> you

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
is a pretty nice grenade here and you

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.430 
is a pretty nice grenade here and you
can't<00:03:17.000> do<00:03:17.150> this<00:03:17.269> with<00:03:17.480> satchel<00:03:17.900> charges<00:03:18.170> you

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
can't do this with satchel charges you

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.199 
can't do this with satchel charges you
can<00:03:18.560> do<00:03:18.650> this<00:03:18.799> with<00:03:18.950> arc<00:03:19.160> grenades<00:03:19.549> yes

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
can do this with arc grenades yes

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.750 
can do this with arc grenades yes
but<00:03:20.930> it's<00:03:21.350> kind<00:03:21.799> of<00:03:21.829> different<00:03:22.010> because<00:03:22.370> it

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
but it's kind of different because it

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.099 
but it's kind of different because it
doesn't<00:03:23.090> do<00:03:23.150> as<00:03:23.299> much<00:03:23.450> damage<00:03:23.480> you're<00:03:23.989> gonna

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
doesn't do as much damage you're gonna

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.559 
doesn't do as much damage you're gonna
usually<00:03:24.709> have<00:03:24.859> to<00:03:24.980> throw<00:03:25.190> two<00:03:25.400> of<00:03:25.549> them<00:03:25.640> and

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
usually have to throw two of them and

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.059 
usually have to throw two of them and
once<00:03:26.780> you<00:03:26.870> get<00:03:26.989> good<00:03:27.170> at<00:03:27.319> cooking<00:03:27.470> them<00:03:27.829> you

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
once you get good at cooking them you

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.039 
once you get good at cooking them you
can<00:03:28.190> just<00:03:28.400> throw<00:03:28.670> them<00:03:28.850> out<00:03:29.000> if<00:03:29.750> you<00:03:29.930> don't

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
can just throw them out if you don't

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.690 
can just throw them out if you don't
actually<00:03:30.290> see<00:03:30.500> a<00:03:30.709> target<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:31.190> store<00:03:31.430> it<00:03:31.519> at<00:03:31.609> the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
actually see a target to store it at the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.670 
actually see a target to store it at the
nearest<00:03:32.060> red<00:03:32.510> dot<00:03:32.780> on<00:03:32.930> your<00:03:32.959> radar<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:33.560> it

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
nearest red dot on your radar and it

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.490 
nearest red dot on your radar and it
works<00:03:33.859> great<00:03:34.989> eventually<00:03:35.989> you're<00:03:36.109> gonna<00:03:36.200> feel

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
works great eventually you're gonna feel

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.199 
works great eventually you're gonna feel
as<00:03:36.680> comfortable<00:03:37.190> with<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.459> frag<00:03:37.730> grenade<00:03:38.060> as

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
as comfortable with the frag grenade as

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.319 
as comfortable with the frag grenade as
you<00:03:38.510> do<00:03:38.720> with<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.140> satchel<00:03:39.590> charge<00:03:40.060> now<00:03:41.060> while

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
you do with the satchel charge now while

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.699 
you do with the satchel charge now while
there<00:03:41.569> is<00:03:41.660> a<00:03:41.690> little<00:03:42.019> bit<00:03:42.139> more<00:03:42.350> of<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.530> learning

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
there is a little bit more of a learning

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.640 
there is a little bit more of a learning
curve<00:03:43.069> for<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.639> grenade<00:03:44.060> it's<00:03:45.049> definitely

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
curve for the grenade it's definitely

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.319 
curve for the grenade it's definitely
worth<00:03:45.799> it<00:03:46.040> it's<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.400> lot<00:03:46.549> of<00:03:46.609> fun<00:03:46.880> it's<00:03:47.090> kind<00:03:47.299> of

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
worth it it's a lot of fun it's kind of

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.479 
worth it it's a lot of fun it's kind of
like<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.750> wing<00:03:47.959> man<00:03:48.260> as<00:03:48.709> well<00:03:48.859> as<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.130> crabber

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
like the wing man as well as the crabber

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:50.890 
like the wing man as well as the crabber
it's<00:03:49.760> one<00:03:49.910> of<00:03:50.030> those<00:03:50.090> weapons<00:03:50.329> that<00:03:50.569> you<00:03:50.780> need

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
it's one of those weapons that you need

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.530 
it's one of those weapons that you need
to<00:03:50.989> put<00:03:51.139> a<00:03:51.170> little<00:03:51.290> bit<00:03:51.500> more<00:03:51.709> time<00:03:52.010> into<00:03:52.730> but

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
to put a little bit more time into but

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.420 
to put a little bit more time into but
you're<00:03:54.109> definitely<00:03:54.380> gonna<00:03:54.650> appreciate<00:03:54.980> it

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
you're definitely gonna appreciate it

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.789 
you're definitely gonna appreciate it
later<00:03:55.609> on<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:56.239> you<00:03:56.900> never<00:03:56.989> know<00:03:57.260> you<00:03:57.319> manned

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
this last clip is kind of continuous and

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.960 
this last clip is kind of continuous and
I'm<00:04:03.290> just<00:04:03.380> gonna<00:04:03.470> commentate<00:04:04.069> it<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.400> this<00:04:04.819> is

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
I'm just gonna commentate it and this is

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.350 
I'm just gonna commentate it and this is
typically<00:04:05.239> what<00:04:05.449> I<00:04:05.510> do<00:04:05.630> in<00:04:05.930> my<00:04:05.959> regular

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
typically what I do in my regular

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.880 
typically what I do in my regular
episodes<00:04:07.810> where<00:04:08.080> I<00:04:08.110> just<00:04:08.380> break<00:04:08.530> down<00:04:08.560> one

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
episodes where I just break down one

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.200 
episodes where I just break down one
complete-game<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.550> kind<00:04:09.880> of<00:04:09.940> do<00:04:10.030> like<00:04:10.060> a

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
complete-game I kind of do like a

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.390 
complete-game I kind of do like a
montage<00:04:10.780> of<00:04:10.840> what<00:04:11.170> happened<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:11.980> go<00:04:12.160> over<00:04:12.280> the

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
mechanics and just kind of like the meta

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.650 
mechanics and just kind of like the meta
game<00:04:19.209> of<00:04:19.510> how<00:04:19.660> people<00:04:20.019> are<00:04:20.140> doing<00:04:20.290> things<00:04:21.660> and

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
game of how people are doing things and

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.210 
game of how people are doing things and
I<00:04:22.750> didn't<00:04:22.990> see<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:23.260> guy<00:04:23.410> here<00:04:23.680> but<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:23.860> just<00:04:23.920> had

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
I didn't see the guy here but I just had

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.650 
I didn't see the guy here but I just had
to<00:04:24.340> assume<00:04:24.640> he<00:04:24.820> was<00:04:24.940> gonna<00:04:25.060> go<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:25.600> way

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
to assume he was gonna go that way

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.090 
to assume he was gonna go that way
considering<00:04:26.230> that<00:04:26.380> there<00:04:26.530> was<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.650> Titan<00:04:27.010> on

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
considering that there was a Titan on

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.440 
considering that there was a Titan on
the<00:04:27.250> other<00:04:27.370> side<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:30.790> next<00:04:31.060> grenade<00:04:31.300> that

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
the other side and the next grenade that

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.430 
the other side and the next grenade that
you're<00:04:31.540> gonna<00:04:31.630> see<00:04:31.990> would<00:04:32.230> have<00:04:32.320> been<00:04:32.410> a

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
you're gonna see would have been a

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.080 
you're gonna see would have been a
little<00:04:32.650> bit<00:04:32.800> more<00:04:32.980> difficult<00:04:33.550> with<00:04:33.850> the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
little bit more difficult with the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.760 
little bit more difficult with the
satchel<00:04:34.570> even<00:04:34.840> though<00:04:34.960> there<00:04:35.110> was<00:04:35.230> a<00:04:35.260> Titan<00:04:35.680> on

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
satchel even though there was a Titan on

satchel even though there was a Titan on
Titan<00:04:36.160> fight<00:04:36.400> because<00:04:36.910> usually<00:04:37.090> during<00:04:37.480> that

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
Titan fight because usually during that

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.940 
Titan fight because usually during that
time<00:04:37.930> they're<00:04:38.230> not<00:04:38.260> even<00:04:38.560> gonna<00:04:38.680> notice

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950
