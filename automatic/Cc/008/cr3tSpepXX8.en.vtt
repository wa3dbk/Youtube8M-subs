00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
probably seen the video they did with

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.179 
probably seen the video they did with
McKinnon's<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.350> I<00:00:22.350> thought<00:00:22.800> was<00:00:22.890> really<00:00:22.949> cool

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
McKinnon's and I thought was really cool

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.380 
McKinnon's and I thought was really cool
and<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.369> started<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.000> while<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.330> I

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
and I started it for a while and I

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.960 
and I started it for a while and I
couldn't<00:00:24.689> figure<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.930> out<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.140> didn't<00:00:25.500> know<00:00:25.970> how

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
couldn't figure it out I didn't know how

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.259 
couldn't figure it out I didn't know how
they<00:00:27.180> did<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.660> looked<00:00:27.869> at<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.099> is

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
they did it I looked at it and it is

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:36.410 
they did it I looked at it and it is
much<00:00:31.430> much<00:00:32.430> different<00:00:32.700> than<00:00:35.390> what<00:00:36.390> I

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
much much different than what I

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.780 
much much different than what I
originally<00:00:36.570> thought<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.200> was<00:00:37.380> which<00:00:37.620> was

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
originally thought it was which was

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:47.299 
originally thought it was which was
something<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:43.489> that<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.739> button<00:00:47.070> there

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
something like that and a button there

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.959 
something like that and a button there
that<00:00:47.789> busy<00:00:48.180> work<00:00:48.500> but<00:00:49.500> um<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:50.430> was<00:00:50.550> hard<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.820> see

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
that busy work but um it was hard to see

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.850 
that busy work but um it was hard to see
in<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> video<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.780> tested<00:00:52.289> my<00:00:52.410> own<00:00:52.530> designs

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
in the video so I tested my own designs

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.810 
in the video so I tested my own designs
and<00:00:53.190> I'll<00:00:53.489> show<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.969> got<00:00:55.340> so<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
and I'll show you what I got so for the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.209 
and I'll show you what I got so for the
gravel<00:00:57.149> layer<00:00:57.500> there's<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.590> button<00:00:58.800> here<00:01:01.219> right

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
gravel layer there's a button here right

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.950 
gravel layer there's a button here right
on<00:01:02.370> top<00:01:02.579> look<00:01:02.730> at<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.539> way<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.809> works

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
on top look at that the way this works

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.310 
on top look at that the way this works
is<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.559> need<00:01:05.549> time<00:01:05.850> because<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.110> put<00:01:07.140> a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
is I need time because if you put a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.450 
is I need time because if you put a
button<00:01:07.560> uh<00:01:09.409> right<00:01:10.409> there<00:01:10.619> say<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.250> would

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
button uh right there say it would

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.830 
button uh right there say it would
activate<00:01:11.790> both<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.150> them<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.510> activate

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
activate both of them but we activate

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.719 
activate both of them but we activate
them<00:01:12.960> at<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.110> wrong<00:01:13.290> time<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.490> key<00:01:14.610> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
them at the wrong time so the key to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.240 
them at the wrong time so the key to
this<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.000> time<00:01:15.380> what<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.470> need<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.650> do<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
this is time what you need to do for the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.590 
this is time what you need to do for the
button<00:01:17.430> right<00:01:17.610> there<00:01:17.640> or<00:01:18.000> lever<00:01:18.270> doesn't

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
button right there or lever doesn't

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.330 
button right there or lever doesn't
matter<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.530> even<00:01:19.650> pressure<00:01:20.009> plate<00:01:20.250> on

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
matter you can even pressure plate on

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.160 
matter you can even pressure plate on
top<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.330> pretty<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:22.020> right

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
an SMP so we I thought of it is you can

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.640 
an SMP so we I thought of it is you can
make<00:01:52.400> a<00:01:52.430> war<00:01:52.670> weapon<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.330> this<00:01:54.080> is<00:01:54.320> awesome

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
make a war weapon and this is awesome

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.109 
make a war weapon and this is awesome
look<00:01:54.770> like<00:01:54.920> sort<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.340> like<00:01:55.400> a<00:01:55.490> catapult<00:01:55.940> or

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
look like sort of like a catapult or

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.780 
look like sort of like a catapult or
something<00:01:56.420> I'm<00:01:56.540> not<00:01:56.690> sure<00:01:57.190> it's<00:01:58.190> a<00:01:58.310> small<00:01:58.520> line

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
something I'm not sure it's a small line

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.050 
something I'm not sure it's a small line
but<00:01:59.560> it<00:02:00.560> works<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.860> same<00:02:00.890> way<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.729> works<00:02:01.909> with

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
but it works the same way it works with

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.810 
but it works the same way it works with
gravel<00:02:02.420> or<00:02:02.540> sand<00:02:02.570> or<00:02:02.950> even<00:02:03.950> items<00:02:04.310> if<00:02:04.490> I<00:02:04.610> want

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
gravel or sand or even items if I want

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.010 
gravel or sand or even items if I want
to<00:02:04.909> back<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:05.450> up<00:02:06.790> this<00:02:07.790> is<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.179> brass<00:02:08.420> block<00:02:08.810> on

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
to back it up this is the brass block on

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:18.770 
to back it up this is the brass block on
it

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.790 

not<00:02:19.500> quite<00:02:19.860> sure<00:02:19.890> where<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.490> went<00:02:21.350> but<00:02:22.350> it

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
not quite sure where that went but it

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.010 
not quite sure where that went but it
shoots<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.610> don't<00:02:24.480> know<00:02:24.540> what<00:02:24.660> reason<00:02:24.840> you

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
shoots it I don't know what reason you

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.250 
shoots it I don't know what reason you
have<00:02:25.170> for<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.440> but<00:02:26.090> either<00:02:27.090> way<00:02:27.300> let's<00:02:28.080> get

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
have for that but either way let's get

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.440 
have for that but either way let's get
into<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.650> innards<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.490> one<00:02:29.670> pretty<00:02:30.240> much

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
into the innards of this one pretty much

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.480 
into the innards of this one pretty much
this<00:02:30.870> one<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.470> same<00:02:31.680> as<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.069> one<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.430> was

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
this one is the same as that one it was

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.970 
this one is the same as that one it was
a<00:02:32.610> failed<00:02:32.819> design<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:34.200> still<00:02:34.590> works<00:02:34.830> it

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
a failed design it it still works it

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.090 
a failed design it it still works it
doesn't<00:02:35.280> look<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.640> way<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.790> wanted<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:37.100> and

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
doesn't look the way I wanted to and

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.880 
doesn't look the way I wanted to and
there<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.520> go<00:02:39.350> but<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:42.150> way<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.360> works<00:02:42.540> is

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
there you go but the way it works is

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.180 
there you go but the way it works is
you're<00:02:43.890> going<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.340> have<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:45.739> it's<00:02:46.739> it's<00:02:46.980> pretty

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
you're going to have to it's it's pretty

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.500 
you're going to have to it's it's pretty
much<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.340> same<00:02:47.550> design<00:02:47.760> fault<00:02:48.000> except<00:02:48.390> for

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
much the same design fault except for

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.820 
much the same design fault except for
this<00:02:48.569> one<00:02:48.630> or<00:02:48.840> else<00:02:48.989> find<00:02:49.110> out<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.500> second

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
this one or else find out in a second

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.650 
this one or else find out in a second
which<00:02:50.310> actually<00:02:50.489> didn't<00:02:50.820> require<00:02:51.239> any<00:02:51.300> time

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
which actually didn't require any time

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.500 
which actually didn't require any time
you<00:02:51.780> get<00:02:51.840> all<00:02:51.959> but<00:02:52.940> this<00:02:53.940> lever<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.360> and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
you get all but this lever is and

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.240 
you get all but this lever is and
activates<00:02:54.870> redstone<00:02:55.260> below<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:56.070> one

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
activates redstone below it and that one

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.259 
activates redstone below it and that one
that<00:02:56.459> one's<00:02:56.610> going<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.790> go<00:02:56.880> straight<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.239> that

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
that one's going to go straight to that

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.940 
that one's going to go straight to that
block<00:02:57.630> which<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.050> turn<00:02:58.290> will<00:02:58.440> activate<00:02:58.769> that

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
block which in turn will activate that

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.060 
block which in turn will activate that
directly<00:02:59.370> the<00:03:00.180> other<00:03:00.330> one<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.980> going<00:03:01.980> to

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
directly the other one is going to

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.740 
directly the other one is going to
activate<00:03:02.370> redstone<00:03:02.880> going<00:03:03.150> through<00:03:03.360> here<00:03:03.600> and

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
activate redstone going through here and

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.509 
activate redstone going through here and
then<00:03:03.870> into<00:03:04.110> this<00:03:04.230> block<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:05.040> block<00:03:05.370> is

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
then into this block that block is

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.090 
then into this block that block is
powered<00:03:05.940> which<00:03:06.569> means<00:03:06.840> this<00:03:07.170> redstone<00:03:07.769> torch

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
powered which means this redstone torch

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.370 
powered which means this redstone torch
is<00:03:08.280> not<00:03:08.459> Howard<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.690> rich<00:03:09.840> santosh<00:03:10.200> is

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
is not Howard and that rich santosh is

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.410 
is not Howard and that rich santosh is
powered<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.580> powers<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:11.970> blog<00:03:12.180> and

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
powered and that powers the blog and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.150 
powered and that powers the blog and
power<00:03:12.600> sophistic<00:03:13.160> some<00:03:14.160> turn<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.430> off<00:03:16.160> this

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
power sophistic some turn it off this

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.979 
power sophistic some turn it off this
one<00:03:17.310> was<00:03:17.430> powered<00:03:17.850> I<00:03:18.060> think<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.600> one<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.750> not

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
one was powered I think that one is not

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.590 
one was powered I think that one is not
because<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.250> Minecraft<00:03:20.910> uses<00:03:21.150> binary

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
because of the Minecraft uses binary

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.280 
because of the Minecraft uses binary
math<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.140> that's<00:03:22.769> how<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:22.980> works<00:03:24.140> so<00:03:25.140> this

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
math and that's how it works so this

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.890 
math and that's how it works so this
design<00:03:25.940> Cadillac<00:03:26.940> like<00:03:27.209> weapon<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.720> could

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
design Cadillac like weapon and I could

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.960 
design Cadillac like weapon and I could
tweak<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.260> or<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:29.190> know<00:03:29.310> come<00:03:29.579> up<00:03:29.670> something

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
tweak it or you know come up something

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.120 
tweak it or you know come up something
else<00:03:30.120> for<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.750> way<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:30.900> works<00:03:31.079> is<00:03:31.260> let's<00:03:31.530> get

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
else for the way it works is let's get

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:40.400 
else for the way it works is let's get
rid<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.310> all<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.549> excess<00:03:33.620> this<00:03:34.620> leather<00:03:35.840> lever

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.530 

activates<00:03:41.760> rest<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:42.940> below<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.210> and<00:03:43.330> now

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
activates rest and below it and now

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.790 
activates rest and below it and now
without<00:03:43.690> when<00:03:44.020> they<00:03:44.110> strayed<00:03:44.350> into<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.560> block

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
without when they strayed into a block

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
without when they strayed into a block
which<00:03:45.580> leads<00:03:45.910> into<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:48.040> with<00:03:48.370> some<00:03:48.580> torch

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
which leads into that with some torch

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.340 
which leads into that with some torch
and<00:03:49.060> activates<00:03:49.540> of<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:49.780> gravitational

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
and activates of that gravitational

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.230 
and activates of that gravitational
piston<00:03:50.650> Oh<00:03:52.710> below<00:03:53.710> it<00:03:54.310> goes<00:03:54.550> into<00:03:54.700> an<00:03:54.880> inverter

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
piston Oh below it goes into an inverter

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.450 
piston Oh below it goes into an inverter
and<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.570> inverter<00:03:55.900> activates<00:03:56.860> that<00:03:57.190> block

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
and the inverter activates that block

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.630 
and the inverter activates that block
which<00:03:57.640> activates<00:03:58.030> to<00:03:58.150> that<00:03:58.270> piston<00:03:59.430> so<00:04:00.430> if<00:04:00.550> i

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
which activates to that piston so if i

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.700 
which activates to that piston so if i
switch<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.210> here<00:04:01.750> in<00:04:01.870> go<00:04:01.990> same<00:04:02.200> time<00:04:02.440> and

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
switch it here in go same time and

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.470 
switch it here in go same time and
luckily<00:04:02.890> that's<00:04:03.220> a<00:04:03.430> well<00:04:03.730> enough<00:04:03.940> time<00:04:04.090> I

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
luckily that's a well enough time I

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.000 
luckily that's a well enough time I
didn't<00:04:04.960> need<00:04:05.080> any<00:04:05.940> repeaters<00:04:07.590> so<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.740> is<00:04:08.890> the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
didn't need any repeaters so that is the

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.790 
didn't need any repeaters so that is the
easiest<00:04:09.280> design<00:04:09.550> I<00:04:09.580> came<00:04:09.820> up<00:04:09.940> with<00:04:09.970> um<00:04:10.800> it's

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
easiest design I came up with um it's

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.390 
easiest design I came up with um it's
actually<00:04:11.920> kind<00:04:12.459> of<00:04:12.550> a<00:04:12.700> copy<00:04:12.940> of<00:04:13.060> itself<00:04:13.270> and

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
actually kind of a copy of itself and

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.259 
actually kind of a copy of itself and

you can you know you can make whatever
you<00:04:16.480> want<00:04:16.690> with<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.840> make<00:04:17.260> how<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.769> looks<00:04:18.010> and

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
you want with it make how it looks and

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.569 
you want with it make how it looks and
or<00:04:18.760> make<00:04:19.109> everyone<00:04:20.109> look<00:04:20.320> but<00:04:20.680> such<00:04:21.040> as<00:04:21.220> S&amp;P

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579

coated<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.210> thought<00:04:22.900> this<00:04:22.990> would<00:04:23.080> be<00:04:23.140> really

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
coated I thought this would be really

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.110 
coated I thought this would be really
cool<00:04:23.620> to<00:04:23.680> have<00:04:23.950> like<00:04:23.980> a<00:04:24.100> war<00:04:24.370> with<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.880> have

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
some tea I haven't found the design yet

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.530 
some tea I haven't found the design yet
that<00:04:27.340> will<00:04:27.460> shoot<00:04:27.669> keen<00:04:27.850> to<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.180> because<00:04:28.450> the

grabbed<00:04:30.730> dee<00:04:30.940> dee<00:04:31.450> said<00:04:31.660> gravity<00:04:32.050> because

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
grabbed dee dee said gravity because

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.860 
grabbed dee dee said gravity because
their<00:04:32.830> gravity<00:04:33.130> blocks<00:04:33.400> but<00:04:33.850> if<00:04:34.120> i<00:04:34.240> put<00:04:34.450> tnt<00:04:34.840> on

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
their gravity blocks but if i put tnt on

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.290 
their gravity blocks but if i put tnt on
there

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.749 

I<00:04:40.360> put<00:04:42.930> CT<00:04:43.930> on<00:04:44.080> there<00:04:44.289> what<00:04:45.129> was<00:04:45.250> my<00:04:45.370> work<00:04:45.580> has

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
I put CT on there what was my work has

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.600 
I put CT on there what was my work has
there's<00:04:45.970> one<00:04:46.120> there<00:04:46.330> aren't<00:04:46.629> that<00:04:46.750> home<00:04:47.610> well

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
there's one there aren't that home well

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.649 
there's one there aren't that home well
let's<00:04:48.759> see<00:04:48.819> that<00:04:48.970> didn't<00:04:49.150> work<00:04:49.270> it<00:04:49.479> didn't

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:49.659 
let's see that didn't work it didn't

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:51.659 
let's see that didn't work it didn't
activate<00:04:49.930> it<00:04:50.080> because<00:04:50.289> as<00:04:50.889> you<00:04:51.159> activate<00:04:51.550> it

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
activate it because as you activate it

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.460 
activate it because as you activate it
and<00:04:51.699> not<00:04:51.970> quite<00:04:52.240> sure<00:04:52.270> if<00:04:52.750> you<00:04:53.050> come<00:04:53.199> with<00:04:53.319> your

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
and not quite sure if you come with your

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.129 
and not quite sure if you come with your
own<00:04:53.560> design<00:04:53.800> uh<00:04:54.300> tell<00:04:55.300> me<00:04:55.330> and<00:04:55.690> I'll<00:04:55.780> test<00:04:56.020> it

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
own design uh tell me and I'll test it

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.260 
own design uh tell me and I'll test it
out<00:04:56.259> but<00:04:57.129> that's<00:04:57.400> gravitational<00:04:57.849> forces<00:04:58.060> guys

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
out but that's gravitational forces guys

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.339 
out but that's gravitational forces guys
thanks<00:04:58.569> for<00:04:58.599> watching<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:59.110> I'll<00:04:59.169> see<00:04:59.199> you
