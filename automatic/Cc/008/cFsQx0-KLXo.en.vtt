00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
zoom roll just because it's physical

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.259 
zoom roll just because it's physical
would<00:02:57.709> still<00:02:58.010> do<00:02:58.160> more<00:02:58.340> than<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.700> especially

would<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.239> do<00:03:29.599> that<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:30.049> then<00:03:30.109> code<00:03:30.319> it<00:03:30.440> kills

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
would you do that and then code it kills

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
know would actually do figure them out

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.800

danger<00:04:34.610> so<00:04:34.760> I<00:04:34.790> don't<00:04:34.970> know<00:04:35.090> why<00:04:35.270> could<00:04:35.570> he<00:04:35.600> did

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
danger so I don't know why could he did

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.129 
danger so I don't know why could he did
it<00:04:35.900> just<00:04:35.930> do<00:04:36.290> that<00:04:36.850> now<00:04:37.850> what<00:04:38.540> happens<00:04:38.900> is<00:04:39.110> that

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
it just do that now what happens is that

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.140 
it just do that now what happens is that
Moltres<00:04:39.650> comes<00:04:39.950> it<00:04:40.130> makes<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.610> game<00:04:40.820> super

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
Moltres comes it makes the game super

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.600 
Moltres comes it makes the game super
laggy<00:04:41.419> because<00:04:41.720> you<00:04:42.139> know<00:04:42.290> Moltres<00:04:42.770> has<00:04:43.370> all

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
laggy because you know Moltres has all

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.159 
laggy because you know Moltres has all
those<00:04:43.760> old<00:04:43.970> flames<00:04:44.270> coming<00:04:44.630> out<00:04:44.690> of<00:04:44.750> him<00:04:44.960> and

those old flames coming out of him and

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.320 
those old flames coming out of him and
that<00:04:45.230> makes<00:04:45.560> what<00:04:45.830> actually<00:04:46.790> makes<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.150> game

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
that makes what actually makes the game

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.899 
it's gonna go to the other opponent but
since<00:06:37.439> it's<00:06:37.740> a<00:06:37.830> partner<00:06:38.099> pokemon<00:06:38.550> that

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:38.909 
since it's a partner pokemon that

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:41.839 
since it's a partner pokemon that
doesn't<00:06:39.300> happen<00:06:39.389> so<00:06:40.099> moonblast<00:06:41.099> yeah<00:06:41.639> that

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:41.849 
doesn't happen so moonblast yeah that

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:44.649 
doesn't happen so moonblast yeah that
does<00:06:41.969> a<00:06:41.999> lot<00:06:42.210> of<00:06:42.270> damage<00:06:42.419> to<00:06:42.779> it<00:06:42.839> before<00:06:43.169> just

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:44.659 
does a lot of damage to it before just

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:47.119 
does a lot of damage to it before just
stuff<00:06:45.659> like<00:06:45.749> that<00:06:46.050> and<00:06:46.319> then<00:06:46.770> you<00:06:47.009> know

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:47.129 
stuff like that and then you know

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:49.219 
stuff like that and then you know
there's<00:06:47.430> Cody<00:06:47.729> here<00:06:48.120> who<00:06:48.419> actually<00:06:48.779> didn't

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:49.229 
there's Cody here who actually didn't

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:52.309 
there's Cody here who actually didn't
realize<00:06:49.529> I<00:06:50.189> guess<00:06:51.180> that<00:06:51.569> you<00:06:51.749> know<00:06:51.779> if<00:06:52.139> you

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 
realize I guess that you know if you

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:55.279 
realize I guess that you know if you
attack<00:06:52.680> the<00:06:53.309> Moltres<00:06:53.849> that<00:06:54.629> it<00:06:55.110> could

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289 
attack the Moltres that it could

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.679 
attack the Moltres that it could
actually<00:06:55.319> you<00:06:55.710> know<00:06:55.740> be<00:06:56.009> game<00:06:56.249> over<00:06:56.430> so<00:06:56.909> he

00:06:57.679 --> 00:06:57.689 
actually you know be game over so he

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:59.839 
actually you know be game over so he
goes<00:06:57.839> for<00:06:58.020> Aquajet<00:06:58.649> he<00:06:59.249> probably<00:06:59.550> should<00:06:59.819> have

00:06:59.839 --> 00:06:59.849 
goes for Aquajet he probably should have

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:01.279 
goes for Aquajet he probably should have
just<00:06:59.939> gone<00:07:00.180> for<00:07:00.419> not<00:07:00.539> quite<00:07:00.719> good<00:07:00.870> against<00:07:01.110> the

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:01.289 
just gone for not quite good against the

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:06.049 
just gone for not quite good against the
