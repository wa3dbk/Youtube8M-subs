00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.120
 very interesting exercise 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.630
 leading such an exercise which 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.620
 isolates the abdominal muscles and less 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.649
 are working 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:10.089
 as if 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:12.689
 auxiliary muscles for example very 

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.099
 often for transshipment of the belt are connected 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.630
 so-called lumbar 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.179
 iliac muscle 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:19.929
 for example, it does not correctly 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:21.880
 exercise trip does not work 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.099
 here is the opposite 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.029
 we try to maximize 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.519
 it is the abdominal muscles big weight 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:28.839
 but the abs muscles feel it 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.269
 extraordinarily well provided you 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.870
 learn to sync 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.740
 absolutely your hands 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.350
 that is, if your hands move 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.580
 regardless of the body of all instead 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.250
 workout is understandable 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.790
 starts working 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.550
 now back cost 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.080
 that is, the main thing is that I am all by hand and 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.730
 now but not show you 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.450
 becomes back to the bottom block 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.000
 widely divorced many of the wonders gibayat 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.150
 your knees after which you need all the muscles 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.230
 and the joints are frozen and 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.230
 now try to focus 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.190
 before a little 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.190
 need to feel cooler 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.290
 only belt work for him 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.220
 note that 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.230
 angle 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.730
 between hand 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.110
 and hull 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.110
 does not change at all 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.049
 with the case so 10 15 times if you get 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.800
 more on Thursday need to increase 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.250
 we are finishing 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.880
 when we lean down 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.980
 it will be their business 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.090
 when it’s maximum that this time we occupy 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.590
 press do a little fell the basics 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.470
 daughters 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.990
 peak reduction straight 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.470
 abdominal muscles 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.820
 advantage works direct 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.680
 muscles fore 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.630
 fast walls see here 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.570
 what are we for example 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.020
 n 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.109
 let's say until the end you do not develop 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:08.940
 the expert explained that you won’t beat 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.940
 nation over another yes it is so 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.659
 I did not relax him
