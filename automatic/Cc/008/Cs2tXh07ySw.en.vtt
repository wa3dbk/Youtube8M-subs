00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:11.290
 I'm the best you know in the world 

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:11.290
 so the first answer is wrong 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.259
 now the second question who is the most 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.259
 strong of the world 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:28.730
 I am the truest wrong answer 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:32.899
 the more I make the world, the more I myself am 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.950
 example they can raise this I can 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.950
 do it myself 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:49.940
 agree but you must know how to do almost 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:51.920
 you mean this agree no you don't 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:01:00.920
 you must know how to do this who is stronger 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:07.220
 I the exact robot the strongest in the world 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.570
 I'm the one who gave me what you have 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.250
 both answers wrong 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.640
 the bird will have to stay to work that 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.260
 forever or dirty and with the weak 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.750
 take me in his place 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.620
 I agree, I prefer it too 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.230
 the working bear no I will stay here 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.720
 well necklaces better the strength of a robot 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.330
 no since everyone wants to stay 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.100
 I will choose what to do 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.230
 you are used without my permission 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.780
 cave and you ate my food but 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.050
 given the strength of the love you feel 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.180
 one for the other forgives you 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:46.340
 from now on we will be friends of 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.340
 friends have to share the right food 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:57.590
 you will certainly be hungry take that 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:57.590
 that you want arrived here
