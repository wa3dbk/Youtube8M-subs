00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.110
 days lasted until I 160 again 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:49.149
 Inquiries had it really extremely violent 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.260
 and not really manageable that 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.870
 I have to do this I can 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.500
 namely not accept everything

 but would like to honestly ask 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.130
 now here I have what interests me 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.330
 but I do not want to be told 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:45.230
 that I'm up to 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:48.410
 my friend all right , he should be better 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:53.630
 when i do that i have to stay around so much 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:58.190
 best where the driving time says 435 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.750

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.110

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.460

 not fast but alright anymore 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.680
 back is the graphics a bit high 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.330
 because the video quality is always 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.090
 the more important I am on youtube 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.610
 grow and always flow graphic to gamble 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.390
 is not necessarily good 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.010
 artwork has never interested me but 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.190
 the video to watch it is already 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.190
