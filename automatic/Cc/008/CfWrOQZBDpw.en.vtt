00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
looked at they were around they're

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.660 
looked at they were around they're
really<00:00:42.899> really<00:00:43.110> excellent<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.829> one<00:00:44.460> thing<00:00:44.579> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
really really excellent so one thing I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.360 
really really excellent so one thing I
want<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.820> talk<00:00:44.969> about<00:00:45.260> is<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> design<00:00:47.309> of

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
want to talk about is like the design of

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.279 
want to talk about is like the design of
the<00:00:47.610> shoe<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.210> see<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:48.960> got<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> bit

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
the shoe you can see it's it's got a bit

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.830 
the shoe you can see it's it's got a bit
of<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.469> slope<00:00:50.160> towards<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.670> heel<00:00:50.910> um<00:00:51.120> but

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
of a slope towards the heel um but

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.540 
of a slope towards the heel um but
there's<00:00:52.050> there's<00:00:52.199> not<00:00:52.469> much<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.860> drop<00:00:53.250> I

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
there's there's not much of a drop I

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.660 
there's there's not much of a drop I
think<00:00:54.149> there's<00:00:54.270> like<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.420> point<00:00:55.039> 15<00:00:56.039> drop<00:00:56.460> or

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
think there's like a point 15 drop or

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.610 
think there's like a point 15 drop or
pretty<00:00:57.120> much<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> zero<00:00:57.600> drop<00:00:57.809> type<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.199> shoe<00:00:58.350> so

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
pretty much a zero drop type of shoe so

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.010 
pretty much a zero drop type of shoe so
what's<00:00:59.160> important<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.910> me<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.420> these<00:01:00.809> shoes

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
what's important to me on these shoes

balance so one thing I really like the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.649 
balance so one thing I really like the
innovate<00:01:55.350> does<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.610> provide<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> little<00:01:57.570> bit

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
innovate does is provide a little bit

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.080 
innovate does is provide a little bit
wider<00:01:57.899> for<00:01:58.110> toe<00:01:58.259> box<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:59.040> not<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.610> wide

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
wider for toe box and it's not so wide

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.789 
wider for toe box and it's not so wide

stability<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.670> other<00:02:12.330> thing<00:02:12.660> was<00:02:13.080> they<00:02:13.379> have

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
stability so other thing was they have

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.750 
stability so other thing was they have
like<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.510> scuff<00:02:14.900> guard<00:02:15.200> near<00:02:15.710> the<00:02:15.740> toe<00:02:16.100> you<00:02:16.670> can

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.460 
like a scuff guard near the toe you can
kind<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:16.970> hear<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.330> it's<00:02:17.960> different<00:02:18.290> than<00:02:18.380> the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
kind of hear it it's different than the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.230 
kind of hear it it's different than the
other<00:02:18.590> material<00:02:19.070> for<00:02:19.790> when<00:02:19.910> you're<00:02:20.000> doing

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
other material for when you're doing

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.170 
other material for when you're doing
rope<00:02:20.930> climbs<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.710> things<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.700> nature<00:02:22.790> so

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
rope climbs and things of that nature so

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.850 
rope climbs and things of that nature so
just<00:02:23.630> makes<00:02:23.810> your<00:02:23.900> shoe<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.140> little<00:02:24.590> bit<00:02:24.710> more

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860

durable<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:26.060> that's<00:02:26.450> another<00:02:26.630> reason<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:26.930> like

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170
