hold until dice fixes battlefield 4 now
personally<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.469> think<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:43.739> kind<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.100> over

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
personally I think it's kind of over

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.069 
personally I think it's kind of over
exaggerated<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:44.940> everybody<00:00:45.270> said<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.629> well

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
exaggerated but everybody said this well

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.869 
exaggerated but everybody said this well
it<00:00:46.289> might<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.680> true<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.950> dice<00:00:47.250> might<00:00:47.520> focus

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
it might be true that dice might focus

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.090 
it might be true that dice might focus
their<00:00:48.239> resources<00:00:48.270> more<00:00:48.989> towards<00:00:49.680> developing

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
their resources more towards developing

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.100 
their resources more towards developing
battlefield<00:00:50.610> for<00:00:50.910> fixing<00:00:51.449> battlefield<00:00:51.809> 4

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
battlefield for fixing battlefield 4

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.869 
battlefield for fixing battlefield 4
right<00:00:52.289> now<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.739> don't<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.789> means

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
right now I don't think that it means

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:54.860 
right now I don't think that it means
they're<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> take<00:00:54.390> away<00:00:54.600> from<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
they're going to take away from the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.840 
they're going to take away from the
development<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.469> battlefront<00:00:55.980> 3<00:00:56.039> battlefield

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
development of battlefront 3 battlefield

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.490 
development of battlefront 3 battlefield
form<00:00:57.180> battlefront<00:00:57.570> 3<00:00:57.600> or<00:00:57.899> different<00:00:58.320> games

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
form battlefront 3 or different games

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.619 
form battlefront 3 or different games
different<00:00:58.949> franchises<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.090> personally

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
different franchises and I personally

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.479 
different franchises and I personally
believe<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.899> dice<00:01:01.199> probably<00:01:01.739> has<00:01:01.920> specific

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
believe that dice probably has specific

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.189 
believe that dice probably has specific
individuals<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.329> are<00:01:03.390> tasked<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:03.899> working

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
individuals that are tasked with working

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.410 
individuals that are tasked with working
on<00:01:04.260> battlefront<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.010> not<00:01:05.280> battlefield<00:01:05.970> this

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
on battlefront and not battlefield this

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.780 
on battlefront and not battlefield this
leads<00:01:06.720> me<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.930> believe<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.409> while<00:01:08.189> they<00:01:08.460> are

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
leads me to believe that while they are

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.399 
leads me to believe that while they are
working<00:01:09.030> very<00:01:09.210> hard<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.869> putting<00:01:10.110> most<00:01:10.229> of

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
working very hard and putting most of

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.690 
working very hard and putting most of
their<00:01:10.530> money<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.830> resources<00:01:11.130> towards<00:01:11.580> fixing

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
their money and resources towards fixing

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.090 
their money and resources towards fixing
battlefield<00:01:12.180> 4<00:01:12.510> they<00:01:13.110> probably<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.860> not

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
battlefield 4 they probably have not

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.090 
battlefield 4 they probably have not
stopped<00:01:14.580> working<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.119> battlefront<00:01:15.630> 3<00:01:16.100> now

stopped working on battlefront 3 now

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.710

of<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.439> blown<00:01:34.680> ass<00:01:34.770> out<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.890> proportions<00:01:35.400> I

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
of just blown ass out of proportions I

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.499 
of just blown ass out of proportions I
think<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.790> news<00:01:35.939> wanted<00:01:36.210> something<00:01:36.420> more

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
think the news wanted something more

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.850 
think the news wanted something more
juicy<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.960> talk<00:01:37.110> about<00:01:37.259> they<00:01:37.530> throw

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
juicy to talk about they throw

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.859 
juicy to talk about they throw
battlefront<00:01:38.340> 3<00:01:38.400> into<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> mix<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.810> a

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
battlefront 3 into the mix like it's a

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.580 
battlefront 3 into the mix like it's a
battle<00:01:40.409> fronts<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.250> hold<00:01:41.460> oh<00:01:41.700> no<00:01:42.030> oh<00:01:42.270> no<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:43.380> all

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
battle fronts on hold oh no oh no in all

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.280 
battle fronts on hold oh no oh no in all
seriousness<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:44.630> personally<00:01:45.630> believe<00:01:45.659> that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
seriousness I personally believe that

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.109 
seriousness I personally believe that
battlefront<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.340> probably<00:01:47.670> still<00:01:47.909> very

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
battlefront is probably still very

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.940 
battlefront is probably still very
active<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:48.720> anything<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.380> at<00:01:49.590> least<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.829> few

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
active and if anything is at least a few

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.170 
active and if anything is at least a few
team<00:01:50.159> members<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> whole<00:01:50.970> team

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
team members it's not a whole team

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.389 
team members it's not a whole team
specifically<00:01:52.110> working<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.740> game<00:01:52.950> while

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
specifically working on that game while

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.550 
specifically working on that game while
dice<00:01:53.640> figures<00:01:54.149> out<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.509> battlefield<00:01:55.170> issues

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
dice figures out it's battlefield issues

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.139 
dice figures out it's battlefield issues
I<00:01:55.829> don't<00:01:56.310> think<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.729> anything<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.030> worry

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
I don't think we have anything to worry

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.130 
I don't think we have anything to worry
about<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.479> don't<00:01:57.630> think<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> game<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.110> hold

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
about I don't think the game is on hold

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.200 
about I don't think the game is on hold
and<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.590> think<00:01:58.829> EA<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.310> dice<00:01:59.340> are<00:01:59.850> smart<00:02:00.149> enough

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
and I think EA and dice are smart enough

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.450 
and I think EA and dice are smart enough
to<00:02:00.360> know<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.890> they<00:02:01.890> got<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.040> big<00:02:02.250> opportunity

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
to know that they got a big opportunity

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.980 
to know that they got a big opportunity
to<00:02:02.700> hear<00:02:02.820> about<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.090> front<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.420> gain<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> lot<00:02:03.810> more

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
to hear about a front to gain a lot more

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.109 
to hear about a front to gain a lot more
fans<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.409> lot<00:02:04.740> more<00:02:04.950> money<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.460> don't<00:02:05.909> think<00:02:05.969> we

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
fans a lot more money I don't think we

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.100 
fans a lot more money I don't think we
don't<00:02:06.270> do<00:02:06.329> anything<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.630> jeopardize<00:02:06.659> that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
don't think that it's anything bad

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.780 
don't think that it's anything bad
enough<00:02:16.069> to<00:02:16.190> where<00:02:16.310> they're<00:02:16.400> going<00:02:16.519> to<00:02:16.580> cancel

and i think the news is just trying to
hype<00:02:25.340> things<00:02:25.640> up<00:02:25.879> but<00:02:26.540> if<00:02:26.870> EA<00:02:27.110> or<00:02:27.500> dice<00:02:27.769> is
