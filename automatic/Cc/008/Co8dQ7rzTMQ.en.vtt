Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.630
Today we’re going to show you how to change
the heater element on your dishwasher.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.799
It’s a really easy job; all we’re going
to need is an adjustable wrench, and a quarter

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:09.799
inch nut driver.

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:11.079
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.089
Now the first step in this repair will be
to disconnect the power; find the breaker

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.529
for the dishwasher and turn it off.

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.980
Now to replace the element, the first thing
we’re going to do is remove two wires that

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.259
attach to the ends of the element from the
backside, then we’ll remove the heater nut

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:53.120
with our adjustable wrench, and also the lock
washers that sit on top of the heater nut.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:20.070
With those parts removed we’ll next open
the dishwasher door; we’ll remove the lower

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.720
rack.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.230
Take a little caution when working inside
of the dishwasher tub at this point because

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.560
we have no support to keep it from tilting
forward.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.280
Now we’ll simply pull the element up through
the opening in the bottom of the tub, pull

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:45.340
the element around the securing brackets,
and then we’ll lift it out of the tub.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.550
Now before we install the new heating element
we’ll make sure that the rubber washers

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.400
are firmly up against the flange on the element.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:04.060
We’ll make sure that we get it wrapped around
the support posts; make sure that we have

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.701
the element firmly seated to the bottom of
the tub through the openings, and now we’re

00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:24.269
ready to put the lock washers and the tub
nuts back on.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:30.709
Before we tighten the nuts just double check
and make sure that the element is seated firmly

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.239
on the base of the tub; and don’t over-tighten
those plastic nuts: we don’t want to strip

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.239
them.

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:49.950
And once those are done we can reconnect the
two wires.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:19.170
Now we’re ready to reinstall the lower rack,
we’ll position the dishwasher back into

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.510
the cabinet, reconnect the power, and our
repair is complete.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.330
We told you it was an easy job.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.439
Thanks for watching, and good luck with your
repair.
