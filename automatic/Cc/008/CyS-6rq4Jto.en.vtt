backpack of course isn't going to be

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.600 
backpack of course isn't going to be
looking<00:01:04.559> very<00:01:04.619> good<00:01:04.890> because<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.189> broke<00:01:05.430> this

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
looking very good because I broke this

gray<00:01:05.880> part<00:01:06.180> off<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.479> should<00:01:06.540> probably<00:01:06.750> just

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
gray part off I should probably just

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.050 
gray part off I should probably just
break<00:01:07.260> off<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> other<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:07.979> before<00:01:08.610> ordering

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
something to fix that up but in the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.410 
something to fix that up but in the
meantime<00:01:11.130> if<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.729> didn't<00:01:11.970> paint<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> right

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
eyes and the head it would look pretty

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.749 
eyes and the head it would look pretty
poor<00:01:15.270> but<00:01:15.780> overall<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.590> colorful<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.460> very

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759

gun to me very old-school which is I
suppose<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.939> way<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.479> should<00:01:21.509> be

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
suppose is the way it should be

you can see with the upper body though

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.350 
you can see with the upper body though
that<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> over<00:01:25.950> reliance<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.549> seals<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.150> going

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
that the over reliance on seals is going

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.850 
that the over reliance on seals is going
to<00:01:27.450> hurt<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.689> little<00:01:27.840> bit<00:01:28.049> with<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> gray<00:01:28.560> and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
to hurt a little bit with the gray and

to hurt a little bit with the gray and
the<00:01:28.950> yellow<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.430> his<00:01:30.000> face<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.930> does<00:01:31.229> look

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the yellow and his face really does look

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.020 
the yellow and his face really does look
too<00:01:31.799> long<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.490> also<00:01:32.610> see<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
too long and you can also see the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.609 
too long and you can also see the
separation<00:01:33.630> between<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.020> gray<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.470> blue

separation between the gray and the blue
there<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.400> certainly<00:01:35.909> not<00:01:36.060> perfect<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:36.720> again

also go ahead and do that and the head
is<00:02:22.320> going<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.590> be<00:02:22.740> on<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.860> poly<00:02:23.100> cap<00:02:23.370> here<00:02:23.550> so

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
is going to be on a poly cap here so

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.430 
is going to be on a poly cap here so
it's<00:02:23.880> going<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.150> go<00:02:24.270> up<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.630> down<00:02:24.750> as<00:02:25.050> well<00:02:25.260> as

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
it's going to go up and down as well as

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.350 
it's going to go up and down as well as
rotate<00:02:25.830> around<00:02:25.950> but<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.790> only<00:02:26.940> has<00:02:27.180> that

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
rotate around but it only has that

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.080 
rotate around but it only has that
single<00:02:27.750> point<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:28.110> articulation<00:02:29.000> arming<00:02:30.000> AM

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
single point of articulation arming AM

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.640 
single point of articulation arming AM
up<00:02:30.210> means<00:02:30.450> popping<00:02:30.870> off<00:02:30.990> this<00:02:31.230> part<00:02:31.470> which<00:02:31.620> is

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
up means popping off this part which is

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.290 
up means popping off this part which is
just<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.040> solid<00:02:32.190> piece<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.760> can<00:02:32.910> then<00:02:33.060> plug

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
just a solid piece you can then plug

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.820 
just a solid piece you can then plug
this<00:02:33.510> into<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.930> poly<00:02:34.110> cap<00:02:34.350> that's<00:02:34.530> attached

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
this into the poly cap that's attached

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.860 
this into the poly cap that's attached
take<00:02:35.580> this<00:02:35.790> part<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.360> when<00:02:36.510> you're<00:02:36.630> actually

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
take this part and when you're actually

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.000 
take this part and when you're actually
taking<00:02:37.020> apart<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.470> fists<00:02:37.740> you're<00:02:37.830> probably

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
taking apart the fists you're probably

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.190 
taking apart the fists you're probably
better<00:02:38.220> off<00:02:38.310> using<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.940> modelers<00:02:39.300> knife<00:02:39.540> to

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
better off using a modelers knife to

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.290 
better off using a modelers knife to
actually<00:02:40.470> split<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:40.800> apart<00:02:40.860> because<00:02:41.640> it's

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
actually split this apart because it's

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.000 
actually split this apart because it's
not<00:02:42.480> even<00:02:42.660> going<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.810> stay<00:02:42.960> on<00:02:43.260> all<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.800> well

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
not even going to stay on all that well

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.650 
not even going to stay on all that well
once<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.340> actually<00:02:44.610> put<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.850> on<00:02:44.970> but<00:02:45.510> I've

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
once you actually put it on but I've

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.210 
once you actually put it on but I've
already<00:02:45.810> broken<00:02:46.050> one<00:02:46.350> part<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:46.830> don't<00:02:47.040> break

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
already broken one part so don't break

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.740 
already broken one part so don't break
another<00:02:47.520> because<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:48.000> hen<00:02:48.240> doesn't<00:02:48.570> want<00:02:48.690> to

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
another because that hen doesn't want to

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.410 
another because that hen doesn't want to
come<00:02:48.900> apart<00:02:49.230> on<00:02:49.500> its<00:02:49.800> own<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.400> silly<00:02:50.970> me<00:02:51.180> for

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
come apart on its own and silly me for

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.640 
come apart on its own and silly me for
thinking<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> shield<00:02:52.170> would<00:02:52.350> actually

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
thinking that the shield would actually

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.650 
thinking that the shield would actually
attach<00:02:52.920> on<00:02:53.160> there<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.700> only<00:02:54.090> for<00:02:54.420> putting

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
attach on there this is only for putting

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.360 
attach on there this is only for putting
it<00:02:54.750> on<00:02:54.960> to<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.320> back<00:02:55.650> if<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.040> want<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.220> put

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
front because it's gonna be all white

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.150 
front because it's gonna be all white
but<00:03:03.720> instead<00:03:04.080> that<00:03:04.290> means<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.650> have<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.920> rely

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
but instead that means you have to rely

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.220 
but instead that means you have to rely
on<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.670> single<00:03:06.030> little<00:03:06.390> part<00:03:06.720> here<00:03:06.780> to

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
on this single little part here to

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.140 
on this single little part here to
attach<00:03:07.530> into<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:07.920> hand<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:08.910> imagine

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
attach into the hand and you can imagine

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.210 
attach into the hand and you can imagine
how<00:03:09.540> well<00:03:09.720> this<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.440> how<00:03:10.530> secure<00:03:10.830> this<00:03:11.070> is

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
how well this and how secure this is

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.790 
how well this and how secure this is
going<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.520> be<00:03:11.640> in<00:03:12.030> terms<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:13.050> actually<00:03:13.470> holding

sticky tack as it is it's just sort of

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.310

but if you find that to be attractive in
the<00:03:45.720> f98<00:03:46.230> shield<00:03:46.620> should<00:03:46.860> be<00:03:47.010> one<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.220> its<00:03:47.310> most

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
the f98 shield should be one of its most

the f98 shield should be one of its most
noticeable<00:03:48.180> features<00:03:48.630> very<00:03:49.440> disappointing

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
like seed or as with this you're

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.510 
like seed or as with this you're
actually<00:04:16.530> swapping<00:04:16.890> off<00:04:17.010> limbs<00:04:17.220> but<00:04:17.459> you

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
actually swapping off limbs but you

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.940 
actually swapping off limbs but you
wonder<00:04:17.700> how<00:04:18.060> much<00:04:18.270> of<00:04:18.420> a<00:04:18.480> predecessor<00:04:19.049> is<00:04:19.200> this

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
wonder how much of a predecessor is this

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.430 
wonder how much of a predecessor is this

much larger and it should be however

much larger and it should be however

meters<00:04:41.070> so<00:04:41.639> you<00:04:41.699> can<00:04:41.910> just<00:04:42.180> see<00:04:42.360> that<00:04:42.389> in

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
meters so you can just see that in

addition<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.080> this<00:04:43.320> being<00:04:43.650> very<00:04:43.710> small<00:04:44.370> at

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
addition to this being very small at

fourteen point eight that also in the

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.439 
fourteen point eight that also in the
old<00:04:47.130> school<00:04:47.400> it<00:04:47.550> seemed<00:04:47.820> like<00:04:48.000> they<00:04:48.120> were<00:04:48.180> just

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
old school it seemed like they were just

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.030 
old school it seemed like they were just
cheeping<00:04:48.840> out<00:04:48.960> on<00:04:49.080> plastic<00:04:49.470> or<00:04:49.620> what<00:04:49.800> I<00:04:49.830> don't

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
cheeping out on plastic or what I don't

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.159 
cheeping out on plastic or what I don't
know<00:04:50.250> but<00:04:50.940> everything<00:04:51.330> just<00:04:51.360> comes<00:04:51.630> across<00:04:51.900> as

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
know but everything just comes across as

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.840 
know but everything just comes across as
being<00:04:52.199> a<00:04:52.410> little<00:04:52.620> bit<00:04:52.770> smaller<00:04:53.070> than<00:04:53.669> it

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
being a little bit smaller than it

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.490 
being a little bit smaller than it
should<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.180> this<00:04:54.510> certainly<00:04:55.050> doesn't<00:04:55.260> look

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
should and this certainly doesn't look

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.469 
should and this certainly doesn't look
like<00:04:55.650> it's<00:04:55.830> in<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:55.979> same<00:04:56.220> league<00:04:56.520> in<00:04:56.910> terms<00:04:57.210> of

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
like it's in the same league in terms of

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.110 
like it's in the same league in terms of
power<00:04:57.979> this<00:04:58.979> is<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.190> fixed<00:04:59.550> figuration

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
power this is the fixed figuration

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.480

Penelope<00:05:00.720> and<00:05:00.990> this<00:05:01.229> one<00:05:01.500> is<00:05:01.740> actually<00:05:01.949> too

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
Penelope and this one is actually too

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.129 
Penelope and this one is actually too
small<00:05:02.520> for<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.240> scale<00:05:03.449> that<00:05:03.570> it<00:05:03.690> should<00:05:03.870> be<00:05:03.990> in

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
small for the scale that it should be in

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.040 
small for the scale that it should be in
one<00:05:04.350> 144th<00:05:05.220> so<00:05:05.789> remember<00:05:06.180> picture<00:05:06.570> this<00:05:06.750> next

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
one 144th so remember picture this next

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.140 
one 144th so remember picture this next
to<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.199> h1<00:05:07.620> next<00:05:07.919> to<00:05:07.979> this<00:05:08.100> guy<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:08.970> can

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
to the h1 next to this guy and you can

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.400 
to the h1 next to this guy and you can
just<00:05:09.330> imagine<00:05:09.419> that<00:05:09.750> if<00:05:09.930> this<00:05:10.050> guy<00:05:10.229> was

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
just imagine that if this guy was

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.250 
just imagine that if this guy was
properly<00:05:10.770> 1/100<00:05:11.580> how<00:05:12.030> much<00:05:12.240> of<00:05:12.360> a<00:05:12.449> monster<00:05:12.990> he

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
properly 1/100 how much of a monster he

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.370 
properly 1/100 how much of a monster he
would<00:05:13.410> be<00:05:13.530> compared<00:05:14.010> to<00:05:14.070> this<00:05:14.280> little<00:05:14.820> kid<00:05:15.380> and

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
would be compared to this little kid and

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.570 
would be compared to this little kid and
looking<00:05:16.710> at<00:05:16.830> something<00:05:17.130> more<00:05:17.340> contemporary

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
looking at something more contemporary

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.510 
looking at something more contemporary
for<00:05:18.330> this<00:05:18.539> guy<00:05:18.750> you've<00:05:18.960> got<00:05:18.990> 1993<00:05:19.979> solidia

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
for this guy you've got 1993 solidia

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.120 
for this guy you've got 1993 solidia
which<00:05:20.970> is<00:05:21.120> also<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.389> non<00:05:21.600> grade<00:05:21.840> 1/100<00:05:22.560> however

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
which is also a non grade 1/100 however

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.010 
which is also a non grade 1/100 however
this<00:05:23.370> guy<00:05:23.520> should<00:05:23.789> be<00:05:23.820> significantly<00:05:24.600> shorter

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
this guy should be significantly shorter

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.779 
this guy should be significantly shorter
and<00:05:25.199> you<00:05:25.260> can<00:05:25.410> see<00:05:25.590> that<00:05:25.740> even<00:05:26.100> the<00:05:26.220> V<00:05:26.340> fins<00:05:26.610> are

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
and you can see that even the V fins are

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.550 
and you can see that even the V fins are
going<00:05:26.940> to<00:05:27.000> add<00:05:27.120> much<00:05:27.360> for<00:05:27.570> height<00:05:27.720> but<00:05:27.930> that

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
going to add much for height but that

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.110 
going to add much for height but that
really<00:05:29.039> this<00:05:29.220> guy<00:05:29.430> just<00:05:29.699> looks<00:05:29.880> to<00:05:30.000> be<00:05:30.090> a

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
really this guy just looks to be a

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.390 
really this guy just looks to be a
little<00:05:30.360> bit<00:05:30.510> smaller<00:05:30.840> than<00:05:31.200> he<00:05:31.830> should<00:05:31.860> be

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
little bit smaller than he should be

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.690 
little bit smaller than he should be
and<00:05:33.320> even<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.380> burger<00:05:34.710> gross<00:05:35.039> makes<00:05:35.310> him<00:05:35.490> look

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
and even the burger gross makes him look

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.279 
and even the burger gross makes him look
a<00:05:35.820> little<00:05:36.000> bit<00:05:36.210> out<00:05:36.389> of<00:05:36.479> proportion

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
a little bit out of proportion

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.680 
a little bit out of proportion
getting<00:05:38.099> into<00:05:38.250> the<00:05:38.490> multitude<00:05:39.000> of<00:05:39.180> beautiful

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
poses that you can do with this guy well

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.560 
poses that you can do with this guy well
you<00:05:41.340> can<00:05:41.460> have<00:05:41.610> him<00:05:41.729> look<00:05:41.910> down<00:05:42.090> the<00:05:42.210> barrel<00:05:42.240> of

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
you can have him look down the barrel of

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.270 
you can have him look down the barrel of
the<00:05:42.660> rifle<00:05:42.810> and<00:05:43.289> you<00:05:43.740> could<00:05:43.860> have<00:05:44.010> the<00:05:44.130> arm

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
the rifle and you could have the arm

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.710 
the rifle and you could have the arm
come<00:05:44.490> out<00:05:44.610> except<00:05:45.180> you're<00:05:45.330> going<00:05:45.510> to<00:05:45.570> have<00:05:45.660> a

come out except you're going to have a
couple<00:05:45.960> of<00:05:46.020> problems<00:05:46.169> one<00:05:46.979> with<00:05:47.190> this<00:05:47.400> being

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
couple of problems one with this being

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.950 
couple of problems one with this being
the<00:05:47.729> weight<00:05:47.970> issues<00:05:48.300> that<00:05:48.450> even<00:05:48.630> if<00:05:48.720> you<00:05:48.810> do

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
the weight issues that even if you do

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.960 
the weight issues that even if you do
bring<00:05:49.139> the<00:05:49.289> shield<00:05:49.560> up<00:05:49.860> it's<00:05:50.130> very<00:05:50.220> easy<00:05:50.520> for

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
bring the shield up it's very easy for

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.210 
bring the shield up it's very easy for
it<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:51.330> collapse<00:05:51.630> downwards<00:05:52.169> and<00:05:52.380> also<00:05:53.099> the

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
it to collapse downwards and also the

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.830 
it to collapse downwards and also the
way<00:05:53.340> the<00:05:53.520> hand<00:05:53.760> fits<00:05:54.000> into<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.360> beam<00:05:54.510> rifle

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
way the hand fits into the beam rifle

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.050 
way the hand fits into the beam rifle
there<00:05:54.990> it's<00:05:55.200> not<00:05:55.380> a<00:05:55.410> snug<00:05:55.710> fit<00:05:55.740> and<00:05:56.250> actually

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
there it's not a snug fit and actually

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.550 
there it's not a snug fit and actually
it's<00:05:57.210> sort<00:05:57.360> of<00:05:57.479> at<00:05:57.599> a<00:05:57.630> very<00:05:57.930> awkward<00:05:58.110> angle

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
it's sort of at a very awkward angle

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.790 
which isn't going to help with the way
that<00:05:59.910> it<00:06:00.030> hits<00:06:00.210> the<00:06:00.360> forearm<00:06:00.750> so<00:06:01.380> really

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
that it hits the forearm so really

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.080 
that it hits the forearm so really
unless<00:06:02.039> you<00:06:02.160> have<00:06:02.310> it<00:06:02.400> locked<00:06:02.550> into<00:06:02.820> place

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
move up very much but the beam rifle can

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.040 
move up very much but the beam rifle can
actually<00:06:27.150> go<00:06:27.240> up<00:06:27.330> there<00:06:27.479> and<00:06:27.599> then<00:06:27.720> you<00:06:27.840> lose

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
actually go up there and then you lose

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.450 
actually go up there and then you lose
the<00:06:28.199> weight<00:06:28.380> issues<00:06:28.710> because<00:06:29.070> actually<00:06:29.400> the

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
the weight issues because actually the

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.080 
the weight issues because actually the
gravity<00:06:29.820> is<00:06:29.940> holding<00:06:30.240> it<00:06:30.330> into<00:06:30.630> the<00:06:30.900> shoulder

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
gravity is holding it into the shoulder

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.460 
gravity is holding it into the shoulder
honestly<00:06:33.090> this<00:06:33.240> is<00:06:33.389> like<00:06:33.419> the<00:06:33.690> sixth<00:06:34.080> time<00:06:34.110> in

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
honestly this is like the sixth time in

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.770 
honestly this is like the sixth time in
the<00:06:34.530> last<00:06:34.680> three<00:06:35.010> minutes<00:06:35.159> and<00:06:35.550> that<00:06:36.360> there<00:06:36.630> is

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
the last three minutes and that there is

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.740 
the last three minutes and that there is
what<00:06:36.960> happens<00:06:37.289> when<00:06:37.440> sticky<00:06:37.770> tack<00:06:38.070> loses<00:06:38.550> its

some<00:07:17.520> of<00:07:17.550> the<00:07:17.699> visuals<00:07:18.090> it<00:07:18.360> does<00:07:18.690> look<00:07:19.020> pretty

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:19.650 
some of the visuals it does look pretty

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.740 
some of the visuals it does look pretty
cool<00:07:19.800> because<00:07:20.400> of<00:07:20.520> just<00:07:20.759> its<00:07:20.910> colorful<00:07:21.360> nature

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750
