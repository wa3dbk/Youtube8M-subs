00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
absolutely brilliant everywhere I go

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.060 
absolutely brilliant everywhere I go
where<00:00:17.779> it's<00:00:17.900> parked<00:00:18.230> oh<00:00:18.289> it's<00:00:18.470> Drive<00:00:18.680> people

comment<00:00:19.430> stop<00:00:20.150> and<00:00:20.300> have<00:00:20.420> a<00:00:20.450> look<00:00:20.510> at<00:00:20.690> it<00:00:20.810> and<00:00:20.990> I

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
comment stop and have a look at it and I

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.390 
comment stop and have a look at it and I
think<00:00:21.200> that's<00:00:21.320> a<00:00:21.440> really<00:00:21.770> refreshing<00:00:22.070> change

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
think that's a really refreshing change

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.029 
think that's a really refreshing change
for<00:00:22.970> a<00:00:23.000> car<00:00:23.180> in<00:00:23.300> this<00:00:23.420> category<00:00:23.830> so<00:00:24.830> it's<00:00:24.950> an

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
for a car in this category so it's an

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.470 
for a car in this category so it's an
electric<00:00:25.400> car<00:00:25.610> but<00:00:25.789> it's<00:00:25.940> got<00:00:26.030> a<00:00:26.060> petrol

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
electric car but it's got a petrol

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.060 
electric car but it's got a petrol
engine<00:00:26.539> to<00:00:26.900> extend<00:00:27.200> the<00:00:27.260> range<00:00:27.440> and<00:00:27.740> of<00:00:27.920> course

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
engine to extend the range and of course

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.890 
engine to extend the range and of course
the<00:00:28.190> fuel<00:00:28.369> tank<00:00:28.580> which<00:00:28.670> holds<00:00:28.940> about<00:00:29.000> six<00:00:29.810> and

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
the fuel tank which holds about six and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.450 
the fuel tank which holds about six and
a<00:00:29.990> half<00:00:30.020> gallons<00:00:30.530> so<00:00:30.619> it's<00:00:30.740> quite<00:00:30.920> short<00:00:31.190> range

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
a half gallons so it's quite short range

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.650 
a half gallons so it's quite short range
probably<00:00:31.670> about<00:00:31.910> two<00:00:32.149> hundred<00:00:32.300> and<00:00:32.480> fifty

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
probably about two hundred and fifty

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.290 
probably about two hundred and fifty
miles<00:00:32.989> on<00:00:33.260> petrol<00:00:33.649> only<00:00:33.890> so<00:00:34.489> you<00:00:34.579> can<00:00:34.730> see<00:00:34.940> the

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
miles on petrol only so you can see the

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.389 
miles on petrol only so you can see the
engine<00:00:35.570> Bay's<00:00:35.750> ab/c<00:00:36.289> around<00:00:36.589> would<00:00:36.800> take<00:00:37.010> to

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
engine Bay's ab/c around would take to

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.040 
engine Bay's ab/c around would take to
the<00:00:37.550> engine<00:00:37.879> and<00:00:38.089> motor<00:00:38.179> and<00:00:38.539> a<00:00:38.569> whole<00:00:38.719> load<00:00:38.870> of

the engine and motor and a whole load of
a<00:00:39.170> thick<00:00:39.739> wires<00:00:39.980> which<00:00:40.219> you<00:00:40.339> would<00:00:40.460> normally

you see all over this car it's got a
real<00:00:46.510> futuristic<00:00:47.510> feel<00:00:47.749> to<00:00:47.929> it<00:00:47.989> and<00:00:48.109> actually

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
real futuristic feel to it and actually

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.139 
real futuristic feel to it and actually
looks<00:00:48.710> like<00:00:48.859> nothing<00:00:49.370> else<00:00:49.519> on<00:00:49.699> the<00:00:49.819> road<00:00:49.969> not

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
looks like nothing else on the road not

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.360 
looks like nothing else on the road not
even<00:00:50.210> a<00:00:50.510> supercar<00:00:50.989> I<00:00:51.170> love<00:00:51.440> it<00:00:51.559> there's<00:00:52.219> not

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
even a supercar I love it there's not

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.619 
even a supercar I love it there's not
that<00:00:52.579> much<00:00:52.760> space<00:00:53.030> in<00:00:53.179> the<00:00:53.239> boot<00:00:53.329> it's<00:00:53.479> enough

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
that much space in the boot it's enough

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.059 
that much space in the boot it's enough
to<00:00:53.749> put<00:00:53.899> a<00:00:53.929> few<00:00:54.139> bags<00:00:54.319> in<00:00:54.499> but<00:00:54.649> what<00:00:54.769> you'll<00:00:54.889> see

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:55.069 
to put a few bags in but what you'll see

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:56.410 
to put a few bags in but what you'll see
is<00:00:55.190> that<00:00:55.219> it's<00:00:55.489> pretty<00:00:55.670> shallow<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:56.149> actually

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
is that it's pretty shallow and actually

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.149 
is that it's pretty shallow and actually
it's<00:00:56.569> not<00:00:56.659> shallow<00:00:57.019> because<00:00:57.559> there's<00:00:57.859> a<00:00:57.920> spare

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
it's not shallow because there's a spare

00:00:58.159 --> 00:00:59.680 
it's not shallow because there's a spare
wheel<00:00:58.339> shallow<00:00:58.879> because<00:00:59.149> that's<00:00:59.389> where<00:00:59.569> the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
wheel shallow because that's where the

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.289 
wheel shallow because that's where the
batteries<00:01:00.019> go<00:01:00.049> down<00:01:00.350> here<00:01:00.589> so<00:01:01.190> yeah<00:01:01.399> 15,000

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:02.299 
batteries go down here so yeah 15,000

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:03.520 
batteries go down here so yeah 15,000
miles<00:01:02.449> behind<00:01:02.839> the<00:01:02.899> wheel<00:01:03.049> I<00:01:03.229> think<00:01:03.409> one<00:01:03.499> of

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
miles behind the wheel I think one of

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.049 
miles behind the wheel I think one of
the<00:01:03.679> interesting<00:01:04.010> things<00:01:04.250> is<00:01:04.430> it<00:01:04.580> great

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
the interesting things is it great

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.610 
the interesting things is it great
driving<00:01:05.420> position<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:05.990> seats<00:01:06.229> are<00:01:06.409> really

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
driving position the seats are really

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.870 
driving position the seats are really
comfy<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.130> steering<00:01:07.430> wheels<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:07.760> right

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
comfy the steering wheels the right

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.730 
comfy the steering wheels the right
distance<00:01:08.210> away<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.780> all<00:01:09.079> these<00:01:09.229> buttons<00:01:09.500> here

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
distance away and all these buttons here

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.499 
distance away and all these buttons here
on<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:09.950> center<00:01:10.250> console<00:01:10.579> and<00:01:10.700> down<00:01:10.850> here<00:01:11.119> you

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
on the center console and down here you

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.330 
on the center console and down here you
can<00:01:11.539> reach<00:01:11.869> right<00:01:12.289> across<00:01:12.530> without<00:01:12.860> having<00:01:13.219> to

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
can reach right across without having to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.560 
can reach right across without having to
lean<00:01:13.490> forward<00:01:13.520> which<00:01:13.969> is<00:01:14.090> something<00:01:14.299> that<00:01:14.420> you

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
lean forward which is something that you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.270 
lean forward which is something that you
can't<00:01:15.049> say<00:01:15.259> about<00:01:15.350> every<00:01:15.619> car<00:01:15.799> on<00:01:15.829> the<00:01:15.890> market

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
can't say about every car on the market

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.190 
can't say about every car on the market
one<00:01:17.000> problem<00:01:17.360> though<00:01:17.450> I<00:01:17.479> do<00:01:17.630> find<00:01:17.990> is<00:01:18.110> the

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
one problem though I do find is the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.660 
one problem though I do find is the
visibility<00:01:18.500> right<00:01:18.950> up<00:01:19.039> here<00:01:19.280> at<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.460> front

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
visibility right up here at the front

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.490 
visibility right up here at the front
because<00:01:19.789> the<00:01:20.060> windscreen<00:01:20.810> is<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.109> sloped

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
because the windscreen is so sloped

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
commute to work and back so if I was to

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.960 
commute to work and back so if I was to
do<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.200> does<00:02:50.350> run<00:02:50.530> roughly<00:02:50.950> 45<00:02:51.580> miles

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970

I'm saving five pounds every working day

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.560 
I'm saving five pounds every working day
and<00:03:10.090> because<00:03:10.990> it's<00:03:11.140> electric<00:03:11.730> one<00:03:12.730> one<00:03:13.270> thing

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
and because it's electric one one thing

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.840 
and because it's electric one one thing
which<00:03:13.780> really<00:03:14.110> annoys<00:03:14.440> me<00:03:14.470> is<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.100> is<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.610> Sat

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
in the postcode so let's put in a

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.220 
in the postcode so let's put in a
postcode<00:03:28.780> of<00:03:29.020> my<00:03:29.260> house

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.240 

se6<00:03:36.300> now
