00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.210

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.800
 guys we go with it and I hope that you 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.960
 really like today's video which 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.000
 have a couple of moments of hacks to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.660
 please hannah you'll see you'll see 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.460
 then 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.420
 so go ahead with this wonderful 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.340
 combat also and combat begins on 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.440
 which starts with the following 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.250
 pokemons on the battlefield wins 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.579
 start with scar mori and raul send to me 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.829
 belong bibiloni makes use of sleeping pill 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.649
 to sleep at scar mori which 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.030
 wake up with the lanberri and throw the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.000
 attack that was waiting to launch 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.090
 hannah that is barbed leaves the ground full 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.920
 barbed for when more rivals enter 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.050
 the fact is that in the next turn 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.219
 because everything more or less goes like in this 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.930
 first turn 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.270
 bibiloni uses are light envelopes that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.820
 when he dies he falls asleep 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.850
 can attack a sleeping pokémon in the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.829
 combat it 's time to change and search 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.289
 the best strategy so is that raúl 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:19.409
 retirement to bibiloni to get a pokémon 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:21.359
 as it is turned to a overturned followed 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.159
 Luck 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.450
 that is calm and wakes up in this 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.209
 first turn after falling asleep 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.630
 and uses aerial law over the east 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:31.950
 Holds a lot with a little bit of health 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.500
 and he recovers a little life too 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.530
 with remains using flamethrower 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.930
 that leaves scarponi with a point of 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.010
 health because he has the ability then 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.150
 you 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:48.070
 in this way it endures and ends 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.310
 finish to overturn that can not do 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.310
 nothing more 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.240
 there is still like that they overturned to body 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.220
 flame burns to scar morí which goes to 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.770
 fall right now to lose health by the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.260
 burns so that 11 there's a 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.260
 pokemon by each coach 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.890
 and raúl sends again to the land of 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.569
 battle to combat bibiloni and for its 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.450
 part jana sends ferro zor 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.359
 Baby bottle I know bufa is looking for with weaver 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.040
 dance there you can check it and it makes 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.689
 very bad in this sense because look at your 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.849
 how speed goes up 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:31.200
 efe reason on the other hand you throw the traps 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:33.810
 rocks and uses gale bibiloni 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.290
 that does not finish killing Ferro Zone what 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.870
 Holds pretty well 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.330
 there it is although it is confusing 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.019
 Ferrol gets attacked and uses spin 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.519
 ball that almost kills to live where a single 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.730
 hit or as you can check is 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.319
 as an end is how wow almost killed him with 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.819
 spin ball and that because of the speed 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.489
 by the speed difference between 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.810
 two characters between the two pokemon in 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.030
 this moment after this great 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.079
 work wins retires ferro zonis a 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.390
 camagüey that receives a blow not 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:10.379
 too effective as it is gale but 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.540
 still with the likes of this 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.840
 ball that takes away enough life 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.519
 again use sleeping pill and this time 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.920
 Well, of course, cooler than he has slept 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.540
 as well 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.010
 as you can see and it does not attack 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.890
 they attack good somnolent strip waiting for a 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.180
 This shift change and wakes up mauá 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.670
 and again with a little bit of hacks to 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.900
 hannah and with fiery fang kills bibi 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.430
 what can be a pretty pokémon 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.530
 damn if we do not finish him in this 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.170
 point could also have decided the 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.150
 fight for another side and the case is that 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.430
 with the sacs that he had when he woke up 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.770
 in this first turn it has come out 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.830
 winning 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:52.690
 arrives at xixona combat which makes fist 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.250
 bullet over water and they end up killing him from 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.730
 walsh he can not do fang 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.730
 igneous now 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.230
 uses well so are mega thread 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.450
 It evolves as you can see a 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.780
 dosage battle or not mentioned and other 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.300
 not 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.700
 so it uses as much attack 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.060
 sword and the other uses that of the rival the 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.980
 de raúl uses brute force getting off 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.850
 so some characteristics when making 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.980
 damage to the ear sis not to because it is a 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.840
 a counter that has a counter that has 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.889
 this this brute force attack that you 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.320
 it does lower some features 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.230
 because it is a very powerful attack and something 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.990
 he has to have bad luck on his part 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.880
 uses bullet fist and leaves well just like 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.370
 you can check that it receives damage too 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.470
 for the one for the wallet I think it will take 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.710
 Life is waiting because you lose health, you leave it 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.479
 with little health very little health and a 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.130
 new brute force that what it does is 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.300
 go back down your stats your 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.060
 characteristics 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.569
 Hannah is smart and she drops like that 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.449
 only by its own weight when using 1 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:59.750
 bullet and receives damage himself from his life 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.729
 wait and fall while using the attack 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.800
 respite to restore the health of your 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.930
 mega evolution of your pokemon has 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.150
 evolved rather than successor that 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.720
 again have a lot of life for 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.819
 ahead and is decisive is decisive is of 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.129
 this health restoration this respite 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:19.069
 it appears ping continue in combat which 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.300
 is the mega of raúl and receives the year by 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.729
 the tines to have thrown is that at 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.969
 decisive die at the end with the lanberri 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:28.789
 it is that he has restored the first dream 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:31.699
 between the bullet fist and the damage that has 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.369
 received by the pins dies pinsi of a 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:37.039
 just hit without doing anything or 

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:39.079
 dies in one incredible blow and I the 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.659
 evolution brought down without it 

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:43.969
 absolutely nothing point in favor for 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:45.679
 win because megapixel can be very very 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.299
 very strong strong 

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:49.999
 galván you also receive damage from the 

00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:52.639
 spikes enough damage between the tines and 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:55.819
 rocks that I had planted perroton and with 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:58.969
 bullet fist practically dies stand and 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:01.340
 uses thunder on that short that is not going 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:03.889
 to fall holds pretty well 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.470
 and fist bullet ends to finish galván 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.090
 tula 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.790
 now you will see that the last pokemon of 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.440
 raúl also receives a lot of damage between 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.170
 some things and others for the rocks that there are 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.880
 in the field and the spines which makes 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:19.120
 examples that can be a pokémon 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.100
 quite powerful also the fall of a 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.290
 I only blow before a fist to that of a 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.330
 season that has been decisive also in 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.880
 this musical combat that endured 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.200
 everything and a sensor that with respite with 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.180
 good strategy using respite and 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.240
 letting the other scissor die has been 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.290
 key so that hannah pass round 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.090
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.680
