 don't use your brain for god's sake 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.739
 do two weighed accounts but it's worth it 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.139
 penalty piccard and rambo insorque chiuque 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.280
 example possessed totally by his team 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:17.500
 fight and that has a difficult film and that 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.920
 you need a pin that uses a network 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:26.109
 acquitted but we beat for style I do not have 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:29.739

 there are even people arriving 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.250
 to ban what is hit by rcs 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.380
 because they are terrified of finding it on 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.230
 team here I am for the mind that it is 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.030
 I do when 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.110

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.159
 it was really loud they hadn't collapsed and 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.540
 honestly do yourself a favor 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.870
 when you do a favor to those who play 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.909
 especially under platinum let us 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.810
 lower characters because then there 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:04.209
 we find with clogged communities 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.060
 answer opens this champion 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.760
 because the lawyer at the party yesterday no 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.750
 save save our community do 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.750
 a favor to our community 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.419

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.320
 especially a book of writing was one 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.240
 prayer towards us because 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.949

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.590
 you understand then use al 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.539
