00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.630
 hello and welcome to the gang 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.730
 power community in our today 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.420
 review is all about the clock ex 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.460
 cps in the competition variant and in addition 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.939
 look at the datasheet for now 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.939
 see you soon 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.340
 datasheet we have now see the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.730
 The weapon has a little bit more detail 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.240
 on 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.580
 what is it for so discover the 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.930
 We have one down the montage 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:57.770
 around alex cps stand on the point we 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.970
 we have competition two stand up 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:04.280
 The handle piece we have six stand 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.010
 and on the other hand I have 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.960
 the sport weapons made in germany and the 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.380
 Internet address to a serial number 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.130
 and the famous f sign down here 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.360
 back in the handle-piece oma rex that was it 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.060
 what you actually wrote 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.350
 do it and cover and now 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.750
 look at the weapons a bit 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.810
 more exactly 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.930
 we have the one down here 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.970
 magazine so faible then this comes 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.970
 magazine the rest of plastic 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.500
 Know above is metal part then sees 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.229
 so we give it to me afterwards 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.360
 more on it and then but here 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.670
 lever with which open the system because we 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.830
 have a weapon around here 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.759
 insert eight shots drum magazine 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.610
 which are equipped with the applus after 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.619
 but on the other side the security and 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:05.500
 you have to press and back or 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:05.500
 press and then the safe or not 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.480
 otherwise we have here to not much 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.459
 given functions 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.780
 we have an adjustable one here 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.730
 visor diaz sides adjustable and 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.130
 otherwise, the almost complete weapon 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.000
 Plastic weight is somewhere 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.459
 550 grams without the whole attachments 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.010
 that is also a relative lightweight 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.110
 In spite of everything , it flies super in the 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.300
 hand for such a small weapon and now 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.090
 Let's take a look at the whole thing 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.660
 with co2 populated with which only 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.660
 busy 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:51.230
 as usually in the scope of delivery 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.460
 are 28 jazzy drum magazines with 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.960
 Let's start with them 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.340
 I've then my rws diabolos is 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.130
 He has been declared many thousands of times 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:06.770
 but I'll say it again on the page 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:08.770
 or wreath you push even plus 1 8 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.860
 times 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:16.209
 I try to make it easy 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.209
 valerie sajdik probably not 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:23.030
 otherwise as I said it is actually 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.080
 self-explanatory and most of you 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.120
 will probably be the one or the other 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.959
 other weapon at home have the exact 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.940
 then with the same system works 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.110
 Take the weapon at hand here 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.390
 the lever down 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.150
 do not leave the whole video unchecked 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.530
 fast forward then puts his 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:46.250
 magazine and pushes it to accurate and 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.390
 Now we go to co2 with the whole 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.130
 to equip co2 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.930
 the unnatural simple you do that 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.330
 national park lever down then 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.590
 Completely opposite the magazine 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:05.299
 he wears the whole one-quarter of the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:08.470
 turn about the c2 capsule then to 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:13.190
 by the way, from them nothing like inside 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:16.220
 leaves the screw of the stroke to co2 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:21.200
 capsule and then turns for the whole 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:23.330
 back and then you have that 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.479
 whole with co2 equipped with the weapon 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:31.910
 it went to the final test 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:33.500
 magazine cover a magazine standing 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.169
 not shot lying on seven 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.000
 on the glass and then look 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.330
 we what comes out so until then 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.330
 equal 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.150
 here are our shot 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.410
 test result what I in each case 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.310
 can be extremely good 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.680
 Of course, Johnson was with the 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.440
 competition lights what's on it 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.800
 that in two brightness levels 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.110
 can adjust 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.700
 we still have at level 1 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.670
 relatively coarse grain 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.910
 but it is also a relative one now 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:31.020
 favorable visor what's on it 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.520
 otherwise exactly in double action 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.860
 shot because we have a double here 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.030
 action can translate itself into everyone 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:41.970
 case and has one 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:44.880
 fun with a co2 capsule 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.470
 gets about 100 final out but 80 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.640
 in my opinion, these are only 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.680
 really usable 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.680
 now we all times the upshot have 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.650
 positive and negative about the weapon 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:08.530
 negative for me is she is actually 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:10.270
 made of plastic and otherwise you can 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.280
 not really great negative too 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.750
 Report except that I find that 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.430
 Know what you are capable of, we can do that 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.810
 Still with some showing that catch 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:22.770
 can in my opinion the 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.389
 Points are way too thick too rough 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.070
 but good I mean it is with it 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:30.190
 the weapon art in the cut so with 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.690
 everything he sees here is 120 euro that is 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.190
 a bargain for us with 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.729
 Diablo can shoot and great 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:39.780
 results therefore achieved my opinion 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:41.860
 I do not have much negative after that 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.330
 positive even if he is not with them 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.030
 Shoot want you can the sights 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:49.530
 laterally adjust that also super the 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.580
 leave then I can show again 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:55.479
 but first I make time briefly 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:57.090
 drum out of here, I have that makes 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:58.960
 very good not that you go there somewhere 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.560
 hereby applause around us 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:06.370
 shoot 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:11.289
 The deduction deduction is quite difficult 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:17.050
 and hackl on it long deduction away no 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:20.370
 pressure point is definitely not a pressure point 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:23.289
 already a bomb 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.919
 But as I said the results speak 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:26.350
 for themselves 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:28.450
 I can recommend this weapon to anyone 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.610
 just want to spend small money 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.710
 Begin et cetera the diablo weapons 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.160
 really want them all and drum 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.850
 tuned 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:40.210
 I think she's great and I hope you 

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:42.630
 fall off and we listen to it 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.630
 next time again
