00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
tooth looks like the cache is inside

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.050 
tooth looks like the cache is inside
there<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> key<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.920> how<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.670> get<00:01:23.939> it

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060

there but the key is how do we get it
out<00:01:24.330> well<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:25.619> cache<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> little<00:01:26.520> spring

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
out well this cache is a little spring

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.190 
out well this cache is a little spring
loaded<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.680> let's<00:01:28.680> see<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.189> shoots<00:01:29.460> out

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
loaded and let's see if it shoots out

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:39.230 
loaded and let's see if it shoots out
okay<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.229> I'm<00:01:31.530> gonna<00:01:31.619> pull<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:37.939> that's<00:01:38.939> cool

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
okay so I'm gonna pull this that's cool

okay so I'm gonna pull this that's cool
just<00:01:39.869> blew<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:41.009> cache<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.610> flew<00:01:41.850> right<00:01:42.090> out

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
just blew the cache just flew right out

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.370 
just blew the cache just flew right out
of<00:01:42.390> there

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
of there

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.219 
of there
let's<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.340> again<00:01:44.570> alright<00:01:45.570> here<00:01:45.810> we<00:01:45.869> go

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
let's see that again alright here we go

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:55.880 
let's see that again alright here we go
and<00:01:51.590> you'll<00:01:52.590> sign<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.040> logbook<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:55.290> move

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and you'll sign the logbook and and move

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.760 
and you'll sign the logbook and and move
on<00:01:56.100> cool<00:01:56.939> cache<00:01:57.240> very<00:01:57.689> unique<00:01:58.079> let's<00:01:58.500> do<00:01:58.680> it

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
on cool cache very unique let's do it

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.859 
on cool cache very unique let's do it
again<00:01:58.860> one<00:01:59.250> more<00:01:59.399> time

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
again one more time

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.120 
again one more time
maybe<00:02:00.869> let's<00:02:01.140> do<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.439> slow<00:02:01.680> motion<00:02:01.890> this

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
maybe let's do it in slow motion this

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:12.980 
maybe let's do it in slow motion this
time<00:02:02.189> shot<00:02:03.030> from<00:02:03.180> here<00:02:03.390> ready<00:02:03.979> one<00:02:04.979> two<00:02:05.820> three
