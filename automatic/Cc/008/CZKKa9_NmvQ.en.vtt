well<00:00:46.670> where's<00:00:46.940> it<00:00:47.030> going<00:00:47.239> because<00:00:47.360> heavy<00:00:47.660> can

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
well where's it going because heavy can

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.029 
well where's it going because heavy can
we<00:00:48.050> go<00:00:48.170> in<00:00:48.230> producer

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039

this<00:01:17.640> down<00:01:17.820> because<00:01:18.149> this<00:01:18.420> pipe<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.899> our<00:01:19.080> farm

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
this down because this pipe on our farm

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.289 
this down because this pipe on our farm
delivers<00:01:19.799> water<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> house<00:01:20.610> we

now<00:01:35.490> these<00:01:35.640> magnets<00:01:36.119> are<00:01:36.240> really<00:01:36.780> powerful<00:01:36.990> so

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
now these magnets are really powerful so

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.719 
now these magnets are really powerful so
I'm<00:01:37.710> gonna<00:01:37.890> make<00:01:38.009> sure<00:01:38.039> we<00:01:38.399> don't<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.670> any

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
I'm gonna make sure we don't have any

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.419 
I'm gonna make sure we don't have any
watches<00:01:39.509> or<00:01:39.929> coiled<00:01:40.380> motors<00:01:40.710> around<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.190> you

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
watches or coiled motors around and you

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.249 
watches or coiled motors around and you
don't<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.700> pacemaker<00:01:41.909> dr4<00:01:42.539> no<00:01:42.929> I<00:01:42.960> don't

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
don't have a pacemaker dr4 no I don't

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.109 
don't have a pacemaker dr4 no I don't
but<00:01:43.500> having<00:01:43.950> said<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.220> would<00:01:44.789> be<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.940> problem

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
but having said that would be a problem

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.880 
but having said that would be a problem
yeah<00:01:45.539> that's<00:01:45.810> how<00:01:45.929> powerful<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.380> magnets<00:01:46.770> are

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
yeah that's how powerful the magnets are
