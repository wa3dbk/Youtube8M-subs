00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
security in his own self and who he is

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.730 
security in his own self and who he is
when<00:03:12.030> he<00:03:12.150> fought<00:03:12.360> Mayweather<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:13.110> thought<00:03:13.590> he

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
when he fought Mayweather I thought he

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.590 
when he fought Mayweather I thought he
fought<00:03:13.920> totally<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.490> wrong<00:03:14.640> file<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.239> mean<00:03:15.420> how

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
fought totally the wrong file I mean how

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.449 
fought totally the wrong file I mean how
do<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.780> how<00:03:16.260> do<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.470> go<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.830> against<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.250> best

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
do you how do you go in against the best

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.729 
do you how do you go in against the best
boxer<00:03:17.910> in<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.150> game<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:18.660> try<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.050> outbox<00:03:19.470> it

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
boxer in the game and try to outbox it

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.830 
boxer in the game and try to outbox it
just<00:03:20.220> as<00:03:20.370> that's<00:03:20.730> just<00:03:20.940> ridiculous<00:03:21.239> so<00:03:21.600> I

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
just as that's just ridiculous so I

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.810 
just as that's just ridiculous so I
think<00:03:22.350> his<00:03:22.500> strategy<00:03:23.010> was<00:03:23.040> wrong<00:03:23.459> for<00:03:23.700> that

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
think his strategy was wrong for that

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.390 
think his strategy was wrong for that
but<00:03:24.300> I<00:03:24.330> still<00:03:25.170> think<00:03:25.470> he's<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.650> very<00:03:25.830> formidable

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
but I still think he's a very formidable

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.250 
but I still think he's a very formidable
fighter<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:26.970> think<00:03:27.209> he's<00:03:27.330> one<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.050> best

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
fighter and I think he's one of the best

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.580 
fighter and I think he's one of the best
fighters<00:03:28.500> out<00:03:28.800> there<00:03:28.860> in<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.190> game<00:03:29.370> today
