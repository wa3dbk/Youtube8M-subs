how to make a simple envelope looks just
like<00:00:05.850> this<00:00:06.890> very<00:00:07.890> simple<00:00:14.210> piece<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.240> paper

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
extra folding down this triangle you

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.150 
extra folding down this triangle you
create<00:01:19.360> it<00:01:20.130> make<00:01:21.130> sure<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.729> don't<00:01:24.850> go<00:01:25.030> too<00:01:25.479> far

you I like about this size just with
graph<00:01:38.950> paper<00:01:38.979> I<00:01:39.369> leave<00:01:40.240> about<00:01:40.479> three<00:01:40.840> maybe

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
graph paper I leave about three maybe

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.590 
graph paper I leave about three maybe
two<00:01:41.950> sometimes

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.249 

I'm<00:01:46.170> told<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:47.119> take<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.630> bottom<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.080> the

I'm told that take the bottom of the
paper<00:01:49.640> fold<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.790> up<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:52.080> crease<00:01:52.380> where

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
paper fold it up to that crease where

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:03.850 
paper fold it up to that crease where
you<00:01:53.070> fold<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:56.670> triangle<00:01:57.119> down

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.679 

take<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.040> Drive<00:02:05.310> will<00:02:05.939> be<00:02:05.970> yourself<00:02:06.420> this

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
take this Drive will be yourself this

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.699 
take this Drive will be yourself this
might<00:02:06.899> be<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> little<00:02:07.439> bit<00:02:07.530> cookies<00:02:09.500> put<00:02:10.500> that

might be a little bit cookies put that
down<00:02:14.030> pull<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> triangle<00:02:15.690> up<00:02:16.910> just<00:02:17.910> might

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
down pull the triangle up just might

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.729 
down pull the triangle up just might
take<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.660> little<00:02:18.810> while<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.290> get<00:02:19.380> there<00:02:19.560> right

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
take a little while to get there right

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:29.830 
take a little while to get there right
sides<00:02:22.190> pull<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.340> back<00:02:23.580> down<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:24.000> top<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.209> it

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.430 

try<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.900> get<00:02:31.110> right<00:02:31.650> at<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.830> tip

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.870 

then<00:02:35.070> go<00:02:36.060> back<00:02:37.670> pull<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:40.370> try<00:02:41.370> not<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.730> get

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
then go back pull this in try not to get

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.560 
then go back pull this in try not to get
any<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:43.310> go<00:02:44.310> into<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:46.340> hold<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.450> do<00:02:48.450> the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
any of this go into it hold that do the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:56.690 
any of this go into it hold that do the
same<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.140> other<00:02:49.170> side

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:18.530 

now<00:02:58.010> take<00:02:59.010> your<00:02:59.130> tape

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.090 

they<00:03:19.540> tape<00:03:19.780> it<00:03:19.960> sideways<00:03:20.230> we<00:03:20.680> would<00:03:20.830> have<00:03:20.950> to

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
they tape it sideways we would have to

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.160 
they tape it sideways we would have to
just<00:03:21.310> tape<00:03:22.270> it<00:03:22.300> down

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.770 

there<00:03:25.740> you<00:03:25.890> go<00:03:27.260> there's<00:03:28.260> your<00:03:28.470> first<00:03:28.680> envelope

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
there you go there's your first envelope

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.980 
there you go there's your first envelope
just<00:03:30.780> like<00:03:30.990> this<00:03:31.110> one<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:33.480> one<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:33.630> just<00:03:33.720> made

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
just like this one the one I just made

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.680 
just like this one the one I just made
