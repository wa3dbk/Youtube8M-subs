00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.820
 that's the jigs here of nuts on the 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.590
 5 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.510
 I put a little 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:19.160
 1 so with little robert we drew 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.860
 virtue will put it on the stage two hours 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.430
 here is the trace is on the other side 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.250
 as well 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:30.949
 and then we draw the features like that 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.910
 lax and perpendicular I made the 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.620
 same thing all 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.350
 so in fact this allows the moment when 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.100
 we will stick to check that all 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.860
 landmarks are exactly in the same place 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:51.260
 and after to stick we can even 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:53.600
 draw around like that a simple 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.340
 for a collar and slices easily 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:06.820
 then the slice sees you coming as 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.820
 that we trace the tour 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:25.740
 and the last all the benchmarks are 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:28.630
 lined up well it's anger then 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.469
 when we do the boat we could 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.509
 stick all this together and then 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:37.119
 obviously we would have to dig 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.899
 inside but actually it's going to be more 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.770
 simple we will cut a part already with 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.619
 the jigsaw 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.799
 take for example this slice here on 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.439
 know that's going to be stuck all that all 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.200
 inside he'll have to remove it so 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.679
 in fact we will take about 2 cm 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.640
 mark a little more in the back 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:05.799
 yeah and all everything here is going 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:09.509
 already in the relay the coupe with the 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.509
 Jigsaw is much faster 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:21.430
 so we'll do as we did everything 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:27.459
 time we redo a hole in the front a 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:29.980
 hole in the back then we go the corner 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.609
 it's like that and we'll put the saw 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.889
 jig 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:38.160
 okay we cut out the inside of 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.160
 slices 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:49.139
 we could actually position them 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.139
 thanks to the small strokes we made 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.280
 if we look we could stick like 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.530
 that in fact we would have a boat that 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.769
 would be too much already but in reality we're going 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:17.120
 remove in advance anything that exceeds 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.650
 the interior for example the two 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.720
 slices like that is going to be glued like 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:34.609
 that's the law to stick like this and 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:38.989
 the one from above come back like that and I 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:42.849
 can trace a reference sound and get 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.849
 positions the slices well 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:04:01.239
 I can trace and all that part that 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:01.239
 Here I will cut with a gouge 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.709
 it's easier to cut before 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.389
 the glue is the same here we will be able 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:15.319
 dig a little bit since learn 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:18.530
 m stick like that we will be able to dig 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:22.610
 actually pretty inside like that and 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.060
 dig the inside front by aÃ¯t for 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.060
 others
