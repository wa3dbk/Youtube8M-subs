00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.700
 hello my name is urban manuel they know me 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.830
 like lolo I have 26 years old game in the 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.590
 closing demarcation and in my first 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.169
 season in inter movistar for me 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.019
 It is a true dream fulfilled not to sign 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.210
 for the inter movistar a club that has 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.000
 won everything that is the most historic for 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.449
 me from Spain and there is a moment in my 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.760
 race that I hope is very long 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.060
 you are in interest and that all the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.500
 things very well 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.230
 well everybody has the illusion 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.270
 for me to get interested was one thing 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.550
 I wanted since I was little when I started 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.160
 playing football goes out to meet him and looks 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.540
 with 26 years the opportunity has come and 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.970
 It was clear that I was not going to 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.320
 always squander always know 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.390
 that is difficult all the players is 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.740
 that does not exist for everyone but for that 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.020
 you work every year 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.490
 previous to get here and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.990
 now they not only get here but 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:09.050
 consolidate yourself to do it well and get 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.620
 many titles for the club 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.390
 well take it easy but with 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.940
 very excited that you call a club 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.310
 as inter y and that offers to come or 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.260
 I want to count on you for everything 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.570
 the world a pride for you and for 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.020
 your family for your friends 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.140
 it's about making the most of it at the end 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.180
 the world wants to come and was in the 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.280
 moment of the call because I was already 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.320
 very clear that for my part I was not going to 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.600
 have a problem to incorporate this 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.420
 club 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.479
 if it's going to be a very nice season 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.390
 let's face six titles I think and 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.619
 all the titles are are with the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.960
 responsibility to face them for 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.700
 win it are also competitions 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.320
 international and European and the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.110
 club I think it's going to be a season 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.030
 spectacular, I hope we have a lot 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.619
 lucky we work well and what 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.810
 let's do our best to attract 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.380
 the showcases of the club a few 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.329
 more titles 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.100
 the reception of colleagues has 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.110
 been spectacular from the first to the 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.300
 last going through the coaching staff and 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.920
 for the club everyone has been very 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.250
 I have been tried with things 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.250
 very easy and I think that in a matter of 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.650
 about two weeks and the new signings 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.810
 we will be fully integrated and with 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.040
 the classmates and it's going to be me I think it's going 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.050
 to be a very good year for everyone so much 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.060
 at the level of costumes as sports 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.610
 I hope that the fans will continue as 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.140
 the last good years as all the whole 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.140
 the story but the last years for me 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.380
 it has been spectacular did not come to the box 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.480
 he has always been a visitor 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.760
 authentic hell because the people there 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.740
 always be the pavilion full and the 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.390
 people squeeze pretty and I hope this 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.670
 year so keep on being this way the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.100
 team accompany the team to keep 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.130
 the illusion in that hobby and that we 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.530
 support throughout the year 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.420
 yes ricardinho then he has one thing that is 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.310
 different from all the others that you do not see 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.010
 in the league and luck that we have it 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.920
 here that I have it as a companion the year 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.870
 gone, as it says it has been a 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.060
 a headache for rivals and 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.440
 is inspired by a match, as 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.230
 in a training the people can 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.850
 make your head hurt but good 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.340
 the luck that we have with us and 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.500
 let's hope it's a fantastic year for 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.270
 which surely that means that at 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.110
 team is doing very well 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.310
 the preseason because it lasts as always 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.980
 but well, the players are already 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.650
 accustomed to this and the bread of each 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.780
 August we are almost not doing more than 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.360
 nothing because in the morning more work 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.520
 physical and career gym and in the afternoon 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.140
 we are trying to increase 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.760
 in the tactical concepts and of 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.650
 strategies because because you have to 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.650
 shorten the deadlines a bit by subject 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.930
 of supercopa and other competitions and 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.640
 Well, I hope that when the end of the 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.260
 pre-season we will be all the team already 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.660
 prepared at both levels not so much 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.880
 physical as well as on the track 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.950
 well I'm not a player too 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.840
 superstitious what he did try to enter 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.270
 serve with the right foot track at the end 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.790
 it's a habit that I picked up a little more 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.680
 young and in the end because of habit 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.060
 keep doing something the only thing I try 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.930
 do not touch the track and enter with your foot 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.830
 right and little else not in one thing that I 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.830
 hurt your head with that
