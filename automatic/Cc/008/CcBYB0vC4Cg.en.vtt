00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
I think that's it what are the things we

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.629 
I think that's it what are the things we
have<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.260> we're<00:04:16.350> even<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.769> cycle<00:04:17.160> if<00:04:17.489> that

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
have that we're even to cycle if that

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.140 
have that we're even to cycle if that
was<00:04:17.730> it

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150
