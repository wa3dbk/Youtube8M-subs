replacing<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.090> air<00:02:57.299> filter<00:02:57.510> completely<00:02:58.470> so

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
replacing this air filter completely so

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
replacing this air filter completely so
I'm<00:02:58.769> not<00:02:58.859> gonna<00:02:59.010> go<00:02:59.159> through<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.400> steps<00:02:59.609> to

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
I'm not gonna go through the steps to

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.009 
I'm not gonna go through the steps to
clean<00:02:59.879> it<00:03:00.000> for<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.180> but<00:03:00.420> that's<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:00.690> gist<00:03:00.840> of

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
it again if you're replacing it you're

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.610 
it again if you're replacing it you're
getting<00:03:02.579> a<00:03:02.700> new<00:03:02.819> foam<00:03:03.060> foam<00:03:03.900> elements<00:03:04.379> inner

getting a new foam foam elements inner

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.170 
getting a new foam foam elements inner
and<00:03:04.889> outer<00:03:05.010> just<00:03:05.700> make<00:03:05.849> sure<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.030> they're

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
and outer just make sure that they're

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.640 
and outer just make sure that they're
well<00:03:06.269> oiled<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:06.959> oil<00:03:07.170> when<00:03:07.349> you<00:03:07.379> get<00:03:07.560> them

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
well oiled the oil when you get them

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.539 
well oiled the oil when you get them
great<00:03:07.950> if<00:03:08.129> not<00:03:08.159> oil<00:03:09.060> them<00:03:09.150> up<00:03:10.040> okay<00:03:11.040> guys<00:03:11.190> next

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
great if not oil them up okay guys next

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.339 
great if not oil them up okay guys next

tank cap we're gonna pop this off if you

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.819 
tank cap we're gonna pop this off if you
look<00:03:15.060> really<00:03:15.209> closely<00:03:15.480> on<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.440> cap<00:03:16.590> there's<00:03:16.769> a

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
look really closely on the cap there's a

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.430 
look really closely on the cap there's a
small<00:03:17.040> breather<00:03:17.340> hole<00:03:17.579> here<00:03:18.109> try<00:03:19.109> to<00:03:19.169> get<00:03:19.319> that

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
small breather hole here try to get that

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.689 
small breather hole here try to get that
into<00:03:19.650> light<00:03:19.829> for<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.040> guys<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.340> can<00:03:20.459> see<00:03:20.639> it

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
into light for you guys you can see it

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.099 
into light for you guys you can see it
right<00:03:20.879> there<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:21.209> little<00:03:21.329> vent<00:03:21.629> hole<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.989> want

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
right there a little vent hole you want

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.750 
right there a little vent hole you want
to<00:03:22.169> make<00:03:22.290> sure<00:03:22.319> that's<00:03:22.530> clear<00:03:22.829> again<00:03:23.579> there's

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
to make sure that's clear again there's

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.830 
to make sure that's clear again there's
a<00:03:23.819> few<00:03:23.970> different<00:03:24.180> ways<00:03:24.209> you<00:03:24.329> can<00:03:24.449> do<00:03:24.569> that<00:03:24.690> you

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
a few different ways you can do that you

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.970 
a few different ways you can do that you
can<00:03:24.959> blow<00:03:25.109> compressed<00:03:25.379> air<00:03:25.620> through<00:03:25.859> there

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
can blow compressed air through there

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.409 
can blow compressed air through there
very<00:03:26.430> carefully<00:03:26.879> we<00:03:26.970> don't<00:03:27.120> want<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.299> put<00:03:27.389> a

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
very carefully we don't want to put a

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.119 
very carefully we don't want to put a
hundred<00:03:27.540> psi<00:03:27.810> through<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.319> thing<00:03:28.500> just<00:03:28.919> make

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
hundred psi through the thing just make

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.879 
hundred psi through the thing just make
sure<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:29.400> clear<00:03:29.639> I<00:03:29.669> just<00:03:29.940> blow<00:03:30.090> through<00:03:30.329> it

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
sure it's clear I just blow through it

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.020 
sure it's clear I just blow through it
if<00:03:31.889> I<00:03:32.040> know<00:03:32.099> that<00:03:32.280> it's<00:03:32.370> clear<00:03:32.579> we're<00:03:32.760> good<00:03:32.879> if

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
if I know that it's clear we're good if

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.759 
if I know that it's clear we're good if
not<00:03:33.090> spray<00:03:33.900> some<00:03:34.079> compressed<00:03:34.379> air<00:03:34.500> in<00:03:34.650> there

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
not spray some compressed air in there

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.140 
not spray some compressed air in there
some<00:03:34.980> cleaner<00:03:35.310> just<00:03:35.430> make<00:03:35.669> sure<00:03:35.819> that<00:03:35.940> is

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
some cleaner just make sure that is

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.369 
some cleaner just make sure that is
clear<00:03:36.419> you<00:03:36.540> don't<00:03:36.599> want<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:36.870> vent<00:03:37.079> clogged

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
clear you don't want that vent clogged

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.020 
clear you don't want that vent clogged
always<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.099> won't<00:03:38.250> have<00:03:38.340> equal<00:03:38.669> pressure<00:03:38.849> in

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
always you won't have equal pressure in

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.449 
always you won't have equal pressure in
the<00:03:39.120> tank<00:03:39.359> so<00:03:39.599> pretty<00:03:40.500> basic<00:03:40.799> thing<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.310> can

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
the tank so pretty basic thing you can

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.670 
the tank so pretty basic thing you can
check<00:03:41.639> almost<00:03:41.970> any<00:03:42.120> time<00:03:42.389> that<00:03:43.230> can<00:03:43.319> cause<00:03:43.470> all

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
check almost any time that can cause all

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.930 
check almost any time that can cause all
sorts<00:03:43.709> of<00:03:44.069> tuning<00:03:44.340> this<00:03:44.459> just<00:03:44.669> to<00:03:44.760> make<00:03:44.910> sure

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
sorts of tuning this just to make sure

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.330 
sorts of tuning this just to make sure
you<00:03:45.090> keep<00:03:45.180> an<00:03:45.329> eye<00:03:45.419> on<00:03:45.449> that<00:03:45.980> now<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.040> third

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
you keep an eye on that now the third

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.069 
you keep an eye on that now the third
thing<00:03:47.370> Losey<00:03:47.879> recommends<00:03:48.419> is<00:03:48.599> charging<00:03:49.049> the

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
thing Losey recommends is charging the

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.599 
thing Losey recommends is charging the
receiver<00:03:49.470> battery<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.919> find<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.370> kind<00:03:50.549> of

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
receiver battery I find it kind of

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.129 
receiver battery I find it kind of
laughable<00:03:51.000> obviously<00:03:51.660> you're<00:03:51.750> gonna<00:03:51.810> charge

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
laughable obviously you're gonna charge

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.809 
laughable obviously you're gonna charge
your<00:03:52.290> battery<00:03:52.590> every<00:03:52.739> single<00:03:53.220> tank<00:03:53.430> if<00:03:53.639> not

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
your battery every single tank if not

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.339 
your battery every single tank if not
more<00:03:54.120> keep<00:03:54.389> making<00:03:54.629> sure<00:03:54.750> it's<00:03:54.900> topped<00:03:55.139> off

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
more keep making sure it's topped off

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.439 
more keep making sure it's topped off
now<00:03:56.069> we<00:03:56.129> don't<00:03:56.430> have<00:03:56.609> the<00:03:56.760> stock<00:03:56.970> battery<00:03:57.209> in

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
now we don't have the stock battery in

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.539 
now we don't have the stock battery in
here<00:03:57.690> we're<00:03:58.199> actually<00:03:58.349> running<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:59.010> regulator

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
here we're actually running a regulator

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.490 
here we're actually running a regulator
with<00:03:59.819> lipo<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.540> can<00:04:00.690> see<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.930> regulator<00:04:01.349> in

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
with lipo you can see the regulator in

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.020 
with lipo you can see the regulator in
there<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.889> don't<00:04:02.159> have<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.519> lipo<00:04:02.790> in<00:04:02.909> there

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
there I don't have the lipo in there

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.729 
there I don't have the lipo in there
right<00:04:03.120> now<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:03.870> we<00:04:04.079> checked<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:04.349> on<00:04:04.560> our<00:04:04.650> own

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
right now so we checked that on our own

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.649 
right now so we checked that on our own
time<00:04:04.980> in<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.190> different<00:04:05.489> schedule<00:04:05.730> if<00:04:06.480> you're

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
time in a different schedule if you're

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.180 
time in a different schedule if you're
running<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.959> stock<00:04:07.169> pack<00:04:07.409> make<00:04:07.799> sure<00:04:08.069> you

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
running the stock pack make sure you

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.259 
running the stock pack make sure you

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
keep an eye on that I mean not having

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.659 
keep an eye on that I mean not having
brakes<00:04:09.690> on<00:04:09.870> vehicle<00:04:10.229> this<00:04:10.349> big<00:04:10.530> can<00:04:10.739> be<00:04:10.769> pretty

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
brakes on vehicle this big can be pretty

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.339 
brakes on vehicle this big can be pretty
harmful<00:04:12.000> so<00:04:12.569> again<00:04:12.870> that's<00:04:12.959> common<00:04:13.319> sense

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
harmful so again that's common sense

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.479 
harmful so again that's common sense
keep<00:04:13.739> an<00:04:13.859> eye<00:04:13.919> on<00:04:13.949> your<00:04:14.069> receiver<00:04:14.280> battery

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
keep an eye on your receiver battery

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.250 
keep an eye on your receiver battery
something<00:04:15.299> that<00:04:15.419> they<00:04:15.540> don't<00:04:15.720> recommend<00:04:16.169> I

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
something that they don't recommend I

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.449 
something that they don't recommend I
think<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.530> might<00:04:16.650> be<00:04:16.680> worthwhile<00:04:16.979> checking

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
think it might be worthwhile checking

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.890 
think it might be worthwhile checking
flip<00:04:18.449> this<00:04:18.570> car<00:04:18.780> around<00:04:20.510> within<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.690> fuel

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
flip this car around within the fuel

tank<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.169> do<00:04:22.349> have<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.469> fuel<00:04:22.680> filter<00:04:22.860> are<00:04:23.159> not

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
tank you do have a fuel filter are not

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.520 
tank you do have a fuel filter are not
gonna<00:04:23.460> see<00:04:23.729> it<00:04:23.760> here<00:04:24.120> but<00:04:24.930> if<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:25.110> take<00:04:25.289> a<00:04:25.320> look

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
gonna see it here but if you take a look

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.500 
gonna see it here but if you take a look
into<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:25.950> cab<00:04:26.159> you'll<00:04:27.030> see<00:04:27.180> there's<00:04:27.360> a<00:04:27.389> little

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
into the cab you'll see there's a little

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.860 
into the cab you'll see there's a little
clunk

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
clunk

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.090 
clunk
with<00:04:28.050> filter<00:04:28.350> element<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:28.770> might<00:04:28.979> be

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
with filter element it might be

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.409 
with filter element it might be
worthwhile<00:04:29.280> just<00:04:29.639> to<00:04:29.729> take<00:04:29.940> a<00:04:29.970> peek<00:04:30.210> in<00:04:30.330> there

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
worthwhile just to take a peek in there

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.640 
worthwhile just to take a peek in there
make<00:04:30.600> sure<00:04:30.630> you<00:04:30.780> don't<00:04:30.930> have<00:04:31.050> excess<00:04:31.380> amount

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
make sure you don't have excess amount

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.740 
make sure you don't have excess amount
of<00:04:31.710> debris<00:04:32.040> that<00:04:32.250> that<00:04:32.669> pre-filter<00:04:33.330> isn't

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
of debris that that pre-filter isn't

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.659 
of debris that that pre-filter isn't
clogged<00:04:34.080> up<00:04:34.260> if<00:04:34.680> it<00:04:34.860> is<00:04:34.979> try<00:04:35.190> to<00:04:35.220> fish<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:35.610> out

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
clogged up if it is try to fish it out

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.070 
clogged up if it is try to fish it out
and<00:04:35.729> clean<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.060> replace<00:04:36.479> the<00:04:36.660> tank<00:04:36.870> if<00:04:37.020> you

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
and clean it replace the tank if you

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.960 
and clean it replace the tank if you
have<00:04:37.229> to<00:04:37.440> it's<00:04:38.010> not<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.220> bad<00:04:38.400> idea<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.760> run<00:04:38.880> an

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
have to it's not a bad idea to run an

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.670 
have to it's not a bad idea to run an
inline<00:04:39.210> fuel<00:04:39.479> filter<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:39.960> we're<00:04:40.530> usually

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
inline fuel filter and we're usually

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.260 
inline fuel filter and we're usually
refueling<00:04:41.220> in<00:04:41.340> pretty<00:04:41.550> dirty<00:04:41.729> conditions<00:04:41.940> and

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
refueling in pretty dirty conditions and

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.730 
refueling in pretty dirty conditions and
over<00:04:42.419> time<00:04:42.630> debris<00:04:42.960> is<00:04:43.020> gonna<00:04:43.199> get<00:04:43.290> in<00:04:43.440> there

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
over time debris is gonna get in there

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.379 
over time debris is gonna get in there
so<00:04:44.070> again<00:04:44.340> worthwhile<00:04:44.729> to<00:04:44.880> take<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.090> look<00:04:45.300> at

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
so again worthwhile to take a look at

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.480 
so again worthwhile to take a look at
that<00:04:45.510> -<00:04:45.750> this<00:04:46.350> is<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.590> one<00:04:46.770> -<00:04:46.889> to<00:04:47.040> intervene

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
that - this is the one - to intervene

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.640 
that - this is the one - to intervene
interval<00:04:48.000> maintenance<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.169> want<00:04:49.410> to<00:04:49.500> do

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
interval maintenance that you want to do

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.370 
interval maintenance that you want to do
on<00:04:49.889> any<00:04:50.220> really<00:04:50.610> fiscale<00:04:51.030> gas<00:04:51.270> car<00:04:51.570> again

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
on any really fiscale gas car again

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.860 
on any really fiscale gas car again
common<00:04:52.770> sense<00:04:52.949> is<00:04:53.240> check<00:04:54.240> everything<00:04:54.660> over

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
common sense is check everything over

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.450 
common sense is check everything over
and<00:04:54.960> every<00:04:55.290> time<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.560> run<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:55.860> but<00:04:56.280> these<00:04:56.400> are

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
and every time you run it but these are

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.590 
and every time you run it but these are
things<00:04:56.729> we<00:04:56.820> want<00:04:56.940> to<00:04:56.970> keep<00:04:57.060> in<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.240> back<00:04:57.419> your

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
things we want to keep in the back your

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.629 
things we want to keep in the back your
mind<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:58.050> make<00:04:58.410> sure<00:04:58.440> you<00:04:58.590> keep<00:04:58.710> up<00:04:58.860> on<00:04:59.040> on<00:04:59.400> the

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
mind and make sure you keep up on on the

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:00.800 
mind and make sure you keep up on on the
next<00:04:59.880> video<00:05:00.060> we're<00:05:00.180> gonna<00:05:00.270> take<00:05:00.449> a<00:05:00.510> look<00:05:00.690> at

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
next video we're gonna take a look at

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.360 
next video we're gonna take a look at
the<00:05:00.960> maintenance<00:05:01.260> interval<00:05:01.710> for<00:05:01.889> every<00:05:02.100> six

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
the maintenance interval for every six

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.529 
the maintenance interval for every six
