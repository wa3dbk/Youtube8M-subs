saw the the old one and a commercial for
the<00:01:02.340> new<00:01:02.430> one<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.150> get<00:01:03.360> it<00:01:03.390> he<00:01:03.900> wins

the new one so I get it I get it he wins
probably<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> assume<00:01:04.920> or<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.759> racist<00:01:06.149> and

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
probably I assume or it's racist and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.569 
probably I assume or it's racist and
here's<00:01:06.749> the<00:01:06.840> thing<00:01:07.020> though<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:08.130> started<00:01:08.460> from

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
here's the thing though it started from

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.940 
here's the thing though it started from
the<00:01:08.880> catchphrase<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.710> end<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the catchphrase in the at the end of the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.730 
the catchphrase in the at the end of the
commercial<00:01:11.100> said<00:01:11.429> the<00:01:11.549> legend<00:01:11.909> begins<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.740> I

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
commercial said the legend begins and I

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.399 
commercial said the legend begins and I
thought<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.249> was<00:01:14.869> noteworthy<00:01:15.869> because

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
thought that was noteworthy because

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.459 
thought that was noteworthy because
there<00:01:17.159> already<00:01:17.340> was<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.609> series<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.319> Karate<00:01:19.319> Kid

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
there already was a series of Karate Kid

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:21.139 
there already was a series of Karate Kid
movie<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:19.859> the<00:01:19.950> legend<00:01:20.219> already<00:01:20.340> began<00:01:20.819> it's

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
movie so the legend already began it's

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:22.399 
movie so the legend already began it's
like<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.359> actually<00:01:21.539> does<00:01:21.899> interest<00:01:22.140> me<00:01:22.259> to

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
like that actually does interest me to

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.899 
like that actually does interest me to
see<00:01:22.530> how<00:01:22.649> Daniel<00:01:22.890> started<00:01:23.280> off<00:01:23.490> life<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.850> a
