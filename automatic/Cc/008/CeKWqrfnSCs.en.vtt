00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:05.500
 Where otherwise high tensions prevail and flashes of lightning it is now quite time 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.490
 harmless 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.629
 but it remains exciting 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.059
 because between the big devices that would otherwise be used to test power plants 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.449
 can be used and generate voltage of up to three million volts 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.400
 frolicking students have the 19 have 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.619
 their little robots as soon as possible independently about a good one 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.619
 four-and-a-half meters long track let lurch 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.130
 a big wedding and parts of the technical university 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.130
 Today, the first sports competition in Berlin takes place 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.350
 there are not too many teams yet 13 messages are there but that's it too 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.350
 first time that such a race take place here in Berlin 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.980
 From now on there will be this event every year students are 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.980
 also invited a few spectators 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.950
 but they have to be missed for the most part 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.519
 for drinks is provided 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.439
 the mood is pleasant and here and there you can watch the concentrated attendance 

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:01.439
 Example at the workshop where even the last improvement will be made 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.740
 she does not care what the Roche look like and how they came 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.940
 some of the companions are also their decision 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.050
 in the course of the project for pupils and further improved 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.310
 while the little one is still pondering and mechanically improving as her mother 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.039
 be allowed to 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.610
 Take care of others more 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.920
 Lego programmable devices may be smarter 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.200
 but also significantly more weight on the scales 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.430
 if the intelligence lies 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.160
 is spotted then on a predetermined course of which the red 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.480
 not to deviate in particular the abbreviation is prohibited 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.869
 before it begins 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.909
 Nevertheless, the drive belts wound up and last start preparations 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.520
 without special suspension is sometimes a little tinkering 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.330
 an ICE style serves as a guard 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.070
 the wheels are ball bearings made from domestic gates and when it serves him one 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.490
 disputed balloon 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.490
 but also fast enough 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.990
 the functional principle is quite simple 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.979
 There is a sensor under the vehicle 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.010
 which can distinguish bright and dark 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.550
 If it is above the black bar, the robot has to move on 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.679
 drive to the right to leave the racetrack 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.689
 If he is over a white area he has to turn left again and so on 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.979
 small robots usually slim down the edge of the black line 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.129
 In the case of the lego robots, it takes the driving behavior quite differently 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.949
 the programming made big differences 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:28.090
 while the one elegant and supple very complicated 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.800
 others tried to get ahead as fast as possible and is now adjusting 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.159
 certainly too far off course 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.760
 and that the whole thing is not as easy as it looks 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.150
 Memoirs remain as Roberto sometimes stand because the drive wheels 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.209
 slip down 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.209
 Loser of the unit or they do not find the line 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.499
 One has chosen only his own racetrack on the praise policy 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.089
 The whole thing is organized by a few students 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:57.669
 who else in the project where with student work and prove that 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.669
 Electrical engineering can be fun and something for everyone 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:05.089
 They have been particularly busy for today the software the times 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:07.969
 is has come extra for this day 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:13.119
 a photoelectric sensor perceives when the robots 100 become so vital the signals 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:17.279
 immediately from the software is missing all lap times are for safety's sake 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:19.169
 also measured with the stopwatch 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.000
 the best time of five is crucial 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.700
 A camera hangs above the race track so that the public can see the view 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.689
 has happened 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.279
 The lap times from that software and the image from the Camorra will be with 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:33.399
 a projector on the big screen 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:35.659
 and how do the participants come from here 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:36.679
 the proportion of 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:39.859
 the baby weighs competition land made 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.730
 1 percent Daniel but more in the second round we are eliminated 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.689
 I did not know what he could do and then she gave alt directly in the 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.199
 Topic choice make that a tar 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.099
 at these sports competitions Ursula made it 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.369
 which cut off in today 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.429
 than 30 seconds, Knowles said 

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:02.309
 as a third place should be so 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:06.599
 therefore have made the third place Speaking of mistakes for the 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.599
 Preparation time was right, he explains 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.189
 So I had a lot of fun 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.479
 he should have been up close as an alternative in itself a good idea 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.909
 We learn that he still has time to linger 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:24.500
 the students had a very special day today 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.069
 where there were successes and failures 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:30.539
 Unfortunately, two teams could not start because of technical problems 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.449
 but in the end, somebody is the fastest one this time 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.580
 small 1 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.870
 after a few hours the winter is over 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.770
 and the organizers pack together 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.509
 but one is for sure 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:44.590
 for the next year 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.590
 though the last problem seemed to be fighting 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.289
 w 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.710
 cath 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.419
 on the 7th 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.419
 I love him Vienna 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:35.089
 Vienna 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.680
 the 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.680
 TOOOR
