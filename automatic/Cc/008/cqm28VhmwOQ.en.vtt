take<00:00:15.200> the<00:00:15.379> straight<00:00:15.740> stick<00:00:16.219> and<00:00:16.900> we're<00:00:17.900> going

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
take the straight stick and we're going

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.190 
take the straight stick and we're going
to<00:00:18.230> place<00:00:18.619> the<00:00:19.610> bite<00:00:19.849> block<00:00:20.119> on<00:00:20.420> it<00:00:20.449> now<00:00:21.140> the

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
to place the bite block on it now the

to place the bite block on it now the
bite<00:00:21.560> block<00:00:21.860> goes<00:00:22.130> on<00:00:22.460> that<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:23.509> biting

bite block goes on that the biting

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.679 
bite block goes on that the biting
portion<00:00:24.890> comes<00:00:25.400> towards<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:26.090> end<00:00:26.329> of<00:00:26.539> the

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
portion comes towards the end of the

portion comes towards the end of the
stick<00:00:26.990> that<00:00:27.590> this<00:00:27.890> holder<00:00:28.759> part<00:00:29.060> of<00:00:29.330> the<00:00:29.480> x-ray

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
stick that this holder part of the x-ray

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.390 
stick that this holder part of the x-ray
is<00:00:30.289> going<00:00:30.980> to<00:00:31.099> be<00:00:31.250> more<00:00:31.550> towards<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:33.710> end<00:00:34.160> of

is going to be more towards the end of

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.369 
is going to be more towards the end of
the<00:00:34.550> stick<00:00:34.850> so<00:00:35.510> we're<00:00:35.690> going<00:00:35.809> to<00:00:35.900> take<00:00:36.170> our

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
the stick so we're going to take our

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.160 
the stick so we're going to take our
x-ray<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.129> this<00:00:37.580> is<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:37.970> side<00:00:38.210> is<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.870> cheek

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
x-ray and this is the side is the cheek

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.229 
x-ray and this is the side is the cheek
side<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.620> white<00:00:39.769> side<00:00:40.100> of<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.400> x-ray<00:00:40.820> not<00:00:41.030> the

to line up like that and I can use this

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.820 
to line up like that and I can use this
on<00:01:08.030> either<00:01:08.300> side<00:01:08.690> let's<00:01:09.050> go<00:01:09.259> over<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.470> Dexter

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
on either side let's go over to Dexter

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.980 
on either side let's go over to Dexter
and<00:01:10.190> place<00:01:10.460> it<00:01:10.700> when<00:01:11.179> we're<00:01:11.330> taking<00:01:11.780> a

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
and place it when we're taking a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.980 
and place it when we're taking a

posterior bite wing we're going to put

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.719 
posterior bite wing we're going to put
this<00:01:15.110> in<00:01:15.289> our<00:01:15.380> patient's<00:01:15.860> mouth<00:01:16.009> and<00:01:16.580> we're

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
this in our patient's mouth and we're

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.730 
this in our patient's mouth and we're
going<00:01:16.910> to<00:01:16.970> place<00:01:17.270> it<00:01:17.299> far<00:01:17.900> enough<00:01:18.140> back<00:01:18.409> and

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
going to place it far enough back and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.100 
going to place it far enough back and
our<00:01:18.830> patient<00:01:19.310> is<00:01:19.400> going<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.729> bite<00:01:20.090> on<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.900> bike

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.620 
our patient is going to bite on the bike
lock<00:01:21.680> part<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:22.280> we<00:01:22.610> want<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:22.970> make<00:01:23.119> sure<00:01:23.390> that

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
lock part and we want to make sure that

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.510 
lock part and we want to make sure that
we<00:01:23.840> get<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.920> contact<00:01:25.640> of<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.000> distal<00:01:26.930> of<00:01:27.520> the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
we get the contact of the distal of the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.990 
we get the contact of the distal of the
five<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.869> mesial<00:01:30.350> of<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.710> six<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:31.850> we

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
five and the mesial of the six so we

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.179 
five and the mesial of the six so we
want<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.360> place<00:01:32.600> this<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.259> that<00:01:33.409> we're<00:01:33.650> going

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
want to place this so that we're going

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.130 
want to place this so that we're going
to<00:01:34.280> have<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.579> edge<00:01:34.759> of<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.090> x-ray<00:01:35.479> coming

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
to have the edge of the x-ray coming

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.520 
to have the edge of the x-ray coming
almost<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:36.979> mesial<00:01:37.610> of<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.930> five<00:01:39.229> and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
almost to the mesial of the five and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.899 
almost to the mesial of the five and
we're<00:01:39.680> going<00:01:39.799> to<00:01:39.829> get<00:01:39.979> our<00:01:40.130> patient<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.729> bite

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
we're going to get our patient to bite

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.149 
we're going to get our patient to bite
together<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:45.110> we're<00:01:45.409> going<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.590> slide<00:01:45.950> the

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
together and we're going to slide the

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.149 
together and we're going to slide the
ring<00:01:46.399> in<00:01:46.840> then<00:01:47.840> again<00:01:48.200> we'll<00:01:48.409> take<00:01:48.680> our<00:01:48.860> PID

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
ring in then again we'll take our PID

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.719 
ring in then again we'll take our PID
and<00:01:50.060> we're<00:01:50.299> going<00:01:50.509> to<00:01:50.570> line<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:50.990> up<00:01:51.700> so<00:01:52.700> that

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
and we're going to line it up so that

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.929 
and we're going to line it up so that
we're<00:01:53.030> parallel<00:01:53.659> with<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.500> ring<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:54.979> take

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
we're parallel with the ring and take

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.630 
we're parallel with the ring and take
the<00:01:56.090> x-ray
