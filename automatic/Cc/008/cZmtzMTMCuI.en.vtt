00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.979

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.850 

so

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.610 

just<00:00:51.460> using<00:00:51.880> a<00:00:52.090> spatula

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.350

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.170 

and<00:01:00.910> then<00:01:01.090> just<00:01:01.300> a<00:01:01.449> damp<00:01:01.719> finger

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.980 

katadyn<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.350> smooth<00:01:07.650> out

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
katadyn to smooth out

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:21.030 
katadyn to smooth out
this<00:01:09.740> is<00:01:09.890> actually<00:01:10.369> something

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.190 

relatively<00:01:21.580> simple

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.720 

looks<00:01:24.799> pretty<00:01:24.979> simple

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.830 

what's<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.540> trick

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
what's the trick

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.630 
what's the trick
practice<00:01:31.840> practice<00:01:32.250> yeah

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.820 

when<00:01:36.120> I<00:01:36.210> first<00:01:36.390> started

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
when I first started

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.260 
when I first started
I<00:01:39.080> knew<00:01:40.080> what<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.320> wanted<00:01:40.680> things<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.980> look<00:01:41.190> like

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
I knew what I wanted things to look like

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.179 
I knew what I wanted things to look like
couldn't<00:01:43.659> make<00:01:43.780> them<00:01:43.990> that<00:01:44.140> way<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.560> lot<00:01:44.979> of<00:01:45.100> it

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
couldn't make them that way a lot of it

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.100 
couldn't make them that way a lot of it
has<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.310> do<00:01:45.490> with<00:01:45.609> hand<00:01:45.850> strength<00:01:47.039> so<00:01:48.039> it's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
has to do with hand strength so it's

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.880 
has to do with hand strength so it's
previous<00:01:50.530> strike<00:01:50.800> this<00:01:52.380> okay<00:01:53.380> so<00:01:53.440> that's<00:01:53.740> the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
previous strike this okay so that's the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.210 
previous strike this okay so that's the
eyes<00:01:54.040> those<00:01:54.370> are<00:01:54.400> finished<00:01:54.850> and
