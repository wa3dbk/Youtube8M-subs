00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:13.447
INTERVIEWER: So I want to hear
from dress rehearsal today

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:17.359
with the tango. what you guys
were thinking and what

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.049
happened in between the two,
because apparently it was a

00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:21.060
transformation.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.560
MELANIE: OK.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.990
So the dress rehearsal
didn't go badly.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.700
It just wasn't as smooth.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.120
It didn't feel right.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.630
It wasn't at the level that
we wanted it to be at.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.670
I think we were really
nervous.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.730
It was the first time the
judges would see it.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.181
It was the first time
that there was some

00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:38.180
people in the audience.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.270
And the dress rehearsal's
always really stressful

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.895
because it's the first time
I was in that dress.

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:44.340
It's the first time that I
swing off the side of the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.810
stage or really do
a lot of tricks.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.410
So the dress rehearsal was a
really big test run for us.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.200
Afterwards, we sort of
let the nerves go.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.800
We talked about it.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.820
We went over the steps that we
missed and tried to get it as

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.140
best we could and then we
just stopped stressing.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.140
Because we said that if
we had it, we had it.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.946
And if we didn't, we're
going to fake it.

00:01:03.946 --> 00:01:05.810
And we're going to have fun.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.980
So we got out there, and
we had a great time.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.270
And I think it definitely
showed.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.960
And it reflected well
on our performance.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.640
MARKO: We always
talk about it.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.530
In between makeup and hair,
whenever we have moments to

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.265
just talk about it, we
tell each other,

00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:19.800
make sure you do this.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.970
Make sure you look at each
other like that.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.912
Give me more support here,
look at each other here.

00:01:24.912 --> 00:01:26.564
So we fix it whenever we can.

00:01:26.564 --> 00:01:28.934
INTERVIEWER: Speaking of
support, talk about that lift

00:01:28.934 --> 00:01:29.408
at the end.

00:01:29.408 --> 00:01:30.356
Oh my gosh.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.726
MELANIE: It was crazy, huh?

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:33.680
INTERVIEWER: That was insane.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.254
MELANIE: Well, I don't know if
you guys watch Dancing With

00:01:36.254 --> 00:01:37.320
The Stars, I don't know if I'm
supposed to talk about this.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.150
But Louis is on Dancing With
The Stars and that was the

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.230
lift that Hines Ward
fell on Kym--

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.300
MARKO: Wait, the one on
the edge of the stage?

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.119
MELANIE: No, at the very end.

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.080
Is that the one you're
talking about?

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.995
The one at the really end?

00:01:47.995 --> 00:01:49.226
INTERVIEWER: Yeah,
the very end.

00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:51.020
Not the edge of the stage,
when she flipped

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.400
through your legs.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.940
MARKO: Oh.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.340
MELANIE: That's the lift where
Hines Ward fell on Kym's neck.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.410
And so, I've seen that.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.306
He hadn't seen it.

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:00.890
I know.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.490
I don't even know if you
really heard him

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.150
talking about this.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.280
He was telling the assistant
on the side.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.419
And I was like, they're about
to have us try this.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.257
Please, I don't want
to break my neck.

00:02:11.257 --> 00:02:14.095
I don't want to die.

00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:15.514
I know.

00:02:15.514 --> 00:02:17.420
But we got it!

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.190
It was really crazy.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.974
It was a lot of force and
it was a lot of trust.

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:23.500
I had to trust him that
he would get me there.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.220
But he got me there.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.170
MARKO: I just had to make sure
that I don't get stuck in the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.890
dress and that her heels don't
poke me in the butt.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.540
MELANIE: Because it
probably happens.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.252
MARKO: Or worse.

00:02:35.252 --> 00:02:39.196
INTERVIEWER: So the moth dance,
as it's now been named,

00:02:39.196 --> 00:02:41.168
how does that compare to the
sculpture dance for you guys?

00:02:41.168 --> 00:02:42.170
MARKO: Completely different.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.980
MELANIE: Yeah, they're
definitely really different in

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.810
choreography and in feeling.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.580
The statue dance, we
were falling in

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.890
love and getting together.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.945
And in the moth dance,
we sort of--

00:02:52.945 --> 00:02:54.034
MARKO: Were already
in love, right?

00:02:54.034 --> 00:02:54.421
MELANIE: Yeah.

00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:56.250
We were trying to take our
relationship somewhere.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.830
Well I was, and he didn't
want to go.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.770
So it's sort of about a
bit of a heartbreak.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.390
MARKO: And the light represented
that idea that she

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.080
wanted to reach, but I was too
scared and hesitant to do so,

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.450
to reach for it.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.030
That's why at the end of the
piece, I pull her back because

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.030
I really don't want it.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.530
MELANIE: But I don't know.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.770
As far as a comparison,
I think the

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.660
movement is really different.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.140
Travis' movement is so big and
lofty and really allows you a

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.780
lot of space.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.810
Whereas, Dee's movement
is really

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.960
close and tight together.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.870
So it was really hard for
us to master because we

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.100
like to dance big.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.940
And we like to dance
really full out.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.210
So it took a lot of rehearsing,
but it was still

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.080
fun to do and it felt great.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.380
INTERVIEWER: Great.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.580
Thanks so much, you guys.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.830
MELANIE: Thank you.
