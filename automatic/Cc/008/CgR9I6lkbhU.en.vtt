00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.019
 hi friends youtube etceteras 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.069
 If you are a fag, please tate it and do not see this site, thank you, let's start 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.419
 a common day in my house just because it was the most 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.460
 my friends were not one that went down and the other one went on vacation about 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.800
 days was did not contain anything to do I thought 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.960
 good since I have the gbagbo emulator and to play since I do not have anything else that 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.680
 do and I will regret forever 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.020
 I had finished almost all the games 100% - the pokémon mysterious world 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.080
 red I started playing with this film that was a bit out of practice with the 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.120
 game so I went to an easy place although it was not a good idea well I went 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.450
 to the forest to a player I went with exceptions just because I think it was 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.000
 enough to reach the 9th floor and there it got weird the game I saw a round odom and 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.150
 the escort 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.630
 the cordage 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.340
 without carmelo to decide I thought for a moment but I said no matter is an author 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.350
 the first thing I do when recruiting them 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.930
 see what movements have 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.560
 when I saw him I kept thinking his movements were tackling days 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.850
 for that I stay with my world although at least it has flamethrowers and 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.659
 dismiss a gift and the box would have to say it went sad 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.100
 but no such picture appeared I was thinking a good moment to follow up 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.920
 see that there was a place to put a ship but I forgot to eat a well 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.539
 that at the end of the tour wheldon and pokémon returned to sleep at 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.450
 barracks I'm going to look for a key to the cangas canon but it only gave me 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.750
 the options and the pokemones did not talk I kept thinking at a moment I assumed 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.990
 that I only had to be in control of the game and I was thinking about it until almost 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.830
 early morning when the train 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.770
 the 8th floor I stayed 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.770
 the state of the floor conflict without finding months 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.700
 at that moment 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.700
 this is a bad joke was still being replaced 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.720
 but he had some dangerous bright red eyes and a picture came out saying 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.310
 a dompe you took away the most precious thing for me 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.790
 my family already seems that or a 2 musso sigh attack that makes you sleep 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.649
 throwing you a cloud 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:20.549
 my pokémon fell asleep and then a sign appears that says of a dome its 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.809
 nightmare I thought that it would only take me lives lost his family how he died of 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:28.449
 hungry over time it was really sad even though I knew it was a game 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.609
 I returned to battle with a gift but my pokémon was on the dead floor at 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.590
 seem such a thing that I find it strange 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.379
 because he always came without life 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.829
 the good leader will start again 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.489
 did not give me the opportunity to start a glove session or ask for help 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.899
 the world 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:48.619
 or more and more until it's not devoured by that damn pokemon 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.779
 I felt that my heart stopped for a moment from that moment I have not 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.599
 gone back to playing that damn games just a tip
