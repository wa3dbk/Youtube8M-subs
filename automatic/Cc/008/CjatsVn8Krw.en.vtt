mmm<00:00:54.449> these<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.620> sensor<00:00:56.010> sound<00:00:56.789> sensor<00:00:57.449> so

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
mmm these are the sensor sound sensor so

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.580 
mmm these are the sensor sound sensor so
can<00:00:58.590> hear<00:00:59.070> things<00:00:59.960> don't<00:01:00.960> get<00:01:01.109> your<00:01:01.170> hopes<00:01:01.379> up

can hear things don't get your hopes up
it<00:01:01.739> only<00:01:01.890> hears<00:01:02.460> volume<00:01:02.969> doesn't<00:01:03.210> hear

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
it only hears volume doesn't hear

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.580 
it only hears volume doesn't hear
anything<00:01:03.449> else<00:01:04.489> motors<00:01:05.780> so<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.320> move

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
anything else motors so it can move

basically that just means it sees

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.600 
basically that just means it sees
distance<00:01:16.310> be<00:01:17.330> intelligent<00:01:18.330> Rick<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:19.430> just<00:01:20.430> call

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
distance be intelligent Rick I just call

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.340 
distance be intelligent Rick I just call
it<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> brain<00:01:20.939> because<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.570> world<00:01:21.990> yeah

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
it the brain because that's world yeah

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.840 
it the brain because that's world yeah
make<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.369> happen

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
make it happen

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.679 
make it happen
big<00:01:25.670> also<00:01:26.670> some<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.060> things<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.450> aren't

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
big also some of things that aren't

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.499 
big also some of things that aren't
mentioned<00:01:27.960> are<00:01:28.350> light<00:01:29.040> sensor<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:32.270> is<00:01:33.270> that

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
mentioned are light sensor and is that

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.060 
mentioned are light sensor and is that
it<00:01:34.130> yes<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.400> believe<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:36.030> was<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:37.680> that's

it yes I believe that was it so that's
what<00:01:38.369> all<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.150> sensors<00:01:39.479> are<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.400> this<00:01:41.400> here

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
what all the sensors are and this here

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.480 
what all the sensors are and this here
is<00:01:41.990> dangling<00:01:42.990> didn't<00:01:43.470> get<00:01:43.590> sorry<00:01:44.130> out<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.479> X

into those later and this is what it
looks<00:03:03.099> like<00:03:03.220> on<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.430> computer<00:03:04.620> something<00:03:05.620> that

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
looks like on a computer something that

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.349 
looks like on a computer something that
gives<00:03:06.670> you<00:03:06.760> digitally<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.910> looks<00:03:10.120> like<00:03:10.209> when

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
gives you digitally it looks like when

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.650 
gives you digitally it looks like when
you're<00:03:10.450> programming<00:03:11.049> it<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.940> what<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.600> looks

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
you're programming it and what it looks

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.789 
you're programming it and what it looks
like<00:03:13.810> when<00:03:13.989> you're<00:03:14.079> programming<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.650> when

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
like when you're programming it when

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.660 
like when you're programming it when
you're<00:03:14.920> really<00:03:15.220> good<00:03:17.489> okay

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
you're really good okay

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
look at them carefully and we got a

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.600 
look at them carefully and we got a
whole<00:04:22.180> boatload<00:04:22.480> of<00:04:22.870> junk

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
whole boatload of junk

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:32.660 
whole boatload of junk
we'll<00:04:24.610> take<00:04:24.760> this<00:04:24.880> one<00:04:25.060> step<00:04:25.180> at<00:04:25.330> a<00:04:25.420> time<00:04:31.200> and

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
we'll take this one step at a time and

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.160 
we'll take this one step at a time and
here<00:04:33.670> we<00:04:33.850> have<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:34.540> quick<00:04:35.410> start<00:04:35.560> guide<00:04:36.990> like<00:04:37.990> it

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
guide um this where each sensor plugs

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.880 
guide um this where each sensor plugs
into<00:05:00.210> on<00:05:01.210> you<00:05:01.510> to<00:05:01.630> put<00:05:01.840> in<00:05:01.960> batteries

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
okay um this is how you test all the

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.300 
okay um this is how you test all the
different<00:05:19.990> things<00:05:22.260> go<00:05:23.260> to<00:05:23.320> try<00:05:23.740> me<00:05:24.010> I<00:05:25.530> need<00:05:26.530> you

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
different things go to try me I need you

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.840 
different things go to try me I need you
choose<00:05:27.580> what<00:05:27.820> you<00:05:27.910> want<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.120> test<00:05:28.360> out<00:05:29.400> um<00:05:30.400> you

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
choose what you want to test out um you

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.240 
choose what you want to test out um you
run<00:05:31.330> it<00:05:31.450> and<00:05:31.720> you<00:05:32.380> make<00:05:32.710> sure<00:05:32.740> that<00:05:33.040> you<00:05:33.160> have

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
run it and you make sure that you have

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.990 
run it and you make sure that you have
the<00:05:33.370> wire<00:05:33.550> hooked<00:05:33.820> up<00:05:34.000> correctly<00:05:34.590> and<00:05:35.590> you<00:05:36.580> put

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
the wire hooked up correctly and you put

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.880 
the wire hooked up correctly and you put
it<00:05:37.060> over<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.930> test<00:05:38.140> bag<00:05:38.410> we'll<00:05:38.590> get<00:05:38.740> that

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
it over the test bag we'll get that

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.250 
it over the test bag we'll get that
later<00:05:38.950> now<00:05:40.320> this<00:05:41.320> looks<00:05:41.680> remarkably<00:05:42.400> like

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
later now this looks remarkably like

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.640 
later now this looks remarkably like
Bionicle

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.020 

that's<00:05:49.650> because<00:05:49.979> it's<00:05:50.280> made<00:05:50.550> by<00:05:50.790> the<00:05:50.850> same

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
that's because it's made by the same

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.620 
that's because it's made by the same
people<00:05:55.669> and<00:05:56.669> that's<00:05:56.910> what<00:05:57.120> you<00:05:57.240> get<00:05:57.360> at<00:05:57.600> the

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
people and that's what you get at the

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:03.770 
people and that's what you get at the
end<00:05:58.070> big<00:05:59.070> mess<00:05:59.250> of<00:05:59.370> wires<00:05:59.520> and<00:06:02.510> then<00:06:03.510> this

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
end big mess of wires and then this

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.490 
end big mess of wires and then this
telling<00:06:04.260> you<00:06:04.380> to<00:06:04.530> run<00:06:04.680> the<00:06:04.860> demo<00:06:06.500> basically

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
telling you to run the demo basically

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.580 
telling you to run the demo basically
what<00:06:07.740> that<00:06:07.770> does<00:06:07.949> is<00:06:08.520> move<00:06:09.320> forward<00:06:10.320> turn

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
what that does is move forward turn

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.240 
what that does is move forward turn
around<00:06:10.860> come<00:06:11.100> back<00:06:11.900> so<00:06:12.900> I'm<00:06:13.229> just<00:06:13.889> telling<00:06:14.130> you

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
around come back so I'm just telling you

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.960 
around come back so I'm just telling you
what<00:06:14.430> to<00:06:14.460> do<00:06:14.610> afterwards<00:06:15.139> didn't<00:06:16.139> see<00:06:16.260> this

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
what to do afterwards didn't see this

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.180 
what to do afterwards didn't see this
put<00:06:17.970> the<00:06:18.090> CD<00:06:18.300> in<00:06:18.389> pewter<00:06:18.960> Wow<00:06:19.590> never<00:06:19.949> figure

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
put the CD in pewter Wow never figure

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.620 
put the CD in pewter Wow never figure
that<00:06:20.220> the<00:06:20.400> CD<00:06:20.699> goes<00:06:20.850> in<00:06:20.940> the<00:06:21.030> computer<00:06:21.479> before

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
that the CD goes in the computer before

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.779 
that the CD goes in the computer before
and<00:06:22.910> then<00:06:23.910> running<00:06:24.270> to<00:06:24.419> fry<00:06:24.690> bot<00:06:25.550> good<00:06:26.550> to<00:06:26.669> know

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
and then running to fry bot good to know

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:28.460 
and then running to fry bot good to know
because<00:06:26.970> the<00:06:27.300> demo<00:06:27.510> bot<00:06:27.690> actually<00:06:28.020> turns<00:06:28.289> into

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
because the demo bot actually turns into

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.000 
because the demo bot actually turns into
the<00:06:28.740> tracks<00:06:28.949> I<00:06:29.750> call<00:06:30.750> it<00:06:30.840> the<00:06:30.930> demo<00:06:31.110> bot<00:06:31.440> but<00:06:31.710> it

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
the tracks I call it the demo bot but it

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.560 
the tracks I call it the demo bot but it
doesn't<00:06:32.310> really<00:06:32.400> have<00:06:32.729> a<00:06:32.760> name<00:06:32.910> I<00:06:33.240> just<00:06:33.270> call

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570 
doesn't really have a name I just call

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.700 
doesn't really have a name I just call
it<00:06:33.630> that<00:06:33.690> because<00:06:33.900> it's<00:06:34.199> the<00:06:34.289> first<00:06:34.410> thing<00:06:34.560> you

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
it that because it's the first thing you

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.370 
it that because it's the first thing you
build<00:06:35.070> and<00:06:35.430> run<00:06:35.880> it's<00:06:36.030> a<00:06:36.120> demo<00:06:36.360> program<00:06:38.300> here

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
build and run it's a demo program here

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.469 
build and run it's a demo program here
is<00:06:40.380> the<00:06:40.680> big<00:06:40.979> manual<00:06:41.639> a<00:06:42.080> little<00:06:43.080> bit<00:06:44.479> very

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 
is the big manual a little bit very

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:46.370
