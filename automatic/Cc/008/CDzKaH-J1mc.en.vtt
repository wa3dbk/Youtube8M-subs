00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.920
 hello in this tutorial I want to tell you 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:12.309
 how can we make this nice pendant 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.110
 The materials we are going to use are 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.680
 fine cardboard that is the one that we are going to 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.410
 recycle plant paper to trace us 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.590
 let's help with a fine stick then 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.660
 We are going to use nail varnish and paint 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.540
 The first thing we do is cut in a 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.760
 fine cardboard two circles with the size 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.220
 we want it to be our pendant and 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.470
 then what we do is throw glue 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.500
 in the area where you have the drawing and 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.080
 paste it the next step would be to sand 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.660
 everything is the edge to remove the 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.080
 perceptions of the circle and for that 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.470
 We are going to use a sandpaper of 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.470
 fine-grained 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.740
 we set the entire edge well 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.740
 in this way 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.420
 once we have already sanded all the 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.619
 edge and it has been perfect what 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.970
 what we do next is to paint 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.570
 we paint everything that is the surface 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.790
 on both sides and the edge to give 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.880
 color to the bottom that is going to have our 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.369
 I'm going to paint black 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.280
 the background so that the colors of the drawing 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.280
 that takes the pendant stand out much more 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.610
 a beautiful dried pendant painting 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.340
 what we are going to do is trace the drawing 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.430
 that we just did we will put the paper 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.570
 above and we will go over the whole drawing 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.970
 so that it is marked 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.250
 once we have finished tracing 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.460
 the drawing on both sides what we're going 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.400
 to do is to paint it for it we are going to 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.390
 use different nail lacquer 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.340
 colors 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.570
 we can use another type of paint 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.570
 that as you like it 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:06.610
 and now it would only be to give the colors 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.610
 in the reason that we just trace 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.870
 we will give you two coats of paint and when 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.180
 we are painting the flower so that 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.150
 petals are perfect for us 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.350
 we will help with the tip of a stick and 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.350
 we will give the form 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.170
 removing the paint that is left over 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.450
 once we have it dry, the only thing 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.700
 What we have left to do is a small 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.170
 hole in the part up here that 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.900
 we can do it with the tip of the stick 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.120
 we will introduce a ring for later 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:07.480
 place the cord a chain that 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.160
 more you like 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:15.160
 we put it like this we close the ring 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.160
 and it would stay like that 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.920
 I hope you liked this tutorial 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.920
 and see you in the next thanks
