the<00:00:28.950> eco<00:00:29.280> challenge<00:00:29.310> was<00:00:30.000> designed<00:00:30.450> to<00:00:30.630> be<00:00:30.780> as

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
the eco challenge was designed to be as

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.220 
the eco challenge was designed to be as
trial<00:00:31.440> of<00:00:31.740> practical<00:00:32.460> technologies<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:34.050> in

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
trial of practical technologies so in

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.430 
trial of practical technologies so in

status quo the eco challenge is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.810 
status quo the eco challenge is
extremely<00:00:40.800> relevant<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.430> ordinary

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
extremely relevant for ordinary

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.420 
extremely relevant for ordinary
Australians<00:00:42.540> because<00:00:42.989> fuel<00:00:43.770> efficiency<00:00:44.370> is

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
Australians because fuel efficiency is

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.799 
Australians because fuel efficiency is
really<00:00:44.760> important<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.360> good<00:00:45.570> for<00:00:45.720> the

eco<00:00:51.809> challenge<00:00:51.860> really<00:00:52.860> gets<00:00:53.580> the<00:00:53.730> message

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
eco challenge really gets the message

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.630 
eco challenge really gets the message
about<00:00:54.330> how<00:00:54.390> efficient<00:00:55.290> cars<00:00:55.740> can<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.250> if<00:00:56.430> you

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
about how efficient cars can be if you

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.100 
about how efficient cars can be if you
marry<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.090> right<00:00:57.270> technology<00:00:57.930> with

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
marry the right technology with

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:18.250 
marry the right technology with
conservative<00:00:58.770> driving<00:00:59.220> techniques

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.770 

the<00:01:19.100> basic<00:01:19.520> strategy<00:01:20.030> for<00:01:20.210> this<00:01:20.300> is<00:01:20.480> really

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
the basic strategy for this is really

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.680 
the basic strategy for this is really
simple<00:01:21.200> we<00:01:21.740> tried<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.220> maintain<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:23.030> slowest

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
simple we tried to maintain the slowest

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.200 
simple we tried to maintain the slowest
possible<00:01:24.100> efficient<00:01:25.100> traveling<00:01:25.640> speed<00:01:25.940> and

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
possible efficient traveling speed and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.960 
possible efficient traveling speed and
then<00:01:26.900> you<00:01:27.380> just<00:01:27.560> try<00:01:27.800> and<00:01:27.830> not<00:01:28.130> very<00:01:28.340> speed

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
then you just try and not very speed

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.800 
then you just try and not very speed
very<00:01:29.240> much<00:01:29.500> two<00:01:30.500> big<00:01:30.710> challenges<00:01:30.980> one<00:01:31.880> intense

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
very much two big challenges one intense

competition in our class and the second

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.780 
competition in our class and the second
big<00:01:35.390> challenge<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:35.930> endurance<00:01:36.470> it's<00:01:36.790> 3,100

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
big challenge is endurance it's 3,100
