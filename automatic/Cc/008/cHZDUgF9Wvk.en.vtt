00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.200
 allies about 2,000 years ago dwarves 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.200
 the kingdom first met people 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.570
 and high elves who have already become 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.420
 allies by then due to wars 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.150

 lands and met with ancient peoples 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.580
 dwarves and their underground capital people and 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.560
 dwarves actively shared secrets

 battles and storytelling the second 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.900
 war dwarves of steelforge joined 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.420
 to the alliance of people fought against the orcs 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.620

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.110
 to break into the kazad 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.750
 having ruined the cities of the dwarf the fleet of madani and 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.150
 swamp angel bridge became a place 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.280
 constant battles only thanks 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.360
 counterattacks of people under the leadership 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.820
 Anduina Lotara 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.250
 the orcs did not have time to seize the steel mount and 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.710
 after the war many allies decided 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.470
 leave alliance but king of magnesium bronze 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.530
 turnover remained his supporter knowing 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.740
 that dwarves owe people for liberation 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.870
 his kingdom times of cataclysm 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.050
 when deathwing broke out of the fall 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.310
 call destruction all over azerot 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.810
 natural disasters have affected and 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.270
 kingdom dwarves 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.940
 in the territories around steelforge began 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.330
 earthquakes which were destroyed 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.030
 many settlements and their inhabitants died 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.280
 king magni is disturbed by the states of the world 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.310
 tried to perform a mystical ritual 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.930
 unity ground ceremony led to 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.590
 unexpected result 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.299
 magnesium turned into a diamond statue 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.210
 fused with the depths of steel 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.750
 in the confusion that followed the loss 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.660
 the king 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.150
 his daughter Moira last married 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.460
 yard for black iron and left 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.190
 Steelhorn claimed the throne and 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.980
 captured the city with the help of his clan 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.060
 spouse if it were not for the intervention of the king 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.000
 Varian Rinn 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.920
 and his son prince anduina action moira 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.760
 would certainly lead to a new civilian 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.130
 the war 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.520
 varus divided control over the capital 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.490
 equally divided between the three clans creating a council 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.760
 three hammers but also in conclusion 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.950
 would affect the people and culture karmadon 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.650
 old homeland of dwarves and gnomes 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.070
 still also stands up confidently 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.230
 of enemies 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.720
 that sprawled around eastern 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.060
 kingdoms during the second war horde 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.250
 managed to conquer vast territories on 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.710
 continent and despite being defeated 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.140
 conflict part of the old horde resides in 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.520
 goat yeah not this is the dragon maw clan and 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.700
 clan of the black mountain 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.120
 now the dwarf and allies seek to return 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.710
 most of what they have lost 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.220
 danger surrounds the continent from all 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.470
 parties 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.710
 not worthy firmly embarked on their native land 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.780
 and hold tight despite the fact that 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.419
 the continent is considered the safest 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.820
 the territories of the eastern mainland Karmadon 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.630
 faced with new threats from 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.800
 touched and dwarves black iron 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.910
 taking advantage of the confusion three of 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.070
 tribe world nape 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.500
 renewed the ancient war against 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.450
 steel mound and despite reaching 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.030
 heroes and adventurers 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:55.830
 after the cataclysm in cosmo yes it did not become 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.830
 calmer but rather the opposite
