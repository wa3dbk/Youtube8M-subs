you the V star demonstration here we're

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.810 
you the V star demonstration here we're
going<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.140> break<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.500> apart<00:00:28.590> break<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.670> down

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
going to break it apart break it down

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.640 
going to break it apart break it down
and<00:00:30.060> show<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.300> why<00:00:30.779> it's<00:00:31.170> not<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.500> most

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
and show you why it's not the most

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.490 
and show you why it's not the most
effective<00:00:32.070> way<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> forward<00:00:33.809> start<00:00:34.170> so

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
effective way to do a forward start so

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.810 
effective way to do a forward start so
Adams<00:00:34.829> gonna<00:00:34.920> hop<00:00:35.190> up<00:00:35.219> here

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
Adams gonna hop up here

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.720 
Adams gonna hop up here
he'll<00:00:36.120> demonstrate<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.809> V<00:00:36.960> start<00:00:37.290> now<00:00:37.469> okay

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.250 

so<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.789> break<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.270> down<00:00:45.510> notice<00:00:46.079> what

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
so to break this down notice what

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.470 
so to break this down notice what
happened<00:00:46.739> when<00:00:47.340> Adam<00:00:47.610> was<00:00:47.640> ready<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.059> go<00:00:48.270> he

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
happened when Adam was ready to go he

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.779 
happened when Adam was ready to go he
had<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.690> click<00:00:48.930> his<00:00:49.079> heels<00:00:49.110> back<00:00:49.710> got<00:00:50.520> up<00:00:50.640> on

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
had to click his heels back got up on

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.090 
had to click his heels back got up on
his<00:00:50.910> toes<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.719> straighten<00:00:52.350> his<00:00:52.440> body<00:00:52.710> up<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
his toes and straighten his body up and

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.510 
his toes and straighten his body up and
as<00:00:53.190> he<00:00:53.309> took<00:00:53.489> off<00:00:53.730> he<00:00:54.719> came<00:00:54.960> straight<00:00:55.140> up<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:56.340> he

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
as he took off he came straight up as he

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.939 
as he took off he came straight up as he
started<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> travel<00:00:57.270> down<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.570> ice<00:00:57.770> these<00:00:58.770> are

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
started to travel down the ice these are

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.650 
started to travel down the ice these are
the<00:00:59.010> reasons<00:00:59.370> why<00:00:59.430> we<00:01:00.000> don't<00:01:00.120> want<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.510> this

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the reasons why we don't want to do this

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.709 
the reasons why we don't want to do this
start<00:01:00.930> first<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.469> all<00:01:01.850> we<00:01:02.850> use<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.420> forward

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
start first of all we use the forward

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.960 
start first of all we use the forward
start<00:01:04.229> typically<00:01:05.040> when<00:01:05.640> we're<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.909> a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
start typically when we're in a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.700 
start typically when we're in a
stationary<00:01:06.570> position<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.260> throughout<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
stationary position and throughout the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.600 
stationary position and throughout the
course<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.159> shift

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
course of a shift

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.179 
course of a shift
you're<00:01:09.060> very<00:01:09.360> rarely<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.290> stationary<00:01:11.010> or

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
you're very rarely in a stationary or

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.640 
you're very rarely in a stationary or
standstill<00:01:11.850> position<00:01:12.450> quite<00:01:13.110> often<00:01:13.380> you're

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
standstill position quite often you're

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.710 
standstill position quite often you're
cut<00:01:13.920> you're<00:01:14.040> gliding<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.540> use

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
cut you're gliding and you have to use

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.929 
cut you're gliding and you have to use
this<00:01:15.900> use<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> forward<00:01:16.770> start<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.189> accelerate

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
this use a forward start to accelerate

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.230 
this use a forward start to accelerate
so<00:01:18.710> this<00:01:19.710> takeoff<00:01:20.189> really<00:01:20.580> does<00:01:20.790> not<00:01:20.909> does<00:01:21.210> not

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
so this takeoff really does not does not

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.050 
so this takeoff really does not does not
work<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.750> scenario<00:01:22.110> also<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.460> faceoffs

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
work in that scenario also at faceoffs

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.090 
work in that scenario also at faceoffs
we'll<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.900> move<00:01:25.200> up<00:01:25.320> here<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.920> always

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
we'll have that I move up here as always

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.140 
we'll have that I move up here as always
taking<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.580> fade<00:01:26.729> out

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
taking a fade out

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.359 
taking a fade out
there's<00:01:27.479> always<00:01:27.600> taking<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.020> faceoff<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:29.159> of

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
there's always taking a faceoff out of

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.640 
there's always taking a faceoff out of
faceoff<00:01:29.880> Adam<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.900> are<00:01:30.930> battling<00:01:31.229> for<00:01:31.470> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
faceoff Adam and I are battling for a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.469 
faceoff Adam and I are battling for a
loose<00:01:31.860> puck<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.310> Adam<00:01:32.579> ends<00:01:32.820> up<00:01:32.909> coming<00:01:33.180> up<00:01:33.299> on

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
loose puck if Adam ends up coming up on

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.569 
loose puck if Adam ends up coming up on
his<00:01:33.600> toes<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.619> end<00:01:34.799> up<00:01:34.950> bumping<00:01:35.220> them<00:01:35.460> at

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
his toes and I end up bumping them at

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.399 
his toes and I end up bumping them at
this<00:01:35.670> point<00:01:35.939> gonna<00:01:36.750> happen<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.170> gonna<00:01:37.290> end

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
this point gonna happen it's gonna end

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.560 
this point gonna happen it's gonna end
up<00:01:37.560> knocking<00:01:37.770> them<00:01:38.070> off<00:01:38.189> stride<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.240> again

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
up knocking them off stride so again

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.990 
up knocking them off stride so again
this<00:01:39.780> particular<00:01:40.200> takeoff<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.009> completely

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
this particular takeoff is completely

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.969 
this particular takeoff is completely
useless<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.720> scenario<00:01:43.259> we're<00:01:43.799> going<00:01:43.920> to

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
useless in this scenario we're going to

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.830 
useless in this scenario we're going to
show<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.460> correct<00:01:44.820> way<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
show you the correct way to do the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.719 
show you the correct way to do the
forward<00:01:46.110> start<00:01:47.090> key<00:01:48.090> Adam<00:01:48.329> right<00:01:48.420> over<00:01:48.630> here

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
forward start key Adam right over here

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.609 
forward start key Adam right over here
now<00:01:50.299> typically<00:01:50.780> you're<00:01:51.020> going<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.200> use<00:01:51.409> your
