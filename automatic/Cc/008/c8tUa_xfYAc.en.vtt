just<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.210> fantastic<00:01:12.750> looking<00:01:13.380> robot<00:01:13.799> mode<00:01:14.040> now

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
just a fantastic looking robot mode now

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.820 
just a fantastic looking robot mode now
he<00:01:14.729> does<00:01:14.909> come<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.240> two<00:01:15.299> flat<00:01:16.170> blasters<00:01:16.799> that

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
he does come with two flat blasters that

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.950 
he does come with two flat blasters that
are<00:01:17.159> fairly<00:01:17.610> well<00:01:17.850> painted<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.479> haven't

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
are fairly well painted I haven't

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.570 
are fairly well painted I haven't
figured<00:01:19.140> out<00:01:19.380> where<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.890> store<00:01:20.220> them<00:01:20.430> in

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
figured out where I can store them in

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.640 
figured out where I can store them in
robot<00:01:20.970> mode<00:01:21.000> yet<00:01:21.509> maybe<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.080> could<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.470> put

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
robot mode yet maybe you could just put

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.100 
robot mode yet maybe you could just put
them<00:01:22.770> off<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> shoulders<00:01:23.930> that<00:01:24.930> would

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
them off on the shoulders that would

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.810 
them off on the shoulders that would
work<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.470> guess<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:26.220> he<00:01:26.280> already<00:01:26.490> has<00:01:26.790> two

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
work I guess but he already has two

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.289 
work I guess but he already has two
blasters<00:01:27.750> over<00:01:28.560> his<00:01:28.770> back<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.369> then<00:01:29.880> he's<00:01:30.119> got

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
blasters over his back and then he's got

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.539 
blasters over his back and then he's got
missile<00:01:30.780> launchers<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.920> looks<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.369> he

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
missile launchers and it looks like he

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.590 
missile launchers and it looks like he
can<00:01:32.729> fly<00:01:33.259> just<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.500> really<00:01:35.220> cool<00:01:35.820> looking

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
can fly just a really cool looking

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.080 
can fly just a really cool looking

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
to fly in robot mode as he has these

able to get this guy in some crazy poses
heck<00:02:07.829> he<00:02:08.069> even<00:02:08.099> has<00:02:08.550> articulated<00:02:09.330> fingers<00:02:09.750> his

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
heck he even has articulated fingers his

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.040 
heck he even has articulated fingers his
transformation<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.640> easy<00:02:12.000> but

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
transformation is easy but

00:02:13.050 --> 00:03:02.740 
transformation is easy but
so<00:02:13.560> let's<00:02:13.830> go<00:02:13.920> ahead<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.100> get<00:02:14.220> into<00:02:14.400> it

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.550 

I<00:03:04.600> think<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.690> will<00:03:05.750> agree<00:03:05.960> with<00:03:06.110> me<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.260> this

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
I think it will agree with me that this

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.470 
I think it will agree with me that this
vehicle<00:03:06.800> mode<00:03:07.130> is<00:03:07.340> really<00:03:07.940> cool

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
vehicle mode is really cool

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.630 
vehicle mode is really cool
it<00:03:08.720> definitely<00:03:09.050> has<00:03:09.530> an<00:03:09.800> homage<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.250> the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
it definitely has an homage to the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.960 
it definitely has an homage to the
original<00:03:10.850> g1<00:03:11.720> figure<00:03:12.380> while<00:03:13.100> remaining<00:03:13.580> a

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
original g1 figure while remaining a

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.450 
original g1 figure while remaining a
little<00:03:14.300> bit<00:03:14.450> unique<00:03:14.690> I<00:03:15.200> like<00:03:15.830> it<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.040> lot

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
little bit unique I like it a lot

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.060 
little bit unique I like it a lot
I<00:03:16.490> really<00:03:17.270> really<00:03:17.510> like<00:03:17.930> it<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.200> lot<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.710> think

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
I really really like it a lot I think

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.610 
I really really like it a lot I think
it's<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.430> lot<00:03:19.700> of<00:03:19.730> fun<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.360> it's<00:03:20.990> something<00:03:21.320> a

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
it's a lot of fun and it's something a

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.620 
it's a lot of fun and it's something a
little<00:03:21.860> bit<00:03:21.980> better<00:03:22.280> than<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.030> quant<00:03:23.330> Ron

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
little bit better than the quant Ron

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.660 
little bit better than the quant Ron
combiner<00:03:24.110> there's<00:03:24.800> nothing<00:03:25.190> wrong<00:03:25.370> with<00:03:25.580> the

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
combiner there's nothing wrong with the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.030 
combiner there's nothing wrong with the
quant<00:03:25.910> Ron<00:03:26.180> figures<00:03:26.630> they're<00:03:27.500> just<00:03:27.740> a<00:03:27.830> little

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
quant Ron figures they're just a little

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.449 
quant Ron figures they're just a little
bit<00:03:28.160> too<00:03:28.340> complicated<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:29.300> too<00:03:29.360> small<00:03:30.459> this

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
bit too complicated and too small this

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.699 
bit too complicated and too small this
is<00:03:31.520> the<00:03:31.790> perfect<00:03:32.030> size<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:32.720> this<00:03:33.410> is<00:03:33.590> the

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
is the perfect size and this is the

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.280 
is the perfect size and this is the
perfect<00:03:34.070> transformation<00:03:34.720> this<00:03:35.720> is<00:03:35.870> probably

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
perfect transformation this is probably

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.380 
perfect transformation this is probably
the<00:03:36.470> best<00:03:36.680> not<00:03:37.280> techno<00:03:37.880> bot<00:03:38.060> or<00:03:38.239> not

I<00:03:50.530> think<00:03:51.530> this<00:03:51.650> figure<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:52.040> just<00:03:52.250> about

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
I think this figure is just about

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.160 
I think this figure is just about
perfect

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
perfect

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.890

I was going to show you guys the

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.470 
I was going to show you guys the
transformation<00:03:57.650> into<00:03:57.800> a<00:03:57.950> limb<00:03:58.310> mode<00:03:58.670> but

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
transformation into a limb mode but

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.949 
transformation into a limb mode but
there's<00:03:59.840> no<00:04:00.140> limb<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.920> attach<00:04:01.390> really<00:04:02.390> all<00:04:02.660> you

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
there's no limb to attach really all you

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.850 
there's no limb to attach really all you
do<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.709> return<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.700> figure<00:04:05.140> partially<00:04:06.140> to

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
do is return the figure partially to

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.570 
do is return the figure partially to
robot<00:04:07.220> mode<00:04:07.870> get<00:04:08.870> all<00:04:09.320> the<00:04:09.680> bits<00:04:09.950> out<00:04:10.280> of<00:04:10.370> the

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
robot mode get all the bits out of the

way of his vehicle mode and just kind of

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.050 
way of his vehicle mode and just kind of
unfold<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:14.989> legs<00:04:15.170> and<00:04:16.100> that's<00:04:16.190> about<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:16.580> I

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
unfold the legs and that's about it I

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.670 
unfold the legs and that's about it I
mean<00:04:18.549> in<00:04:19.549> all<00:04:19.760> honesty<00:04:19.790> that<00:04:21.220> is<00:04:22.220> his<00:04:22.490> arm<00:04:22.790> mode

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
mean in all honesty that is his arm mode

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.500 
mean in all honesty that is his arm mode
except<00:04:24.680> you<00:04:24.830> fold<00:04:25.130> this<00:04:25.400> panel<00:04:25.880> up<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.270> flip
