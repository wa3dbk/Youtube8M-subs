00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:03.739
 the 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.260
 in a few hours 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.669
 the 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.059
 the 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.580
 the national electric wheelchair hockey team is busy with the 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.619
 preparations for the hockey world cup in italy 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.560
 a trial of ten players on the world title leaves on 31 October 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.919
 to defend 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.049
 the last training was held in politics 22 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.989
 the team consists of 12 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.030
 after only nine nights light frost he really emerged before that even though 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.640
 We did things internationally but from 19 there were 38 participants at the time 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.300
 referee to get started with the hofje it is part of the 

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:44.899
 royal dutch hockey association how long is that 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.310
 own family 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.730
 real an official year but will be official from now on September 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.730
 absolutely great 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.530
 what do you do by sunday 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.980
 many training hours repeat the fall want to run all the dots on the i 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.620
 and then really after italy got the feeling team feeling everything with you 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.800
 so no further there is the youngest player 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.850
 for them the wk is his first major tournament 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.799
 and I am 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.450
 I got it at school 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.150
 made an acquaintance with the sport 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.610
 if i didn't say you were it was the twelfth 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.200
 and then I went to school and 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.660
 and swissport 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.660
 when i got fit in the local time i started playing 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.080
 it is not 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.370
 much nicer 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.210
 I can't find the weekdays that the weekend 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.210
 then I can be back 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.540
 in addition to being a tracking dog all with this title is in the pocket with this team 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.590
 and hopes to be world champion in english newspapers in italy 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.820
 the player of the world cup match more 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.749
 in that sense, and in the meantime does not know to what extent they have improved 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.869
 so I just have to wait and see how they play 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.299
 the coalition are absolute world leaders because they are simply far fewer 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.539
 it so in the Netherlands 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:32.539
 And yes but with the other countries it is always this case also 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:34.459
 test allows 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.920
 in terms of technique, he was a trainer, just a lot of entries, yes 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.169
 better than others think 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:43.540
 we have players it was anyway 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.839
 have less material 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:50.129
 with the arrival of kiers I think by invented in the Netherlands so therein 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.019
 we already have a step forward 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.039
 indeed a bit of the story is what it's all about and financing
