 in front of us 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.010
 the good mexican attacker 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.640
 by anthony minor 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.560

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.420

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.319
 find a result like that and 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.480
 winning a great team like brazil 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.879

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.560
 for everything they have strived 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.870
 they have trained with everything 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.120
 and I love life, I think it's because 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.010
 they are these tears after the 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.360
 match the tricolor received a visit 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.150
 very special 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.459
 sergio czech perez mexican pilot of the 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.470
 formula one reached concentration 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.470
 to motivate the players 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.570
 to support them tell them that we are with 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.060
 you all the country that do not have very 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.580
 excited and we share all the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.190
 sacrifice because it's here as long as I 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.200
 design takes in two months so house that 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.330
 when they go out to play and feel this 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.740
 sacrifice that development on behalf of 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.289
 all a country 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.539
 that it was with the heart that they have fun 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.990
 and that they see everything in the country for their 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.900
 families 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.360
 first of all for what they offer then to 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.510
 God because I think the most important thing 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.480
 for all 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.560
 final won Argentina good bravos but 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.850
 with a great peak 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.850
 it came to the grand final 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.350
 it was in abu dhabi it was the great moment 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.660
 and again the revenge was in the 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.229
 mind and in the heart of each of the 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.229
 players 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.409
 and Africans did not come by the best 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.489
 s 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.489
 but forceful 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.330
 and they achieved a new championship 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.819
 ours went with their foreheads in 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.580
 high the tears rolled because that's the way 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.960
 the defeat the pride remained because 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.259
 the races do not end here 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.120

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:10.889
