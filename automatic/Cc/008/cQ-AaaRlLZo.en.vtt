00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.760
 hello friends in this video we're going to 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.180
 show how to pack a suitcase to pass 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.760
 in this good rural hand the first thing 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.050
 most important the suitcase has to be 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.330
 of this style with a weekend 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.490
 then it's not going to be very big to have in 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.140
 mind that what to put in for 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.390
 it's not going to serve us either, it 's better 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.850
 take advantage of the clothes and between her that we 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.949
 we can combine between a 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.260
 set and another one goes for the first day 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.510
 of output would be convenient for example 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.970
 is how to wear dressed that would be in a 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.320
 Lacking a comfortable comfortable footwear tape 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.420
 with frank do since then 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.050
 take it also and then in the part 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.909
 above 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.430
 I have two good classes, I must say 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.960
 true that we are now in the era 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.760
 autumn-winter depend these suitcases 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.620
 in bad weather it can rise cold 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.960
 then I have 236 several of collbatÃ³ 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.670
 below and above another in this way 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.170
 I can use the one below for the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.810
 last day because it has not yet been visible 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.759
 and we can 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:19.270
 at the time of the chosen good friend we have 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.500
 chosen in principle 21 hours that we are going 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.509
 to serve because he brought me to do 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.000
 escapes through the mountain that we are going to have 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.979
 normally on a rural getaway and 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.570
 then something else dress thing if we go to 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.939
 visit the plan one of the by the 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.740
 around the same town that would be a 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.960
 little more I wish like it can be a 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.549
 leather operator jacket and if it does 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.170
 cold you for example wearing a vest 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.939
 of these now that they take a lot of 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.130
 skin 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.409
 and then they have now remember and a little 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.060
 more dress but good if you do not depend 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.679
 also of the case if more is done in plan 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.500
 Trekking would be a more amoral plan 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.170
 would be spent would lack plans of different 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.439
 more cultural or acceptance as you see 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.710
 that combine the two things let's go 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.510
 with the suitcase 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.350
 well here the suitcase we have put 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.060
 first the typical jeans that 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.760
 are we could combine it for example 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:15.630
 with a basic basic and above 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.880
 for example a vest of these cases of 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.680
 fleece then let you do 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.750
 activities also outdoors because 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:27.120
 you have the most free arms for the 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.390
 Saturday if you have planned on Saturday 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.730
 Departure at night so look you can 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.120
 take advantage of the same set what is 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:41.330
 the cowboy with the mythical the stain 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.330
 white that is getting a gauze 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.200
 we give a totally change even 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.560
 you can wear heels 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:58.260
 for the last day we would have a new 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.420
 pants because it's a pair of pants 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.280
 we could take advantage with the first day 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.069
 that we have spoken since jersey so no 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.470
 you need more and then the footwear 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.180
 comfortable we have taken all the time and 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.019
 we have even installed law but in 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.580
 some a backpack 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:18.000
 we have to forget the underwear 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.030
 is worth the shoes that we have said if you go 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.390
 to leave the sports also what 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.390
 we try 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.799
 the toilet also teeth 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.569
 this also you have to enter before 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.629
 but if not then it does not take much that 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.310
 It takes you in small and important boats 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.580
 is to mark the pants at the bottom of the 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.950
 all stretched lines and do not wrinkle and 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.989
 good as we take advantage of and we're going 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.920
 Aragon with several posts above 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.030
 Well, that 's how we are dealing with bags 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.180
 we recommend you also have a shoulder strap 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.980
 because at the same time that they bend to this means 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.500
 also that we can take advantage of 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.769
 shoes to the idea because if we go out 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.769
 you will also do 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.070
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.720

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.370
 travelers dotcom or leave your 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.330
 comments thank you very much until the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.330
 next goodbye
