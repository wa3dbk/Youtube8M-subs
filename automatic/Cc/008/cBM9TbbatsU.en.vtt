I took my sorbet mixture out of the
fridge<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.130> now<00:03:50.519> like<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.090> said<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:51.390> was<00:03:51.480> going

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
fridge and now like I said I was going

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.820 
fridge and now like I said I was going
to<00:03:51.690> put<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:51.870> in<00:03:51.959> for<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.140> couple<00:03:52.350> hours<00:03:52.470> I

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
to put it in for a couple hours I

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.259 
to put it in for a couple hours I
actually<00:03:53.010> put<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.370> in<00:03:53.459> overnight<00:03:53.700> just

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
actually put it in overnight just

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.030 
actually put it in overnight just
because<00:03:54.510> it's<00:03:54.660> much<00:03:54.810> easier<00:03:54.840> in<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.590> colder

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
because it's much easier in the colder

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.520 
because it's much easier in the colder
the<00:03:56.070> better<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:57.090> now<00:03:57.420> that's<00:03:57.600> done<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.350> want
