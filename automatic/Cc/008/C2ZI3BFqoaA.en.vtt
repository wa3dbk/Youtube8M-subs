00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 everyone 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.189
 creating the cold and I bring you a new 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:19.430
 video tutorial on how to install tactics 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.400
 a nintendo ds emulator I hope that 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.660
 you like, we started with the installation 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.240
 proof will get and so download the 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.970
 files I'll leave the link below the 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.470
 description once downloaded that the 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.470
 have in your memory microsd 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.480
 you need a file manager this 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.380
 it helps you to see all the files of 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:45.190
 his internal memory as he speculated 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.790
 doc documents and much more 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.860
 this case I am using now astro 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:55.510
 an application that you can download from 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:58.239
 google play free let's continue first 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.410
 that nothing believes in the folder where 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.410
 they put all the files 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:10.410
 if they are fixed there are three files that are 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.950
 firmware and two zombies 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.479
 we select 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.479
 we can move it 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.620
 move 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.110
 I do not know leave 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.050
 and from above 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.050
 and copy them 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.790
 once they are copied we return to 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.750
 is edit the folder where I have we have 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.750
 our emulator 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.940
 Brad Pitt 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.940
 and let's say install 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.150
 let's see the installation a bit like 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:59.280
 about 45 seconds or so 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.570
 we have done it 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.570
 and we left here 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.000
 enter the menu and see this as the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.000
 practical application we execute 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.670
 this device takes much 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.880
 application since it brings little ram and little 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.560
 it's a very small processor once 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.080
 in the game 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.819
 sd card and we look for the folder where 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.780
 they have the games I in this case they 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.340
 called nintendo ds emulator as you see 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.190
 I have two files 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:48.170
 in this case I will execute 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.680
 what is the pokemon black 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.180
 we give the menu and the two arrows this 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.810
 it helps us to be a little more 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.360
 Quick the game so as not to be struggling 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.750
 and they look at this the game is not 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.270
 running good this has been all 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.010
