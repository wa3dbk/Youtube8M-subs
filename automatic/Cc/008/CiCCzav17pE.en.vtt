we're<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:44.370> hard<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.640> say

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
but there's a pretty good chance we'd

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.279 
but there's a pretty good chance we'd
have<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.340> great<00:00:47.579> pic<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.329> some<00:00:48.960> money<00:00:49.110> to
