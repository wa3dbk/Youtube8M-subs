amazing treatment for a reran soreness
well<00:00:05.220> we've<00:00:05.339> got<00:00:05.520> it<00:00:05.609> we<00:00:05.670> got<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:05.940> wires<00:00:06.150> run

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
well we've got it we got the wires run

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.080 
well we've got it we got the wires run
we've<00:00:06.810> got<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:07.049> two<00:00:07.950> seven-foot<00:00:08.519> wires<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:09.030> go

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
we've got a two seven-foot wires that go

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.330 
we've got a two seven-foot wires that go
to<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.510> back<00:00:09.690> with<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.469> extensions<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.219> go

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
to the back with the extensions to go

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.660 
to the back with the extensions to go
down<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.820> cornet<00:00:12.240> band<00:00:12.269> on<00:00:12.780> one<00:00:12.990> set<00:00:13.290> and

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
down to the cornet band on one set and

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.820 
down to the cornet band on one set and
then<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.790> other<00:00:14.910> set<00:00:15.210> what<00:00:15.450> we<00:00:15.480> do<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:16.109> we

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
then the other set what we do is we

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.759 
then the other set what we do is we
place<00:00:17.699> paths<00:00:18.830> in<00:00:19.830> areas<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.810> we<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.590> we've

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
place paths in areas that we that we've

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.759 
place paths in areas that we that we've
discovered<00:00:23.189> are<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.820> chronic<00:00:24.600> problems<00:00:25.080> okay

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
discovered are the chronic problems okay

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:34.520 
discovered are the chronic problems okay
so<00:00:26.730> what<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.849> put<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.970> gel<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:33.530> and

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
so what you do is you put the gel on and

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.229 
so what you do is you put the gel on and
all<00:00:34.680> these<00:00:34.829> wires<00:00:35.130> I've<00:00:35.370> got<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.670> my<00:00:35.790> hand<00:00:35.820> here

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
all these wires I've got in my hand here

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.130 
all these wires I've got in my hand here
they're<00:00:36.450> all<00:00:36.600> done<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.020> sequence<00:00:38.120> okay<00:00:39.140> you

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
they're all done in sequence okay you

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.510 
they're all done in sequence okay you
hook<00:00:40.320> them<00:00:40.410> up<00:00:40.530> before<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.950> do<00:00:41.100> them<00:00:43.340> okay<00:00:44.340> now

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
hook them up before you do them okay now

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.420 
hook them up before you do them okay now
you<00:00:44.579> got<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.940> go<00:00:45.090> right<00:00:45.500> here<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.860> takes<00:00:47.219> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
you got to go right here so that takes a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.590 
you got to go right here so that takes a
little<00:00:47.610> bit<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> way<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.030> move<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.450> out<00:00:48.570> of

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
little bit in the way so move it out of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.049 
little bit in the way so move it out of
the<00:00:48.690> way<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:50.430> then<00:00:50.610> you're<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> go<00:00:51.030> here

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
the way so then you're going to go here

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.520 
the way so then you're going to go here
then<00:00:54.059> you're<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.360> put<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.079> second<00:00:55.500> one

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
then you're going to put the second one

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.639 
then you're going to put the second one
the<00:00:56.010> third<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.610> should<00:00:56.940> say<00:00:57.260> goes<00:00:58.260> right

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the third one I should say goes right

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.400 
the third one I should say goes right
there<00:00:59.399> that's<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.910> real<00:01:00.149> critical<00:01:00.600> area<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.199> a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
there that's a real critical area for a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.280 
there that's a real critical area for a
racehorse<00:01:02.539> going<00:01:03.539> around<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.019> same

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
racehorse going around on that same

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.960 
racehorse going around on that same
circle<00:01:04.799> all<00:01:04.949> at<00:01:05.640> Arn<00:01:05.790> time<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:08.430> then<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.820> go

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
circle all at Arn time and then we go

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.160 
circle all at Arn time and then we go
from<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.659> point<00:01:10.280> we<00:01:11.280> go<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:12.049> to<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
from that point we go up to the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.520 
from that point we go up to the
sacroiliac<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.760> baha'i<00:01:15.320> there's<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
sacroiliac and the baha'i there's the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.640 
sacroiliac and the baha'i there's the
baha'i<00:01:17.810> okay<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:18.930> right<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> spinal

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
baha'i okay it's right on the spinal

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.760 
baha'i okay it's right on the spinal
cord<00:01:20.270> this<00:01:21.270> goes<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.350> spinal<00:01:22.619> cord

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
cord this goes right on the spinal cord

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.109 
cord this goes right on the spinal cord
then<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.790> go<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.119> sacroiliac<00:01:25.939> which<00:01:26.939> is

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
then we go to the sacroiliac which is

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.200 
then we go to the sacroiliac which is
right<00:01:27.360> at<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.689> highest<00:01:27.900> point<00:01:28.229> okay<00:01:29.210> right

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
right at the highest point okay right

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.240 
right at the highest point okay right
there<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:31.259> put<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.920> there

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
there you put that on there

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.140 
there you put that on there
then<00:01:34.000> your<00:01:34.120> bike<00:01:34.300> get<00:01:34.510> some<00:01:34.690> tape<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:37.060> we<00:01:39.150> have

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
then your bike get some tape and we have

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.590 
then your bike get some tape and we have
the<00:01:40.270> tape<00:01:40.480> already<00:01:40.870> cut<00:01:41.080> here<00:01:42.600> we're

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
the tape already cut here we're

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.510 
the tape already cut here we're
researching<00:01:44.229> tape<00:01:44.680> we<00:01:45.010> haven't<00:01:45.310> really

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
researching tape we haven't really

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.280 
researching tape we haven't really
satisfied<00:01:46.180> ourselves<00:01:46.690> a<00:01:46.750> little<00:01:46.870> using<00:01:47.110> the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
right tape this is the word bone

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.060 
right tape this is the word bone
treatment<00:01:52.570> this<00:01:52.750> is<00:01:52.930> one<00:01:53.200> necessity<00:01:53.770> for<00:01:53.950> any

to all horses now we do these points and
the<00:02:18.489> ting<00:02:18.760> point<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.180> we<00:02:19.270> use<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.780> gall

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
the ting point that we use is the gall

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.890 
the ting point that we use is the gall
bladder<00:02:20.170> ting<00:02:20.800> point<00:02:21.100> okay<00:02:21.820> so<00:02:22.660> you've<00:02:22.870> got

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
bladder ting point okay so you've got
