00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
at the Mojave Desert I put up a video a

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.990 
at the Mojave Desert I put up a video a
couple<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.530> days<00:00:10.679> ago<00:00:10.860> about<00:00:11.160> this<00:00:11.340> strange

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
place down there by Edwards Air Force

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.300 
place down there by Edwards Air Force
Base

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
Base

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.310 
Base
and<00:00:19.400> there's<00:00:20.060> a<00:00:20.150> lot<00:00:20.390> of<00:00:20.420> weird<00:00:20.780> stuff<00:00:20.840> down

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
and there's a lot of weird stuff down

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.800 
and there's a lot of weird stuff down
here<00:00:21.700> and<00:00:22.700> I<00:00:22.790> was<00:00:22.910> looking<00:00:23.150> around<00:00:23.210> the<00:00:23.480> area

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
here and I was looking around the area

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.920 
here and I was looking around the area
and<00:00:26.950> just<00:00:27.950> scoping<00:00:28.220> the<00:00:28.340> place<00:00:28.370> out<00:00:28.930> because

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
and just scoping the place out because

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.750 
and just scoping the place out because
I'm<00:00:30.080> going<00:00:30.290> to<00:00:30.350> put<00:00:30.500> some<00:00:31.040> more<00:00:31.190> together<00:00:31.400> on

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
I'm going to put some more together on

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.580 
I'm going to put some more together on
this<00:00:31.970> and<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:32.540> actually<00:00:33.140> a<00:00:33.320> little<00:00:33.500> bit

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
this and and actually a little bit

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.630 
this and and actually a little bit
better<00:00:33.770> quality<00:00:35.320> but<00:00:36.320> um<00:00:36.500> to<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:37.100> northwest

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
better quality but um to the northwest

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.440 
better quality but um to the northwest
of<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:37.820> area<00:00:38.150> is<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:39.340> very<00:00:40.340> nondescript<00:00:40.670> area

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
of the area is a very nondescript area

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.479 
of the area is a very nondescript area
of<00:00:41.720> here<00:00:42.410> where<00:00:42.739> my<00:00:42.830> cursor<00:00:42.860> is<00:00:43.480> and<00:00:45.489> nothing

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
of here where my cursor is and nothing

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.549 
of here where my cursor is and nothing
around<00:00:46.730> except<00:00:47.360> desert<00:00:47.989> and<00:00:48.700> things<00:00:50.559> things

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
around except desert and things things

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.470 
around except desert and things things
for<00:00:52.129> sure<00:00:52.390> but<00:00:53.390> I<00:00:53.900> ran<00:00:54.589> into<00:00:54.739> something<00:00:55.480> it's

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
for sure but I ran into something it's

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:08.510 
for sure but I ran into something it's
really<00:00:56.750> fun<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:56.989> run<00:00:57.199> into<00:00:57.409> these<00:00:57.530> things

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.530 

seems<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.390> be<00:01:09.450> some<00:01:09.570> sort<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:09.990> compound<00:01:10.470> I

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
seems to be some sort of compound I

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.760 
seems to be some sort of compound I
think<00:01:12.540> these<00:01:12.630> things<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.990> front<00:01:13.170> are<00:01:13.380> solar

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
think these things in front are solar

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.420 
think these things in front are solar
panels

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
panels

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.000 
panels
I<00:01:15.080> think<00:01:16.760> stand<00:01:17.760> the<00:01:17.880> reason<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.690> that<00:01:19.010> started

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
I think stand the reason is that started

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.430 
I think stand the reason is that started
to<00:01:20.070> get<00:01:20.190> power<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.520> there<00:01:22.250> it's<00:01:23.250> bad<00:01:24.440> don't

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
to get power out there it's bad don't

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.580 
to get power out there it's bad don't
take<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> closer<00:01:26.040> look<00:01:26.310> at<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.750> but<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:28.020> looks

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
take a closer look at this but it looks

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.550 
take a closer look at this but it looks
like<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:29.270> got<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.300> little<00:01:30.450> brother<00:01:31.229> Hill

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
like it's got a little brother Hill

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.359 
like it's got a little brother Hill
right<00:01:31.920> off<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:32.970> side<00:01:33.570> there<00:01:34.369> there's

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
right off to the side there there's

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.640 
right off to the side there there's
nothing<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.880> look<00:01:36.030> at<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.330> there<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:37.440> I<00:01:37.470> can

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
nothing to look at on there that I can

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.230 
nothing to look at on there that I can
find<00:01:37.890> immediately<00:01:38.430> I'll<00:01:38.820> look<00:01:38.940> at<00:01:39.090> this

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
find immediately I'll look at this

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.520 
find immediately I'll look at this
closer<00:01:39.660> or<00:01:40.140> another<00:01:40.410> time<00:01:42.350> let's<00:01:43.350> take<00:01:43.500> a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
closer or another time let's take a

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.590 
closer or another time let's take a
closer<00:01:43.890> look<00:01:44.009> at<00:01:44.759> what's<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.060> confident

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
closer look at what's not confident

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.980 
closer look at what's not confident
still<00:01:48.680> all<00:01:49.680> right<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:51.030> know<00:01:51.119> I'm<00:01:51.450> gonna<00:01:51.750> zoom

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
still all right you know I'm gonna zoom

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.330 
still all right you know I'm gonna zoom
in<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.320> I'll<00:01:52.410> zoom<00:01:52.560> back<00:01:52.619> out<00:01:52.920> because<00:01:53.340> uh<00:01:55.340> it

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
in but I'll zoom back out because uh it

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.440 
in but I'll zoom back out because uh it
gets<00:01:56.520> too<00:01:56.640> blurry<00:01:57.050> but<00:01:58.050> I<00:01:58.080> tried<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.800> show<00:01:59.009> you

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
gets too blurry but I tried to show you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.029 
gets too blurry but I tried to show you
the<00:02:00.450> best<00:02:00.660> picture<00:02:01.050> possible<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> already

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
the best picture possible so I already

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.240 
the best picture possible so I already
have<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.250> set<00:02:02.610> up<00:02:02.700> at<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.910> best<00:02:03.119> angle<00:02:03.890> but<00:02:04.890> I

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
have a set up at the best angle but I

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.479 
have a set up at the best angle but I
can<00:02:05.460> get<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.149> see<00:02:09.649> there's<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.799> green

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
can get you can see there's this green

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.670 
can get you can see there's this green
thing<00:02:11.549> all<00:02:12.330> right<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.900> looks<00:02:13.019> like<00:02:13.230> some<00:02:13.500> for

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
thing all right that looks like some for

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.220 
thing all right that looks like some for
a<00:02:13.709> vehicle<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.220> may<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.900> something

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
a vehicle that may be like something

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.370 
a vehicle that may be like something
with<00:02:16.350> wheels<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:17.370> maybe<00:02:17.580> not<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.930> certainly

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
with wheels but maybe not that certainly

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.979 
with wheels but maybe not that certainly
certainly<00:02:19.890> looks<00:02:20.130> like<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.810> space<00:02:21.810> vehicle

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
certainly looks like a space vehicle

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.310 
certainly looks like a space vehicle
with<00:02:22.380> something<00:02:22.650> behind<00:02:22.799> it<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:24.110> god<00:02:25.110> only

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
with something behind it and god only

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.220 
with something behind it and god only
knows<00:02:25.500> what<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:25.980> thing<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.250> but<00:02:27.230> that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
knows what that thing is but that

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.930 
knows what that thing is but that
certainly<00:02:28.440> also<00:02:28.890> looks<00:02:29.340> like<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.670> space

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
certainly also looks like a space

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.410 
certainly also looks like a space
vehicle<00:02:30.180> with<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.140> little<00:02:31.530> row<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:32.420> something

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
vehicle with a little row of something

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.540 
vehicle with a little row of something
off<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.810> side<00:02:34.110> there<00:02:34.440> also

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.830 

again<00:02:39.550> this<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.850> Google<00:02:40.240> Earth<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.690> I'm

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
again this is Google Earth and I'm

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.160 
again this is Google Earth and I'm
looking<00:02:41.200> from<00:02:41.380> outer<00:02:41.500> space<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:42.600> not<00:02:43.600> bad<00:02:43.900> it's

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
looking from outer space so not bad it's
