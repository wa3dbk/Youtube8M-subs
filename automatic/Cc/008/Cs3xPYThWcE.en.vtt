00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
and you just put your hook along the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.149 
and you just put your hook along the
side<00:01:32.439> of<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.909> picture<00:01:34.119> part<00:01:34.710> pull<00:01:35.710> up<00:01:35.829> a<00:01:35.950> loop

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159

and<00:01:36.369> pull<00:01:36.460> it<00:01:36.939> through<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:40.030> simply<00:01:40.960> creates

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
and pull it through this simply creates

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.179 
and pull it through this simply creates
a<00:01:41.799> chain<00:01:42.280> stitch<00:01:42.930> which<00:01:43.930> is<00:01:43.960> just<00:01:44.560> exactly

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
a chain stitch which is just exactly

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.749 
a chain stitch which is just exactly
like<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:46.000> would<00:01:46.180> do<00:01:46.360> with<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.630> needle<00:01:47.049> in<00:01:47.829> an

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
like you would do with a needle in an

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.069 
like you would do with a needle in an
embroidery<00:01:49.329> stitch<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:51.189> just<00:01:52.020> easier<00:01:53.020> for

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
embroidery stitch it's just easier for

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:59.410 
embroidery stitch it's just easier for
me<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.560> use<00:01:53.799> a<00:01:54.310> hook

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.320 

and<00:01:59.509> you<00:02:00.320> continue<00:02:00.560> around<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.700> entire

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
and you continue around the entire

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.609 
and you continue around the entire
project<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:06.259> entire<00:02:06.590> picture<00:02:06.920> portion<00:02:07.850> and

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
project the entire picture portion and

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.110 
project the entire picture portion and
it<00:02:09.619> just<00:02:09.920> helps<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.489> even<00:02:10.819> out<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:12.849> edges<00:02:13.849> that

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
it just helps to even out the edges that

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.420 
it just helps to even out the edges that
are<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.510> little<00:02:14.930> jagged<00:02:15.200> from<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:16.069> single

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430
