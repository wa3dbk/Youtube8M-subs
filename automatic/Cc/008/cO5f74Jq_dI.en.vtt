00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.460
 theme of our program 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:11.879
 trimmer is the buzzword the last 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.389
 time for those who have vegetation on 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.570
 face 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.190
 why because it's peak 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.710
 beard popularity 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.180
 You can city a lot 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.280
 bearded guys 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.650
 so the trimmers enjoy special 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:30.390
 in demand but few know what 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.700
 example and how to distinguish it from the usual 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.130
 long countries which almost cars 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.030
 today we are in a beauty salon shred style 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.760
 gloss and we asked to answer next 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.700
 high trimer 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.420
 beautiful girl stylist top stylist 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.940
 salon 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.460
 Elena network glitch who like no other 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.329
 meaning will answer all of us 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:00.989
 questions so elena please put me 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:05.610
 I see us here appliances begin 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.820
 the main thing is how to distinguish an example under the first 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.860
 queue we look at size c size 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.970
 coach and our 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.900
 very different stop in hand weight 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.210
 machine 3 blade and our distance between 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.760
 our one note 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.040
 up to two three millimeters 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.450
 the distance between the knives can be in 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.380
 typewriter when drying 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.390
 3 it has a distance of millimeter 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.550
 half a millimeter it means you can 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.770
 practically then smooth skin take off 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.380
 vegetation alone is not a sheep 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.330
 yourself while you can of course 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.180
 regulate but risk 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.820
 to bypass such for roughness and to scratch 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.000
 will therefore be half a millimeter remains and 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.050
 Of course, the difference in power is because 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.600
 good example is capable of holding charge 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.179
 unwired three years to eight ten 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.289
 hours it is very convenient to travel to 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.550
 working condition 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.179
 we went on a business trip for the weekend 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.780
 brought along 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.400
 sheets gang made up please all 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.230
 it will be in a few days 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.680
 actively 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.810
 your use of little nozzles 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.680
 comfortable to do 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.410
 curly ago bada make contour 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.520
 parts about meeting as difficult as possible 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.950
 and of course cope without the help of a master 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.930
 it is convenient but the difference is still with 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.330
 the following if you take a one-time 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.820
 machine you shoot really up 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.600
 smooth skin three make up 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:52.260
 half a millimeter convenient stop in hand 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:56.040
 they are very light coaches and they are very 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.670
 comfortable compact small blade 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.040
 small knives 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.380
 but we have another option there 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.700
 machine skills are specifically designed 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:12.100
 hair cutting 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:18.700
 so she and us he literally 3 4 cloves 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:20.560
 the knives are very quiet wireless if we 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.400
 will talk about a hair clipper 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.210
 hair 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.370
 they are powerful they work longer they 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:32.510
 able to cope with thick hair 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.810
 enough houses 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.540
 but unfortunately cut the city like to 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.209
 the tools won't be entirely right 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.049
 because small parts you can't 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.440
 process 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:49.379
 three things get good clicked 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.560
 good steel very sharp knife which 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:56.640
 allows fast in one motion 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.569
 remove those necessary hairs that we 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.680
 want to 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:05.609
 sharpness compactness and distance between 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.030
 I get knives if a guy 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.950
 a beard before that to him for her 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.109
 take care of just an example or 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.870
 Need and trimmer not machine in dependence 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:18.810
 from what is the length of his beard on 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.090
 face if we talk about pain those who 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.030
 worn a few months one 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.070
 coach you can not do need 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.060
 will be all the same professional machine 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.400
 hair cutting 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.120
 she will cope if we are talking about beard 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:37.110
 learn not 2 3 4 angry of course just 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.590
 three nozzle which is up to 6 7 millimeters 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.690
 leave the bristles volumetric adjustable and 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:47.639
 at the end whether the cultural part is removed 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:51.479
 just well we conclude the main 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:54.660
 answer between the coach and the machine in that 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:58.760
 that the trimmer is much more compact there 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:01.680
 the frequency of the teeth is different and they take off 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.380
 close enough to the skin unlike 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.099
 cars are all about irregularities 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.760
 and Germans 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.760
 fine fine thanks
