here it is in this clip and there I've

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.529 
here it is in this clip and there I've
actually<00:00:17.430> grows<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.029> see<00:00:18.270> I've<00:00:18.359> got<00:00:18.390> three

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
actually grows you see I've got three

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.320 
actually grows you see I've got three
Reds<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.140> table<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.760> white<00:00:20.970> there<00:00:21.240> at

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
Reds on the table and the white there at

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.269 
Reds on the table and the white there at
the<00:00:21.420> far<00:00:21.660> end<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.080> obviously<00:00:22.439> it's<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.830> long<00:00:23.010> pot

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
the far end so obviously it's a long pot

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.880 
the far end so obviously it's a long pot
now<00:00:24.000> I've<00:00:24.359> got<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.689> white<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.740> it's

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
now I've got the white so it's

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.250 
now I've got the white so it's
absolutely<00:00:26.460> dead<00:00:26.699> straight<00:00:27.119> on<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.930> first

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
absolutely dead straight on the first

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.279 
absolutely dead straight on the first
ready<00:00:28.500> now<00:00:29.510> until<00:00:30.510> you've<00:00:30.660> set<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:30.990> up<00:00:31.170> on

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
ready now until you've set this up on

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.569 
ready now until you've set this up on
the<00:00:31.410> practice<00:00:31.590> tip<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.980> won't<00:00:32.160> be<00:00:32.279> able<00:00:32.399> to

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
the practice tip you won't be able to

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.430 
the practice tip you won't be able to
tell<00:00:32.850> from<00:00:33.180> where<00:00:33.450> where<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> cue<00:00:34.260> ball

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
tell from where where the cue ball

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.400 
tell from where where the cue ball
actually<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:36.030> once<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:36.930> down<00:00:37.140> there

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
actually is but once you get down there

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.319 
actually is but once you get down there
you<00:00:37.649> will<00:00:37.890> notice<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.550> second<00:00:39.000> red<00:00:39.149> now

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
you will notice that the second red now

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.020 
you will notice that the second red now
becomes<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.780> three<00:00:39.989> quarter<00:00:40.410> pot<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
becomes a three quarter pot and the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.420 
becomes a three quarter pot and the
third<00:00:42.300> red<00:00:42.629> becomes<00:00:43.079> half<00:00:43.379> ball<00:00:43.649> pot<00:00:43.980> now

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
third red becomes half ball pot now

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.130 
third red becomes half ball pot now
obviously<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.239> could<00:00:45.420> stick<00:00:45.600> another<00:00:45.809> red<00:00:46.020> on

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
obviously we could stick another red on

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.740 
obviously we could stick another red on
so<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.530> portable<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:48.059> because<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> time

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
so it's portable but because of the time

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.930 
so it's portable but because of the time
restrictions<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.620> YouTube<00:00:50.039> I've<00:00:50.760> just

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
restrictions here on YouTube I've just

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.720 
restrictions here on YouTube I've just
put<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> three<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.140> didn't<00:00:52.730> get

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
put the three on just so we didn't get

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.850 
put the three on just so we didn't get
the<00:00:53.879> idea<00:00:54.239> about<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.050> practice<00:00:55.469> actually

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the idea about the the practice actually

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.450 
the idea about the the practice actually
goes<00:00:56.600> now<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:58.680> thing<00:00:58.949> which<00:00:59.129> you'll<00:00:59.309> know

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
goes now the one thing which you'll know

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.490 
goes now the one thing which you'll know
which<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.149> those<00:01:00.270> two<00:01:00.359> ever<00:01:00.480> I've<00:01:00.780> said<00:01:01.020> it's

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
which on those two ever I've said it's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.889 
which on those two ever I've said it's
four<00:01:01.770> ball<00:01:02.010> are<00:01:02.550> three<00:01:03.090> quarter<00:01:03.449> ball<00:01:03.600> half

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
four ball are three quarter ball half

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.200 
four ball are three quarter ball half
ball<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.409> portable<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.159> that's<00:01:05.640> basically

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
ball and portable and that's basically

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.000 
ball and portable and that's basically
all<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.630> angles<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.080> potting<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.619> Snoopy

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
all the angles of potting in Snoopy

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.130 
all the angles of potting in Snoopy
obviously<00:01:08.549> there<00:01:08.729> are<00:01:08.760> thin<00:01:09.060> cuts<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.600> very

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
obviously there are thin cuts in very

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.530 
obviously there are thin cuts in very
small<00:01:10.260> variations<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:11.760> those<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.240> main

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
small variations but those are the main

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.390 
small variations but those are the main
ones<00:01:12.570> you're<00:01:13.080> going<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.320> be<00:01:13.409> seen<00:01:13.680> when<00:01:14.280> you're

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
ones you're going to be seen when you're

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.789 
ones you're going to be seen when you're
actually<00:01:14.549> looking<00:01:14.909> at<00:01:15.180> long<00:01:15.360> pots<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:18.799> we

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
actually looking at long pots so we

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.200 
actually looking at long pots so we
lined<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.159> something<00:01:20.549> that's<00:01:20.700> straight<00:01:21.030> on

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
lined up something that's straight on

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.060 
lined up something that's straight on
the<00:01:21.330> previous<00:01:21.689> track<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.560> once<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.920> get

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the previous track and once you get

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:37.440 
the previous track and once you get
there

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.820 

now<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.510> other<00:01:38.750> thing<00:01:39.020> what<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:39.350> can<00:01:39.470> do<00:01:39.620> with

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
now the other thing what you can do with

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.790 
now the other thing what you can do with
this<00:01:39.920> practice<00:01:40.250> as<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:41.270> can<00:01:41.420> actually<00:01:41.800> use

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
this practice as you can actually use

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.920 
this practice as you can actually use
all<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.430> shots<00:01:43.700> required<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:44.540> you<00:01:44.600> play<00:01:44.900> a

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
all the shots required so you play a

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.810 
all the shots required so you play a
stun<00:01:45.350> shot<00:01:45.650> you<00:01:46.070> can<00:01:46.250> play<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.580> run-through

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
stun shot you can play the run-through

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.570 
stun shot you can play the run-through
shot<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:47.600> most<00:01:48.080> difficult<00:01:48.290> of<00:01:48.770> all<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:49.460> could

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
shot and most difficult of all you could

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.430 
shot and most difficult of all you could
play<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:50.000> screw<00:01:50.270> shot<00:01:50.570> so<00:01:51.020> what<00:01:51.230> I<00:01:51.260> recommend

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
play the screw shot so what I recommend

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.680 
play the screw shot so what I recommend
to<00:01:52.010> you<00:01:52.160> for<00:01:52.430> now<00:01:52.610> while<00:01:53.420> you're<00:01:53.660> still

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.630 
to you for now while you're still
getting<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.290> feel<00:01:54.680> for<00:01:54.710> this<00:01:55.100> type<00:01:55.370> of<00:01:55.400> shot

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
getting the feel for this type of shot

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.630 
getting the feel for this type of shot
is<00:01:56.030> just<00:01:56.330> it<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.990> run<00:01:57.230> through<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:57.770> stun<00:01:58.310> shots

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
is just it to run through and stun shots

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.550 
is just it to run through and stun shots
leave<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.180> screw<00:01:59.450> shot<00:01:59.780> until<00:02:00.290> you<00:02:00.410> actually

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
leave the screw shot until you actually

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.410 
leave the screw shot until you actually
get<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:00.920> feel<00:02:01.220> for<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.610> shot<00:02:01.820> you've<00:02:01.970> practiced
