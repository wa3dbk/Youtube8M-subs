this one feels just slightly more wobbly
not<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.360> I'd<00:01:39.509> worried<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.259> ever<00:01:40.439> really

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
not that I'd worried that it ever really

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.399 
not that I'd worried that it ever really
fall<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.329> doesn't<00:01:42.509> feel<00:01:42.810> quite<00:01:43.229> as

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
fall but it just doesn't feel quite as

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.370 
fall but it just doesn't feel quite as
in<00:01:44.100> place<00:01:44.340> or<00:01:44.549> quite<00:01:44.909> as<00:01:45.060> secured<00:01:45.450> even<00:01:46.290> though

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
in place or quite as secured even though

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.160 
in place or quite as secured even though
I<00:01:46.409> don't<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:46.829> think<00:01:46.950> I'll<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> problem

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
I don't really think I'll be a problem

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.840 
I don't really think I'll be a problem
but<00:01:49.170> yeah<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.649> guess<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.100> plus<00:01:50.280> years<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.670> comes

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
but yeah I guess so plus years it comes

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.249 
but yeah I guess so plus years it comes
in<00:01:50.970> all<00:01:51.060> different<00:01:51.090> colors<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:51.960> slightly

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259
