00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:09.990
 very good the painted dough that we usually 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:12.660
 steaming in a moment is easy 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.199
 but how are we doing stuffed 400 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.369
 cubic centimeters and water water 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.900
 start to put a little bit of flour 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.300
 a little bit is when of flour in total 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.859
 200 usually put a little bit until 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.859
 before I did it with mixed 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.530
 little by little until you put everything 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.430
 in what kind of flour like flour 40 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.430
 this is a mass 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.170
 of water and 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.850
 investigating a little bit if you have one 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.890
 time for those things and things 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.780
 while in the world we were fan 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.690
 more to different with more besides practice 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.240
 I can not do it in a jiffy 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.550
 we have titled it in its moment of fact 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.300
 if you search the web 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.470
 1 dot com appears as 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.760
 the grace of the world because I really 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.860
 in love with the world but my karina well 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.660
 you take off salt you saw for good as 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.630
 any label 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.880
 this is the crisis 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.079
 a pincelito said the pincelito with the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.030
 that has the camera a while ago that 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.340
 feel the TV 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.340
 but it was to show how easy 10 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.950
 while with the service there clear 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.200
 while from the lumps this bull to 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.270
 blender as for the ico everything is 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.340
 ready we have to make this mass 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.560
 rest half an hour at least 40 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.750
 minutes at least for the flour 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.149
 he goes through a colander that is what I'm going 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.100
 to do now to avoid any kind 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.200
 of haze 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.420
 finally it does not happen with the issue of 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.500
 blender the group but for the doubt by 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:05.750
 the beloved grace still as a journey with 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.750
 Marquitos like this already has a suitcase 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.620
 the sweet classics 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.670
 but why does not he explain the artifact 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.670
 who bought a kitchen appliance 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.390
 the most important thing is that the pan is 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.210
 fit the mouth of the pot in the uci 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.920
 because I put these repasadores with 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.510
 that does not fit perfect that what you 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.830
 It can happen to you or your house then 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.500
 you put a review bar is around 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.810
 and already generates in exact perfect crankcase 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.860
 why because this mass is heated 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.970
 for those who never saw it and 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.970
 we have the triplets of gold 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.070
 a Maria emilia at least before the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.070
 most people 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:05.739
 this dough is cooked without any kind of 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.069
 fat I'm telling you to notice 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.239
 please no fat 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.430
 directly above the pan and the 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.109
 pan is heated with steam or is 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.909
 that does not have that water does not have to 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.010
 touch the bell just a bit to 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.840
 generate steam and that thing is about 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.459
 as to make the value more efficient so that 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.739
 there is no loss of vapor layers that in your 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.840
 house you have a good Teflon pan and 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.930
 It fits right in a little pot of stories 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.290
 the perfect repasador then did the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.569
 very simple mixture water flour I leave it 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.609
 half an hour to rest it happened to 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.370
 through a ceda thing and it stays there 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:43.340
 like a painting like a painting 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.680
 is in another way we need to renew ourselves 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.150
 instead of making them round they can be 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.980
 quietly round we 're going it the 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.110
 little square from way it is not going 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:57.840
 brushing by layers and we go about 2 3 1 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.470
 2 3 and we go all 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.600
 2. 3 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:09.670
 1 2 3 let's say with the last wave 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:16.290
 is one last more 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.290
 with the girl he shouted well one two three 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.130
 well what we do now is that we passed 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.440
 four or five times in total 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.200
 and it is that this is cooking I do not know 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.390
 no non-stick grease 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.670
 it is getting whiter and in this 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.020
 moment in the brief moment does not come 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.020
 the notion of the other side 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:47.249
 the summer comes and goes down with this 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.499
 protector protective institution 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:52.099
 that it is fabulous the view took off 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:52.099
 from miranda 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:00.550
 but fat is not nothing either 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.550
 more than flour and water 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.270
 fruit 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:14.790
 let's go back to the quality fill that 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:18.890
 it is very important 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:21.090
 10 thanks to the million dollar question 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.680
 first you put it there on the counter 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.930
 I reassure that it gets cold after 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.320
 it cooled you can calmly this 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:39.720
 stack what it is to have security 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:41.430
 infinite of the same 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.380
 eye if you're going to use it because it 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.780
 can use there if you put classics 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.760
 rather well sealed 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:52.130
 Of course I love 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:57.190
 with the present has been in brackely thousand 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.190
 possibilities for this this spring 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:05.800
 I tell myself everything but I have a great 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.800
 entry that will not happen to my daughter 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:14.640
 investigated all and not content 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:18.240
 in Japanese they are called haruna and they 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:21.529
 develops from spring 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.549
 more they put me like this and this I 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.549
 if it is not first 

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:33.369
 talking about spring 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.210

 I want to recontra cook what has 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.930
 value 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:53.669
 a little bit of that carrot now 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:57.209
 I start to change carrot color if 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:59.210
 we are not going to cut the morrón 

00:06:57.209 --> 00:07:01.790
 cytological 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.800
 olive onion 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.570
 how rich is the kingdom is the 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.980
 and filling but look what I carboy 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.980
 that was a couple of turns 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.740
 that lacks this a little more flavor 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:27.800
 everything inside and we're also going to put 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.539
 I have seven green or green onions 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:35.049
 and at the same time 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:37.419
 a pinch of salt here you have that 

00:07:35.049 --> 00:07:39.369
 I leave grace perform of this greater 

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:42.159
 absolutely little surface of 

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:44.469
 little bit not much that this is how it is 

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:46.479
 it's not going to be normal the meat started to 

00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:50.009
 take to change color but it's going to 

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:53.610
 finish cooking in man 

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:56.460
 Lightweight and fast ingredients
