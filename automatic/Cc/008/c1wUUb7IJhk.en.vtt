00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello very good everyone good today 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.000
 I bring several news from grand theft 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.919
 car 5 when we started so 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 important you already know that several users 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.780
 they have had problems with grand theft 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.120
 auto 5 on the xbox 360 when installed 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.520
 well I already gave the solution of a video 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.439
 in room a little bit of it but good 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.170
 today I'm going to talk about another topic and you know 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.330
 that apart from this failure there is more or 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.500
 have taken some people who take the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.140
 game or to elevate slowed down in which 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.059
 it charges the game little or the map takes 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.520
 a lot in loading have also suffered 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.050
 many problems with loss of cars or 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.540
 you tell us a car and then we 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.360
 appears or you leave it in the garage and then 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.610
 it is gone and you have spent a 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.430
 big bucks in a car then I improved it 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.920
 and everything and then equally disappear 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.510
 Well this problem is supposed to be 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.300
 that we keep the vehicle with a 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.280
 character and then we use it with another and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.699
 then that is the fault is what it gives 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.800
 the failure but good to avoid it 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.019
 for those who have been affected by this 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.930
 topic you have a solution a solution 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.610
 provisional 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.590
 I will inform you when they fix this 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.299
 I do not think it takes a long time 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.210
 Well, I suppose when the patch comes up 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.820
 and this will not happen anymore 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.530
 let's hope and good basically what 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.780
 You can do so for now 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.780
 we pass this is to avoid parking the car 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.590
 in the garage driving garage cars 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.960
 or driving good or a vehicle that is 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.049
 improved with another character not using it 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.810
 with another, that is if you improve with a 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.179
 character the car do not abuse with the other 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.630
 neither the best with the other nor anything and 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:46.550
 Well, I will inform you when it is corrected 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.650
 the problem and well then another issue 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.260
 is that some players have been 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.900
 investigating the internal code of the game 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.720
 and they have discovered interesting things 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.190
 but well I'm telling you, you know, it's not 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.380
 reliable are rumors 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.660
 rockstar has not confirmed anything they are 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.030
 codes that is only a code and 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.290
 it's a rumor so good to be up 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:12.350
 that roast does not sign anything forget 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.390
 Forget about this but hopefully good is that 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.880
 in this because the truth is that they are 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.950
 important details and pretty enough 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.750
 interesting good on the one hand the 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.140
 code mentions a version of grand 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.870
 theft auto 5 for pc and playstation 4 or 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.540
 be for pc already have said a lot of 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.340
 times and surely it is that they take them out 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.530
 they have also put in several stores 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.160
 today they have been added in two more 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.740
 in two more stores and well you know 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.319
 it always takes about six months to put 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.209
 grand theft auto on the computer and I 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.000
 I think it's going to go out for pc the 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.709
 problem is for play 4 even the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.810
 second the code yes that is planned 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.430
 for play 4 but ross back has always 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.830
 said that they do not have planned to 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.870
 people a version for the future 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.120
 generation of consoles but good the 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.840
 code says the opposite but it's a 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.280
 rumor I wish I had in mind a 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.440
 version for the new generation of 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.850
 consoles and do not bring it to the new 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.310
 generation of consoles but good and 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.010
 You know how this is going that maybe not 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.930
 they affirm it within so many months or 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.730
 better they take it out of next year never 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.240
 you know but maybe we do not have it 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.000
 but good at the moment nothing confirmed already 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.130
 to see if it is confirmed later and 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.500
 well on the other hand you already know that 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.440
 they made the multiplayer was going to have 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.100
 a maximum of 16 people as the code 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.190
 indicates that it would be 32 players you want is 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.440
 32 players that would be a bit flippant 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.310
 I do not know I would like very much there are 32 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.850
 players 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.620
 the more people the better the more the day 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.390
 more drives and play but good 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.020
 moment we know that the maximum of 10 bits 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.480
 16 people and motivated by 2 tap but 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.780
 good the code in mention to 32 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.950
 players that at once on Tuesday day 1 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.080
 October that a lot of people have 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.330
 asked is the grand theft auto hike ' 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.220
 online and we will be able to check how many 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.400
 players are going to always and also 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.319
 we have some possible ways 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.769
 which we also had in grand 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.290
 theft auto 4 and well now they're going to 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.579
 back to grand theft auto 5 good or 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.740
 they could come back it does not skip a bit if it's 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.199
 if it is viable or not and we could 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.810
 have team flight races 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.280
 special and remarkable or police and 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.539
 thieves 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.940
 well you already know how it is 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.940
 online auto enablers will have more than 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.830
 500 missions possible one possible 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.520
 mission would be to kill a player the 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.139
 heading the good have filtered this but 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.600
 a mission will kill me a little bit is from the 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.520
 departure seems a bit different but 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.930
 good are 500 five hundred missions 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.240
 missions that can surprise us 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.639
 all already know what prepares us 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.430
 rockstar thus trying waiting with 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.500
 craving on Tuesday and then also leaving 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.870
 and the issue apart from the codes the 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.440
 failures and this I inform you that the 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.910
 application and fluid for the game in a 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.889
 little time will have to be available 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.229
 for android you know that for now 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.120
 has put for the iphones but hey 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.700
 for android is not available yet 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.490
 but you have to go out and right away without what 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.370
 when they put it pando and still without forming 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.720
 I look at it every day to see if there is 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.090
 they put but good for now there's no 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.430
 Equally nothing, I hope you have the 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.040
 information I thank cristian for 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.930
 make this gameplay a greeting to all and 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.260
 see you next video until the 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.260
 next
