00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.969 

then<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.030> got<00:01:27.240> two<00:01:27.510> circles<00:01:30.620> you<00:01:31.620> know<00:01:31.740> what

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
then we got two circles you know what

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.969 
then we got two circles you know what
you're<00:01:32.159> right<00:01:32.870> there<00:01:33.870> art<00:01:34.140> they're<00:01:34.470> triangles

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
you're right there art they're triangles

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
or feet - of and then another triangle

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:31.039 
or feet - of and then another triangle
so<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:24.540> far<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:25.680> got<00:02:26.180> one<00:02:27.230> two<00:02:28.230> three<00:02:30.049> circle

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049
