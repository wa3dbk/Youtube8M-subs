super<00:05:53.970> cool<00:05:54.360> idea<00:05:54.750> because<00:05:55.140> the<00:05:55.440> jewelry

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
super cool idea because the jewelry

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.980 
super cool idea because the jewelry
trends<00:05:56.130> are<00:05:56.220> always<00:05:56.670> changing<00:05:57.270> and<00:05:57.690> if

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
trends are always changing and if

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.680 
trends are always changing and if
jewelry<00:05:58.410> can<00:05:58.560> be<00:05:58.680> expensive<00:05:59.040> so<00:05:59.400> why<00:06:00.120> not<00:06:00.360> just

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
jewelry can be expensive so why not just

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.690 
jewelry can be expensive so why not just
you<00:06:01.020> know<00:06:01.140> try<00:06:01.530> these<00:06:01.590> out<00:06:01.920> if<00:06:02.100> you<00:06:02.190> love<00:06:02.460> one
