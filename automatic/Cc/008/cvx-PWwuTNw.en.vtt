00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
Bill of the crank bait the line comes

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.849 
Bill of the crank bait the line comes
out<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.570> tied<00:00:21.840> directly<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.529> treble

out and you tied directly to the treble

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.189 
out and you tied directly to the treble
hooks<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.000> good<00:00:24.180> for<00:00:24.210> two<00:00:24.510> reasons<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
hooks this is good for two reasons the

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.529 
hooks this is good for two reasons the
first<00:00:25.350> whenever<00:00:26.279> fish<00:00:26.670> comes<00:00:26.970> up<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.330> eats

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
first whenever fish comes up and eats

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.990 
first whenever fish comes up and eats
it's<00:00:28.529> going<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.800> get<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.039> hooks<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.820> hooks

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
it's going to get the hooks the hooks

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.510 
it's going to get the hooks the hooks
will<00:00:30.179> eject<00:00:30.599> from<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.990> crank<00:00:31.199> bait<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
will eject from the crank bait and the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.950 
will eject from the crank bait and the
crank<00:00:32.759> bait<00:00:32.880> will<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.210> slide<00:00:33.420> up<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> line

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
crank bait will just slide up the line

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.709 
crank bait will just slide up the line
so<00:00:34.559> when<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> fish<00:00:35.100> comes<00:00:35.309> up<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.579> jumps<00:00:36.059> it's

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
so when the fish comes up in jumps it's

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.119 
so when the fish comes up in jumps it's
not<00:00:36.899> going<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.320> leverage<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.890> sling

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
not going to have the leverage to sling

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.190 
not going to have the leverage to sling
the<00:00:38.250> bait<00:00:38.719> secondly<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:39.899> you're<00:00:40.050> out<00:00:40.170> there

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
the bait secondly if you're out there

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.990 
the bait secondly if you're out there
deep<00:00:40.559> cranking<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.399> get<00:00:41.550> hung<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.969> a

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
deep cranking and you get hung on a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.299 
deep cranking and you get hung on a
brush<00:00:42.210> pile<00:00:42.480> can't<00:00:43.469> get<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.710> out<00:00:43.829> are<00:00:44.190> you

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
brush pile can't get it out are you

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.860 
brush pile can't get it out are you
