00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.030
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.940
 new follow my ship tv from turku in 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.950
 finland from the stx shipyard behind us 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.660
 See the ship 3 around you 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.160
 It's not about theirs today 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.380
 sister my ship 4 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.390
 which is also being built here in tokyo and 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.160
 Today is a very special day 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.810
 the fourth ship of tui cruises will be 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.609
 keel laid and that is for us 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.300
 Give them my ship once 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.300
 to introduce more precisely 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.660
 I am now in the dock and behind me 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.560
 finds the keel laying of mine right away 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.390
 ship 4 instead 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.520
 experienced my ship tv spectator 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.470
 already know the keel laying is 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.270
 An old shipbuilding tradition and standing 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.130
 for the start of the assembly of the ship 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.020
 So something like that 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.670
 Laying of the foundation stone in the construction of a house 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.290
 To this day , as a lucky charm 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.270
 coins on the pairings of the first 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.690
 section and so synonymous with mine 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.690
 ship 4 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.090
 some 4 are laid keel and with me 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.730
 is now peter heidecker head of the 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.140
 new construction teams of tui cruises poster with 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.940
 Keel laying is an important one 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.230
 Milestone managed how it looks 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.390
 in total with the construction progress of the 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.300
 my ship 4 out today we have the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.920
 Keeling the four of my ship celebrated 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.780
 and the total production was mine 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.060
 ship is currently at about 30 percent 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.290
 if we just look at the steel 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.030
 which we already see in the background 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.740
 we are already at almost 60 percent 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.030
 then I would say we show them 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.050
 now like my ship four 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.050
 will look later 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.220
 in the background you can see a part of 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.540
 future my ship 4 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.760
 Mr. haider you can already us 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.860
 reveal what that will be later that 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.130
 Part of the 77 large steel plate the 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.110
 we manufacture at the yard and this will 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.280
 specifically covers three four and five so 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.870
 a public area on the my 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.180
 ship will be much and they have just 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.920
 It said a few differences 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.760
 my ship 3 is something new 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.069
 will be that 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.630
 For example, we have the sports area 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.330
 enlarged then we have the 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.090
 outdoor area at surfers surfstick house 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.180
 enlarged and the smoker's and the 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.410
 casino put together to a room what 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.640
 will be the highlight in your opinion 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.470
 my ship will be four 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.000
 Of course, there are many highlights 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.440
 my ship is here next to the plane 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.480
 I would mention these areas anyway 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.310
 call the pooldeck again with ours 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.620
 25 meters pool and of course ours 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.130
 eyecatcher the diamond in the back 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.110
 of the ship 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.700
 and how does it continue after the 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.530
 keel laying what happens next 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.239
 We will be starting lots of start blocks now 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.130
 with the big crane in the dry dock 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.330
 lift and then with the 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.130
 Welding all steel parts 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.780
 connect with each other and thus the 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.430
 hull training my ship here 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.769
 thank you mister haider for your strength 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.600

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.130
 heard it stays exciting and we stop 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.690
 Of course, they continue to talk about that 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.410
 construction progress of my ship on her 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.120

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.530
