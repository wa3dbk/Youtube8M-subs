00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.509
 I have interesting again 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.980
 information for everyone 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.529
 console owners do not care if you 're on 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.470
 playstation 3 playstation 4 xbox 360 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.320
 or xbox one plays I had it 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.150
 Yesterday yeah never clicked lexmark had 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.310
 the exact release date for the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.590
 bank robberies and the christmas dlc 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.050
 found out and wanted to still in the evening 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.360
 more detailed information about the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.920
 issue single features and that 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.420
 he has done and this information 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.870
 I want to work for you now 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.790
 take 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.290
 Here we have his course at the beginning 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.969
 he writes that we are now variable 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.920
 that is, at the beginning of a snow have 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.840
 For example, days can be less 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.910
 snowing at a different time 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.530
 only at the beginning of the day can also 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.600
 less snow stay on the ground and 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.489
 in the course of the day, the snow gets up 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.719
 the ground is getting more and more slippery 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.399
 you can quickly get off with the vehicles 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.230
 just right through the area can 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.359
 I imagine well and so too 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.189
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, we got it quite realistically 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.020
 this feature only the playstation 4 and 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.200
 the xbox one player later 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.970
 get playstation 3 and the xbox 360 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.580
 the normal snowfall you 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.869
 last year already had 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.970
 There are also new ones for all eight 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.310
 garments in the christmas game next to 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.869
 Shanti has jacket should go with it 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.369
 But I'm curious if 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.110
 the things of the things we do 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.360
 have gotten strong last year 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.729
 In addition, there are differences 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.350
 a limited christian appartement 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.479
 or a limited christmas 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.130
 Apartment Interior This 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.040
 Unfortunately, feature is only available again 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.140
 for nextgen players another new 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.610
 feature are head cluck missions 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.740
 but I have ever in one 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.049
 Video addressed and the welcome 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.939
 again all and last but not least 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.979
 there is a new effect in the sky 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.079
 or a new color though 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.930
 again that only for playstation 4 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.770
 and xbox one players hear the features 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.659
 in any case pretty 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.460
 promising and if all so 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.439
 runs as it should to run you come 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.420
 at the same time the bank robberies 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.890
 nevertheless I find it quite handicapped 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.009
 governed by rockstar that they are so 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.660
 very much on xbox and playstation 4 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.370
 For example , I think 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.360
 the appartement would also be on 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.310
 the playstation 3 and xbox 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.440
 80 we got there only that 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.690
 There we had a lot of new ones 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.610
 apartments and updates 1 more or 1 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.200
 I do not think less 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.240
 big difference but that's what you want 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.760
 of course, more money on that in the 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.140
 more people the xbox or playstation 4 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.730
 buy version of the game 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.080
 that 's it then from this video has it 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.040
 you like for example like-button 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.040
 corner rausholt 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.090
 kg 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.340
