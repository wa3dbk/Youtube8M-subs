00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.440
 with film and television and then focused on video and editing, I also work there 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.180
 also with an after effects I think it is important to get more students involved 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.740
 than just technology is audiovisual shaping animation 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.800
 namely a lot of creativity 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.320
 and content 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.850
 telling stories by sharing the same passion is 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 diminished defective rule between student and teacher 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.800
 and that through is a safe environment 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.110
 with a common goal 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.110
 pay attention to help towards professional practice 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.489
 my name is haas groothuizen 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.580
 I give up the graphic lyceum 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.839
 animation people 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.359
 for me the relationship is that anything is possible 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.720
 I just stay whole because of everything 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.480
 people walking around fascinated 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.800
 hvn animation and if i have the most important it is not good at it 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.730
 the fleet of your own power everyone can do something else I am convinced 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.560
 that everyone I really really can't 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.240
 what you have already done on that is of course very safe feeling but also give it a try 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.240
 looking at something else is what you had 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.000
 I quite a gardener I teach is celebrated this concept the project 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.620
 classes 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.530
 what i like about all the lessons of the anwb is that they are not for subject-oriented 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.900
 only too specialized but also a bit wider so that the student of us anyway 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.470
 does not have this to continue studying 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.470
 but also to be able to pick up other things in his work 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.080
 I really like how they like it 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.950
 the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.490
 the 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.889
 not 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.509
 I chose the sound system because it is very much to well-written 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:15.529
 I came to this school because my neck to neck 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:23.579

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.470
 an exception animation and so on again 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.659
 Possible if your options are recent, are very friendly 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.579
 owners of the central bank will do ecb 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.049
 a man's car 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.049
 it just got really good 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.939
