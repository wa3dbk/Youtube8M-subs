00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
why it's not sandblasted the customer

sandblasted<00:01:56.799> all<00:01:56.979> this<00:01:57.189> rust<00:01:57.520> could<00:01:57.789> have

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
sandblasted all this rust could have

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.020 
sandblasted all this rust could have
been<00:01:58.000> sandblasted<00:01:58.479> up<00:01:58.930> all<00:01:59.170> that<00:01:59.380> in<00:01:59.530> there

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
been sandblasted up all that in there

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.670 
been sandblasted up all that in there
and<00:02:01.030> then<00:02:01.299> a<00:02:01.390> primer<00:02:01.659> put<00:02:01.990> on<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.409> it<00:02:02.530> could

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
and then a primer put on it and it could

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.380 
and then a primer put on it and it could
have<00:02:02.770> been<00:02:02.890> all<00:02:03.219> like<00:02:03.399> brand-new<00:02:03.880> because

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
have been all like brand-new because

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.330 
have been all like brand-new because
this<00:02:04.539> thing's<00:02:04.780> solid<00:02:05.259> now<00:02:05.409> I<00:02:05.680> mean<00:02:06.219> this

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
this thing's solid now I mean this

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.990 
this thing's solid now I mean this
thing's<00:02:07.799> right<00:02:08.799> down<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.220> mounts<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:09.850> mean

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
thing's right down to the mounts I mean

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.750 
thing's right down to the mounts I mean
you<00:02:10.090> have<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:11.500> have<00:02:11.680> new<00:02:11.859> body<00:02:12.130> mounts<00:02:12.609> in

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
you have you have new body mounts in

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.039 
you have you have new body mounts in
there<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.000> mean<00:02:13.359> this<00:02:13.480> thing<00:02:13.720> could<00:02:13.930> have<00:02:14.019> been

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
there I mean this thing could have been

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.599 
there I mean this thing could have been
sandblasted<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.920> really<00:02:15.190> looked<00:02:15.400> nice<00:02:15.640> but

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
sandblasted and really looked nice but

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:25.220 
sandblasted and really looked nice but
you<00:02:18.609> got<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.880> do<00:02:19.030> what<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.019> customer<00:02:20.440> wants<00:02:20.799> so

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.209 

that's<00:02:25.830> what<00:02:26.010> we<00:02:26.130> have<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:27.180> far
