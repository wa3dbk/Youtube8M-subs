00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:13.120
 good the subject that we are going to see today are 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.760
 the roller coasters and I'll tell you 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.720
 how they work and I'll explain 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.179
 several subjects of physics to the tenth grade 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.730
 that are reflected in how the 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.830
 roller coasters use only one engine in 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.839
 the beginning of his journey to be able 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.689
 reach the height indicated for 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:35.540
 then start the adventure that is not to say 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.510
 uses no mechanical mechanism to 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.950
 help complete the trajectory this 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.750
 it's because the principle of 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.640
 operation of roller coasters 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.120
 based on the law of conservation of 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.190
 energy in this case said energies the 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.950
 Kinetic energy in potential energy 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.110
 the kinetic energy is that which is 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.240
 present in every movement is the 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.550
 movement energy while greater 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.190
 be this is to say the greater the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.000
 Higher speed will be kinetic energy 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.450
 that this body has, on the other hand, the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.740
 Potential energy refers to the energy 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.150
 positioning in this case it 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.880
 will use the potential energy 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.220
 and as it says its name refers the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.010
 energy around your position in 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.020
 good gravity relation I'm going to 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.320
 talk about the newton lists that you 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.700
 come reflected in the roller coaster I'm going to 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.250
 talk about the first law of grandchildren 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.500
 that the law of motion that says that 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.370
 an object at rest will remain in 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.640
 rest until a balanced force 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.860
 be applied to the resistance that 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.070
 the object presents to change its 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.220
 state of movement is known as 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.740
 inertia the inertia of the object depends 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.439
 in its mass 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.540
 in a roller coaster all are manifested 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.149
 Newton's laws in the first law 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.030
 the objects in this case the passengers 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.310
 with the safety seats will keep 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.460
 its course in a straight line at a speed 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.890
 constant until a force the 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.440
 stop when the roller coaster is 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.560
 found on a low or a turn 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.220
 steep the seats provide that strength 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.480
 from here released 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.200
 pushing the bodies from the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.390
 passengers passengers will feel 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.820
 momentarily heavier this strength 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.820
 it's called positive g force 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.870
 the second law of newton says that a 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.530
 strength does not balance applied 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.490
 an object is proportional to the mass and the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.000
 acceleration of it 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.000
 He says 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.190
 it is equal to more 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.810
 the acceleration of a produced object 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.360
 by a force is directly 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.530
 proportional to the magnitude of the force 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:09.140
 in the same direction as the force 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.140
 and proportional to the mass of the object 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.420
 gravitational energy is what it does 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.910
 that the roller coasters in the 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.970
 exciting when the car goes up the 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.320
 first hill of the mountain 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.720
 the gravitational energy as it increases and 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.720
 when I had the car in the back 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.960
 hills begin 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.930
 to go down 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.530
 the force the gravitational force what 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.060
 It is that the car accelerates the majority 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.000
 gravitational carriage on the mountain 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.410
 it becomes kinetic energy when 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.510
 it leaves behind the first hill and 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.090
 the mountain when the car goes up 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.970
 second hill its kinetic energy is 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.970
 converted back into energy 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.030
 and gravitational 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.180
 Newton's third law says that for every 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.400
 action there is a reaction of an equal 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.519
 magnitude and direction but in sense 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.440
 otherwise this means that in each 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.199
 interaction there are a couple of forces 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.600
 acting the two objects that interact 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.880
 each other in the second and the third 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.789
 newton's law in the descents of the 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.490
 roller coasters the force g that doubles 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.460
 what makes us feel that we think 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.030
 more if it were not for the extensive study of 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.759
 the forces that are so exact everything 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.430
 could end in a catastrophe for a 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.680
 millisecond error in the mountains 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.759
 Russian forces are also manifested 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.979
 Negative g when a part approaches 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:53.610
 high of the roller coaster there are lower 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:56.639
 pressure between the body and the seat the 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.080
 brain interprets this as loss of 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.419
 weight 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.370
 movement circular movement 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.680
 circular is present the mountains 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.680
 Russians in their gears and in 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.000
 acrobatics they perform to study a 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.789
 movement like this is necessary 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.370
 define the velocity vector must be 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.110
 know its module or magnitude the 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.000
 direction of the velocity vector which is the 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.889
 straight tangent to the trajectory in the 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.949
 point that the particle occupies in the 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.700
 instant considered and its meaning is the 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.950
 move the particle in that instant 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.230
 the sense of direction and vector 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.300
 speed change constantly since 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.600
 they vary the direction and sense of 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.030
 tangent to the curve a body will move 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.070
 according to a curve path always and 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.660
 when the acceleration existing in the 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.820
 body has a component 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.400
 perpendicular to the direction of 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.560
 movement 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.570
 this acceleration perpendicular to the 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.690
 speed is called acceleration 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.419
 centripetal and is always directed towards 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.470
 the center of the trajectory is 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:00.930
 acceleration also 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.930
 usually called acceleration 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.270
 radial or normal acceleration because it has 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.780
 the radius direction of the curvature 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.670
 of the trajectory at the given point and 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.190
 point towards the center of the curves 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.960
 now I'm going to talk about the energy of 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.420
 the roller coasters the two most 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.420
 important in relation 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:26.970
 roller coaster its potential energy and the 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:28.560
 kinetic energy the potential energy is 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.100
 the energy that a body has 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.440
 depending on its height with respect to 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.750
 ground 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.180
 in the car of a roller coaster is 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.520
 initially dragged by an engine and 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.460
 a chain system on top of the 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.390
 first fall receiving for it a 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.510
 large amount of potential energy 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:53.390
 kinetic guide is the energy that possesses a 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.760
 object according to its movement to 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.280
 perform a job under its mass 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.080
 and at its speed all the objects that are 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.020
 move they have a large amount 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.850
 determined kinetic energy the amount 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.640
 of such energy depends so much on the 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.500
 mass as the speed of the object a 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.530
 Russian roller car has a lot of energy 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.020
 kinetic the one that has one since it has 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.880
 much mass and moves very fast in 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.270
 general the kinetic energy of a 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:23.120
 passenger reaches its maximum value in the 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.250
 lowest height of the travel in a 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.140
 roller coaster the potential energy is 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:30.260
 quickly transformed into energy 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:32.780
 kinetics at the time of the fall and the 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:37.300
 inverse in the next moment when 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.300
 reaches again the next hill
