00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:30.230
 and then staff so the thalamus there with 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.989
 The third video of the right mini-session is 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.850
 because I have become anp and other videos 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.580
 are the inscription for who wants to see 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.680
 Okay, I'm talking about the drama of 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.890
 story and the drama is really think it is 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.040
 the big reason the fans' oxy is to lean 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.720
 in studio and right then let's go 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.900
 in the last video I said that the other 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.690
 explains everything and does not just stick to aa 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.370
 talk about what such professionals are 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.829
 subject but he has a model that 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.870
 able to work both the largest 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.950
 both the story of a guy and 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.309
 general plot 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.350
 sure and that's what makes it so 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.910
 bright is not simply to put it 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.890
 It's history for you. 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.960
 It's like we're reading a 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.960
 history book right then who knows 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.030
 the events of mankind but not 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.759
 We also know that pm does not know 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.080
 people felt there at the time at least 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.630
 so what we learn in the 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.340
 school, I wanted to say right now to 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.740
 on a track and personal 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.080
 the year he will explain the stories of 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.690
 a different way when it does not 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.300
 there only history does not make someone with 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.600
 such a story does not it really goes to 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.580
 the past it counts in the skin of someone 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.740
 so always in the past has the character 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.360
 is it going to happen something with 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.369
 he's just gonna know the 100's. 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.619
 together that character is for that 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.560
 I told you in the last video that many 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.759
 characters that are not even like this 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.369
 are secondary 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.750
 they are very important that many 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.300
 people end up liking these 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.800
 characters exactly because the other in the 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.200
 time to tell the past of these 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.740
 characters to tell the story at last 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.200
 if passed and rocco quiet clover say 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.789
 this drama looking place is not a 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.709
 drama with a ney show 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.819
 That's why I say it again. 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.580
 fans do not say that what is much more than 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.300
 send it we fall again there 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.239
 tron very positive point in different 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.940
 sure it's just the employee plot 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.730
 of the maid is very similar to what 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.590
 You're very much like the shows. 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.980
 do even until some eminent 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.420
 phase without the drama or else Sehnem 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.640
 the action of the cinema 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.379
 The plot of the without without even 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.299
 adult stories they obviously 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.470
 better worked because they have 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.470
 much longer 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.030
 finally, it does not have as much pressure as 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.680
 show or get bigger or have this 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.120
 competence is taking some small 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.310
 details of other styles of banking and 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.190
 mail he can do a show neither 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.390
 weekly afternoon anp personal ie 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.920
 pressure to the limit but even so in the 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.709
 general and manages to make a story 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.750
 that you understand that you make a 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.720
 story that has the drama that has 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.910
 really reformed me you got there 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.980
 characters important characters 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.780
 charismatic and all this because he 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.750
 can put on a convincing drama 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.140
 does not remember which one he has friends now 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.120
 not personal because it is very well made 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.090
 very well done and will say that the 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.380
 The story of the two is who's going to say 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.849
 that the story of xenon is serious is 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.130
 bright what he does a 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.260
 His story on show does not have this. 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.169
 I do not know, I read too much, I cried more. 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.180
 really does not have pocket ambitions 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.099
 many together I 'm meaning 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.049
 that the episode is differentiated because it 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.480
 follows a few different rules 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.150
 neither is the show's personal rules nor 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.609
 Weekly actually the thing is very 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.680
 for entertainment you actually do not 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:03.169
 will read a weekly story looking for 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.799
 a deep story sometimes even 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:10.280
 It happens right but it is not not so common 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:12.799
 so on the most hasty night not so 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.329
 explained but it's a good story then 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.789
 as you usually tell a story 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.400
 best work is a show neither 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.440
 fortnightly or is it a monthly show 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.270
 understood how it was the case of smoking 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.740
 put up as is the case of some 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:30.380
 optional today as the smaller as the ex 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.599
 sprinter but neither does it depend on person 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.820
 started pretending that you will not like it 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:36.680
 It was bigger for example but you might like 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.289
 an end in itself monal i mean 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.539
 is that it does not have so much pressure and when 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.760
 show nor is it a little better worked and 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.150
 a bit more detailed 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:49.210
 he tries to work and some others 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.940
 characteristics as in the example a 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:56.070
 revenge of a character is hatred of 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.630
 someone then is a little thing but more 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.880
 stronger money 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.650
 in the case he should also follow a 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.060
 most reasonable rule so one thing 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.160
 very fun 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.100
 something that is more hurried than not 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.110
 have so much work of the 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.130
 plot characters 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:18.190
 only that it has characteristics like this with 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:21.310
 ney has there is entertainment comedy 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:24.760
 even when it's time to explain to 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:29.340
 you some moral teachings 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:32.370
 is to educate in a certain way 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.010
 different is not normal 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.090
 I understood that everyone this all this 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:43.530
 happens because the other one can 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:46.000
 convince cry the history of nami 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:50.710
 story of any other character 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:59.110
 who is stealing the crying boy who in 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:06:03.280
 The time I left I cried with the sky 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:06.550
 that arrived with which I told people 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.950
 so fuck it is very good that you 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.890
 approximate the characters who cm are 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:14.620
 so important do you understand this and 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.770
 about him he really does everything 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.990
 cool character still does not forget the 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.010
 characters that all of them have a load 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.730
 dramatic 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:27.370
 This is fucking forrÃ³ so this video 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:30.280
 Missing people talking together, mangas there. 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.950
 they bring is this drama and tals because 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.210
 so is the year and if they do not walk well 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.250
 different even 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.160
 It's me, at least I'm used to reading. 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:42.580
 many manga is rare even to have this 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.020
 drama teams have is usually a drama 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.830
 what happens is a daily drama 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:51.840
 understood doubts of a person at 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.840
 It's a drama like telling the past. 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.400
 put the historical part is not a 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.830
 thing so very closed to the 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.990
 character even playing is a drama 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.219
 very nice but this is a drama the 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.960
 guardian pis 

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:05.569
 so I 'm not going to tell you to send any 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.000
 This time and stay the next time I'll still do. 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:10.550
 another specific video're more drama 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.770
 then it 's the ump if he picks the 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.889
 characteristic of other styles 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.650
 as if I do not even cry, but it has 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:22.789
 yes some characteristics and causes 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:25.879
 this is weeping or weekly and is 

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:27.919
 It certainly ends in this way. 

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:28.759
 It was for you people, you see yourself in the next 

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:31.099
