00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello to all guys and well found by 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.940
 francesco siciliani for iphoneitalia.com 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.010
 in this section we will analyze 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.110
 in very short videos 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.599
 some functions and features of ios 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.490
 in order to help all users 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.059
 first weapons to use your own best 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.070
 iphone 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.810
 so I anticipate you already that we will treat 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.359
 simple topics and basic functions 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.710
 so many of you will already know 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.210
 but not only will it also happen to us 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.410
 see some useful tricks for 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.109
 make the most of the apple iphone 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.250
 that maybe not everyone will know goes 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.250
 well we can start 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:48.030
 in this episode let's see how 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.040
 block the removal of apps on ios 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.170
 if we hold down an application 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.360
 the classic hicks for will appear 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.460
 remove it from the iphone unless you 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.950
 it is a system application but 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.970
 if we go into general restrictions e 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.510
 we are going to block the deleting entry 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.250
 up 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.229
 obviously we will have to create a code for 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.510
 the restrictions if we don't have it before 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.220
 when we're going to do the operation 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.140
 for deleting an app not 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.899
 the aics will appear so we won't be able to 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.490
 go and remove no application 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.280
 back on restrictions we can always 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.590
 decide to rehabilitate it as we could 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.690
 decide to disable and re-enable 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.940
 installing apps from the app store 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.450
 then block any installations 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.090
 of future apps is the purchase of content 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.399
 in the app then of and certain packages 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.080
 optional applications that maybe 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.789
 we don't want to buy that we could 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.399
 risk buying too 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.560
