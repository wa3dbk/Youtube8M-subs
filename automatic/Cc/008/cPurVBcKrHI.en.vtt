00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.630 
shot you can see that the pressure
fluctuation<00:02:09.200> creates<00:02:10.039> a<00:02:10.130> very<00:02:10.340> noticeable

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
fluctuation creates a very noticeable

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.150 
fluctuation creates a very noticeable
change<00:02:11.120> in<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.420> ejection<00:02:11.750> quantity<00:02:12.350> as<00:02:12.560> the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
change in the ejection quantity as the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.110 
change in the ejection quantity as the
pump<00:02:13.430> pulses<00:02:14.060> on<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.450> off<00:02:15.580> this<00:02:16.580> pulsing

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
pump pulses on and off this pulsing

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.660 
pump pulses on and off this pulsing
means<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:18.019> atomization<00:02:18.350> quality<00:02:19.160> is<00:02:19.280> always

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
means the atomization quality is always

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.580 
means the atomization quality is always
changing<00:02:20.180> as<00:02:20.330> well<00:02:20.630> as<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.900> injection<00:02:21.350> flow

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
changing as well as the injection flow

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.350 
changing as well as the injection flow
rate<00:02:21.830> which<00:02:22.430> leads<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.760> inconsistent

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
rate which leads to inconsistent

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.690 
rate which leads to inconsistent
performance<00:02:23.920> now<00:02:24.920> let's<00:02:25.160> check<00:02:25.310> out<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.580> new

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
in this next shot you can see how much

here is the internally bypass AEM pump

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.000 
here is the internally bypass AEM pump
notice<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.350> absence<00:03:11.500> which<00:03:11.920> assembly<00:03:12.340> and

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
notice the absence which assembly and

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.680 
notice the absence which assembly and
here<00:03:15.010> is<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.280> old-style<00:03:15.580> switch<00:03:16.000> pump<00:03:16.300> with

here is the old-style switch pump with

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.460 

with<00:03:22.210> both<00:03:22.420> pump<00:03:22.750> turned<00:03:22.990> on<00:03:23.110> it's<00:03:23.320> very

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
with both pump turned on it's very

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.230 
with both pump turned on it's very
obvious<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:23.920> see<00:03:24.130> how<00:03:24.400> much<00:03:24.610> movement<00:03:24.820> there

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
obvious to see how much movement there

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.880 
obvious to see how much movement there
really<00:03:25.420> is<00:03:27.720> now<00:03:28.720> if<00:03:28.900> I<00:03:28.990> pick<00:03:29.170> up<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.590> switch

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
really is now if I pick up the switch

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.100 
really is now if I pick up the switch
pump<00:03:30.160> off<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.520> table<00:03:30.850> you<00:03:31.540> can<00:03:31.720> actually<00:03:31.990> get

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
pump off the table you can actually get

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.690 
pump off the table you can actually get
an<00:03:32.200> idea<00:03:32.320> of<00:03:32.560> how<00:03:32.680> much<00:03:32.830> movement<00:03:33.460> there

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
an idea of how much movement there

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.080 
an idea of how much movement there
really<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.650> inertia<00:03:36.010> of<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.400> electric

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
really is the inertia of the electric

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.670 
really is the inertia of the electric
motor<00:03:37.120> turning<00:03:37.510> on<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:37.900> off<00:03:37.960> really<00:03:38.560> does

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
motor turning on and off really does

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.340 
motor turning on and off really does
cause<00:03:38.920> it<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.130> vibrate<00:03:39.250> quite<00:03:39.700> a<00:03:39.730> bit<00:03:40.350> over

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
cause it to vibrate quite a bit over

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.170 
cause it to vibrate quite a bit over
here<00:03:41.770> to<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.010> AEM<00:03:42.340> pump<00:03:42.610> which<00:03:42.970> is

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
here to the AEM pump which is

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.910 
here to the AEM pump which is
continuously<00:03:43.720> running<00:03:43.960> you<00:03:44.260> notice<00:03:44.650> there's

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
continuously running you notice there's

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.800 
continuously running you notice there's
almost<00:03:45.310> no<00:03:45.580> vibration<00:03:45.730> at<00:03:46.120> all<00:03:46.210> it<00:03:46.510> runs<00:03:46.660> very

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
almost no vibration at all it runs very

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.559 
almost no vibration at all it runs very
smoothly

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.600 

and<00:03:51.870> just<00:03:52.530> show<00:03:52.769> that<00:03:52.980> both<00:03:53.099> pumps<00:03:53.459> are

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
and just show that both pumps are

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.039 
and just show that both pumps are
actually<00:03:53.939> running<00:03:54.090> let<00:03:54.659> me<00:03:54.720> show<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:54.900> the

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
actually running let me show you the

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:01.640 
actually running let me show you the
nozzles<00:03:59.480> first<00:04:00.480> you'll<00:04:00.720> see<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:01.230> one<00:04:01.409> for<00:04:01.590> the

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
nozzles first you'll see the one for the

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.280 
nozzles first you'll see the one for the
switch<00:04:01.860> pump<00:04:02.599> and<00:04:03.599> here's<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.930> one<00:04:04.049> for<00:04:04.079> the

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
switch pump and here's the one for the

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.069 
switch pump and here's the one for the
new<00:04:04.379> pump<00:04:04.680> that's<00:04:04.920> going<00:04:05.189> smooth<00:04:05.900> let<00:04:06.900> me<00:04:06.989> get

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
new pump that's going smooth let me get

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.899 
new pump that's going smooth let me get
them<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.290> shot<00:04:07.500> together<00:04:07.650> there<00:04:08.489> they<00:04:08.610> are

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
them the shot together there they are

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:15.189 
them the shot together there they are
as<00:04:09.769> you<00:04:10.769> can<00:04:10.860> see<00:04:11.010> they<00:04:11.190> are<00:04:11.220> both<00:04:11.340> running

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:15.199 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.210 

here<00:04:16.199> you<00:04:16.350> can<00:04:16.470> see<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.799> actual<00:04:16.949> difference

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
here you can see the actual difference

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.090 
here you can see the actual difference
between<00:04:17.699> the<00:04:17.820> two<00:04:17.970> pumps<00:04:18.799> while<00:04:19.799> it<00:04:19.949> may

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
between the two pumps while it may

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.770 
between the two pumps while it may
appear<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.669> cutoff<00:04:20.880> switch<00:04:21.209> has<00:04:21.419> simply

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
appear that the cutoff switch has simply

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.480 
appear that the cutoff switch has simply
been<00:04:21.930> replaced<00:04:22.350> with<00:04:22.560> a<00:04:22.590> block<00:04:22.860> off<00:04:23.039> plate<00:04:23.220> on

been replaced with a block off plate on
the<00:04:23.699> new<00:04:23.850> AM<00:04:24.419> pump<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.500> internal<00:04:25.949> design

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
the new AM pump and the internal design

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.090 
the new AM pump and the internal design
is<00:04:26.639> actually<00:04:27.030> significantly<00:04:27.240> different

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
is actually significantly different
