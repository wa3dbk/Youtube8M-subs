on my mom's car and there's literally
nothing<00:01:16.170> I'm<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.650> driving<00:01:17.189> actually<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:18.060> can

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
nothing I'm not driving actually you can

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.120 
nothing I'm not driving actually you can
see<00:01:18.390> by<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.600> mirror<00:01:18.930> up<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.560> yeah<00:01:19.860> we

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
see by the mirror up there yeah we

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.550 
see by the mirror up there yeah we
didn't<00:01:20.340> fix<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.240> was<00:01:21.570> too<00:01:21.689> lazy<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
didn't fix it because I was too lazy I

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.450 
didn't fix it because I was too lazy I
said<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.250> actually<00:01:23.490> under<00:01:24.150> me<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:26.040> had<00:01:26.220> that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
said we actually under me so we had that

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.640 
said we actually under me so we had that
and<00:01:28.430> that's<00:01:29.430> what<00:01:29.579> we<00:01:29.640> had<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.060> we<00:01:30.270> used<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:31.110> key

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and that's what we had and we used a key

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.770 
and that's what we had and we used a key
light<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.250> key<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.579> out<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.270> had<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> one

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
light to key it out so we had a one

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.649 
light to key it out so we had a one
problem<00:01:34.290> as<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.100> see<00:01:35.369> when<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> use<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
problem as you can see when I use the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.569 
problem as you can see when I use the
green<00:01:36.869> screen<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.380> has<00:01:37.650> those<00:01:37.860> little<00:01:38.280> blue

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
green screen it has those little blue

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.870 
green screen it has those little blue
thingies<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:39.810> used<00:01:39.960> another<00:01:40.439> key<00:01:40.799> light<00:01:41.040> to

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
thingies so we used another key light to

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.800 
thingies so we used another key light to
key<00:01:42.150> them<00:01:42.360> out<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.930> we<00:01:43.200> get<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.970> perfect<00:01:44.970> blank

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
key them out so we get a perfect blank

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.690 
key them out so we get a perfect blank
shock<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:47.720> this<00:01:49.159> so<00:01:50.159> if<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.340> turn<00:01:50.520> on

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
shock just like this so if we turn on

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.450 
shock just like this so if we turn on
this<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.840> all<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.560> keys<00:01:52.829> done

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
this you can see that all the keys done

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.520 
this you can see that all the keys done
and<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.329> can<00:01:54.509> pretty<00:01:54.689> much<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.979> perfect

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
and you can pretty much see it's perfect

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.440 
and you can pretty much see it's perfect
so<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.649> doesn't<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.280> any<00:01:59.549> problems<00:02:00.210> it's

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
so it doesn't have any problems it's

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.780 
so it doesn't have any problems it's
perfect<00:02:00.840> after<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.920> created<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.579> road

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
perfect after that we created the road

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.520 
perfect after that we created the road
which<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.520> me<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:06.450> road<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.170> composition

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
which is of me the road is a composition

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.580 
which is of me the road is a composition
of<00:02:07.979> me<00:02:08.190> driving<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:08.759> my<00:02:08.879> bicycle<00:02:09.119> and

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
of me driving with my bicycle and

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.589 
of me driving with my bicycle and
holding<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.679> camera

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
holding the camera

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.949 
holding the camera
so<00:02:12.260> we<00:02:12.349> got<00:02:12.499> the<00:02:12.620> rolled<00:02:12.829> over<00:02:13.010> here<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.959> we

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
so we got the rolled over here and we

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.809 
so we got the rolled over here and we
used<00:02:15.200> stabilized<00:02:15.889> motion<00:02:16.099> as<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.519> can<00:02:16.670> see

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
used stabilized motion as you can see

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.220 
used stabilized motion as you can see
the<00:02:16.939> edges<00:02:17.349> around<00:02:18.349> here<00:02:18.590> are<00:02:19.689> moving<00:02:20.689> so

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
the edges around here are moving so

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.110 
the edges around here are moving so
because<00:02:21.859> when<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.189> car<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:22.549> standing<00:02:22.730> it's

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
because when the car is standing it's

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.809 
because when the car is standing it's
like<00:02:23.359> stabilized<00:02:24.230> then<00:02:24.499> I<00:02:24.620> was<00:02:24.799> moving<00:02:25.489> with

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
like stabilized then I was moving with

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.089 
like stabilized then I was moving with
my<00:02:25.969> hands<00:02:26.359> a<00:02:26.450> little<00:02:26.689> bit<00:02:26.870> when<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.650> was<00:02:27.709> holding

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
my hands a little bit when I was holding

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.970 
my hands a little bit when I was holding
the<00:02:28.189> camera<00:02:28.219> and<00:02:28.700> then<00:02:28.849> I<00:02:28.969> started<00:02:29.389> and<00:02:29.980> each

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
the camera and then I started and each

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.069 
the camera and then I started and each
time<00:02:31.310> i<00:02:31.459> shift<00:02:31.849> with<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:33.049> manual<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.840> added<00:02:35.840> a

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
time i shift with the manual I added a

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.670 
time i shift with the manual I added a
time<00:02:36.469> remap<00:02:37.099> to<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:38.299> night<00:02:38.989> time<00:02:39.230> remap

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
time remap to the night time remap

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.530 
time remap to the night time remap
actually<00:02:40.219> is<00:02:41.060> just<00:02:42.189> time<00:02:43.189> shifting<00:02:43.849> time

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
actually is just time shifting time

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.949 
actually is just time shifting time
stretching<00:02:45.019> something<00:02:45.469> about<00:02:46.569> less<00:02:47.569> and<00:02:47.810> less

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
stretching something about less and less

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.259 
stretching something about less and less
percent<00:02:48.439> so<00:02:48.620> healing<00:02:48.980> speeded<00:02:49.579> up<00:02:49.669> in<00:02:49.849> spirit

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
percent so healing speeded up in spirit

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.319 
percent so healing speeded up in spirit
each<00:02:50.510> time<00:02:50.840> achieved<00:02:51.199> Emmanuel<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:53.030> after

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
each time achieved Emmanuel and after

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.649 
each time achieved Emmanuel and after
that<00:02:53.449> we<00:02:54.109> put<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.500> road<00:02:54.739> in<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.760> composition

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
that we put the road in the composition

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.500 
that we put the road in the composition
over<00:02:56.810> here<00:02:57.109> so<00:02:57.379> we<00:02:57.500> get<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.949> this<00:02:58.849> and<00:02:59.180> this

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
over here so we get the this and this

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.629 
over here so we get the this and this
little<00:03:00.079> pretty<00:03:00.379> much<00:03:00.560> perfect<00:03:01.069> you<00:03:01.280> can<00:03:01.430> see

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
little pretty much perfect you can see

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.899 
little pretty much perfect you can see
the<00:03:02.540> windows<00:03:02.930> are<00:03:03.109> way<00:03:03.290> too<00:03:03.349> clear<00:03:03.739> so<00:03:04.579> we<00:03:04.760> use

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
the windows are way too clear so we use

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.390 
the windows are way too clear so we use
the<00:03:05.060> texture<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:06.290> make<00:03:06.500> them<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:06.919> little<00:03:07.310> bit

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
the texture to make them a little bit

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.830 
the texture to make them a little bit
brownish<00:03:07.699> the<00:03:08.480> texture<00:03:08.870> was<00:03:09.109> from<00:03:09.469> the<00:03:10.840> action

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
brownish the texture was from the action

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.569 
brownish the texture was from the action
assertion<00:03:12.319> stack<00:03:12.650> or<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:13.669> can<00:03:13.909> see<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:15.579> right

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
assertion stack or you can see it right

assertion stack or you can see it right
over<00:03:16.879> here<00:03:18.459> we<00:03:19.459> used<00:03:21.310> this<00:03:22.310> one<00:03:22.629> and<00:03:23.629> we<00:03:23.930> turn

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
over here we used this one and we turn

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.309 
over here we used this one and we turn
down<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.650> opacity<00:03:24.680> down<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:26.060> when<00:03:26.629> we<00:03:27.079> add

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
down the opacity down and when we add

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.039 
down the opacity down and when we add
like<00:03:27.620> ellipse<00:03:28.129> masks<00:03:28.759> feather<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.389> out<00:03:29.659> and

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
like ellipse masks feather that out and

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.080 
like ellipse masks feather that out and
it<00:03:30.799> can<00:03:31.009> get<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:33.470> dust<00:03:34.280> effect<00:03:34.729> on<00:03:34.970> the

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
it can get the the dust effect on the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.039 
it can get the the dust effect on the
last<00:03:35.299> engine<00:03:35.810> after<00:03:36.769> I<00:03:37.009> hit<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.609> drop<00:03:38.509> we<00:03:38.810> got

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
last engine after I hit the drop we got

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.050 
last engine after I hit the drop we got
the<00:03:40.540> broken<00:03:41.540> windshield<00:03:42.319> effects<00:03:43.040> as<00:03:43.669> you<00:03:43.849> can

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
the broken windshield effects as you can

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.740 
the broken windshield effects as you can
see<00:03:44.540> you<00:03:45.470> got<00:03:45.620> like<00:03:45.829> a<00:03:45.859> mask<00:03:46.250> coming<00:03:47.150> out<00:03:47.419> and

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
see you got like a mask coming out and

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.369 
see you got like a mask coming out and
like<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:47.930> fading<00:03:48.650> Canon<00:03:49.009> cuts<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.780> like

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
like a fading Canon cuts the the like

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.089 
like a fading Canon cuts the the like
it's<00:03:52.009> going<00:03:52.599> like<00:03:53.599> it<00:03:53.870> doesn't<00:03:54.049> just<00:03:54.349> pops<00:03:54.799> our

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
it's going like it doesn't just pops our

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.300 
it's going like it doesn't just pops our
it's<00:03:55.400> like<00:03:55.599> what<00:03:56.599> and<00:03:57.229> it<00:03:57.409> just<00:03:57.590> generates

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
it's like what and it just generates

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.569 
it's like what and it just generates
those<00:03:58.870> sparkles<00:03:59.870> or<00:04:00.169> whatever<00:04:00.530> broken<00:04:01.370> glass

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
those sparkles or whatever broken glass

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.429 
those sparkles or whatever broken glass
and<00:04:01.879> then<00:04:02.150> we<00:04:02.389> are<00:04:02.479> at<00:04:02.569> the<00:04:02.719> blood<00:04:03.109> splatter

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 
and then we are at the blood splatter

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.129 
and then we are at the blood splatter
which<00:04:03.680> I<00:04:03.829> found<00:04:04.099> it<00:04:04.250> on<00:04:04.400> Google<00:04:04.790> Images<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:06.019> the

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
which I found it on Google Images to the

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.800 
which I found it on Google Images to the
glass<00:04:06.409> over<00:04:06.650> here<00:04:06.799> so<00:04:07.639> it<00:04:07.789> has<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.359> effect

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
glass over here so it has the effect

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.270 
glass over here so it has the effect
like<00:04:09.620> it<00:04:10.219> was<00:04:10.340> something<00:04:10.609> popped<00:04:11.090> off<00:04:11.389> and

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
like it was something popped off and

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.569 
like it was something popped off and
also<00:04:13.280> we<00:04:13.579> did<00:04:13.789> it<00:04:13.939> we<00:04:14.209> make<00:04:14.840> on<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.829> shaking<00:04:16.280> on

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
also we did it we make on the shaking on

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.759 
also we did it we make on the shaking on
glass<00:04:16.880> we<00:04:17.449> make<00:04:17.599> the<00:04:17.719> picture<00:04:18.019> larger<00:04:18.229> we

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
glass we make the picture larger we

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.800 
glass we make the picture larger we
added<00:04:19.099> some<00:04:19.250> blur<00:04:19.489> so<00:04:19.760> it<00:04:19.849> bends<00:04:20.060> like<00:04:20.269> on

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
added some blur so it bends like on

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.140 
added some blur so it bends like on
as<00:04:21.049> you<00:04:21.170> can<00:04:21.320> see<00:04:21.500> if<00:04:21.560> we<00:04:21.620> turn<00:04:21.829> it<00:04:21.980> off<00:04:22.430> it's

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
as you can see if we turn it off it's

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.060 
as you can see if we turn it off it's
just<00:04:23.930> my<00:04:24.050> god<00:04:24.260> and<00:04:24.710> doesn't<00:04:25.250> get<00:04:25.340> faster<00:04:27.070> 92%

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
just my god and doesn't get faster 92%

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.500 
just my god and doesn't get faster 92%
and<00:04:28.310> it's<00:04:29.090> very<00:04:29.389> good<00:04:29.540> also<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:32.120> did<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.389> for

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
and it's very good also that did it for

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.440 
and it's very good also that did it for
that<00:04:32.740> render<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:33.889> out<00:04:34.040> up<00:04:34.460> we<00:04:34.880> also<00:04:35.060> have<00:04:35.300> it

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
that render it out up we also have it

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.040 
that render it out up we also have it
before<00:04:35.810> that<00:04:36.169> wiggler<00:04:36.710> so<00:04:37.070> I'll<00:04:37.880> set<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.300> so<00:04:38.630> it

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
before that wiggler so I'll set it so it

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.750 
before that wiggler so I'll set it so it
has<00:04:39.260> to<00:04:39.440> shaky<00:04:39.860> when<00:04:39.980> I'm<00:04:40.130> drying<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:40.700> then

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
has to shaky when I'm drying and then

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.240 
has to shaky when I'm drying and then
hitting<00:04:41.150> little<00:04:41.300> Archie<00:04:41.870> key<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.860> after<00:04:43.130> that

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
hitting little Archie key and after that

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.240 
hitting little Archie key and after that
I<00:04:43.490> export<00:04:44.240> everything<00:04:44.750> in<00:04:45.260> Sony<00:04:45.800> Vegas<00:04:48.250> I'll

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
I export everything in Sony Vegas I'll

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.470 
I export everything in Sony Vegas I'll
just<00:04:49.460> open<00:04:49.610> it<00:04:49.820> up<00:04:50.650> here's<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.800> video<00:04:51.919> and

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
just open it up here's the video and

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.430 
just open it up here's the video and
added<00:04:53.480> some<00:04:53.750> sound<00:04:54.320> effects<00:04:54.710> found<00:04:55.310> online

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
added some sound effects found online

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.210 
added some sound effects found online
crashing<00:04:57.440> effects<00:04:57.860> and<00:04:58.220> then<00:04:58.820> adding<00:04:59.300> te<00:04:59.510> out
