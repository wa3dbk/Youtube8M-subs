that<00:01:52.740> person<00:01:53.190> isn't<00:01:53.430> always<00:01:53.700> going<00:01:53.940> straight

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
that person isn't always going straight

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.970 
that person isn't always going straight
they<00:01:54.720> could<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.020> turning<00:01:55.350> they<00:01:55.740> could<00:01:55.890> be

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
they could be turning they could be

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.040 
they could be turning they could be
doing<00:01:56.280> tricks<00:01:56.670> they<00:01:57.180> could<00:01:57.360> be<00:01:57.450> surfing<00:01:57.720> the

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
everybody on the beach the drone once it

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.330 
everybody on the beach the drone once it
righted<00:03:16.890> itself<00:03:17.209> it<00:03:18.320> stayed<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:19.560> place<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.160> did

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
righted itself it stayed in place it did

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.520 
righted itself it stayed in place it did
not<00:03:20.520> fall<00:03:20.850> into<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.270> water<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.870> I'm<00:03:21.989> flying<00:03:22.290> a

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
not fall into the water and I'm flying a

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.520 
not fall into the water and I'm flying a
few<00:03:22.709> hundred<00:03:23.070> feet<00:03:23.480> into<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.780> water<00:03:24.959> so<00:03:25.260> I

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
few hundred feet into the water so I

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.320 
few hundred feet into the water so I
mean<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:25.920> would<00:03:26.010> have<00:03:26.100> sucked<00:03:26.370> for<00:03:26.640> sure<00:03:26.880> and

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
mean it would have sucked for sure and

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.640 
mean it would have sucked for sure and
there'd<00:03:27.510> be<00:03:27.600> no<00:03:27.780> way<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:27.959> could<00:03:28.170> swim<00:03:28.380> fast

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
there'd be no way I could swim fast

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.330 
there'd be no way I could swim fast
enough<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.040> don't<00:03:29.160> get<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:30.890> so<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:32.160> just

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
enough you don't get it and so I just

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.440 
enough you don't get it and so I just
thought<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.520> was<00:03:32.790> amazing<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.360> know

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
thought that was amazing you know

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.630 
thought that was amazing you know
because<00:03:33.720> I'm<00:03:33.840> flying<00:03:34.110> in<00:03:34.470> he's<00:03:35.010> riding<00:03:35.459> this

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
because I'm flying in he's riding this

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.580 
because I'm flying in he's riding this
way<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.060> wind's<00:03:36.330> coming<00:03:36.360> this<00:03:36.810> way<00:03:37.020> I<00:03:37.230> mean

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
way the wind's coming this way I mean

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.830 
way the wind's coming this way I mean
that's<00:03:38.070> that's<00:03:38.489> inertia<00:03:38.880> as<00:03:39.330> everything<00:03:39.750> like

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
that's that's inertia as everything like

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.910 
that's that's inertia as everything like
that<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.290> this<00:03:40.709> drone<00:03:41.130> actually<00:03:42.680> survived<00:03:43.680> it

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
that and this drone actually survived it

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.770 
that and this drone actually survived it
you<00:03:44.070> know<00:03:44.220> I'm<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.790> stoked<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:45.390> I<00:03:45.480> picked

lot more confidence now we always

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.310 
lot more confidence now we always
wondered<00:03:59.700> what<00:03:59.850> would<00:04:00.000> happen<00:04:00.150> if<00:04:00.480> if<00:04:00.900> we<00:04:01.109> hit

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
do you think that the blades would cut

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.410 
do you think that the blades would cut
the<00:04:03.720> lines<00:04:03.930> do<00:04:04.799> we<00:04:04.980> think<00:04:05.190> that<00:04:05.430> when<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.239> line

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
the lines do we think that when the line

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.840 
the lines do we think that when the line
comes<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:07.230> would<00:04:07.470> just<00:04:07.680> stop<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.040> motor<00:04:08.459> and

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
comes it would just stop the motor and

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.699 
comes it would just stop the motor and
then<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.359> patron<00:04:09.930> would<00:04:10.049> fall<00:04:10.320> into<00:04:10.500> the

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
then the patron would fall into the

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.349 
then the patron would fall into the
water<00:04:10.920> we<00:04:11.549> weren't<00:04:11.760> sure<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.150> this<00:04:12.239> is
