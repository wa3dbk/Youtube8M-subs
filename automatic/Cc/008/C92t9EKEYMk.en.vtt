 team 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:21.050
 The attitude control system for detecting the unstable driving of the vehicle 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:26.300
 The driver's steering wheel operation and the driving state of the vehicle are detected, 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:30.590
 Steering stability and handling of the vehicle through engine output control of de-braking 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:35.210
 Advanced safety system that improves performance 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:39.770
 Advantages of this system are that the vehicle equipped with the body posture control device 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:43.940
 There is an effect of reducing the number of accident days to 32 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:49.309
 Similar cases have been reported overseas 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:52.129
 In addition, the vehicle body attitude control unit when left over a sudden obstacle on the straight road 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:56.390
 Vehicles equipped with a vehicle that is not installed 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:01:00.320
 It has been reported that it can escape safely about 1.9 times 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:05.239
 Because of these advantages, the developed countries, the United States and Europe, 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.780
 To make the new vehicle mandatory basic regulation of the body posture control system 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.780
 It is a trend. 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.390
 The body posture control system consists of the following components 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:24.880
 The applied wheel speed sensor of each wheel 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:27.520
 Rotation rate sensor for measuring the rotational motion of the vehicle with respect to the vertical axis 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:32.830
 Recognizing the driver's intention to adjust the driving direction 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:35.230
 Steering Receive signals from each sensor to determine when and how to intervene 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:42.090
 This cu 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:42.090
 And it helps regulate the hydraulic device to generate a braking force of each wheel or chancel 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.730
 The first thing that happens is when you turn the handle. 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:57.310
 The driver must leave quickly to the left. 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:59.230
 The bodily sensor transmits this to the body position control unit cu 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.770
 However , 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:08.170
 The car signals that it is understeering. 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.850
 In a moment, the body posture control device speaks to the left rear wheel very instantly. 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.030
 Provides 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.560
 The owner of the car will do what the driver intended 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:22.270
 To keep your car in the left lane after you have avoided obstacles 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:26.890
 If you adjust the steering wheel of the car, the car will oversteer 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:32.110
 As a result, the rear part of the car tries to move to the left 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:34.620
 In this case, when the braking force is applied to the left front wheel of the body posture control device , 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.620
 Reduce 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:48.610
 When I am driving a car, I often meet with the US Senate, which is unexpectedly unstable. 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:53.680
 I will. 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:58.690
 The body posture control device is equipped with the top vehicle, the highway is hosted 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:01.750
 The car is right, but the lane is wide, so it makes you feel comfortable 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.020
 There are no traffic accidents or traffic information. 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.350
 Then suddenly grapefruit we showed up 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:13.709
 Because I suddenly turned my strength to avoid a collision. 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.709
 Give me a slip on the car and a little rage ou will 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:22.940
 U 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:26.000
 The body posture control device always monitors the automatic braking situation in real time 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.280
 The moment when the car recognizes signs of getting out of the lane 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.020
 ZiStone works instantly 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:37.950
 Precisely improved braking power is achieved by independently working each wheel 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.530
 It keeps the car safe in the car division. 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.530
 This is because the vehicle body posture control device 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.530
 It's a way to get the driver out of danger. 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:57.709
 It is not always possible to judge a road situation correctly 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:59.599
 For example, I thought just an ordinary corner is actually the slope is more than you think 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.209
 It could be serious. 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:05.269
 If you enter at too high a speed 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:09.010
 The centrifugal force for being pushing the car wipe 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.010
 Cars leave the road 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.020
 U 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.620
 The vehicle body posture control device determines the direction in which the driver intended to go and the actual running of the vehicle 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.510
 Compare directions 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.280
 If the car deviates from the intended direction of the driver , 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:39.020
 It is done 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.100
 Even if the operator does not take any action, the system controls each wheel independently 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.800
 And 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:50.720
 If necessary, the engine output is also reduced and the vehicle is controlled stably. 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.560
 A recent survey found that 25% of all traffic accidents, 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.470
 The 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.430
 Occurs when a car slides 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:03.230
 The vehicle body attitude control apparatus, and prevents the car from sliding 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.880
 Minimize the possibility of an accident by keeping the car safe on the road 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.930
 Let me 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:15.010
 While the body posture control system can not overcome the physical limits 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.010
 Provides the best assistance to drivers even in critical and dangerous situations 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:25.890
 The slippery curve curve When cornering the evil expression and the sudden master c 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:30.180
 The body posture control device loses its center 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:32.690
 Side or circumstances after he burst into a different direction than the driver Reed 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.690
 You will 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:44.820
 Looking at the vehicle equipped with the body posture control device 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:48.030
 Overstring occurs as seen when the vehicle suddenly turns left 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.790
 The vehicle will try to outboard the road 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:55.740
 At this time, the body posture control device sense 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:59.680
 The outer front wheel is braked briefly to generate the opposite station position. 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:04.360
 I can not keep my car safe. 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:10.110
 In the case of understeering, when the vehicle is about to get off the road 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:15.480
 It has played a role in the direction of the automation of the inner rear wheel of the vehicle 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:19.249
 As such, the body posture control system can not control the abs and the anti-slip device 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:25.069
 Control is possible up to the part 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:28.899
 In this way, the vehicle stability control improves handling performance 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:34.629
 It is a system that protects the safety of our valuable customers . 

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:36.279
 1 Since 2010 Kia Motors has stepped up its basic posture control system 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:41.070
 By applying 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:43.760
 Let's consider safety evenly. 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.760
 Thank you
