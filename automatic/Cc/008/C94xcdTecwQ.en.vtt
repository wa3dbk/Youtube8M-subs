a<00:00:14.389> smokin<00:00:15.389> confit<00:00:15.839> petri<00:00:16.320> dish<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:17.279> really

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
a smokin confit petri dish is really

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.830 
a smokin confit petri dish is really
interesting<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.150> all<00:00:18.300> sorts<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.660> levels

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
interesting on all sorts of levels

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.019 
interesting on all sorts of levels
combines<00:00:19.619> all<00:00:19.890> sorts<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.250> textures<00:00:20.820> and

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
combines all sorts of textures and

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.019 
combines all sorts of textures and
flavors<00:00:21.359> which<00:00:22.170> are<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.500> harmonious<00:00:23.160> so

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
flavors which are really harmonious so

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.240 
flavors which are really harmonious so
we<00:00:24.119> start<00:00:24.390> off<00:00:24.449> with<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.869> big<00:00:25.109> feet<00:00:25.439> big<00:00:25.710> jig

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
we start off with the big feet big jig

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.089 
we start off with the big feet big jig
itself<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.880> called<00:00:27.090> slowly<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:28.109> 12<00:00:28.410> hours<00:00:28.859> at

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
itself is called slowly the 12 hours at

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.349 
itself is called slowly the 12 hours at
85<00:00:29.550> Celsius

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
85 Celsius

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.680 
85 Celsius
it's<00:00:30.869> then<00:00:31.199> lightly<00:00:32.130> smoked<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.390> cold

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
it's then lightly smoked in a cold

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.090 
it's then lightly smoked in a cold
smoking<00:00:34.550> arrangement<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.820> maple<00:00:36.300> chips

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
smoking arrangement with maple chips

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.910 
smoking arrangement with maple chips
it's<00:00:38.100> then<00:00:38.370> further<00:00:38.899> confit<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.170> clarified

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
it's then further confit in clarified

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.040 
it's then further confit in clarified
butter<00:00:40.950> which<00:00:41.399> has<00:00:41.550> been<00:00:41.760> infused<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.360> ham

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
butter which has been infused with ham

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.979 
butter which has been infused with ham
on<00:00:43.230> juniper<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.250> bay<00:00:44.550> leaf<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.600> has<00:00:45.750> 3

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
on juniper and bay leaf so it has 3

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.830 
on juniper and bay leaf so it has 3
processes<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.920> cooking<00:00:47.329> then<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.629> some

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
processes of cooking then we have some

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.630 
processes of cooking then we have some
thinly<00:00:49.079> sliced<00:00:49.230> shiitake<00:00:49.649> mushrooms

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640

mouthfeel to the dish almost a little

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.950 
mouthfeel to the dish almost a little
bit<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.250> pork<00:01:14.520> fat<00:01:14.760> itself<00:01:15.180> very

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
bit like the pork fat itself very

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.320 
bit like the pork fat itself very
succulent<00:01:16.350> sort<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.040> feeling<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:18.210> we

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
succulent sort of feeling and then we

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.050 
succulent sort of feeling and then we
have<00:01:18.540> drew<00:01:18.900> some<00:01:19.110> artichoke<00:01:19.680> skins<00:01:20.100> which<00:01:20.880> is

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
have drew some artichoke skins which is

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.940 
have drew some artichoke skins which is
steamed<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.750> peeled<00:01:22.170> off<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.380> Jerusalem

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
steamed and peeled off the Jerusalem

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.219 
steamed and peeled off the Jerusalem
artichokes<00:01:23.720> dehydrated<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.930> then

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
artichokes dehydrated and then

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.899 
artichokes dehydrated and then
deep-fried<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.189> some<00:01:26.400> clarified<00:01:26.880> butter

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
deep-fried in some clarified butter

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.569 
deep-fried in some clarified butter
until<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.930> become<00:01:28.259> really<00:01:28.829> crisp<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.430> golden

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
until I become really crisp and golden

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.240 
until I become really crisp and golden
and<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.570> represents<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> top<00:01:31.500> crackling<00:01:32.009> of

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
and that represents the top crackling of

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.340 
and that represents the top crackling of
the<00:01:32.670> dish<00:01:32.880> when<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.869> actually<00:01:34.020> cook<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the dish when you actually cook the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.950 
the dish when you actually cook the
peachy<00:01:34.860> really<00:01:35.159> slowly<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.970> meat<00:01:36.150> becomes<00:01:36.540> so

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
peachy really slowly the meat becomes so

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.130 
peachy really slowly the meat becomes so
soft<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.590> cycle

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
soft in cycle

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.649 
soft in cycle
but<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:38.680> was<00:01:38.770> just<00:01:38.920> missing<00:01:39.250> this<00:01:39.729> element<00:01:40.450> of

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
but it was just missing this element of

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.050 
but it was just missing this element of
crackling<00:01:41.080> for<00:01:41.409> me<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:42.159> idea<00:01:42.520> of<00:01:42.580> using<00:01:42.850> the

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
crackling for me the idea of using the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.390 
crackling for me the idea of using the
Jerusalem<00:01:43.450> artichoke<00:01:43.870> skins<00:01:44.320> are<00:01:45.040> as

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
Jerusalem artichoke skins are as

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.609 
Jerusalem artichoke skins are as
correctly<00:01:46.060> was<00:01:46.540> really<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.900> basis<00:01:47.290> for<00:01:47.320> the

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
correctly was really the basis for the

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.430 
correctly was really the basis for the
dish<00:01:47.830> so<00:01:48.820> they're<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.240> main<00:01:49.390> flavors<00:01:50.140> and

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
dish so they're the main flavors and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.260 
dish so they're the main flavors and
then<00:01:50.770> we<00:01:50.920> just<00:01:51.100> simply<00:01:51.280> garnish<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:52.119> dish

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
then we just simply garnish the dish

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.640 
then we just simply garnish the dish
with<00:01:52.330> some<00:01:53.020> fresh<00:01:53.260> Tasmanian<00:01:53.979> wasabi<00:01:54.310> flowers

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
with some fresh Tasmanian wasabi flowers

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.990 
with some fresh Tasmanian wasabi flowers
so<00:01:56.650> the<00:01:56.710> dish<00:01:56.890> comes<00:01:57.190> together<00:01:57.430> with<00:01:57.820> is<00:01:57.970> a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
so the dish comes together with is a

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.510 
so the dish comes together with is a
beautiful<00:01:58.360> aromatic<00:01:58.960> we<00:01:59.500> check<00:01:59.800> this<00:01:59.979> often

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
beautiful aromatic we check this often

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.550 
beautiful aromatic we check this often
cycle<00:02:00.909> it<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.509> can<00:02:01.659> basically<00:02:01.840> eat<00:02:02.080> it<00:02:02.350> with<00:02:02.470> a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
the Tristram artichokes the sea scallops

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.380 
the Tristram artichokes the sea scallops
and<00:02:07.570> shitake<00:02:08.140> mushrooms<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.850> flavors<00:02:10.270> of
