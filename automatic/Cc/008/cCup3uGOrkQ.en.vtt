drill a bit in your drill it has those
three<00:01:58.210> clampy<00:01:59.050> things<00:01:59.410> that<00:01:59.740> grab<00:02:00.009> it<00:02:00.220> on<00:02:00.340> the

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
three clampy things that grab it on the

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.790 
three clampy things that grab it on the
chuck<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.940> know<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.300> sometimes<00:02:01.960> I've<00:02:02.500> put<00:02:02.710> it

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
chuck you know and sometimes I've put it

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.350 
chuck you know and sometimes I've put it

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
couple of those are grabbing so just

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.859 
couple of those are grabbing so just
make<00:02:06.460> sure<00:02:06.580> those<00:02:06.759> are<00:02:06.820> grabbing<00:02:07.090> also<00:02:07.750> when

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
you put your drill bit into the chuck

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.970 
you put your drill bit into the chuck
make<00:02:10.360> sure<00:02:10.570> it<00:02:10.720> doesn't<00:02:10.899> seat<00:02:11.350> all<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.739> way<00:02:11.830> up

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
pain to use that because I had to just

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.170

saw<00:03:25.090> out<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.870> was<00:03:25.900> an<00:03:26.079> idea<00:03:26.410> I<00:03:26.470> was

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
saw out of it it was an idea I was

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.590 
saw out of it it was an idea I was
hoping<00:03:26.950> I<00:03:27.070> could<00:03:27.100> make<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.400> video<00:03:27.609> viral<00:03:28.060> video

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
hoping I could make a video viral video

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.990 
hoping I could make a video viral video
and<00:03:28.959> so<00:03:29.739> I<00:03:29.769> wanted<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.070> use<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:30.220> saw<00:03:30.579> and<00:03:30.790> just

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
and so I wanted to use that saw and just

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.510 
and so I wanted to use that saw and just
do<00:03:31.120> like<00:03:31.590> Victorian<00:03:32.590> style<00:03:32.889> legs

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
do like Victorian style legs

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.250 
do like Victorian style legs
and<00:03:33.700> put<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:33.910> bunch<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.210> gears<00:03:34.570> on<00:03:34.780> it<00:03:34.900> really

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
and put a bunch of gears on it really

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.320 
and put a bunch of gears on it really
don't<00:03:35.470> do<00:03:35.620> anything<00:03:35.890> and<00:03:36.340> just<00:03:36.610> shoot<00:03:37.090> like<00:03:37.300> a

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
don't do anything and just shoot like a

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.480 
don't do anything and just shoot like a
one-minute<00:03:38.080> video<00:03:38.200> of<00:03:38.530> it<00:03:38.680> working<00:03:39.220> but<00:03:39.430> I

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
one-minute video of it working but I

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.580 
one-minute video of it working but I
never<00:03:39.940> got<00:03:40.090> around<00:03:40.240> to<00:03:40.570> it<00:03:40.600> now<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.290> sauce

plywood do I use that's a good question

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.810 
plywood do I use that's a good question
because<00:04:20.680> I<00:04:20.860> use<00:04:21.010> all<00:04:21.130> different<00:04:21.400> types<00:04:21.640> of

because I use all different types of
plywood<00:04:22.120> for<00:04:22.600> instance<00:04:23.170> this<00:04:23.560> week<00:04:23.950> I'm<00:04:24.280> using

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
plywood for instance this week I'm using

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.470 
plywood for instance this week I'm using
this<00:04:25.750> which<00:04:26.200> is<00:04:26.550> maple<00:04:27.550> plywood<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.300> has<00:04:28.450> a

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
this which is maple plywood it has a

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.630 
this which is maple plywood it has a
real<00:04:28.780> thin<00:04:29.260> veneer<00:04:29.800> of<00:04:29.980> maple<00:04:30.370> on<00:04:30.430> it<00:04:30.580> I

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
real thin veneer of maple on it I

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.940 
real thin veneer of maple on it I
actually<00:04:30.760> got<00:04:31.090> this<00:04:31.240> at<00:04:31.450> Home<00:04:31.720> Depot<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:32.530> it

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
actually got this at Home Depot and it

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.520 
actually got this at Home Depot and it
was<00:04:33.070> cheaper<00:04:33.670> than<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.600> regular<00:04:35.110> pine

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
was cheaper than the regular pine

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.980 
was cheaper than the regular pine
plywood<00:04:36.310> I<00:04:36.460> don't<00:04:36.640> know<00:04:36.730> why<00:04:36.940> but<00:04:37.330> that's<00:04:37.780> why

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
plywood I don't know why but that's why

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.630 
plywood I don't know why but that's why
I<00:04:38.020> got<00:04:38.260> it<00:04:38.380> and<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.590> it<00:04:39.010> sort<00:04:39.280> of<00:04:39.340> looks<00:04:39.550> like

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
I got it and it it sort of looks like

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.470 
I got it and it it sort of looks like
pine<00:04:40.060> -<00:04:40.360> here's<00:04:40.660> pine<00:04:41.370> plywood<00:04:42.370> and<00:04:42.670> they're

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
pine - here's pine plywood and they're

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.000 
pine - here's pine plywood and they're
not<00:04:43.660> a<00:04:43.720> whole<00:04:44.020> lot<00:04:44.230> of<00:04:44.260> difference<00:04:44.770> -<00:04:44.890> it

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
not a whole lot of difference - it

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.160 
not a whole lot of difference - it
really<00:04:45.160> quality<00:04:45.910> of<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.180> is<00:04:46.330> probably<00:04:46.840> not<00:04:47.020> as

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
really quality of it is probably not as

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.230 
really quality of it is probably not as
good<00:04:47.230> because<00:04:47.710> you<00:04:47.830> can<00:04:47.950> tell<00:04:48.160> it<00:04:48.820> doesn't

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
good because you can tell it doesn't

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.110 
good because you can tell it doesn't
have<00:04:49.450> as<00:04:49.600> many<00:04:49.720> plies<00:04:50.170> as<00:04:50.620> this<00:04:51.220> one<00:04:51.460> does<00:04:51.730> if

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
have as many plies as this one does if

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.910 
have as many plies as this one does if
it<00:04:52.210> has<00:04:52.330> a<00:04:52.360> lot<00:04:52.540> of<00:04:52.570> plies<00:04:52.870> like<00:04:53.140> this<00:04:53.380> it's<00:04:53.620> I

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
it has a lot of plies like this it's I

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.950 
it has a lot of plies like this it's I
think<00:04:54.010> that's<00:04:54.220> just<00:04:54.310> cabinet<00:04:55.030> grade<00:04:55.330> plywood

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
think that's just cabinet grade plywood

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.570 
think that's just cabinet grade plywood
and<00:04:56.140> it's<00:04:56.200> always<00:04:56.380> sanded<00:04:56.920> on<00:04:57.040> both<00:04:57.280> sides

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
and it's always sanded on both sides

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.970 
and it's always sanded on both sides
really<00:04:58.000> nice<00:04:58.180> some<00:04:58.570> of<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.840> cheaper<00:04:59.500> plywood

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
really nice some of the cheaper plywood

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.670 
really nice some of the cheaper plywood
will<00:05:00.160> only<00:05:00.400> have<00:05:00.610> just<00:05:00.970> a<00:05:01.210> few<00:05:01.240> plies<00:05:02.140> in<00:05:02.500> there

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
will only have just a few plies in there

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.190 
will only have just a few plies in there
and<00:05:02.890> you'll<00:05:03.070> also<00:05:03.400> sometimes<00:05:03.820> have<00:05:03.910> big<00:05:04.300> holes

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
and you'll also sometimes have big holes

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.930 
and you'll also sometimes have big holes
