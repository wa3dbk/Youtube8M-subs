00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.099
 the guy who most influenced our 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.080
 their physical calculation and their 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.730
 discoveries and innovations 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.460
 he who with his great efforts 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.770
 reached all mankind and did every time 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.420
 more developed and more understanding 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.630
 of the universe yes albert einstein is not 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.980
 about sir wilson seriously we that 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.439
 program is getting more and more 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.840
 decadent then it's okay let's talk about 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.969
 So, Mr. Wilson, but sign up for the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.980
 channel by clicking the link and following the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.100
 to help make sure this helps. 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.030
 Holy shit, and this video was meant to be. 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.160
 different 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.899
 I had voted for the titans 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.500
 I just had a problem editing the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.360
 Titans 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.379
 so it will be there but no more 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.210
 Let's go to theory, yes, many. 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.399
 asked to make that theory about the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.340
 dub nerd video game and I stayed 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.989
 extremely tempted to do but was 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.210
 from that moment that I was watching 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.850
 to the colony against attack that I discovered 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.790
 a more interesting specimen sir 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.650
 wilson or rather yes sir that wilson 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.409
 Make it clear that I'm not talking about 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.560
 wilson azevedo but your character the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.380
 Mr. Wilson and his psychology and 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.140
 every time I heard his or her 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.180
 personalities asked me more and more 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.850
 Today I will prove to you that the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.979
 Mr. Wilson is actually a guy with 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.890
 serious personality disorders and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.180
 Of course how the steps to Brazil are then 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.890
 come on 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.979
 we must first establish what 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.110
 it's normal what's abnormal so 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.090
 we can conclude that yes it is crazy but 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.030
 let's split it three topics the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.399
 first as rage yes play with meloni 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.100
 a traumatic experience for many 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.149
 but most tell this game the book 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.799
 and I will not play anymore 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.799
 now watch how he reacts 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.540
 Yeah, I know 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.650
 then we definitely have a case of 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.050
 exaggerated anger according to hallucinations 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.479
 within several episodes we can see 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.880
 a severe case of hallucinations from seeing 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.860
 death until fights with the state of use 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.750
 against ninjas and comments and we are a 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.750
 normal thing that you see nowadays 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.810
 yes to a serious crisis of hallucination 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.739
 in short they off of hallucinogens and 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.680
 constant 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.110
 we come to the third personality point 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.209
 and perhaps it is the most complex point of 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.190
 our theory within the channel we saw that the 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.470
 mr mister wilson unconsciously 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.120
 take on diverse personalities who 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.360
 try to take control of the episodes 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.580
 I fear mob that basically an alter ego 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.709
 main character and today we have the pain 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.360
 which is a rigid version the characters 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.510
 today very clear of multiple personality 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.519
 can be seen in the film Fight Club is 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.319
 what spoilers what the character 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.300
 is a personality 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.880
 totally different from him called 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.130
 Tagheer li ning that's all he does not 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.530
 is thus creating a persona that he 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.780
 I wanted to finally see that you 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.850
 Wilson suffers the same disturbance only 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.620
 with three different people 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.810
 so yes he has problems 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.860
 and there we have a point that I 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.130
 wanted to arrive 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.130
 joining compulsive anger hallucinations 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.070
 frequent and multiple personality we have 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.920
 what psychology likes to call 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.780
 dissociative disorder of identity or 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.239
 in which the individual presents 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.090
 many possibilities that continuously 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.739
 can take control of the individual 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.950
 let's perform some of the symptoms of this 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.750
 we have panic attacks that 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.920
 we have seen in many of the episodes is on 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.230
 focus on games 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.720
 the anxiety is almost totally 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.030
 present the donor episode and of course 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.650
 depression is too much to fill one of the 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.930
 traditions we have seen of the Lord 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.820
 wilson as he prepares to 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.359
 record the episode as you're 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.340
 seeing 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.590
 In short, Mr. Wilson has 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.510
 tron all crises 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.459
 plates with this type of problem is the 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.440
 The more obscure of all this is that when 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.430
 we have analyzed how this type of 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.920
 mental issue 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.629
 according to Sidney, we have seen that everything 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.640
 fits well 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.019
 according to which it is a rule of 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.900
 disease classifications 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.849
 tpi is caused by severe stress and 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.860
 problems related to childhood 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.930
 Mr. Wilson in his other 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.060
 personalities who were born of a 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.160
 crisis in his childhood in which he played 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.840
 the games he so much hates maybe 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.850
 these games are what stimulate their 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.010
 problems and constantly making 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.310
 that he plays video game tapes in 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.360
 rather private all legislation and 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.240
 rage 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.850
 all this is increasingly involving 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.520
 that he picks up a horrible game and plays it 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.220
 he is stuck in this constant link of 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.470
 psychological crisis but people this is just 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.990
 a theory made by a gamer gamer 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.789
 list but mister wilson do not take this is 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.070
 normal, this is just a tribute to the 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.690
 Your channel subscribes to its channel 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.389
 it's a great channel if you do not know 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.340
 against is one of the best 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.020
 Brazilian channels in my opinion 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.820
 being sincere is the channel that 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.979
 accompanies a good time I wanted to do 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.900
 this is within the theory because it is 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.940
 always interesting kind staff wanted 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.310
 ask me to do the emg fan 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.500
 but we have great ones and another 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.450
 inside Brazil so I wanted to do something 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.120
 with a Brazilian cult that has 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.970
 practically the same level of quality 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.530
 then follow them and also the channel in 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.300
