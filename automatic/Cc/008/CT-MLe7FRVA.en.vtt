the<00:00:53.549> water<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:54.120> touching<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.659> nut<00:00:54.959> and<00:00:55.319> then

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the water just touching the nut and then

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.660 
the water just touching the nut and then

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
for about 12 hours so 12 hours have

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.620 
for about 12 hours so 12 hours have
passed<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.700> time<00:01:11.940> for<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.210> next<00:01:12.450> step

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
passed and it's time for the next step

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.330 
passed and it's time for the next step
of<00:01:12.780> our<00:01:12.870> spreading<00:01:13.260> process<00:01:13.620> we're<00:01:14.190> going<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.180 
of our spreading process we're going to
remove<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.210> dome<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:16.470> beans<00:01:16.740> haven't

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
remove the dome the beans haven't

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.640 
remove the dome the beans haven't
sprouted<00:01:17.610> us<00:01:17.760> yet<00:01:18.060> they<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.990> swollen<00:01:19.290> in

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
sprouted us yet they have swollen in

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.100 
sprouted us yet they have swollen in
size<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:20.970> see<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> color<00:01:21.810> the

size and you can see that the color the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.780 
size and you can see that the color the
water<00:01:22.320> has<00:01:22.590> changed<00:01:23.040> color<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.760> little

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
bit greenish tinge to it now so we're

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.090 
bit greenish tinge to it now so we're
going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.570> pour<00:01:27.870> off<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.320> extra<00:01:28.710> this

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
water here we're going to give the beans

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.860 
water here we're going to give the beans
a<00:01:32.370> little<00:01:32.640> quick<00:01:32.880> rinse<00:01:33.120> under<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.660> water

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
with our hands because the root is going

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.330 
with our hands because the root is going
to<00:01:37.180> be<00:01:37.240> searching<00:01:37.690> for<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.200> water<00:01:38.440> you<00:01:39.160> don't

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
to be searching for the water you don't

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.100 
to be searching for the water you don't
want<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.730> mesh<00:01:39.940> though<00:01:40.240> being<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.810> root<00:01:40.990> to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
want the mesh though being the root to

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.680 
want the mesh though being the root to
be<00:01:41.230> going<00:01:41.530> down<00:01:41.740> into<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.130> mesh<00:01:42.600> we're<00:01:43.600> gonna

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
be going down into the mesh we're gonna

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.630 
be going down into the mesh we're gonna
add<00:01:43.930> fresh<00:01:44.230> water<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.950> then<00:01:45.460> we're<00:01:45.550> gonna

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
add fresh water and then we're gonna

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:57.180 
add fresh water and then we're gonna
just<00:01:45.940> simply<00:01:46.270> replace<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.810> dome<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.560> now

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
just simply replace the dome and now

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:05.719 
just simply replace the dome and now
we'll<00:01:57.370> just<00:01:57.550> wait<00:01:57.760> another<00:01:58.000> 12<00:01:58.390> hours

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.580 

so<00:02:06.729> another<00:02:06.970> 12<00:02:07.300> hours<00:02:07.450> has<00:02:07.810> passed<00:02:08.080> it's<00:02:08.380> time

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
so another 12 hours has passed it's time

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.930 
so another 12 hours has passed it's time
for<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.830> next<00:02:08.920> stage<00:02:09.250> in<00:02:09.280> our<00:02:09.520> sprouting

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
for the next stage in our sprouting

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.000 
for the next stage in our sprouting
process<00:02:10.360> so<00:02:10.990> you<00:02:11.050> just<00:02:11.290> simply<00:02:11.560> remove<00:02:11.709> the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
process so you just simply remove the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.360 
process so you just simply remove the
dome<00:02:12.190> again<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:13.810> beans<00:02:14.170> house<00:02:14.560> permanent

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
dome again and the beans house permanent

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.010 
dome again and the beans house permanent
this<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.700> exciting<00:02:16.239> you<00:02:16.270> just<00:02:16.600> pour<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.989> water

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
this is exciting you just pour the water

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.800 
this is exciting you just pour the water
off<00:02:17.520> give<00:02:18.520> them<00:02:18.670> one<00:02:18.850> more<00:02:18.880> quick<00:02:19.330> rinse<00:02:19.570> you

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
off give them one more quick rinse you
