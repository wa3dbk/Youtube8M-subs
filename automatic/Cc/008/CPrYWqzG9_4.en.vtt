00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
room and go to sleep forever because

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.020 
room and go to sleep forever because
you're<00:00:13.620> kind<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.920> stressed<00:00:14.130> out<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.610> you

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
you're kind of stressed out and you

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.730 
you're kind of stressed out and you
don't<00:00:15.210> really<00:00:15.450> want<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.750> do<00:00:15.839> anything<00:00:16.049> I'm

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
don't really want to do anything I'm
definitely<00:00:16.980> having<00:00:17.279> one<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.520> those<00:00:17.609> days

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
definitely having one of those days

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.310 
definitely having one of those days
should<00:00:18.270> probably<00:00:18.539> take<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.660> off<00:00:18.960> because<00:00:19.140> I

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
should probably take this off because I

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.859 
should probably take this off because I
look<00:00:19.590> like<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> grandma<00:00:20.310> who<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.820> wearing<00:00:21.449> some

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
look like a grandma who is wearing some

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.310 
look like a grandma who is wearing some

thought and this shirt isn't really
helping<00:00:30.359> much<00:00:30.779> either<00:00:30.810> because<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.920> looks

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
helping much either because it looks

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.740 
helping much either because it looks
like<00:00:32.160> I'm<00:00:32.279> wearing<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.550> doily<00:00:32.700> but<00:00:33.270> it's
