00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
playing some drop zone on a village and

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.320 
playing some drop zone on a village and
I<00:00:12.960> actually<00:00:13.349> made<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> commentary<00:00:14.429> about<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
I actually made a commentary about the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.529 
I actually made a commentary about the
MSR<00:00:15.929> ACOG<00:00:16.470> veena<00:00:16.770> really<00:00:17.310> sick<00:00:17.550> weapon<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.510> use

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
MSR ACOG veena really sick weapon to use

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.429 
MSR ACOG veena really sick weapon to use
and<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:20.220> think<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.760> did<00:00:20.939> pretty<00:00:21.150> well<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.930> I

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
and I think that did pretty well and I

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.170 
and I think that did pretty well and I
really<00:00:22.740> think<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.400> ACOG<00:00:23.670> scope<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:24.150> a

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
really think that the ACOG scope is a

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.759 
really think that the ACOG scope is a
pretty<00:00:24.480> underrated<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.410> game<00:00:25.590> actually

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
pretty underrated in this game actually

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.419 
pretty underrated in this game actually
it's<00:00:26.130> pretty<00:00:26.279> good<00:00:27.529> the<00:00:28.529> ACOG<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> little

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
it's pretty good the ACOG is a little

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.089 
it's pretty good the ACOG is a little
bit<00:00:29.519> closer<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.470> you<00:00:31.470> know<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.949> to

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
bit closer to the you know to the I to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.850 
bit closer to the you know to the I to
the<00:00:32.460> character<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:34.140> not<00:00:34.350> like<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> model

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
the character so it's not like the model

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.069 
the character so it's not like the model
142<00:00:35.100> ACOG<00:00:35.610> scope<00:00:35.640> where<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.390> really<00:00:36.840> far

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
142 ACOG scope where it's really far

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.799 
142 ACOG scope where it's really far
away<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.559> pretty<00:00:37.710> hard<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.010> aim<00:00:38.809> you

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
away and it's pretty hard to aim you

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.500 
away and it's pretty hard to aim you
know<00:00:39.930> down<00:00:40.140> site<00:00:40.530> down<00:00:41.489> range<00:00:41.820> i<00:00:42.090> should<00:00:42.300> say

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
know down site down range i should say

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.840 
know down site down range i should say
you<00:00:43.440> know<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> get<00:00:43.890> some<00:00:44.040> long-range<00:00:44.280> kills

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
you know to get some long-range kills

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.750 
you know to get some long-range kills
with<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> ACOG<00:00:45.719> scope<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.739> mod<00:00:46.920> 143<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.460> think

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
with the ACOG scope in a mod 143 I think

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.090 
with the ACOG scope in a mod 143 I think
it's<00:00:47.879> pretty<00:00:48.059> good<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:49.289> looks<00:00:49.530> good<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.920> have

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
it's pretty good it looks good you have

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.319 
it's pretty good it looks good you have
I<00:00:50.399> think<00:00:50.840> six<00:00:51.840> different<00:00:52.649> little<00:00:53.640> reticle<00:00:54.120> red

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
I think six different little reticle red

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.810 
I think six different little reticle red
dot<00:00:54.539> size<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.140> choose<00:00:55.289> from<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.860> I

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
dot size that you can choose from and I

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.880 
dot size that you can choose from and I
like<00:00:57.120> using<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.660> triangular<00:00:58.410> one<00:00:58.590> just

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
like using this a triangular one just

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.099 
like using this a triangular one just
because<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.100> i'm<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.940> car<00:01:00.149> for<00:01:00.329> fanboy<00:01:00.809> man<00:01:01.079> I

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
because a i'm a car for fanboy man I

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.950 
because a i'm a car for fanboy man I
wanted<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.949> be<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.160> want<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.030> ACOG<00:01:03.329> scope<00:01:03.359> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
wanted to be I want the ACOG scope and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.950 
wanted to be I want the ACOG scope and
caught<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.860> come<00:01:05.040> back<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.580> um<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.810> know
