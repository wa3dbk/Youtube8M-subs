00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.290
 Hello UTF Fraer year this is my new 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.060
 I beat for the crusader in this build 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.250
 wanted to achieve the effect of causing damage 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.500
 as from spikes that is, we will apply 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.660
 damage to the enemy when he attacks 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.880
 now let's see what we have 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.430
 It turned out first we go through the pluses and 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.250
 minuses and so the pros of this build 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.440
 good damage and survival fit both 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.710
 for playing party and solo level 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.290
 difficulty torture 3 and 4 what about 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.079
 minuses there is no control mobs not 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.120
 Suitable for quick pharma problems with 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.150
 mobs that attack you from a distance 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.100
 as well as a large number of legendary 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:57.710
 things for the perfect kit and now 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.960
 let's deal with our skills on 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.270
 1 slot I put the rage is not without strings 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.140
 effects for dealing damage like 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.450
 distance and close to the second slot i 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.549
 put a carat champion to increase 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.259
 Rune damage and accumulation 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.799
 the arsonist will give us extra damage 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:18.350
 on the enemy in the third slot and put 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.659
 skill phalanx strings archers they will 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.130
 cause good damage and distract 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.159
 at the mobs for a while 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.619
 On 4 slots I put the principle of valor with 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.979
 rune irrepressible force to increase 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.380
 damage and saving anger on the main 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.750
 skill set punishment to increase 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.780
 block probabilities and runes counter-strike for 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.039
 causing additional damage and 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.960
 main auxiliary skill will be 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.960
 line of heaven with a rune cleft 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.950
 from passive skill put a single step 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.120
 back to increase block probability 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.850
 health restoration packs 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.220
 at the expense of the unit a good thing to increase 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.960
 damage and also to restore 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.810
 health since I have a two-handed weapon 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.730
 i use divine power but if u 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.280
 you one-handed weapon you can choose 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.220
 from such room as multicolor 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:16.350
 righteousness vigilance impenetrable 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:19.130
 armor of the board and unbreakable fighter in 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.740
 panel improvement i chose power 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.760
 critical damage resistance to elements and 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.760
 area damage 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.090
 now we move on to our drip 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.850
 for my duty I specifically collected 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.760
 things like click on drill power 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.950
 thunder and defender whist march 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.620
 and also i want to get fireproof 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.750
 boots all these forever wear reverse damage 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.170
 against the enemy even if we do not attack 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.750
 him 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.060
 for the perfect kit costs us 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.080
 pay attention to things like 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.440
 wristbands reaper armor acana power a 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.350
 hilda clothes captain crimson ring 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.310
 royal luxury rescue shield and 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.290
 the brush claws of the gyrfalcon 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.120
 the nuances we should have pleasant 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.370
 physical damage not less than forty 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.830
 percent critical damage no less 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.590
 three hundred percent and don't forget 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.960
 about increasing damage from elements and skills 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.000
 we also need to understand the probability of a block 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.800
 in my case it's 50 percent with 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.860
 use the skill of punishment with 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.630
 defining elements above 800 is worth 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.670
 also do not skip things on the decline 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.610
 control effects and reduced time 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.470
 restore your skills but now 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.900
 let's actually see how it goes 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.580
 loved into action while you watch the video 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.280
 I will talk about some details 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.500
 build is designed to conduct melee 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.390
 After all, whether by force to Andrew 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.340
 thunder and protector all mash 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.560
 the enemy will take damage when 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.840
 assault don't forget she let 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.610
 it seems they help on instantly 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.940
 restore 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.320
 no lift and health spheres 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.700
 can be put down with ordinary mobs 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.980
 use only primary 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.840
 secondary skill and when stumble 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.790
 for an elite tutu we need to go 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.190
 as close as possible first 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.740
 activate emphasis some carats after 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.450
 i use heaven once phalanx then 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.970
 already activate the principle of valor 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.109
 fat loss of heaven that there are forces in passing 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.109
 such punishment 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.080
 and
