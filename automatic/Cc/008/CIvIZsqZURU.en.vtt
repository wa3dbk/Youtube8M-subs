00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.760
 pesto and raw sauces we learn to 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.340
 prepare in the best possible way 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.590
 as always we say in the kitchen must 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.180
 put your heart also thanks to 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.340
 presence of fabio campoli dear fabio 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.810
 thanks sonia we try again today at 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.790
 put your heart into it because my idea 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.140
 I want to immediately see the error 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.730
 positive and negative when we talk 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.130
 of cold sauce because Italy is rich 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.660
 of not only of Ligurian and Genoese texts 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.930
 but many sauces made with oil 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.550
 extra virgin with herbs with dried fruit and 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.079
 they all have a peculiarity that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.600
 they are raw so not cooked it goes 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.760
 very well 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.830
 therefore, if the due precautions are not taken 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.120
 we risk making sauces raw of 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.190
 this kind that means I am 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.120
 oxidize that there is too much fat with 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.460
 attention 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.560
 look at the difference as they can 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.090
 stay green and mix together 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.980
 to the oil also a part of water 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.300
 let's give a certain tone and try with gods 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.759
 tips that are good for both 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.200
 rice for vegetable pastes 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.080
 I will start immediately from some exact 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.939
 first with and let's also say fabio piÃ¹ 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.909
 that better ones are also healthier because 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.409
 when we respect certain methods of 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.969
 preparation cooking etcetera 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.979
 we also eat in a more balanced way 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.600
 everything we try to do together 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.700
 on this table and to give advice 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.649
 experiences already lived because 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.850
 so many years I've done that this is 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.679
 of course 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.270
 evolution continues as we did 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.460
 other times other recipes are omelettes 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.590
 I also made omelettes 2 the day 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.240
 and so he certainly has in this experience 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.249
 the Italy experience is rich in oil 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.729
 a little extra virgin but good this one 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:43.380
 we always say what little but always 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.200
 medium light intense fruity but of 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.819
 great quality of the oil from here is this 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.999
 a special eye because it is fruity 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.560
 intense herbaceous and what does it mean aler 

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:55.139
 kiss of the kiss connects to the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.479
 green chlorophyll then the greens 

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:59.819
 can be basil parsley la 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.979
 spinach rocket no all that green and 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.469
 chlorophyll and chestnut sensation 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.270
 but there is a detail that the oil 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.789
 however at the low parade the sensation 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.150
 from maroni but I put a little look 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.950
 of rocket the secret of these recipes is 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.319
 also the cold the choice of materials 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.880
 first then what do I do when I prepare 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.400
 these sauces put everyone in the fridge 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.230
 sonia nut cheeses because more 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.060
 temperature is low and less c hassi 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.410
 action all plant products too 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.540
 walnut orders 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.820
 working there with robots with probes 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.290
 dive get hot and we 'll have to 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.310
 end a product that gradually warms up 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.290
 quality green 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.240
 the makeup of great quality products 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.030
 fresh scented in the morning of the garden 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.040
 market in the fridge very cold 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.780
 and then when we go with the probe in 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.760
 version or with robot a few seconds a 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.380
 so let's not spoil anything then 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.880
 I put the whole green part okay 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.560
 basil 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.910
 I chose the nuts but in short Italy 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.820
 it is really rich in hazelnut nuts 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.650
 almonds I would have covered when 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.120
 I can try to use the product 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.740
 Italian 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.730
 fruit is a product all year round 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.830
 dry 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.140
 I prepared because I like it I am a 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.230
 little lemon juice 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.540
 obviously a natural antioxidant 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.860
 citric acid but also on the palate if 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.480
 we think of oil and lemon when 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.070
 we want to start is pleasant then 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.050
 these rices are good and hot 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.840
 then chill some lemon juice 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.640
 therefore double antioxidant function e 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.260
 pleasant to the palate because I have 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.630
 told in my book that there is the 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.270
 low and acids, fatty acids and 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.030
 the margarines that I never use are in 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.530
 bottom but the best are the part that 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.820
 make their own palate coatings that 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.880
 don't let you hear I knew 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.620
 very well I put my dream there 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.000
 we will touch it many times I call it 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.590
 grated cheese but try to 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.100
 teach cooks that Italy is rich in 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.560
 large cheeses not fake but real from 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.420
 worse than any area but they are big 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.459
 cheeses then at the moment a little bit of 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.620
 cheese and then the last thing 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.690
 I put water, water and oil together 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.630
 together yes so I put the ice 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.580
 still to lower the temperature is 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.380
 war from now so we all put it 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.720
 not even salt together 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.180
 I'm going to whisk this is what creates create 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.459
 an emulsion does not make it creamy but 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.170
 we reduce the oil we have a sauce more 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.030
 light on the palate to hold in 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.459
 refrigerator and we make ourselves a little product 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.190
 during the year as we like to do with 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.269
 I'm going to make the last of the vegetables 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.269
 operation that this 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.269
 frattini 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.440
 and this then all turned out to be this 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.030
 final results 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.570
 look at a moment really while 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.580
 we are here 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.830
 and it is precisely I stop because so much 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.830
 we always say it with our own 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.480
 cooking techniques that we show 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.270
 I prepared a look at how nice 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.350
 then we have already explained it a little bit 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:50.570
 good and healthy dividers because cooked 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.330
 as our friends who follow us know 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.850
 cooked with a spectacular healthy technique 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.000
 look warm a little of ours 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:02.360
 the walnuts and herbs sauce don't need much 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.550
 a spoon we mix it well and there 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.670
 we really seem to be a 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.540
 suggestion therefore the important thing is 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.940
 top quality products 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.950
 few but really good or in products 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.140
 cold possibly just pulled out 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.840
 from the fridge and always seasonal products 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.540
 when we can shoot we read 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.060
 fine seasonal Italian products 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.510
 this is the suggestion of this 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.570
 episode of kuoni cuisine by fabio campoli 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.580
 and as always I want to remind you that 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.910
 find these suggestions but also 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.920
 many others on how to eat yes in a way 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:41.170
 tasty but also especially so 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:44.350
 healthy for us and not just for us on
