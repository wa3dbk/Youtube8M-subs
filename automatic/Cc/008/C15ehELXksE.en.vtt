your<00:01:18.750> iphone<00:01:19.080> 4<00:01:19.380> right<00:01:19.830> before<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.250> start<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
your iphone 4 right before you start the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.120 
your iphone 4 right before you start the
process<00:01:20.729> now<00:01:21.180> I've<00:01:22.110> already<00:01:22.350> installed<00:01:22.890> this

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
process now I've already installed this

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.020 
process now I've already installed this
and<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:24.540> process<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.170> super<00:01:25.590> easy<00:01:26.030> it's

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and the process was super easy it's

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.600 
and the process was super easy it's
completely<00:01:27.509> dry<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.159> takes<00:01:29.159> about<00:01:29.310> 10

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
completely dry and takes about 10

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.060 
completely dry and takes about 10
minutes<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.450> essentially<00:01:31.200> what<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.380> do<00:01:31.619> is

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
minutes so essentially what you do is

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.210 
minutes so essentially what you do is
you<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:32.909> basically<00:01:33.210> pull<00:01:33.990> back<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.920> tab

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
you just basically pull back on this tab

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.120 
you just basically pull back on this tab
you<00:01:37.759> just<00:01:38.759> pull<00:01:38.970> back<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.450> tab<00:01:39.979> lined<00:01:40.979> it

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
you just pull back on this tab lined it

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.149 
you just pull back on this tab lined it
up<00:01:41.189> perfectly<00:01:41.909> do<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.930> back<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.350> line<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.070> up

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
up perfectly do the back here line it up

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.429 
up perfectly do the back here line it up
perfectly<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.909> once<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.320> you

perfectly and once you have it then you

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.899 
perfectly and once you have it then you
just<00:01:46.619> slowly<00:01:47.430> start<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.030> push<00:01:48.990> down<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
just slowly start to push down and

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.370 
just slowly start to push down and

remove the bubbles and the seals and
when<00:01:52.470> you're<00:01:52.590> done<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.180> just<00:01:54.180> take<00:01:54.479> this

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
when you're done you just take this

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.200
