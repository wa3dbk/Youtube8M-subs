no<00:02:53.489> time<00:02:53.760> because<00:02:53.970> rice<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.780> already<00:02:54.959> we<00:02:55.590> have

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
no time because rice is already we have

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.260 
no time because rice is already we have

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
here this roasting of this rice rava or

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.509 
here this roasting of this rice rava or
sakura<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.640> totally<00:03:24.030> optional<00:03:24.239> I've<00:03:25.519> done

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
sakura is totally optional I've done

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.220 
sakura is totally optional I've done
both<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.850> method<00:03:27.330> with<00:03:27.660> roasting<00:03:28.080> and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
both the method with roasting and

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.930 
both the method with roasting and
without<00:03:28.440> roasting<00:03:28.860> I<00:03:29.010> found<00:03:29.310> with<00:03:29.519> roasting

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
without roasting I found with roasting

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.880 
without roasting I found with roasting
it<00:03:30.060> gives<00:03:30.299> a<00:03:30.450> nice<00:03:30.570> an<00:03:30.840> aromatic<00:03:31.200> flavor<00:03:31.680> to

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
it gives a nice an aromatic flavor to

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:32.509 
it gives a nice an aromatic flavor to
your<00:03:31.920> OPA

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
your OPA

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.430 
your OPA
so<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:32.910> can<00:03:33.120> totally<00:03:33.480> skip<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.930> roasting

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
so you can totally skip that roasting

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.729 
so you can totally skip that roasting
step<00:03:34.739> now<00:03:35.580> we'll<00:03:35.790> mix<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.239> well<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:37.440> make

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
step now we'll mix this well and make

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.070 
step now we'll mix this well and make
sure<00:03:37.980> all<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.519> ingredients<00:03:39.150> have<00:03:39.269> mixed<00:03:39.540> well

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080

mark to make sure the OPA doesn't stick
to<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.769> kadai<00:03:57.049> it's<00:03:58.049> been<00:03:58.410> around<00:03:58.769> eight<00:03:59.640> to

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
to the kadai it's been around eight to

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.940 
to the kadai it's been around eight to
nine<00:04:00.120> minutes<00:04:00.600> and<00:04:00.870> I've<00:04:01.170> opened<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.739> lid

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
nine minutes and I've opened the lid

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.310 
nine minutes and I've opened the lid
just<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.370> check<00:04:02.640> how<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.299> upma<00:04:03.840> has<00:04:04.080> been

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
just to check how the upma has been

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.590 
just to check how the upma has been
cooked<00:04:04.650> you<00:04:05.430> can<00:04:05.459> see<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.910> water<00:04:06.150> has<00:04:06.299> been

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
cooked you can see the water has been

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.600 
cooked you can see the water has been
completely<00:04:07.080> absorbed<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.160> there<00:04:08.340> is<00:04:08.430> no

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
completely absorbed and there is no

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.970 
completely absorbed and there is no
water<00:04:08.850> at<00:04:09.120> all<00:04:09.330> or<00:04:09.570> will<00:04:09.870> slightly<00:04:10.170> stir<00:04:10.650> it

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
water at all or will slightly stir it

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.560 
water at all or will slightly stir it
I<00:04:11.010> see<00:04:11.489> it's<00:04:11.640> sticking<00:04:11.850> a<00:04:12.090> little<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.450> the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
I see it's sticking a little to the

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.479 
I see it's sticking a little to the
kirai<00:04:12.720> that's<00:04:13.079> the<00:04:13.350> reason<00:04:13.680> why<00:04:13.860> I<00:04:13.890> told<00:04:14.160> you

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
kirai that's the reason why I told you

kirai that's the reason why I told you
you<00:04:14.610> have<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.880> open<00:04:15.180> in<00:04:15.299> between<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:15.870> or<00:04:16.229> mix

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
you have to open in between and or mix

you have to open in between and or mix
it<00:04:16.890> this<00:04:17.669> is<00:04:17.850> almost<00:04:18.299> about<00:04:18.600> 80<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.260> 85<00:04:19.739> percent

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
it this is almost about 80 to 85 percent

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.940 
it this is almost about 80 to 85 percent
done<00:04:20.640> we'll<00:04:21.209> just<00:04:21.450> give<00:04:21.660> it<00:04:21.810> another<00:04:22.080> or<00:04:22.710> few
