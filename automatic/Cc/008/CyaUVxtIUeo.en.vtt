00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
all of my area with that base cover now

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.419 
all of my area with that base cover now
watch<00:01:57.539> how<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.780> fade<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.319> a<00:01:58.500> little<00:01:58.890> more<00:01:59.069> red

watch how I fade in a little more red

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.380 
watch how I fade in a little more red
and<00:01:59.459> yellow<00:01:59.939> as<00:02:00.469> I<00:02:01.469> get<00:02:01.679> down<00:02:01.950> low<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.969> give<00:02:03.149> me

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
and yellow as I get down low to give me

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:18.960 
and yellow as I get down low to give me
the<00:02:03.539> little<00:02:03.750> bit<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.289> a<00:02:04.439> forest<00:02:04.979> floor<00:02:05.729> effect

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.380 

blue<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.960> opposite<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.710> orange<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:21.430> darken<00:02:22.210> and

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
blue is opposite to orange so darken and

00:02:22.390 --> 00:03:00.699 
blue is opposite to orange so darken and
cancel<00:02:22.930> out<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.260> intensity

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.009 

so<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.370> gets<00:03:01.519> browner<00:03:01.849> as<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.269> comes<00:03:02.480> down<00:03:02.689> and

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
so you gets browner as it comes down and

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.470 
so you gets browner as it comes down and
just<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.859> touch<00:03:04.129> of<00:03:04.430> white<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:05.030> lighten<00:03:05.239> that

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
just to touch of white to lighten that

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.539 
just to touch of white to lighten that
brown<00:03:08.290> make<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.439> look<00:03:09.590> like<00:03:09.799> some<00:03:10.069> light<00:03:10.280> is

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
brown make it look like some light is

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:33.370 
brown make it look like some light is
hitting<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:11.090> forest<00:03:11.959> floor<00:03:12.140> back<00:03:12.530> in<00:03:12.709> there

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:04:06.320

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.720 

okay<00:04:07.330> that's<00:04:07.720> my<00:04:07.900> base<00:04:08.110> now<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:09.310> next<00:04:09.640> thing

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730
