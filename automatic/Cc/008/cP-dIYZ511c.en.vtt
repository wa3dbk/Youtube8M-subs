00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
rather than just shoving food in my

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.300 
rather than just shoving food in my
mouth<00:01:55.910> because<00:01:56.270> it's<00:01:56.630> that<00:01:56.810> time<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.260> day

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
realized that I don't really want to eat

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.930 
realized that I don't really want to eat
anything<00:02:02.740> immediately<00:02:03.740> when<00:02:04.160> I<00:02:04.190> wake<00:02:04.460> up<00:02:04.640> I

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
anything immediately when I wake up I

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.380 
anything immediately when I wake up I
used<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.450> just<00:02:05.690> wake<00:02:05.930> up<00:02:06.140> eat<00:02:06.590> go<00:02:07.400> to<00:02:07.460> school<00:02:08.179> or
