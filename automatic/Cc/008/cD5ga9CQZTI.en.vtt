00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello friends today I'll show you how 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.639
 make a rose made of egg carton 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.650
 well let's see how the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.370
 materials that we are going to use are the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.060
 egg carton a slim stick gun 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.810
 of silicon acrylic paint or vinci 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.210
 red and green color scissors or cutter and a 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.550
 Brush 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.449
 The first thing we will do is cut a 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.739
 strip what is the egg carton already 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.739
 then let's cut 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.200
 three pieces of these 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.720
 what are we going to use to 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.760
 make our rose 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.790
 What we will do with our pieces will be 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.790
 cut with a scissor all the shore 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.449
 well in this way and we will do the same 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.699
 with the three pieces well we already have 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.330
 cut the edges of our figures 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.390
 and now let's take one and with the help 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.570
 of the silicon gun we will stick all 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.159
 the tips along the edges and we will have 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.159
 in this way 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.970
 once stuck what will be our rose 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.520
 next we are going to take our 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.409
 red paint and our brush and we're going 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.840
 to paint 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.350
 while drying the piece we have for 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.370
 the rose we take another figure and we're going to 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.970
 cut in half 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.810
 and again in the middle and then 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.490
 these pieces are going to shape 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.490
 because they will be our leaves 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.770
 we cut the other 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.520
 well and we will only use two the other what 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.520
 we keep 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.970
 and this piece will be for the part that goes 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.360
 under the rose so we open it a 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.360
 little bit 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.980
 and then we are going to take our 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.280
 green paint and what we are going to do is 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.640
 paint the leaves the part that went under 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.180
 of the rose and the stick that is our 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.040
 stem 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.500
 good friends how can you see we already have 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.810
 our painted and dried pieces the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.239
 stalk the bottom of the rose the 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.420
 rose and the leaves and then we're going 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.420
 to paste what is our rose 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.520
 with this piece 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.650
 in this way we take our stem well 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.650
 and we put a little on the tip 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.880
 and we introduce it 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.250
 in the two pieces and we will have this 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.340
 way finally let's paste what is 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.370
 the sheet 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.830
 bending the tip a little 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.460
 and applying silicone 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.790
 and we put it in this way we paste the 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.790
 other 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.610
 in the other side 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.360
 and finally we have finished our 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.360
 pink 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.560
