00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.809
 hello we're going to make a tube scarf 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.820
 it is 40 cm wide on the whole 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.619
 lee of the fabric if the polka dot polyester is 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.630
 a little shorter than faux fur 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.430
 which is wrong or wrong on the other pin 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.020
 well and we will cut the butter on 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.730
 will equalize over the entire length 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.310
 so first put the pins 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.510
 to equalize and then we will want it is very 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.939
 simple if you put a lot 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.340
 pinned it will save you from having to 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.710
 to build we cut the end we equalized 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.630
 on both sides taking the polyester 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.730
 as a landmark having not at the edge of the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.379
 polyester now we're going to sew on 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.969
 the two lengths only we 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.590
 will leave the widths open as 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.870
 fight for 1 cm from the edge 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.730
 obviously we had positioned and two 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.770
 pieces of tissue place against 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.870
 places to see the shaking seam well 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.460
 the tanks because it's the wrong one 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.010
 fur gives it a little hair 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.230
 velvet and there is everywhere so this 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.120
 cook outside through the window of a garden 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.890
 if you can only follow me 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.420
 weight and sew the seam is made to 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.580
 a centimeter now in the church 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.470
 is pale and then we go on wire and so 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.720
 his two lengths taking both 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.520
 layers together after the yarn is on 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.280
 will iron the seam with a bat 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.049
 so do their passage and do 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.920
 now we just have to assemble the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.140
 two sides it must first tour 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.360
 where we eventually equalize so that 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.400
 be it right one way to do it 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.220
 either we take exactly the two 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.740
 pieces together and we pin in 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.740
 sparing 10 cm coll and will be open 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.060
 was shifted by about 15 cm its 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.310
 will produce a twist so we are not 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.960
 friends that's it gives us that we're going 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.210
 to the end of what can be attached 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.830
 the rest we wanted it will end at the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.260
 hand when we return to picket 1 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.110
 cm here we see the shift that we 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.000
 call because there is polyester 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.920
 and then there is the fake fur 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.560
 we can even as soon as it is even more 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.820
 we can shift squarely in shower have 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.890
 so offset by half in couple and if 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.979
 we take off our shoulders and we'll go back 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.260
 in sheath so while leaving the screeds 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.480
 by the hole we left our customers 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.360
 we have our shift we can do it 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.940
 without so we prefer it is shifted 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.480
 all you have to do is finish by hand 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.850
 this little seam here is the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.010
 small point the pond the shocks tube is 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.959
 finished to wear it you put it 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.390
 around your neck like a big 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.050
 jumper will pull you and you put on a 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.240
 second time 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.130
 so she wirelessly duplicate she exists 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.170
 in 4 colors there are four colors of 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.900
 polyester seven years ago linens website 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.550

 a red the four colors are very 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.150
 good so for the four colors we have 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.120
 this black gray and here are the tube tanks 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.050
