 Russian production of Apple Watch 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.599
 turned out to be unprofitable and much more 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.369
 let's start by tradition with not the most significant 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.300
 this week's events and so heading 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.300

 Mode officially ios application 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.950
 it looks so cool that 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.750
 some may well think about 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.360
 transition street block to the official 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.250
 A client recently hacker team has created 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.630
 new computer virus capable 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.370
 infect mac 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.079
 it works at the embedded level 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.059
 software that does 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.340
 impossible to remove it without tricky 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.190
 manipulations hackers called their offspring 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.680

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.140
 apple pointing to a security hole

 the company has so far managed to eliminate only one 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.539
 out of five vulnerabilities this week came out 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.090
 fourth public beta austin captain 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.009
 and version 6 for developers visible 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.569
 almost no changes have changed 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.459
 just an icon in the system settings menu 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:26.259
 and added new wallpaper 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:28.060
 the remaining improvements are aimed at 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.500
 increase system stability and 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.229
 fix bugs and errors 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.119
 and teams so g known for its 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.920
 jailbreak tools 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.500
 This week has released a new version. 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.720
 now use your utilities 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.580

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.599
 untether which does not 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.369
 repeat procedure is required after 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:50.470
 device reboot among 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.840
 supported ios versions listed 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.840
 EEPROM 8 13 84 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.899
 kill it as it is known works on 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.790
 the territory of our country that can not us 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.530
 but not some services please 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.289
 apple remain available only for 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.390
 us inhabitants in the case of apple music up 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.190
 we did not reach the station hyt swan 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.140
 probably because it sounds on 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.060
 foreign language is sad 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.290
 radio station listeners give me quite 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.810
 positive evaluation 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.010
 but do not despair there is hope for 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.830
 what beats 2 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.720
 or for example, without 6, he will play in Russia 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.849
 network information appeared from anonymous 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.670
 sources according to which apple can 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.049
 not limited to just one radio station 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.420
 agreement with the copyright holders allow 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.150
 they broadcast not only full swan but also on 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.370
 5 other radio stations will they appear 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.920
 what exactly they will be different to us while 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.150
 unknown however Western media have expressed 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.099
 several assumptions 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.690
 additional radios may be 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.700
 aimed at music lovers 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.160
 different genres and different regions 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.049
 the world speaking different languages so 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.030
 it is likely that soon we 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.870
 get the radio from apple and for 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.870
 Russian-speaking users 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.780
 this week is a Taiwanese company 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.120
 advanced 7 contactor engineering 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.920
 producing processors with 1 for apple 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.270
 Watch voiced at the conference with 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.000
 investors disappointing data 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.130
 concerning smartwatches she stated that 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.230
 disappointed low production 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.420
 apple watch because of insufficient 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.520
 order numbers production process 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.900
 never paid for the information 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.120
 analysts to provide 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.520
 the profitability of the release of components of this 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.680
 must order 2 million monthly 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.690
 processor and the last month and date 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.640
 orders over one and a half 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.130
 million connection with which the company suffered 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.780
 damages meanwhile tim cook said that not 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.680
 it is worth taking reports seriously 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.959
 apple partners 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.700
 if he and the supplier reduced orders 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:51.140
 it may mean that the load was 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:52.520
 moved to another partner if you 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.160
 Been waiting for a large-scale update 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.170
 line of computers aimak then we have for 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.209
 you good news analytics from 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.280
 agencies kiji oh famous for their 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.350
 accurate predictions reports that up to 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.420
 updates aimak left quite a bit 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.220
 more precisely the updated computer will 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.560
 submitted from the fourth quarter of this 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.910
 years most likely in October along with 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.010
 new ipad and macbook 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.930
 it is reported that a new ime will receive 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.970
 improved display processor as well 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.709
 other updated components thus 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.739
 the appearance of computers will not change 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.169
 is it about the appearance of 21 and a half 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.930
 Inch retina aimag is unclear 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.669
 the line has not been updated since 2013 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.770
 ex version retina display 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.660

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.370
