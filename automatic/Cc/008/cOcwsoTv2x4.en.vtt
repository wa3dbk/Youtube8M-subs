00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 We're still here at the LG booth. 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.140
 the flex lg that for those who do not 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.719
 know is the curved screen phone and also 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.059
 also flexible lg screen 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.730
 it has a 6-inch screen 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.160
 720p curve as you can see here 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.500
 by the curvature of the huge cell 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.980
 almost bigger I think it is bigger than 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.560
 lot 3 and it has the same 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.930
 specifications that the lg 2 and 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.880
 a 3 megapixel rear -facing camera that 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.070
 is a little less than g2's that of 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.260
 20 megapixels but it is very similar in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.120
 The question of the sensor such an account also 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.760
 that with optical image stabilization the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.610
 which is excellent and the great fitch of 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.660
 same cell phone is not part of the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.760
 processing new power 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.070
 processing that is the same as the year 2 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.870
 of Annex 5 is neither of the RAM than 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.500
 is also the same as 2 gigabytes in the attachment 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.750
 5 is thus the curved screen which is also 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.129
 how you can see the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.239
 People are going to take a demo test. 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.699
 now to flex the cell phone against 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.530
 another table than the LG booth and he 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.710
 can see that it really flexes and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.689
 is stoned is the same which is very 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.909
 awesome plus lg obviously not 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.020
 recommends that you do this for a long time. 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.150
 time because this may end 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.189
 damaging the cell phone but it can 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.009
 there we can say that we're going 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.659
 speak a little sturdy because of this 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.939
 does not prevent it from continuing entirely 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.250
 he did not suffer any damage he continues 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.040
 100% running now something else that is 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.290
 very interesting in flex lg is that 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.869
 it has a back that has a material 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.659
 which automatically ensures 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.640
 light scratches but if you're scratching 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.470
 strongly as his pick up the phone 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.100
 and start dragging on the asphalt 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.890
 obviously not going to recover is very 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.990
 Well, you pick up a key as it is. 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.329
 to him he will recover after a 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.820
 some time and this is very interesting 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.189
 and smart and flex at the moment the lg does not 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.990
 said nothing about bringing to Brazil is 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.579
 they do not say anything they will have a 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.979
 prototype can not say much 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.079
 but we found some things 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.479
 interesting about this and you can see 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.970
 this on our site with link that goes 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.840
 being in the description was a hug and 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.730
 Thank you for checking our coverage. 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.970
 the leader and flex here in campus party 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.970
 Brazil
