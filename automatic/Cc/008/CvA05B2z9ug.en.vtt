00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.160
 new video 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.770

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.780
 heaven on spike cube taking place 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.340
 currently a little bit like this 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.140
 happened a decade ago 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.820
 days that was called araud this 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.369

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.939
 it's about a quarter of an hour 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.230
 twenty minutes on a custom map 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.040

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.020
