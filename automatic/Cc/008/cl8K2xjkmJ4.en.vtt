allies that are increasingly concerned

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.120 
allies that are increasingly concerned

more aggressive actions around the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.949 
more aggressive actions around the
region<00:03:49.459> 80%<00:03:50.459> of<00:03:50.550> people<00:03:50.670> live<00:03:51.090> within<00:03:51.420> about<00:03:51.840> a

region 80% of people live within about a

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.960 
region 80% of people live within about a
hundred<00:03:52.230> miles<00:03:52.350> of<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.680> coastline<00:03:53.010> think<00:03:53.790> about

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
hundred miles of a coastline think about

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.790 
hundred miles of a coastline think about
all<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.209> coastline<00:03:54.630> that<00:03:54.660> is<00:03:55.110> involved<00:03:55.680> with

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
all the coastline that is involved with

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.620 
all the coastline that is involved with
the<00:03:55.890> Pacific<00:03:56.130> Rim<00:03:56.459> region<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.060> ninety

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
the Pacific Rim region and ninety

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.240 
the Pacific Rim region and ninety
percent<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.989> world<00:03:58.140> trade<00:03:58.410> goes<00:03:58.680> on<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.920> ocean

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
percent of world trade goes on the ocean

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.880 
percent of world trade goes on the ocean
so<00:03:59.489> this<00:04:00.030> isn't<00:04:00.239> just<00:04:00.720> about<00:04:00.840> military<00:04:01.650> being

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
so this isn't just about military being

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.000 
so this isn't just about military being
there<00:04:02.190> for<00:04:03.230> adversarial<00:04:04.230> relationships<00:04:04.830> it's

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
there for adversarial relationships it's

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.340 
there for adversarial relationships it's
about<00:04:05.070> for<00:04:05.640> stability<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:07.019> way<00:04:07.170> we're

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
about for stability of the way we're

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.960 
about for stability of the way we're
