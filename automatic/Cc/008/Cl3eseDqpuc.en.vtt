00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:13.250
 Hi there, you're on a decibel channel today 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.440
 another video about the box body under the sub 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:21.039
 the Urals from 12.3 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:24.050
 asked to calculate the dimensions as usual 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.890
 certain requirements were customer 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.810
 net volume turned out 63 liters 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.590
 port setting 37 herz 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:37.269
 but this form has a body tried 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.420
 make it as wide as possible and 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:46.719
 at the maximum depth that is here 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:50.600
 This size tried to do 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:56.649
 the smallest and that's what we got in 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:59.289
 total port slit port sizes 340 on 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.059
 50 millimeters 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:05.290
 I'll show you how he looks later 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.630
 inside well here everything is standard as in ours 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.560
 Karabakh which we count 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.260
 only sizes differ 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.420
 as for being cut off, this is the kind 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.350
 has amplitude-frequency 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.870
 characteristic is not quite bad 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.510
 the characteristic is obtained salon 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.270
 car on a little shift left think 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.940
 you will be more than pleasant by 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.610
 at least from this dynamic all that 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.650
 you can squeeze but it's for everyday 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.970
 if they are not for measurements for 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.420
 listening to music 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.680
 every day I think he will 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:48.380
 as universal as possible go to 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:51.620
 most details means parts 1 and 2 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:57.050
 exactly the same size as usual 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:02:00.729
 340 to 255 thickness of all material 18 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:04.159
 millimeters of all the walls of MDF or plywood 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.560
 I usually recommend these materials. 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.580
 use well and most often there 18 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.269
 millimeters goes to manufacturer's part 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.530
 number three front wall dimensions 900 on 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.220
 376 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.990
 and in her 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.770
 hole window respectively under 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.810
 speaker you can arrange it like 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.040
 you will be comfortable a little bit to the left there 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.550
 above below either 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.580
 to the right here I have arranged as in my 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.220
 the look will be cute just look 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.000
 but in any case it shouldn't sound 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.840
 affect therefore already see for yourself 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.470
 as you will be more comfortable and a hole under 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.480
 the port itself is 50 to 340 square here these 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.610
 dimensions 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.590
 wall thickness respectively 18 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.740
 millimeters here we are and size 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.030
 holes you don't have everything as usual in 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:07.270
 our enclosures detail number four 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:11.750
 bottom wall dimensions are 900 by 255 and 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:14.390
 item number five is us top wall 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.050
 It is similar to the bottom dimensions for sure 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.520
 the same 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:22.040
 and item number six is ​​the same copy 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.019
 front wall only without holes then 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.180
 we have three pairs of details 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:30.769
 absolutely the same you can immediately 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.459
 cut me in one of them will have 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:38.269
 still make holes for the desk for 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:42.440
 dynamics and we still have details 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.730
 the port itself is item number 340 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.870
 at 197 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:52.340
 and detail number eight 340 by 187 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.489
 size this vital you need for 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:00.470
 port manufacturing here's the location of these 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:06.739
 details you see well and actually on 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:09.320
 that's all about the desk here such 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.930
 program settings bo sport 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.470
 that is, there should be no signs 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.260
 air speed of 7 meters per second 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.820
 theoretically should be what port 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.729
 so I think there are no problems 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.610
 I should be here on this all 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.969
