swinging the club back knees feet roll

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.540 
swinging the club back knees feet roll
because<00:02:23.170> he<00:02:23.410> started<00:02:23.800> through<00:02:24.040> his<00:02:24.280> right

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
because he started through his right

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.820 
because he started through his right
foot<00:02:24.850> would<00:02:25.120> roll<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.930> heel<00:02:26.230> wouldn't<00:02:26.620> come

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
foot would roll the heel wouldn't come

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.430 
foot would roll the heel wouldn't come
up<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.730> slowed<00:02:28.030> down<00:02:28.300> his<00:02:28.510> overactive<00:02:28.900> body

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440

and they taught him how to release the
club<00:02:30.940> in<00:02:31.209> time<00:02:31.840> with<00:02:31.990> his<00:02:32.110> footwork<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:33.310> when

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
about his feet gave him his whole rhythm

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.930 
about his feet gave him his whole rhythm
of<00:02:55.570> his<00:02:56.140> golf<00:02:56.410> swing<00:02:56.560> right<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.459> just<00:02:57.730> said

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
of his golf swing right so you just said

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
I'm feeling what my feet are doing in

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.710 
I'm feeling what my feet are doing in
the<00:03:00.400> moment<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:00.819> that's<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.150> whole<00:03:01.330> idea<00:03:01.360> of

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
the moment and that's the whole idea of

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.170 
the moment and that's the whole idea of
this<00:03:02.019> thin<00:03:02.350> tech<00:03:02.590> low-profile<00:03:03.340> technology<00:03:04.030> is

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
this thin tech low-profile technology is

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.690 
this thin tech low-profile technology is
if<00:03:04.780> we<00:03:04.989> can<00:03:05.170> reduce<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.769> amount<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.130> material

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
if we can reduce the amount of material

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.420 
if we can reduce the amount of material
between<00:03:06.970> your<00:03:07.780> foot<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.380> ground<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:09.280> we

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
between your foot and the ground and we

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.180 
between your foot and the ground and we
can<00:03:09.610> improve<00:03:09.850> that<00:03:10.390> connectivity<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:12.069> the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
can improve that connectivity and the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.130 
can improve that connectivity and the
sensitivity<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.300> signals<00:03:13.810> that<00:03:13.900> your

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
sensitivity so the signals that your

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.930 
sensitivity so the signals that your
feet<00:03:14.410> are<00:03:14.560> sending<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:14.950> your<00:03:15.160> brain<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.700> tell

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
feet are sending to your brain to tell

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.729 
feet are sending to your brain to tell
you<00:03:16.120> what's<00:03:16.690> happening<00:03:17.110> in<00:03:17.260> your<00:03:17.350> footwork

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
you what's happening in your footwork

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.320 
you what's happening in your footwork
throughout<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.220> golf<00:03:18.400> swing<00:03:18.550> are<00:03:18.850> enhanced

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
throughout the golf swing are enhanced

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.120 
throughout the golf swing are enhanced
that's<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.630> whole<00:03:19.780> idea<00:03:19.810> well<00:03:20.739> there's<00:03:20.950> no

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
that's the whole idea well there's no

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.610 
that's the whole idea well there's no
there's<00:03:21.519> no<00:03:21.700> doubt<00:03:21.940> that's<00:03:22.209> critical<00:03:22.810> but<00:03:22.959> the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
there's no doubt that's critical but the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.590 
there's no doubt that's critical but the
hard<00:03:23.890> thing<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.190> find<00:03:24.489> David<00:03:24.970> is<00:03:25.090> shoes<00:03:25.360> that

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
hard thing to find David is shoes that
