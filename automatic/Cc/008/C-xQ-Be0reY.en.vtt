00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
against a feral druid and rogue death

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.880 
against a feral druid and rogue death
knight<00:01:54.420> here<00:01:54.600> starts<00:01:54.930> out<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.170> blood<00:01:55.350> presents

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
knight here starts out in blood presents

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.289 
knight here starts out in blood presents
what<00:01:56.040> presents<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> new<00:01:56.549> tanking<00:01:56.939> presence

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
what presents the new tanking presence

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.670 
what presents the new tanking presence
so<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:57.719> kind<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.290> old<00:01:58.320> frost

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
so it's kind of like the old frost

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.469 
so it's kind of like the old frost
presence<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.310> reduces<00:01:59.520> damage<00:01:59.820> increases

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
presence it reduces damage increases

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.679 
presence it reduces damage increases
health<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.710> that's<00:02:02.670> that's<00:02:03.060> why<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.570> that

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
health so that's that's why is in that

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.870 
health so that's that's why is in that
presence<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.290> hammer<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.189> justice<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.610> rogue

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
presence I hammer of justice this rogue

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.419 
presence I hammer of justice this rogue
out<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.479> stealth<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:07.890> think<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.160> easier

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
out of stealth and I think it's easier

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.100 
out of stealth and I think it's easier
to<00:02:08.520> see<00:02:08.729> rogues<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.149> south<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.810> because<00:02:09.989> I'm

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
to see rogues and south on because I'm

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.960 
to see rogues and south on because I'm
pretty<00:02:10.289> sure<00:02:10.500> they<00:02:10.619> don't<00:02:10.770> have

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
pretty sure they don't have

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.160 
pretty sure they don't have
improves<00:02:12.970> tell<00:02:13.180> fallon<00:02:13.510> anymore<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.990> our

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
improves tell fallon anymore that our

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.550 
improves tell fallon anymore that our
master<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.680> deception<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:16.240> stealth<00:02:17.170> overall

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
master of deception so stealth overall

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.950 
master of deception so stealth overall
