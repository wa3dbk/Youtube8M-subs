from the paddles is will help balance
those<00:00:14.830> hips<00:00:15.100> a<00:00:15.250> little<00:00:15.490> bit<00:00:15.610> more<00:00:15.850> so<00:00:16.029> if<00:00:16.119> you

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
those hips a little bit more so if you

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.029 
those hips a little bit more so if you
just<00:00:16.330> really<00:00:16.779> struggling<00:00:17.380> to<00:00:17.529> find<00:00:17.830> the

replicate that good hip position put it

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.950 
replicate that good hip position put it
in<00:00:36.010> for<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.280> next<00:00:36.519> 50<00:00:36.819> take<00:00:37.030> it<00:00:37.210> out<00:00:37.359> you<00:00:37.839> do

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
in for the next 50 take it out you do

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.869 
in for the next 50 take it out you do
those<00:00:38.140> 650s<00:00:38.859> you<00:00:38.979> should<00:00:39.190> be<00:00:39.309> able<00:00:39.399> to<00:00:39.550> feel

those 650s you should be able to feel

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:41.910 
those 650s you should be able to feel
good<00:00:40.179> balance<00:00:40.600> for<00:00:40.659> a<00:00:40.839> 50<00:00:41.229> and<00:00:41.319> then<00:00:41.469> maintain

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
good balance for a 50 and then maintain

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.500 
good balance for a 50 and then maintain
that<00:00:42.129> good<00:00:42.309> balance<00:00:42.519> without<00:00:42.999> the<00:00:43.149> hallway

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
that good balance without the hallway

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.319 
that good balance without the hallway
and<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:44.440> paddles<00:00:44.889> paddles<00:00:45.519> are<00:00:45.879> a<00:00:45.909> good<00:00:46.149> way

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
and the paddles paddles are a good way

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.410 
and the paddles paddles are a good way
to<00:00:46.389> build<00:00:46.780> up<00:00:46.929> good<00:00:47.199> shoulder<00:00:47.649> strength<00:00:48.420> as

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
to build up good shoulder strength as

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.410 
to build up good shoulder strength as
well<00:00:49.839> as<00:00:50.049> help<00:00:50.350> you<00:00:50.530> feel<00:00:50.920> how<00:00:51.609> much<00:00:51.819> water<00:00:52.149> you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
well as help you feel how much water you

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.689 
well as help you feel how much water you
can<00:00:52.600> actually<00:00:52.870> hold<00:00:53.409> with<00:00:53.679> your<00:00:53.829> hands<00:00:54.280> as<00:00:54.429> you

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
can actually hold with your hands as you

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.369 
can actually hold with your hands as you
move<00:00:54.909> their<00:00:55.120> hands<00:00:55.329> through<00:00:55.600> that's<00:00:55.899> that

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
move their hands through that's that

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.869 
move their hands through that's that
that<00:00:57.129> pool<00:00:57.429> motion<00:00:57.959> so<00:00:58.959> the<00:00:59.709> two<00:00:59.979> bad<00:01:00.219> benefits

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
that pool motion so the two bad benefits

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.239 
that pool motion so the two bad benefits
to<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.119> paddles<00:01:01.449> one<00:01:01.749> is<00:01:02.139> it's<00:01:02.709> sort<00:01:03.039> of<00:01:03.069> like

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:03.249 
to the paddles one is it's sort of like

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:05.009 
to the paddles one is it's sort of like
resistance<00:01:03.760> or<00:01:03.999> weight<00:01:04.180> training<00:01:04.420> in<00:01:04.869> the

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
resistance or weight training in the

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.690 
resistance or weight training in the
water<00:01:05.229> because<00:01:05.799> you<00:01:05.890> having<00:01:06.190> to<00:01:06.280> pull<00:01:06.520> and

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
water because you having to pull and

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.270 
water because you having to pull and
hold<00:01:06.880> more<00:01:07.270> water<00:01:07.570> as<00:01:07.900> you<00:01:08.080> move<00:01:08.290> along<00:01:08.590> and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
hold more water as you move along and

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.490 
hold more water as you move along and
then<00:01:09.910> the<00:01:10.030> second<00:01:10.450> is<00:01:10.720> that<00:01:11.170> you're<00:01:11.350> actually

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
then the second is that you're actually

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.870 
then the second is that you're actually
holding<00:01:12.370> more<00:01:13.060> water<00:01:13.360> every<00:01:14.050> time<00:01:14.290> so<00:01:14.880> another

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
holding more water every time so another

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.490 
holding more water every time so another
good<00:01:16.060> set<00:01:16.390> is<00:01:16.660> do<00:01:17.130> 650s<00:01:18.720> 250<00:01:19.720> with<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:20.080> paddles

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
good set is do 650s 250 with the paddles

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.350 
good set is do 650s 250 with the paddles
feeling<00:01:21.070> how<00:01:21.250> much<00:01:21.280> water<00:01:21.700> you<00:01:21.970> can<00:01:22.150> actually

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
feeling how much water you can actually

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.080 
feeling how much water you can actually
hold<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.230> then<00:01:23.590> a<00:01:23.620> 10<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.250> a<00:01:24.340> 50<00:01:24.670> without

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
hold and then a 10 and a 50 without

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.570 
hold and then a 10 and a 50 without
feeling<00:01:25.840> trying<00:01:26.470> to<00:01:26.650> catch<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.100> hold<00:01:27.190> as<00:01:27.400> much

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
feeling trying to catch and hold as much

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.230 
feeling trying to catch and hold as much
water

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
water

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.260 
water
so<00:01:28.540> you<00:01:28.630> can<00:01:28.870> a<00:01:29.680> good<00:01:30.340> proof<00:01:30.549> another<00:01:31.060> good

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
so you can a good proof another good

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.930 
so you can a good proof another good
progression<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.930> you<00:01:32.049> can<00:01:32.200> do<00:01:32.350> for<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.590> feel

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
progression that you can do for the feel

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.870 
progression that you can do for the feel
is<00:01:33.940> as<00:01:34.570> I<00:01:35.080> demonstrated<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.220> little<00:01:36.490> earlier

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
is as I demonstrated a little earlier

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.180 
is as I demonstrated a little earlier
you<00:01:37.090> can<00:01:37.510> do<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.630> 50<00:01:38.050> swimming<00:01:38.409> with<00:01:38.530> your<00:01:38.710> fists

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
you can do a 50 swimming with your fists

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.430 
you can do a 50 swimming with your fists
so<00:01:39.790> you're<00:01:40.150> focusing<00:01:40.690> on<00:01:40.840> catching<00:01:41.110> and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
so you're focusing on catching and

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.190 
so you're focusing on catching and
holding<00:01:41.619> the<00:01:41.979> water<00:01:42.190> with<00:01:42.460> your<00:01:42.640> forearm<00:01:43.299> then

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
holding the water with your forearm then

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.219 
holding the water with your forearm then
in<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.440> following<00:01:44.800> 50<00:01:45.340> years<00:01:45.550> of<00:01:45.759> a<00:01:46.030> okay<00:01:46.540> so

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
in the following 50 years of a okay so

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.620 
in the following 50 years of a okay so
you've<00:01:47.380> got<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.619> little<00:01:48.009> bit<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.580> your<00:01:49.270> hand

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
you've got a little bit of your hand

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.660 
you've got a little bit of your hand
catching<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.409> holding<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.800> water<00:01:50.979> but<00:01:51.369> again

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
catching and holding the water but again

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.399 
catching and holding the water but again
you're<00:01:51.880> still<00:01:52.119> focusing<00:01:52.690> on<00:01:52.840> catching<00:01:53.290> and

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
you're still focusing on catching and
