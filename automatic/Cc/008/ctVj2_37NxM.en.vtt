00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.940 
this we actually took the suit out when
in<00:02:45.879> the<00:02:45.970> water<00:02:46.180> got<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.569> nice<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:46.959> wet<00:02:47.170> hang<00:02:47.829> it

up<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.069> dry<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.579> see<00:02:49.120> how<00:02:49.180> fast<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.510> took<00:02:49.660> so

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
up to dry and see how fast it took so

00:02:50.019 --> 00:03:21.300 
up to dry and see how fast it took so
let's<00:02:50.170> check<00:02:50.319> that<00:02:50.440> out<00:02:50.500> right<00:02:50.739> now

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.500 

so<00:03:22.310> we<00:03:22.400> had<00:03:22.550> a<00:03:22.580> little<00:03:22.670> technical<00:03:22.910> difficulty

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
so we had a little technical difficulty

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.210 
so we had a little technical difficulty
coming<00:03:23.989> back<00:03:24.140> from<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.440> beach<00:03:24.560> but<00:03:24.830> um<00:03:25.069> we

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
coming back from the beach but um we

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.040 
coming back from the beach but um we
actually<00:03:25.250> got<00:03:25.879> back<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:26.480> hung<00:03:26.629> it<00:03:26.780> up<00:03:26.840> the

being soaked so let's check it out all
right<00:03:50.410> start<00:03:51.410> times<00:03:51.590> about<00:03:51.739> nine<00:03:51.950> oh<00:03:51.980> six<00:03:52.280> so

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
right start times about nine oh six so

00:03:52.489 --> 00:04:05.380
