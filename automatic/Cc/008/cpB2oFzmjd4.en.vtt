media<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:38.780> explain<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:40.250> move<00:03:40.490> up<00:03:40.700> now<00:03:40.850> the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
media and explain the move up now the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.520 
media and explain the move up now the
Eagles<00:03:41.270> wanted<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.570> keep<00:03:41.720> all<00:03:41.959> of<00:03:41.990> their<00:03:42.260> draft

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
Eagles wanted to keep all of their draft

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.949 
Eagles wanted to keep all of their draft
picks<00:03:42.910> certainly<00:03:43.910> not<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.510> case<00:03:44.660> there<00:03:44.840> they

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
picks certainly not the case there they

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.250 
picks certainly not the case there they
felt<00:03:45.170> that<00:03:45.350> row<00:03:45.590> would<00:03:46.220> not<00:03:46.430> be<00:03:46.700> there<00:03:47.000> at<00:03:47.260> 1550

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
felt that row would not be there at 1550

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.800 
felt that row would not be there at 1550
so<00:03:48.890> they<00:03:49.459> make<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.730> move<00:03:49.880> up<00:03:50.060> they<00:03:50.510> give<00:03:50.690> up

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
so they make the move up they give up

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.180 
so they make the move up they give up
the<00:03:50.900> fifth<00:03:51.110> round<00:03:51.260> draft<00:03:51.470> pick<00:03:51.709> so<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:51.950> Eagles

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
the fifth round draft pick so the Eagles

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.300 
the fifth round draft pick so the Eagles
out<00:03:52.310> of<00:03:52.790> round<00:03:53.420> number<00:03:53.600> five<00:03:53.990> tomorrow<00:03:54.530> but

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
out of round number five tomorrow but

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.090 
out of round number five tomorrow but
they<00:03:55.430> do<00:03:55.490> pick<00:03:55.790> up<00:03:55.910> a<00:03:56.060> second<00:03:56.690> pick<00:03:57.100> 191
