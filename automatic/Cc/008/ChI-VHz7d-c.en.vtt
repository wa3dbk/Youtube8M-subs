went<00:00:06.770> ahead<00:00:06.830> and<00:00:07.069> did<00:00:07.190> it<00:00:07.250> break<00:00:07.520> fully<00:00:07.850> on<00:00:07.970> my

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
went ahead and did it break fully on my

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.680 
went ahead and did it break fully on my
rear<00:00:08.299> brake<00:00:09.639> and<00:00:10.639> it's<00:00:10.820> still<00:00:11.120> pretty<00:00:11.389> mushy

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
rear brake and it's still pretty mushy

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.509 
rear brake and it's still pretty mushy
so<00:00:12.019> I<00:00:12.080> think<00:00:12.290> I<00:00:12.349> needed<00:00:12.530> to<00:00:12.650> take<00:00:12.800> it<00:00:12.980> apart<00:00:13.280> and

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
so I think I needed to take it apart and

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.999 
so I think I needed to take it apart and
Reba<00:00:14.389> leave<00:00:14.540> it<00:00:14.690> there's<00:00:15.349> probably<00:00:15.469> some<00:00:15.860> more

and I got a ton of hair out
then<00:00:55.400> the<00:00:55.550> system<00:00:55.880> goes<00:00:56.090> from<00:00:56.510> below<00:00:57.350> of<00:00:57.560> the

and then goes all the way back down to
the<00:01:11.080> foot

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
the foot

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.330 
the foot

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
and the master cylinder

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.789 
and the master cylinder
and<00:01:16.429> that<00:01:16.850> seems<00:01:17.659> to<00:01:17.780> me<00:01:18.020> like<00:01:18.049> a<00:01:18.289> pretty

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
and that seems to me like a pretty

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.010 
and that seems to me like a pretty
stupid<00:01:20.109> pretty<00:01:21.109> stupid<00:01:21.409> layout<00:01:21.950> for<00:01:22.369> a

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
stupid pretty stupid layout for a

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.899 
stupid pretty stupid layout for a
braking<00:01:24.020> system<00:01:24.469> because<00:01:24.859> that's<00:01:25.549> a<00:01:25.640> huge

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
braking system because that's a huge

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.800 
braking system because that's a huge
loop<00:01:26.179> that<00:01:26.840> can<00:01:26.990> collect<00:01:27.289> air<00:01:27.500> bubbles<00:01:27.859> and<00:01:28.130> I

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
loop that can collect air bubbles and I

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.520 
loop that can collect air bubbles and I
don't<00:01:29.810> recall<00:01:29.990> seeing<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.560> bleeder<00:01:32.110> when<00:01:33.110> I

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
don't recall seeing a bleeder when I

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.749 
don't recall seeing a bleeder when I
took<00:01:33.649> everything<00:01:34.219> off<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:36.520> unless<00:01:37.520> they're

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
took everything off so unless they're

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.330 
took everything off so unless they're
expecting<00:01:38.299> us<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.630> like<00:01:38.810> crack<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.590> lines<00:01:39.859> and

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
expecting us to like crack the lines and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.039 
expecting us to like crack the lines and
completely<00:01:40.700> disassemble<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.509> bike<00:01:41.719> every

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
completely disassemble the bike every

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.039 
completely disassemble the bike every
time<00:01:42.259> we<00:01:42.439> need<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.709> bleed<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.100> brakes<00:01:43.399> I

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
time we need to bleed the brakes I

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.219 
time we need to bleed the brakes I
really<00:01:45.049> hope<00:01:45.229> that<00:01:45.380> Ducati<00:01:45.740> has<00:01:46.039> some<00:01:46.280> kind<00:01:46.490> of

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
really hope that Ducati has some kind of

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.130 
really hope that Ducati has some kind of
solution<00:01:48.729> like<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.759> bolt<00:01:50.090> on<00:01:50.239> bleeder<00:01:50.780> nipple

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
solution like a bolt on bleeder nipple

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.309 
solution like a bolt on bleeder nipple
or<00:01:51.259> something<00:01:51.770> because<00:01:52.310> it's<00:01:52.909> just<00:01:53.569> bleeding

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
or something because it's just bleeding

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.779 
or something because it's just bleeding
these<00:01:54.560> brakes<00:01:54.829> is<00:01:55.009> a<00:01:55.039> real<00:01:55.250> pain<00:01:55.429> in<00:01:55.489> the<00:01:55.670> ass<00:01:55.819> I

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
these brakes is a real pain in the ass I

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.130 
these brakes is a real pain in the ass I
don't<00:01:58.789> think<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.030> mechanics<00:01:59.149> that<00:01:59.989> the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
don't think the mechanics that the

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.240 
don't think the mechanics that the
dealerships<00:02:00.679> really<00:02:01.009> have<00:02:01.569> an<00:02:02.920> easy<00:02:03.920> mode

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
dealerships really have an easy mode

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.190 
dealerships really have an easy mode
method<00:02:04.759> to<00:02:04.879> do<00:02:05.030> it

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
method to do it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.600 
method to do it
so<00:02:07.189> what<00:02:07.490> i<00:02:07.520> did<00:02:07.640> was<00:02:08.450> i<00:02:08.660> bought<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:09.610> slingshot

put the speed bleeder into the cab
and<00:02:33.180> then<00:02:33.510> what<00:02:33.690> I'm<00:02:33.780> going<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.930> do<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.560> crack

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
and then what I'm going to do is crack

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.730 
and then what I'm going to do is crack
the<00:02:35.400> bleeder<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.030> caliber

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
the bleeder on the caliber

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.650 
the bleeder on the caliber
after<00:02:37.950> attaching<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.520> host<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.120> in<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.450> bottle

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660

of

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.880 

and<00:02:44.000> then<00:02:44.570> I'm<00:02:44.660> going<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.810> use<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.990> mityvac<00:02:45.620> on

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
and then I'm going to use a mityvac on

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.580 
and then I'm going to use a mityvac on
the<00:02:46.100> master<00:02:46.490> cylinder<00:02:46.730> reservoir<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:48.260> suck

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
the master cylinder reservoir to suck

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.480 
the master cylinder reservoir to suck
the<00:02:48.770> fluid

the fluid

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.000 
the fluid
from<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.760> caliber<00:02:50.380> all<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.620> way<00:02:51.740> up<00:02:51.860> the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
from the caliber all the way up the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.920 
from the caliber all the way up the
lines

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
lines

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.780 
lines
now<00:02:54.409> normally<00:02:54.890> what<00:02:55.040> i<00:02:55.069> would<00:02:55.280> do<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.579> use<00:02:55.760> a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
now normally what i would do is use a

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.640 
now normally what i would do is use a
reverse<00:02:56.180> bill<00:02:56.480> injector<00:02:57.049> which<00:02:57.260> is<00:02:57.409> kind<00:02:57.590> of

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
reverse bill injector which is kind of

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.220 
reverse bill injector which is kind of
like<00:02:57.769> a<00:02:57.829> little<00:02:58.099> squirt<00:02:58.400> gun<00:02:58.640> thing<00:02:59.079> kind<00:03:00.079> of<00:03:00.170> a

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
like a little squirt gun thing kind of a

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.440 
like a little squirt gun thing kind of a
syringe

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
syringe

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.770 
syringe
to<00:03:03.319> pump<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.800> fluid<00:03:03.980> from<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.489> caliper<00:03:04.970> up<00:03:05.300> to

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
to pump the fluid from the caliper up to

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.680 
to pump the fluid from the caliper up to
the<00:03:05.900> reservoir<00:03:06.430> but<00:03:07.430> unfortunately<00:03:08.420> the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
the reservoir but unfortunately the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.229 
the reservoir but unfortunately the
nipple<00:03:09.080> that's<00:03:09.980> on<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.280> caliper<00:03:10.790> is<00:03:10.910> kind<00:03:11.120> of

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
nipple that's on the caliper is kind of

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.880 
nipple that's on the caliper is kind of
leaky<00:03:11.629> and<00:03:11.870> doesn't<00:03:12.140> hold<00:03:12.319> enough<00:03:12.590> pressure

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
leaky and doesn't hold enough pressure

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.380 
leaky and doesn't hold enough pressure
so<00:03:13.989> when<00:03:14.989> I<00:03:15.019> try<00:03:15.349> to<00:03:15.379> do<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.860> before<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.640> just

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
so when I try to do it before it just

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.750 
so when I try to do it before it just
ended<00:03:17.660> up<00:03:17.780> like<00:03:18.310> dripping<00:03:19.310> fluid<00:03:19.640> all<00:03:19.730> over

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
ended up like dripping fluid all over

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
ended up like dripping fluid all over
the<00:03:20.000> place<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.390> was<00:03:20.510> like<00:03:20.630> just<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:21.140> mess<00:03:22.360> so<00:03:23.360> I

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
the place it was like just a mess so I

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.290 
the place it was like just a mess so I
think<00:03:24.319> sucking<00:03:24.980> fluid<00:03:25.459> rather<00:03:25.790> than<00:03:26.030> pushing

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
think sucking fluid rather than pushing

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.720 
think sucking fluid rather than pushing
it<00:03:26.599> is<00:03:26.750> going<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.050> be<00:03:27.110> in<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.290> safer<00:03:27.680> out<00:03:27.800> and

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.979 

hopefully<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:32.090> works<00:03:32.209> I'm<00:03:32.540> in<00:03:32.690> awe<00:03:32.780> i'm<00:03:32.840> going

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
hopefully it works I'm in awe i'm going

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.670 
hopefully it works I'm in awe i'm going
to<00:03:33.049> try<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.290> out<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.880> can't<00:03:34.880> hurt<00:03:35.560> it's<00:03:36.560> not

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
to try it out and can't hurt it's not

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.199 
to try it out and can't hurt it's not
going<00:03:36.799> to<00:03:36.890> be<00:03:36.950> any<00:03:37.069> worse<00:03:37.310> than<00:03:37.340> my<00:03:37.700> currently

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
going to be any worse than my currently

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.089 
going to be any worse than my currently
crappy<00:03:38.480> mushy<00:03:38.780> pedal<00:03:40.690> but<00:03:41.690> i<00:03:42.140> was<00:03:42.680> doing<00:03:42.950> some

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
crappy mushy pedal but i was doing some

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.339 
crappy mushy pedal but i was doing some
research<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.700> saw<00:03:43.910> on<00:03:44.360> other<00:03:44.750> forms<00:03:45.230> of

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
research and saw on other forms of

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:46.780 
research and saw on other forms of
multistrada<00:03:45.920> forums<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.489> they're<00:03:46.670> having

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.750 

the<00:03:50.220> Multistrada<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.100> think<00:03:53.130> they<00:03:53.520> said

the Multistrada so and I think they said
there's<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.090> fix<00:03:54.360> that<00:03:54.690> if<00:03:54.840> people<00:03:55.170> go<00:03:55.710> into

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
there's a fix that if people go into

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.340 
there's a fix that if people go into
their<00:03:56.130> dealership<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:57.060> ducati<00:03:57.840> has<00:03:58.020> approved

their dealership the ducati has approved
a<00:03:58.440> certain<00:03:58.740> fix<00:03:58.980> for<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.400> kit<00:03:59.670> but<00:04:00.630> even<00:04:00.900> that

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
a certain fix for a kit but even that

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.380 
a certain fix for a kit but even that
doesn't<00:04:01.230> work<00:04:01.530> quite<00:04:01.770> all<00:04:02.550> that<00:04:02.790> well<00:04:02.970> you

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
doesn't work quite all that well you

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.850 
doesn't work quite all that well you
have<00:04:03.540> yet<00:04:03.750> up<00:04:03.870> with<00:04:03.990> the<00:04:04.080> same<00:04:04.230> result<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.800> a

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
have yet up with the same result of a

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.030 
have yet up with the same result of a
bushy<00:04:05.040> brake<00:04:05.340> pedal

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
bushy brake pedal

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.670 
bushy brake pedal
so

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
so

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.890 
so
I'm<00:04:10.159> going<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.370> try<00:04:10.579> to<00:04:10.609> cap<00:04:10.939> and<00:04:11.689> if<00:04:11.780> that

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
I'm going to try to cap and if that

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.690 
I'm going to try to cap and if that
takes<00:04:12.140> care<00:04:12.409> of<00:04:12.469> it<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:12.890> makes<00:04:13.099> bleeding

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
takes care of it and makes bleeding

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.310 
takes care of it and makes bleeding
really<00:04:13.879> easy<00:04:14.180> then<00:04:14.769> that's<00:04:15.769> enough<00:04:16.039> for<00:04:16.160> me

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.990 

and<00:04:20.650> then<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.130> other<00:04:21.280> thing<00:04:21.370> I<00:04:21.670> did<00:04:21.820> was<00:04:21.940> a

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
and then the other thing I did was a

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.030 
and then the other thing I did was a
chain<00:04:22.300> adjustment<00:04:22.750> you<00:04:23.650> might<00:04:23.830> notice

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
chain adjustment you might notice

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.580 
chain adjustment you might notice
there's<00:04:24.310> no<00:04:24.430> clunking<00:04:24.970> noise<00:04:25.260> like<00:04:26.260> a<00:04:26.290> wood

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
there's no clunking noise like a wood

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.130 
there's no clunking noise like a wood
block<00:04:26.970> it's<00:04:27.970> because<00:04:28.240> I<00:04:28.270> adjusted<00:04:28.750> my<00:04:28.810> chain

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
block it's because I adjusted my chain

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.710 
block it's because I adjusted my chain
last<00:04:29.380> night<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.850> recommended<00:04:31.360> speck<00:04:31.690> of

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
last night to the recommended speck of

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.150 
last night to the recommended speck of
nine<00:04:32.230> to<00:04:32.440> 11<00:04:32.800> millimeters<00:04:33.340> and<00:04:35.040> that<00:04:36.040> was

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
nine to 11 millimeters and that was

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.740 
nine to 11 millimeters and that was
pretty<00:04:36.310> easy<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.850> two<00:04:37.000> pinch<00:04:37.240> bolts<00:04:37.630> on<00:04:37.720> the

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
pretty easy the two pinch bolts on the

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.380 
pretty easy the two pinch bolts on the
swing<00:04:38.050> arm<00:04:38.230> we're<00:04:39.220> easy<00:04:39.430> to<00:04:39.640> break<00:04:39.820> loose<00:04:40.090> and

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
swing arm we're easy to break loose and

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:47.580 
swing arm we're easy to break loose and
tighten<00:04:40.990> back<00:04:41.140> up<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:44.280> oddly<00:04:45.280> enough<00:04:46.590> the

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
tighten back up and oddly enough the

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.520 
tighten back up and oddly enough the
bike<00:04:47.800> doesn't<00:04:48.070> have<00:04:48.340> a<00:04:48.370> lot<00:04:48.670> of<00:04:48.700> static<00:04:49.000> sag

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
bike doesn't have a lot of static sag

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.570 
bike doesn't have a lot of static sag
which<00:04:50.530> is<00:04:50.710> when<00:04:50.950> it's<00:04:51.100> just<00:04:51.220> sitting<00:04:51.340> there

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
which is when it's just sitting there

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.340 
which is when it's just sitting there
with<00:04:51.880> nobody<00:04:52.030> sitting<00:04:52.420> on<00:04:52.630> it<00:04:55.170> some<00:04:56.170> bikes

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
with nobody sitting on it some bikes

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.960 
with nobody sitting on it some bikes
have<00:04:56.560> a<00:04:56.590> lot<00:04:56.800> of<00:04:56.830> sag<00:04:57.130> some<00:04:57.400> bikes<00:04:57.610> hit<00:04:57.790> they

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
have a lot of sag some bikes hit they

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.310 
have a lot of sag some bikes hit they
don't<00:04:58.180> have<00:04:58.330> much<00:04:58.570> at<00:04:58.720> all<00:04:58.810> when<00:04:59.080> they're<00:04:59.200> just

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
don't have much at all when they're just

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.910 
don't have much at all when they're just
sitting<00:04:59.620> on<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.770> ground

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
sitting on the ground

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.460 
sitting on the ground
you<00:05:01.460> can<00:05:01.580> check<00:05:01.730> your<00:05:01.790> static<00:05:02.300> sag<00:05:02.540> by<00:05:02.810> pulling

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
you can check your static sag by pulling

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.490 
you can check your static sag by pulling
up<00:05:03.560> on<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.860> rear<00:05:04.040> area<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.550> your<00:05:04.670> bike<00:05:05.380> for<00:05:06.380> the

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
up on the rear area of your bike for the

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.930 
up on the rear area of your bike for the
rear<00:05:06.650> shock<00:05:06.920> if<00:05:07.190> you're<00:05:07.340> doing<00:05:07.520> swingarm

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
rear shock if you're doing swingarm

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.290 
rear shock if you're doing swingarm
stuff

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
stuff

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.619 
stuff
and<00:05:09.479> if<00:05:09.629> the<00:05:09.750> tail<00:05:09.960> lifts<00:05:10.440> at<00:05:10.590> all<00:05:11.180> then<00:05:12.180> you<00:05:12.449> do

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:12.629 
and if the tail lifts at all then you do

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:14.990 
and if the tail lifts at all then you do
have<00:05:12.659> some<00:05:13.050> static<00:05:13.440> sag<00:05:13.680> it's<00:05:14.580> not<00:05:14.699> a<00:05:14.729> bad

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
have some static sag it's not a bad

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.420 
have some static sag it's not a bad
thing<00:05:15.259> too<00:05:16.259> much<00:05:16.440> static<00:05:16.650> sag<00:05:17.009> is<00:05:17.159> a<00:05:17.220> bad<00:05:17.400> thing

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
thing too much static sag is a bad thing

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.559 
thing too much static sag is a bad thing
but<00:05:17.879> a<00:05:17.940> little<00:05:18.240> bit

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
but a little bit

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:20.050 
but a little bit
isn't<00:05:19.259> a<00:05:19.289> big<00:05:19.469> deal

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
isn't a big deal

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.280 
isn't a big deal
and<00:05:20.270> it's<00:05:20.450> actually<00:05:20.780> kind<00:05:20.960> of<00:05:20.990> a<00:05:21.080> good<00:05:21.230> thing

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
and it's actually kind of a good thing

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.260 
and it's actually kind of a good thing
for<00:05:21.710> suspension<00:05:22.370> travel<00:05:22.700> when<00:05:22.970> you're<00:05:23.090> going

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
for suspension travel when you're going

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.980 
for suspension travel when you're going
over<00:05:23.450> bumps

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
over bumps

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.600 
over bumps
to<00:05:25.560> keep<00:05:25.770> tragic

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
to keep tragic

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.330 
to keep tragic
the<00:05:28.419> diabolo<00:05:28.719> at<00:05:29.319> least<00:05:29.500> my<00:05:29.650> bike<00:05:29.919> does<00:05:30.189> not

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
the diabolo at least my bike does not

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.379 
the diabolo at least my bike does not
have<00:05:30.550> much<00:05:30.759> static<00:05:31.000> sag<00:05:31.389> at<00:05:31.539> all<00:05:32.159> so<00:05:33.159> the<00:05:34.150> chain

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
have much static sag at all so the chain

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.879 
have much static sag at all so the chain
adjustment<00:05:34.840> was<00:05:35.050> actually<00:05:35.530> really

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
adjustment was actually really

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.739 
adjustment was actually really
once<00:05:37.370> I<00:05:37.550> did<00:05:37.729> it<00:05:37.849> with<00:05:37.969> the<00:05:38.090> bike<00:05:38.270> on<00:05:38.449> its<00:05:38.569> side

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:38.749 
once I did it with the bike on its side

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:41.679 
once I did it with the bike on its side
stand<00:05:39.110> like<00:05:39.379> the<00:05:39.499> manual<00:05:39.860> recommends<00:05:40.430> i<00:05:40.759> put

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:41.689 
stand like the manual recommends i put

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:44.719 
stand like the manual recommends i put
it<00:05:41.810> up<00:05:41.870> on<00:05:42.020> my<00:05:42.169> motor<00:05:42.379> manufacturing<00:05:43.219> stand

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
it up on my motor manufacturing stand

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.260 
it up on my motor manufacturing stand
and<00:05:44.849> the<00:05:45.389> setting<00:05:45.919> after<00:05:46.919> pinching<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:47.879> the

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
and the setting after pinching the the

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.320 
and the setting after pinching the the
pinch<00:05:48.479> sir<00:05:48.749> torquing<00:05:49.439> down<00:05:49.559> the<00:05:49.680> pinch<00:05:49.889> bolts

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
pinch sir torquing down the pinch bolts

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.909 
pinch sir torquing down the pinch bolts
which<00:05:51.330> on<00:05:51.629> the<00:05:51.809> speed<00:05:52.020> triple<00:05:52.289> oddly<00:05:52.710> enough

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
which on the speed triple oddly enough

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.480 
which on the speed triple oddly enough
tightens<00:05:53.339> up<00:05:53.490> the<00:05:53.699> chain<00:05:53.939> and<00:05:55.249> you<00:05:56.249> have<00:05:56.370> to

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
tightens up the chain and you have to

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.860 
tightens up the chain and you have to
actually<00:05:56.610> adjust<00:05:57.120> it<00:05:57.300> to<00:05:57.330> be<00:05:57.509> a<00:05:57.539> little<00:05:57.689> bit

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
actually adjust it to be a little bit

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.649 
actually adjust it to be a little bit
loose<00:05:58.139> before<00:05:58.409> you<00:05:58.650> tighten<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:59.009> pinch<00:05:59.219> bolts

00:05:59.649 --> 00:05:59.659 
loose before you tighten the pinch bolts

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.570 
loose before you tighten the pinch bolts
well<00:06:00.659> on<00:06:00.749> the<00:06:00.839> diavel<00:06:01.080> I<00:06:01.559> tighten<00:06:02.370> up<00:06:02.430> the

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
well on the diavel I tighten up the

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.269 
well on the diavel I tighten up the
pinch<00:06:02.759> bolts<00:06:03.089> and<00:06:03.210> nothing<00:06:03.449> changed<00:06:03.870> so

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:04.279 
pinch bolts and nothing changed so

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:07.239 
pinch bolts and nothing changed so
that's<00:06:05.279> good<00:06:05.580> i<00:06:05.819> put<00:06:06.089> it<00:06:06.180> up<00:06:06.240> on<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.479> stand<00:06:06.749> and

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:07.249 
that's good i put it up on the stand and

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:09.529 
that's good i put it up on the stand and
it<00:06:08.249> was<00:06:08.339> still<00:06:08.550> the<00:06:08.669> same<00:06:08.849> measurement<00:06:09.330> just

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
it was still the same measurement just

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:15.469 
it was still the same measurement just
below<00:06:09.749> half<00:06:09.990> an<00:06:10.169> inch<00:06:11.569> between<00:06:12.710> just<00:06:14.120> say<00:06:15.120> like

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
below half an inch between just say like

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.589 
below half an inch between just say like
a<00:06:15.689> third<00:06:15.990> of<00:06:16.080> an<00:06:16.199> inch<00:06:17.360> kind<00:06:18.360> of<00:06:18.419> a<00:06:18.479> goofy

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
a third of an inch kind of a goofy

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:19.939 
a third of an inch kind of a goofy
measurement<00:06:19.199> but<00:06:19.289> that's<00:06:19.469> got<00:06:19.620> to<00:06:19.740> be<00:06:19.800> the

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:19.949 
measurement but that's got to be the

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:22.189 
measurement but that's got to be the
that's<00:06:20.309> the<00:06:20.399> conversion<00:06:20.999> of<00:06:21.389> nine<00:06:21.599> to<00:06:21.870> 11

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 
that's the conversion of nine to 11

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.369 
that's the conversion of nine to 11
millimeters<00:06:22.710> in<00:06:23.309> standard<00:06:24.080> that<00:06:25.080> didn't<00:06:25.259> have

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:25.379 
millimeters in standard that didn't have

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:28.579 
millimeters in standard that didn't have
a<00:06:25.639> metric<00:06:26.639> ruler<00:06:27.240> or<00:06:27.389> anything<00:06:27.899> last<00:06:28.139> night<00:06:28.259> so

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:28.589 
a metric ruler or anything last night so

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:31.010 
a metric ruler or anything last night so
I<00:06:29.580> just<00:06:29.729> used<00:06:29.939> a<00:06:30.059> sharpie<00:06:30.300> and<00:06:30.479> measured<00:06:30.870> it

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
I just used a sharpie and measured it

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.499 
I just used a sharpie and measured it
out<00:06:31.110> marked<00:06:32.009> out<00:06:32.129> though<00:06:32.879> that<00:06:32.909> I<00:06:33.149> want<00:06:33.389> to<00:06:33.419> be

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:33.509 
out marked out though that I want to be

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.159 
out marked out though that I want to be
adjusted<00:06:33.990> to<00:06:35.180> so<00:06:36.180> that<00:06:36.449> completely<00:06:36.809> got<00:06:37.050> rid

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
adjusted to so that completely got rid

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.090 
adjusted to so that completely got rid
of<00:06:37.229> the<00:06:37.349> chain<00:06:37.589> slap

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.360 

and<00:06:41.370> I<00:06:42.180> think<00:06:42.300> because<00:06:43.110> the<00:06:43.410> of<00:06:43.680> this<00:06:43.950> the

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
and I think because the of this the

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.300 
and I think because the of this the
geometry<00:06:45.150> of<00:06:45.240> the<00:06:45.300> swing<00:06:45.630> arm<00:06:45.810> it<00:06:46.710> looks<00:06:46.860> like

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
geometry of the swing arm it looks like

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.700 
geometry of the swing arm it looks like
the<00:06:47.490> front<00:06:47.700> the<00:06:47.970> sprocket<00:06:48.750> the<00:06:49.440> front

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
the front the sprocket the front

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.490 
the front the sprocket the front
sprocket<00:06:50.190> is<00:06:50.220> actually<00:06:50.820> at<00:06:51.810> it<00:06:51.960> directly<00:06:52.320> in

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 
sprocket is actually at it directly in

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.890 
sprocket is actually at it directly in
line<00:06:52.530> with<00:06:52.830> the<00:06:53.160> swing<00:06:53.430> arm<00:06:53.720> so<00:06:54.720> what<00:06:54.870> that

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 
line with the swing arm so what that

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.750 
line with the swing arm so what that
means<00:06:55.290> is<00:06:55.560> as<00:06:55.890> you're<00:06:56.100> compressing<00:06:56.430> and

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:56.760 
means is as you're compressing and

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.900 
means is as you're compressing and
unloading<00:06:57.270> the<00:06:57.990> rear<00:06:58.500> shock<00:06:58.830> and<00:06:59.130> the<00:06:59.190> swing

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910 
unloading the rear shock and the swing

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.060 
unloading the rear shock and the swing
arms<00:07:00.120> going<00:07:00.300> up<00:07:00.510> and<00:07:00.630> down<00:07:00.720> it's<00:07:01.230> not<00:07:01.500> causing

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
arms going up and down it's not causing

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.010 
arms going up and down it's not causing
the<00:07:02.340> chain<00:07:02.630> to<00:07:03.630> get<00:07:03.810> much<00:07:04.080> tighter<00:07:04.410> or<00:07:04.710> looser

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
the chain to get much tighter or looser

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.900 
the chain to get much tighter or looser
unlike<00:07:07.020> many<00:07:07.320> other<00:07:07.530> bikes<00:07:07.830> that<00:07:08.070> form<00:07:08.610> kind

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:08.910 
unlike many other bikes that form kind

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.890 
unlike many other bikes that form kind
of<00:07:09.030> a<00:07:09.180> an<00:07:09.750> angle<00:07:11.240> with<00:07:12.240> their<00:07:12.450> stereo<00:07:12.750> with

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 
of a an angle with their stereo with

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.839 
of a an angle with their stereo with
their<00:07:13.160> suspension<00:07:14.160> geometry<00:07:14.250> at<00:07:14.700> the<00:07:14.790> rear

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:16.849 
their suspension geometry at the rear

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:18.459 
their suspension geometry at the rear
basically<00:07:17.659> what<00:07:17.779> you<00:07:17.869> want<00:07:18.020> to<00:07:18.080> look<00:07:18.199> at<00:07:18.349> the

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:18.469 
basically what you want to look at the

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:21.129 
basically what you want to look at the
figure<00:07:18.709> that<00:07:18.889> out<00:07:18.949> is<00:07:19.509> the<00:07:20.509> the<00:07:20.719> center<00:07:20.990> of<00:07:21.050> the

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:21.139 
figure that out is the the center of the

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:23.439 
figure that out is the the center of the
front<00:07:21.319> sprocket<00:07:21.889> and<00:07:22.009> then<00:07:22.909> the<00:07:23.029> center<00:07:23.419> of

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:23.449 
front sprocket and then the center of

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:26.350 
front sprocket and then the center of
the<00:07:24.050> axle<00:07:25.009> that<00:07:25.249> the<00:07:25.339> swing<00:07:25.610> arm<00:07:25.759> pivots<00:07:26.209> on

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:26.360 
the axle that the swing arm pivots on

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.589 
the axle that the swing arm pivots on
and<00:07:26.599> on<00:07:26.659> the<00:07:26.779> Diablo<00:07:27.020> it's<00:07:27.469> the<00:07:27.649> lowest<00:07:28.599> lowest

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 
and on the Diablo it's the lowest lowest

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:32.469 
and on the Diablo it's the lowest lowest
bid<00:07:29.929> on<00:07:30.020> the<00:07:30.139> frame<00:07:30.819> in<00:07:31.819> the<00:07:31.909> black<00:07:32.119> part<00:07:32.419> of

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 
bid on the frame in the black part of

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:34.990 
bid on the frame in the black part of
the<00:07:32.569> frame

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.570 

and

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:38.580 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.179 

and<00:07:39.270> then<00:07:39.569> look<00:07:39.900> at<00:07:39.990> the<00:07:40.050> center<00:07:40.650> of<00:07:40.680> the<00:07:41.039> rear

00:07:41.179 --> 00:07:41.189 
and then look at the center of the rear

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:46.119 
and then look at the center of the rear
hub<00:07:41.520> and<00:07:42.389> if<00:07:42.990> those<00:07:43.110> all<00:07:43.349> line<00:07:43.620> up<00:07:43.650> with<00:07:44.639> a

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:46.129 
hub and if those all line up with a

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:50.330 
hub and if those all line up with a
straight<00:07:47.129> edge<00:07:47.509> then<00:07:48.919> you're<00:07:49.919> not<00:07:49.949> going<00:07:50.250> to

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.340 
straight edge then you're not going to

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.779 
straight edge then you're not going to
have<00:07:50.460> to<00:07:50.610> do<00:07:50.759> a<00:07:50.789> whole<00:07:50.879> lot<00:07:51.090> of<00:07:52.639> you<00:07:53.639> probably

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:53.789 
have to do a whole lot of you probably

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:56.330 
have to do a whole lot of you probably
won't<00:07:54.150> need<00:07:54.210> a<00:07:54.330> ton<00:07:54.629> of<00:07:54.800> slack<00:07:55.800> in<00:07:55.830> your<00:07:56.129> chain

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 
won't need a ton of slack in your chain

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.580 
won't need a ton of slack in your chain
unless<00:07:57.240> your<00:07:57.419> swing<00:07:57.599> arm<00:07:57.750> travels<00:07:58.050> a<00:07:58.139> lot<00:07:58.289> then

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:58.590 
unless your swing arm travels a lot then

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.969 
unless your swing arm travels a lot then
of<00:07:58.710> course<00:07:58.889> it's<00:07:59.039> going<00:07:59.069> to<00:07:59.219> change<00:08:00.530> but<00:08:01.530> this

00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:01.979 
of course it's going to change but this

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:05.779 
of course it's going to change but this
bike<00:08:02.189> seems<00:08:02.580> pretty<00:08:02.789> good<00:08:02.909> for<00:08:03.240> that<00:08:04.789> that

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:05.789 
bike seems pretty good for that that

00:08:05.789 --> 00:08:07.399 
bike seems pretty good for that that
lady<00:08:05.969> was<00:08:06.030> laughing<00:08:06.479> as<00:08:06.599> she<00:08:06.719> made<00:08:06.960> a<00:08:06.990> messed

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:07.409 
lady was laughing as she made a messed

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:13.039 
lady was laughing as she made a messed
up<00:08:07.560> turn<00:08:09.080> there's<00:08:10.080> the<00:08:10.289> turn<00:08:10.439> lane<00:08:10.469> over<00:08:10.889> there
