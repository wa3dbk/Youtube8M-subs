00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:13.890
 yes yes we are doing this here now 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.640
 small experiment we do it like this 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.710
 say 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.990
 So we have some here and one 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.670
 vacuum cleaner 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.270
 Now you can definitely think what 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.270
 we would 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.310
 here are also a very small bit 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:42.510
 Change was much worse 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:45.329
 seriously do something yes we wanted 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.480
 also show the photo with the whole 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.399
 swirls spread over a whole room 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.239
 and that's why our instagram needs 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:59.100
 I took it I can already say so 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:05.870
 mine as likely stroked 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.870
 the 12 ok and there how tell me shortly thereafter 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.560
 so the upper which the lower now 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.560
 is it really written 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:25.770
 okay then you can find us then and 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.979
 we might follow and on my 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.100
 channel so the top I have again 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.000
 a photo of how the whole looked here 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.090
 but that's not all 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.180
 room in the photo legal room 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.650
 for example, there it was 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:53.909
 full as in the photo and well then 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:02:01.100
 let's start hello that's one 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.100
 taste best the death 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.000
 bad 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.820
 be very close 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:18.470
 if yes may and look at the lexika 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.210
 casual jessica liening canal
