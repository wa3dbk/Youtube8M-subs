00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:27.999 
joints or anything like that but I think

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:31.499 
joints or anything like that but I think
detailing<00:05:28.999> wise<00:05:29.149> he<00:05:29.360> looks<00:05:29.539> pretty<00:05:29.659> decent

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
detailing wise he looks pretty decent

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.149 
detailing wise he looks pretty decent
now<00:05:32.509> he<00:05:32.629> has<00:05:32.809> his<00:05:32.839> cape<00:05:33.259> the<00:05:33.770> interesting

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
now he has his cape the interesting

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:35.409 
now he has his cape the interesting
thing<00:05:34.399> about<00:05:34.430> the<00:05:34.699> cape<00:05:34.879> is<00:05:35.029> actually<00:05:35.330> the

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
thing about the cape is actually the

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.320 
thing about the cape is actually the
cape<00:05:35.659> is<00:05:35.839> not<00:05:36.110> separate<00:05:36.800> it's<00:05:37.089> molded<00:05:38.089> or

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
cape is not separate it's molded or

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.200 
cape is not separate it's molded or
fastened<00:05:39.229> to<00:05:39.469> his<00:05:39.589> back<00:05:39.889> I<00:05:40.219> guess<00:05:40.699> the<00:05:40.879> idea<00:05:40.909> is

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
fastened to his back I guess the idea is

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.149 
fastened to his back I guess the idea is
so<00:05:41.449> that<00:05:41.629> his<00:05:41.779> cape<00:05:42.020> would<00:05:42.169> sit<00:05:42.469> straight<00:05:42.800> and

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
so that his cape would sit straight and

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.209 
so that his cape would sit straight and
it<00:05:43.580> wouldn't<00:05:43.849> go<00:05:43.999> off<00:05:44.210> or<00:05:44.689> anything<00:05:44.870> like<00:05:45.110> that

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:45.219 
it wouldn't go off or anything like that

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:47.619 
it wouldn't go off or anything like that
and<00:05:46.219> I'm<00:05:46.370> fine<00:05:46.399> with<00:05:46.669> that<00:05:46.849> I<00:05:46.969> mean<00:05:47.149> again<00:05:47.389> I'm

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:47.629 
and I'm fine with that I mean again I'm

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:49.209 
and I'm fine with that I mean again I'm
only<00:05:47.809> gonna<00:05:48.020> have<00:05:48.229> these<00:05:48.379> guys<00:05:48.589> on<00:05:48.770> display<00:05:49.159> so
