00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
part of the computer the confusing part

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.490 
part of the computer the confusing part
of<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.430> hurricane<00:01:27.850> is<00:01:28.360> all<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.840> limbs<00:01:29.080> moving

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
of the hurricane is all the limbs moving

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
of the hurricane is all the limbs moving
back<00:01:29.650> and<00:01:29.860> forth<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:31.210> know<00:01:31.800> so<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:33.220> second

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
back and forth you know so the second

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.640 
back and forth you know so the second
step<00:01:33.730> is<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.120> just<00:01:34.270> gonna<00:01:34.450> pull<00:01:34.660> it<00:01:34.780> out<00:01:34.900> and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
step is you just gonna pull it out and

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.710 
step is you just gonna pull it out and
when<00:01:35.830> you<00:01:35.950> pull<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.250> ball<00:01:36.430> out<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:37.090> know<00:01:37.210> you

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
when you pull the ball out you know you

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.570 
when you pull the ball out you know you
have<00:01:37.870> in<00:01:38.050> your<00:01:38.170> right<00:01:38.320> hand<00:01:38.530> if<00:01:39.190> you<00:01:39.280> want<00:01:39.490> to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
have in your right hand if you want to

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.040 
have in your right hand if you want to
put<00:01:39.820> most<00:01:40.090> of<00:01:40.270> your<00:01:40.330> weight<00:01:40.450> on<00:01:40.870> your<00:01:40.990> right

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
put most of your weight on your right

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.010 
put most of your weight on your right
side<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:42.460> adds<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.150> effect<00:01:43.420> of<00:01:43.570> your<00:01:43.660> going

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
side that adds the effect of your going

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.740 
side that adds the effect of your going
that<00:01:44.170> way<00:01:44.350> so<00:01:44.619> that's<00:01:44.740> part<00:01:45.040> of<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.220> move<00:01:45.369> too

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
that way so that's part of the move too

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.560 
that way so that's part of the move too
so<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:47.080> pop<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:47.500> out<00:01:47.619> and<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:49.090> put<00:01:49.119> most<00:01:49.450> of

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
so you pop it out and you put most of

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.600 
so you pop it out and you put most of
your<00:01:49.630> weight<00:01:49.720> on<00:01:49.840> this<00:01:50.110> side<00:01:50.320> so<00:01:51.070> after<00:01:51.400> you<00:01:51.490> do

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
your weight on this side so after you do

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.640 
your weight on this side so after you do
that<00:01:51.640> you're<00:01:52.479> gonna<00:01:52.600> shift<00:01:53.080> it<00:01:53.200> back<00:01:53.290> over<00:01:53.500> to

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
that you're gonna shift it back over to

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.620 
that you're gonna shift it back over to
this<00:01:53.860> side<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.850> when<00:01:54.970> you<00:01:55.030> shift<00:01:55.210> back<00:01:55.300> you're

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
this side and when you shift back you're

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.870 
this side and when you shift back you're
gonna<00:01:55.720> bring<00:01:56.050> you're<00:01:56.950> gonna<00:01:57.160> cross<00:01:57.490> your<00:01:57.670> arms

an<00:01:59.290> act<00:01:59.500> so<00:02:00.220> out<00:02:00.490> cross<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.800> then<00:02:02.800> that's<00:02:03.220> when

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
an act so out cross and then that's when

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.910 
an act so out cross and then that's when
you<00:02:03.490> get<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.850> next<00:02:04.000> step<00:02:04.440> okay<00:02:05.440> so<00:02:05.770> the

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
you get to the next step okay so the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.699 
you get to the next step okay so the
next<00:02:06.100> step<00:02:06.340> is<00:02:06.660> putting<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:08.200> ball<00:02:08.380> behind

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
next step is putting the ball behind

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.490 
next step is putting the ball behind
your<00:02:09.009> leg<00:02:09.280> so<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.270> already<00:02:10.509> have<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.050> pop<00:02:11.260> out

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
your leg so you already have the pop out

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.980 
your leg so you already have the pop out
the<00:02:12.250> cross<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:13.180> now<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.420> need<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.720> behind

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
the cross and now you need the behind

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.590 
the cross and now you need the behind
the<00:02:14.080> leg<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:15.160> there's<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.790> certain<00:02:16.060> position

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
the leg so there's a certain position

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.330 
the leg so there's a certain position
where<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:16.959> do<00:02:17.080> behind<00:02:17.620> your<00:02:17.769> leg<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.100> as<00:02:18.220> you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
where you do behind your leg and as you

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.280 
where you do behind your leg and as you
get<00:02:18.459> better<00:02:18.489> you<00:02:19.269> can<00:02:19.300> do<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:19.720> pretty<00:02:19.900> much<00:02:20.080> all

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
get better you can do it pretty much all

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.310 
get better you can do it pretty much all
of<00:02:20.440> your<00:02:20.530> leg<00:02:20.739> but<00:02:21.670> for<00:02:22.269> starters<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:23.200> would

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
of your leg but for starters you would

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.960 
of your leg but for starters you would
just<00:02:23.410> want<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.650> go<00:02:23.800> right<00:02:24.190> behind<00:02:24.459> your<00:02:24.820> knee

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
just want to go right behind your knee

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.870 
just want to go right behind your knee
so<00:02:25.330> if<00:02:25.930> I'm<00:02:26.080> facing<00:02:26.230> this<00:02:26.530> way<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.980> popped<00:02:27.700> it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
so if I'm facing this way I popped it

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.060 
so if I'm facing this way I popped it
out<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:28.060> crossed<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:29.470> want<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.709> go<00:02:29.800> right

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
out I crossed it you want to go right

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.130 
out I crossed it you want to go right
here<00:02:30.310> pretty<00:02:30.489> much<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:31.390> then<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.810> just<00:02:31.959> pop

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
here pretty much and then you just pop

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.770 
here pretty much and then you just pop
it<00:02:32.200> in<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:33.600> right<00:02:34.600> around<00:02:34.780> this<00:02:35.200> knee<00:02:36.540> okay<00:02:37.540> so

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
it in so right around this knee okay so

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.479 
it in so right around this knee okay so
you<00:02:37.840> pop<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.320> on<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.590> knee<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.070> next<00:02:39.310> step

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
you pop it on the knee and the next step

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.490 
you pop it on the knee and the next step
is<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.820> just<00:02:40.000> catch<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.239> easy<00:02:41.080> is<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.380> well

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
is to just catch it easy is that well

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.820 
is to just catch it easy is that well
not<00:02:41.620> like<00:02:42.040> catch<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.580> ball<00:02:42.940> but<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.390> know

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
not like catch the ball but you know

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.250 
not like catch the ball but you know

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
your the same hand that goes around some

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.039 
your the same hand that goes around some
right<00:02:50.860> or<00:02:51.010> left<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.430> use<00:02:51.640> my<00:02:51.790> right<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.900> goes

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
right or left I use my right so it goes

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.350 
right or left I use my right so it goes
around<00:02:53.320> catch<00:02:53.950> with<00:02:54.130> my<00:02:54.250> right<00:02:54.489> now<00:02:55.209> let's

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
around catch with my right now let's

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.750 
around catch with my right now let's
move<00:02:55.600> isn't<00:02:56.080> exactly<00:02:56.519> effective<00:02:57.519> for<00:02:57.730> getting

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
move isn't exactly effective for getting

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.060 
move isn't exactly effective for getting
by<00:02:58.150> people<00:02:58.600> but<00:02:59.170> it's<00:02:59.290> effective<00:02:59.830> for

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
by people but it's effective for

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.310 
by people but it's effective for
confusing<00:03:00.970> people<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.480> then<00:03:01.630> going<00:03:01.900> by<00:03:02.049> them

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
confusing people and then going by them

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.120 
confusing people and then going by them
so<00:03:02.860> what<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.130> do<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.180> go<00:03:04.420> out<00:03:04.560> around<00:03:05.560> and

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
so what you do is you go out around and

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.789 
so what you do is you go out around and
you<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.510> receive<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.989> ball<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.440> as<00:03:08.620> soon<00:03:08.769> as

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
you you receive the ball and as soon as

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:09.990 
you you receive the ball and as soon as
you<00:03:08.890> receive<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.160> ball<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.580> just<00:03:09.700> cross<00:03:09.850> over

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
you receive the ball you just cross over

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.690 
you receive the ball you just cross over
real<00:03:10.269> fast<00:03:10.299> and<00:03:10.810> that<00:03:11.709> works<00:03:12.070> that<00:03:12.370> most

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
real fast and that works that most

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.289 
real fast and that works that most
mostly<00:03:13.450> all<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.810> time<00:03:14.459> so<00:03:15.459> pretty<00:03:15.790> much<00:03:15.940> you

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
mostly all the time so pretty much you

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.339 
mostly all the time so pretty much you
pop<00:03:16.600> out<00:03:16.950> come<00:03:17.950> around<00:03:18.250> get<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.420> go<00:03:20.020> so

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
pop out come around get it and go so

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.260 
pop out come around get it and go so
like<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.280> want<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.490> come<00:03:21.670> straight<00:03:21.970> but<00:03:22.120> you

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
like you want to come straight but you

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.160 
like you want to come straight but you
want<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:22.480> stand<00:03:22.750> straight

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
want to stand straight

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.360 
want to stand straight
back<00:03:23.260> up<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.550> get<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.790> ball<00:03:25.590> then<00:03:26.590> go<00:03:26.800> sort

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
back up so you get the ball then go sort

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.540 
back up so you get the ball then go sort
of<00:03:27.430> like<00:03:27.550> a<00:03:27.610> little<00:03:27.760> hesitation<00:03:28.349> okay<00:03:29.380> so<00:03:29.680> all

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
of like a little hesitation okay so all

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.210 
of like a little hesitation okay so all
together<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:31.270> should<00:03:31.390> look<00:03:31.540> like<00:03:31.569> this<00:03:31.840> and

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:42.890 

that's<00:03:36.220> when<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:36.459> go<00:03:36.610> so<00:03:37.120> one<00:03:37.480> more<00:03:37.630> time

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.710 

and<00:03:43.099> that's<00:03:44.099> the<00:03:44.280> hurricane<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:45.510> little

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
and that's the hurricane the little

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.789 
and that's the hurricane the little
practice<00:03:46.079> you<00:03:46.230> should<00:03:46.260> be<00:03:46.409> doing<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.680> like<00:03:46.769> a

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
practice you should be doing it like a

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.069 
practice you should be doing it like a
pro
