00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
can do a lot of functions so let's see

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.370 
can do a lot of functions so let's see
what<00:01:39.390> else<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:39.689> get<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.320> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
what else we get in here this is a

I don't know what this is
hmm<00:01:55.570> some<00:01:56.570> sort<00:01:56.810> of<00:01:56.900> charger<00:01:57.380> perhaps<00:01:57.710> we'll

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
hmm some sort of charger perhaps we'll

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.920 
hmm some sort of charger perhaps we'll
have<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.220> look<00:01:58.370> into<00:01:58.550> that<00:01:58.640> later<00:01:58.850> see<00:01:59.750> what

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
larger size hands and wrists it won't be

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.690 
larger size hands and wrists it won't be
too<00:03:18.049> unsightly<00:03:18.799> and<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.040> kind<00:03:19.250> of<00:03:19.310> looks<00:03:19.489> nice

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
too unsightly and it kind of looks nice

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
it's got a chrome finish around the edge

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.710 
it's got a chrome finish around the edge
it<00:03:21.980> looks<00:03:22.250> like<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.519> standard<00:03:22.940> digital<00:03:23.329> watch

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
it looks like a standard digital watch

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.630 
it looks like a standard digital watch
but<00:03:24.079> it<00:03:24.170> obviously<00:03:24.500> does<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.070> lot<00:03:25.280> more<00:03:25.340> than

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
but it obviously does a lot more than

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.120 
but it obviously does a lot more than
that<00:03:25.730> next<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.510> quarter<00:03:27.049> here<00:03:27.769> it<00:03:27.860> is<00:03:27.950> next

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
that next to a quarter here it is next

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.710 
that next to a quarter here it is next
to<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.280> quarter<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.760> can<00:03:28.910> kind<00:03:29.420> of<00:03:29.450> put<00:03:29.630> the

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
to a quarter and I can kind of put the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.000 
to a quarter and I can kind of put the
quarter<00:03:29.989> right<00:03:30.140> in<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.350> screen<00:03:30.590> so<00:03:30.739> it's<00:03:30.860> not

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
quarter right in the screen so it's not

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.850 
quarter right in the screen so it's not
too<00:03:31.430> big<00:03:31.850> where<00:03:32.630> is<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.989> power<00:03:33.200> button<00:03:33.470> to

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
too big where is the power button to

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.830 
too big where is the power button to
peel<00:03:34.640> this<00:03:34.820> off<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.299> side<00:03:37.390> okay<00:03:38.390> I<00:03:38.420> think<00:03:38.540> I

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
peel this off the side okay I think I

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.690 
peel this off the side okay I think I
found<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.320> power<00:03:39.530> button<00:03:39.890> I<00:03:40.160> think<00:03:40.310> this<00:03:40.579> is

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
found the power button I think this is

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.090 
found the power button I think this is
it<00:03:40.820> right<00:03:40.850> here<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.350> put<00:03:42.709> your<00:03:42.739> SIM<00:03:43.070> card

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
it right here so you put your SIM card

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.420 
it right here so you put your SIM card
in<00:03:43.459> here<00:03:43.670> where<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.090> have<00:03:44.720> no<00:03:44.959> idea<00:03:45.350> I<00:03:45.620> have<00:03:46.190> to

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
in here where I have no idea I have to

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.770 
in here where I have no idea I have to
find<00:03:46.670> that<00:03:46.790> out<00:03:46.940> soon<00:03:46.970> but<00:03:47.269> let's<00:03:47.299> just<00:03:47.630> see

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
find that out soon but let's just see

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.810 
find that out soon but let's just see
what<00:03:47.959> it's<00:03:48.079> like<00:03:48.260> after<00:03:49.070> you<00:03:49.190> turn<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:49.519> on<00:03:49.610> I

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
what it's like after you turn it on I

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.770 
what it's like after you turn it on I
think<00:03:49.880> there<00:03:50.299> is<00:03:50.329> a<00:03:50.480> stylus<00:03:51.410> for<00:03:51.680> this<00:03:52.190> screen

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
think there is a stylus for this screen

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.449 
think there is a stylus for this screen
perhaps<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:54.049> missed<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:54.650> in<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:54.920> box

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
perhaps I missed it in the box

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.600 
perhaps I missed it in the box
anyhow<00:03:56.420> let's<00:03:56.660> see<00:03:56.810> what<00:03:56.959> happens

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
anyhow let's see what happens
