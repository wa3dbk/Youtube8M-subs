00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 to see the best applications for 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.870
 Android start with a browser on 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.210

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.490
 called dolphin browser will have all the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.380
 names and links in the description with 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.590
 this browser is called dolphin 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.960
 browser we can surf the internet 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.460
 a much faster and more comfortable way than 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.199
 as we would with the browser that 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.380
 came with our mobile is superior to 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.109
 firefox to lopera and chrome first 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.630
 this is the main window here 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.540
 we can write in the address that 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.680
 go search the internet or if it's not 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.230
 no address is sought 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.899
 automatically on the google 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.879
 here we usually have the websites that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.460
 more we visit or that we have 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.059
 chosen that they are here as it is done 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.550
 in chrome for your fish finally 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.980
 if you slide your finger to the right 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.160
 here the whole list will disappear again 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.989
 of your favorite websites so that if 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.430
 they are sailing because although by 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.460
 any web they do is go now 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.799
 directly choose the web you want 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.450
 but that's not all, but also here 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.280
 down on the left we have this 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.000
 where in order that if we click 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.159
 we can write for example an axis and of 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.530
 this mode we will automatically go to word 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.270
 and in the same way we can create our 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.759
 shortcuts to our pages 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.579
 favorite everything to navigate in a way 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.399
 more interactive and faster on the internet 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:29.340
 the next application is called quick 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.020
 tics is the gallery improvement for android 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.700
 surely you will know the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.549
 true mobile life of your android 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.380
 it's pretty bad and slow with this 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.319
 application will make you like life be 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.970
 much faster and pretty for example 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.310
 now it's about her and then we have 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.890
 classified by folders and if we do 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.709
 click on one bring us here all the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.789
 photos that we have inside this folder 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:55.319
 and we can see that, but if we go to 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.369
 adjustments we can for example 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.970
 set it as wallpaper 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.810
 turn the edit we can frame 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.640
 we can change one part 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.890
 the aspect ratio of the image does not 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.860
 we can even know where it was taken 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.530
 this picture is called twitpic 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.900
 for example if you turn your mobile 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.849
 it also obviously turns around 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.709
 it even does animation is pretty 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.650
 between photos and we can 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.630
 put it in presentation mode that we can 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.269
 completely configure the following 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.519

 baby with orange that what he does is 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.050
 same as it is done but it tends to hit 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.780
 more with this application we can 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.459
 detect how songs are called 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.100
 that we listen to on the radio in 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.630
 TV we pass here and we click 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.670
 to this big button that says creation is 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.220
 that's about five seconds 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.830
 recognizing the immediately gives us the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.349
 name the artist including the biography 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.840

 icon is completely free in the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.989
 store when they download it is like a 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.450
 simple application of notes but that 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.760
 It also synchronizes with our PC or 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.380
 with the other android phones that 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.720
 let's have for example click on 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.180
 new note and here we can choose 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.980
 example download 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.689
 the best apps best apps I still do not 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.379
 I have it synchronized so that if I 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.150
 threw back 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.799

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.200
 moment I give to remind me more 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.000
 late from here I have always download 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.769
 the best apps this is the title and if 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.530
 I write here for example for saying something 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.239
 the name of the apps because I'll have it 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.889
 a very efficient reminder 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.870
 can put reminders that for 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.010
 example that day is now sounds like the 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.950
 alarm or that in the bar 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.530
 notifications come out that I have this 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.690
 event 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.430
 the next application is called new 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.900
 launcher the global and cher is the 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.360
 launcher that I'm running right now 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.220
 in this phone they do not go to a che 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.430
 for phones that have to write 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.680
 living or higher sandwich what 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.209
 they do is recreate the stock style of the 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.790
 android but that has for example the 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.500
 galaxy nexus or the future nexus 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.319
 then we can configure it 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.030
 absolutely everything the grid the 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.260
 icons the widgets here for example 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.209
 we have the widgets but we can 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.610
 configure which tabs go up here 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.950
 we can classify our best 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.540
 applications in folders for example 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.510
 we can choose if we go to some adjustments 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.040
 de novo if we go to the desktop we can 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.680
 change the desktop grid 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.790
 the margins the type of style that the 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.530
 search bar 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.140
 the displacement effect here have 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.660
 to create among many that if by 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.700
 example are trying to reach the most 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.830
 I like you this is without a doubt 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.120
 along with latex even be the best 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.580
 skype launcher for android in this 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.070
 moment although this one does not go launcher spends 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.080
 much less ram and minor battery 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.970
 we can for example do that if 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.889
 we need something down we are 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.930
 will lower the notification bar 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.449
 various combinations of fingers so that 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.090
 go to direct times way to our 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.800
 favorite applications finally in the 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.080
 Last recommended application is the 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.509
 game called jetpack joyride the 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.520
 heartbreak the creators of fruit ninja 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:04.409
 this is a game that came out earlier for 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.659
 iphone and that was really addictive in 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:09.090
 this platform so it happened too 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:13.349
 to android in this game we have to 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:15.389
 dodge all the dolls these and 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.449
 the laser bars and pick up the 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:21.000
 maximum possible coins and for example 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.639
 you see this we have to dodge and for 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.129
 example the backpack that brings me is to the 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.409
 once a machine gun down by 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:30.659
 example if I take this are different types 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.789
 of vehicles for then to advance from 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:36.060
 a faster way too when you get 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:38.430
 with some cannons or you give yourself to 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.589
 bars are you almost give him you lose the 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.229
 game but if for example you take 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:45.120
 how was it going with vehicle now step to 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.129
 return to the previous model although if 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.449
 now they give me I will die 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.159
 we have to go picking various 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.110
 coins to buy the new ones 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:52.740
 gadgets that will help us move forward 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.990
 in a manner 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.940
 fast and comfortable in the game for example 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.460
 now I have an extra tab and when we 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.580
 we die there is the game is over 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.349
 and we have to throw a roulette 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.729
 that as you can see now I have had one 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:10.939
 atomic explosion that what it will do will be 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.169
 as you see throw me later in the end 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:14.719
 we also have to dodge this type 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.219
 of obstacles and in the end the most 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:18.949
 important is other currencies that 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:21.319
 we collect and the meters of passion network is 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:22.879
 one of the most addictive games and that 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:24.740
 I recommend to prove to everyone that it looks like a 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:26.240
 little to go at first but then 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.759
 You are taking the time or you are 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.800
 just like we can go here and buy 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:33.199
 the best propellers of the vehicles 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.819
 utilities gadgets there's even a 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:37.069
 payment mode but of course as always 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:38.779
 we recommend this have been the 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:40.849
 Today's best applications 

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:43.039
 I hope you liked it if it's like that 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:44.509
 they come to login and subscribe to 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:47.680
 be the latest in the android world 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:47.680
 until the next androids
