bit for again I said if there's a

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.479 
bit for again I said if there's a
different<00:03:07.620> laser<00:03:07.739> that<00:03:07.950> we<00:03:08.040> have<00:03:08.160> which<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.340> a

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
different laser that we have which is a

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.210 
different laser that we have which is a
co2<00:03:09.000> resurfacing<00:03:09.660> laser<00:03:09.739> which<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.920> laser

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
co2 resurfacing laser which is a laser

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.580 
co2 resurfacing laser which is a laser
that<00:03:11.459> basically<00:03:12.090> peels<00:03:12.540> off<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.959> skin<00:03:13.290> and

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
that basically peels off the skin and

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.610 
that basically peels off the skin and
the<00:03:13.650> skin<00:03:13.680> grows<00:03:14.070> back<00:03:14.280> tight<00:03:14.580> wrinkle<00:03:15.390> free

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
acne scar free it's used for

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.229

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
because it takes a while for this to

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.380 
because it takes a while for this to
heal<00:03:25.260> up<00:03:25.470> it's<00:03:26.040> basically<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.430> vaporization<00:03:27.269> of

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
heal up it's basically a vaporization of

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.600 
heal up it's basically a vaporization of
the<00:03:27.510> skin<00:03:27.810> we<00:03:28.350> wipe<00:03:28.590> out<00:03:28.769> all<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.040> lesions<00:03:29.430> and

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
then it's red bit weepy feels over the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.170 
then it's red bit weepy feels over the
course<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.269> week<00:03:33.450> it's<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.470> big<00:03:34.650> deal<00:03:35.180> cysts

whole castle there's a whole capsule
that<00:04:27.030> emanates<00:04:27.479> from<00:04:27.539> that<00:04:27.750> one<00:04:27.960> poor<00:04:28.229> and<00:04:28.560> you

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
that emanates from that one poor and you

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.409 
that emanates from that one poor and you
have<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.280> proper<00:04:29.699> job<00:04:29.850> at<00:04:30.060> getting<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.300> whole

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
cap so i'll put in the stitches up

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.490 
cap so i'll put in the stitches up
underneath<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:32.759> up<00:04:32.820> top<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:33.300> with<00:04:33.690> that<00:04:36.500> see

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
underneath and up top and with that see

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.650 
underneath and up top and with that see
that<00:04:37.620> little<00:04:37.800> protrusion<00:04:38.789> out<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.389> skin

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
that little protrusion out of the skin

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.600 
that little protrusion out of the skin
over<00:04:39.810> here<00:04:40.199> right<00:04:40.800> there<00:04:40.860> in<00:04:41.100> the<00:04:41.130> lower<00:04:41.340> back

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
over here right there in the lower back

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.969 
over here right there in the lower back
so<00:04:42.600> that's<00:04:42.660> called<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:42.960> leg<00:04:43.110> Poma<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:43.650> that's

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
so that's called a leg Poma and that's

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.939 
so that's called a leg Poma and that's
just<00:04:44.340> natural<00:04:45.000> excess<00:04:45.870> fat<00:04:46.139> there<00:04:46.830> are

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
just natural excess fat there are

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.620 
just natural excess fat there are
genetic<00:04:47.070> diseases<00:04:47.610> where<00:04:48.030> people<00:04:48.240> make<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.389> lot

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
genetic diseases where people make a lot

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.450 
genetic diseases where people make a lot
of<00:04:48.690> these<00:04:48.960> lipomas<00:04:49.560> all<00:04:49.710> over<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:49.949> arms<00:04:50.310> and

of these lipomas all over the arms and
legs<00:04:50.520> some<00:04:51.210> people<00:04:51.449> just<00:04:51.479> get<00:04:51.810> it<00:04:51.960> for<00:04:52.110> example

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320

we saw patient yesterday he has three in
his<00:04:54.840> scalp<00:04:55.139> you<00:04:56.009> know<00:04:56.130> when<00:04:56.280> he<00:04:56.400> wants<00:04:56.669> to<00:04:56.789> get

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
his scalp you know when he wants to get

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.120 
his scalp you know when he wants to get

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.950 
shaves really thin kind of a crew cut
all<00:05:02.910> the<00:05:03.030> time<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.389> they've<00:05:03.509> got<00:05:03.690> a<00:05:03.720> true

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
either we inject them with steroids to

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.080 
either we inject them with steroids to
try<00:07:02.010> and<00:07:02.130> flatten<00:07:02.460> them<00:07:02.550> out<00:07:02.640> but<00:07:02.790> one<00:07:02.970> did

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.660 
try and flatten them out but one did
this<00:07:03.240> big<00:07:03.510> usually<00:07:03.930> we<00:07:04.560> what<00:07:04.800> we<00:07:04.830> do<00:07:05.040> is<00:07:05.160> we<00:07:05.280> cut

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:05.670 
this big usually we what we do is we cut

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.760 
this big usually we what we do is we cut
a<00:07:05.700> little<00:07:05.880> flap<00:07:06.180> of<00:07:06.420> skin<00:07:06.450> edge<00:07:07.050> it<00:07:07.290> out<00:07:07.440> I<00:07:07.470> just

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
a little flap of skin edge it out I just

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.000 
a little flap of skin edge it out I just
did<00:07:07.890> this<00:07:08.010> completes<00:07:08.670> go<00:07:08.880> and<00:07:09.500> cut<00:07:10.500> it<00:07:10.590> out<00:07:10.710> and

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.010 
did this completes go and cut it out and

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.800 
did this completes go and cut it out and
then<00:07:11.040> put<00:07:11.340> the<00:07:11.550> flat<00:07:11.730> down<00:07:11.910> and<00:07:12.150> then<00:07:12.450> put<00:07:12.630> in<00:07:12.750> a

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
then put the flat down and then put in a

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.450 
then put the flat down and then put in a
pressure<00:07:13.140> here<00:07:13.410> and<00:07:13.560> across<00:07:13.770> you<00:07:14.040> a<00:07:14.100> lot<00:07:14.340> of

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 
pressure here and across you a lot of

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.580 
pressure here and across you a lot of
pressure<00:07:14.670> so<00:07:15.120> it<00:07:15.180> doesn't<00:07:15.450> grow<00:07:15.510> back

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590 
pressure so it doesn't grow back

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.540 
pressure so it doesn't grow back
sometimes<00:07:16.590> what<00:07:16.740> I've<00:07:16.830> done<00:07:16.950> recently<00:07:17.220> also

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
sometimes what I've done recently also

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.860 
sometimes what I've done recently also
this<00:07:17.940> past<00:07:18.180> year<00:07:18.360> because<00:07:18.570> it's<00:07:18.720> so

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870 
this past year because it's so

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.720 
this past year because it's so
frustrating<00:07:19.050> and<00:07:19.560> they<00:07:19.919> grow<00:07:20.100> back<00:07:20.310> so<00:07:20.520> much

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:20.730 
frustrating and they grow back so much

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.010 
frustrating and they grow back so much
and<00:07:20.910> you<00:07:20.970> really<00:07:21.180> want<00:07:21.360> to<00:07:21.390> help<00:07:21.480> the<00:07:21.660> patient

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 
and you really want to help the patient

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.360 
and you really want to help the patient
is<00:07:22.380> I'll<00:07:22.770> send<00:07:23.100> them<00:07:23.250> to<00:07:23.580> highline<00:07:24.270> for

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.370 
is I'll send them to highline for

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.710 
is I'll send them to highline for
radiation<00:07:26.370> as<00:07:26.940> soon<00:07:27.090> as<00:07:27.180> we<00:07:27.300> cut<00:07:27.480> it<00:07:27.600> out

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 
radiation as soon as we cut it out

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.380 
radiation as soon as we cut it out
before<00:07:28.680> it<00:07:28.890> has<00:07:29.040> a<00:07:29.070> chance<00:07:29.160> to<00:07:29.460> grow<00:07:29.580> back<00:07:29.850> they

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:30.390 
before it has a chance to grow back they

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.850 
before it has a chance to grow back they
go<00:07:30.540> for<00:07:30.750> three<00:07:31.020> to<00:07:31.140> five<00:07:31.290> sessions<00:07:31.560> of

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860 
go for three to five sessions of

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.710 
go for three to five sessions of
radiation<00:07:32.430> to<00:07:32.520> get<00:07:32.640> targeted<00:07:32.910> radiation<00:07:33.600> in

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 
radiation to get targeted radiation in

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.630 
radiation to get targeted radiation in
the<00:07:33.780> area<00:07:34.110> and<00:07:34.290> then<00:07:34.620> it<00:07:34.680> doesn't<00:07:34.830> go<00:07:35.040> back<00:07:35.220> it

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:35.640 
the area and then it doesn't go back it

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.659 
the area and then it doesn't go back it
stuns<00:07:35.970> the<00:07:36.180> tune<00:07:36.960> so<00:07:37.860> treating<00:07:38.250> it<00:07:38.310> as<00:07:38.370> if<00:07:38.430> it's

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:38.669 
stuns the tune so treating it as if it's

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:40.130 
stuns the tune so treating it as if it's
a<00:07:38.730> tumor<00:07:38.910> and<00:07:39.150> get<00:07:39.330> radiation<00:07:39.570> just<00:07:39.840> like<00:07:39.990> it's

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:40.140 
a tumor and get radiation just like it's

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.990 
a tumor and get radiation just like it's
of<00:07:40.230> breast<00:07:40.440> cancer<00:07:40.800> or<00:07:41.340> kidney<00:07:41.700> cancer

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 
of breast cancer or kidney cancer

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.720 
of breast cancer or kidney cancer
something<00:07:42.240> I<00:07:42.270> think<00:07:42.419> get<00:07:42.660> radiation<00:07:43.610> right<00:07:44.610> to

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:44.730 
something I think get radiation right to

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.230 
something I think get radiation right to
the<00:07:44.850> site<00:07:45.060> and<00:07:45.330> then<00:07:45.630> they<00:07:45.720> stay<00:07:45.990> away
