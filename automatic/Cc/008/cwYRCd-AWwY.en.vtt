the<00:02:03.550> proper<00:02:04.180> color<00:02:04.600> scheme<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.080> it<00:02:05.650> actually

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
the proper color scheme and it actually

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.249 
the proper color scheme and it actually
looks<00:02:06.190> really<00:02:06.520> cool<00:02:07.030> also<00:02:07.450> we<00:02:07.630> kind<00:02:07.990> of<00:02:08.050> have

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
looks really cool also we kind of have

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.770 
looks really cool also we kind of have
them<00:02:08.409> on

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
them on

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.630 
them on
well<00:02:09.959> an<00:02:10.200> apt<00:02:10.410> elliptic<00:02:10.920> feeling<00:02:11.310> right<00:02:11.490> now

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
well an apt elliptic feeling right now

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.910 
well an apt elliptic feeling right now
so<00:02:12.240> it's<00:02:12.540> kind<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.900> like<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.230> little<00:02:13.410> fallout<00:02:13.770> I

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
so it's kind of like a little fallout I

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.680 
so it's kind of like a little fallout I
think<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.670> campaign<00:02:15.030> resulted<00:02:15.480> like<00:02:15.660> a

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
think in the campaign resulted like a

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.690 
think in the campaign resulted like a
nuclear<00:02:15.990> missile<00:02:16.650> or<00:02:16.860> something<00:02:16.950> hitting

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
nuclear missile or something hitting

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.570 
nuclear missile or something hitting
Paris<00:02:18.360> or<00:02:18.840> something<00:02:19.230> again<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.190> haven't

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
Paris or something again I haven't

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.830 
Paris or something again I haven't
played<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.940> campaign<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.420> i'm<00:02:21.540> not<00:02:21.660> sure<00:02:21.810> but

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
played the campaign so i'm not sure but

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.630 
played the campaign so i'm not sure but
i<00:02:22.050> think<00:02:22.440> that's<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.830> reason<00:02:23.100> why<00:02:23.130> everything

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
i think that's the reason why everything

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.530 
i think that's the reason why everything
looks<00:02:23.850> kind<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.560> folly<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:26.489> just<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.360> little

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
looks kind of folly and just a little

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.360 
looks kind of folly and just a little
bit<00:02:27.690> more<00:02:28.230> deserted<00:02:28.800> if<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.100> know<00:02:29.220> what<00:02:29.340> i

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
bit more deserted if you know what i

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.130 
bit more deserted if you know what i
mean<00:02:29.489> but<00:02:29.700> yeah<00:02:29.910> i<00:02:30.150> really<00:02:30.630> like<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.840> looks<00:02:31.020> of

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
mean but yeah i really like the looks of

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.170 
mean but yeah i really like the looks of
it<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.470> apparently<00:02:32.280> they<00:02:32.580> also<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:32.970> been

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
it and apparently they also have been

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.270 
it and apparently they also have been
added<00:02:33.420> some<00:02:33.750> flanking<00:02:34.319> routes<00:02:34.500> in<00:02:34.739> metro<00:02:35.069> or

it's<00:03:43.019> kind<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.290> hard<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.560> use<00:03:43.829> but<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.220> just<00:03:44.519> try

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
it's kind of hard to use but I just try

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.460 
it's kind of hard to use but I just try
to<00:03:44.880> get<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.180> little<00:03:45.299> bit<00:03:45.510> used<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.079> because<00:03:46.230> I

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
to get a little bit used to it because I

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.110 
to get a little bit used to it because I
want<00:03:46.920> to<00:03:46.980> use<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.310> little<00:03:47.489> bit<00:03:47.700> more<00:03:47.850> again

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
want to use it a little bit more again

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.170 
want to use it a little bit more again
because<00:03:48.510> that's<00:03:49.290> just<00:03:49.470> my<00:03:50.250> favorite<00:03:50.730> gun

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
because that's just my favorite gun

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.750 
because that's just my favorite gun
actually<00:03:51.480> like<00:03:51.959> for<00:03:52.350> all<00:03:52.500> these<00:03:52.620> items<00:03:52.829> and

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
I'm not too found off the racks and I

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.310 
I'm not too found off the racks and I
was<00:03:55.739> never<00:03:56.010> has<00:03:56.190> been<00:03:56.370> but<00:03:57.150> yeah<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:58.049> Magnum

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
was never has been but yeah the Magnum

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.740 
was never has been but yeah the Magnum
would<00:03:58.440> normally<00:03:59.250> be<00:03:59.400> my<00:03:59.640> go-to<00:03:59.880> sidearm<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.630> I

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
would normally be my go-to sidearm and I

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.410 
would normally be my go-to sidearm and I
really<00:04:01.140> want<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.070> get<00:04:02.220> it<00:04:02.370> back<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:02.880> even

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
really want to get it back and even

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.449 
really want to get it back and even
though<00:04:03.570> it's<00:04:03.750> it's<00:04:04.049> kind<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.350> buggy<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:05.070> dice

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
though it's it's kind of buggy and dice

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.420 
though it's it's kind of buggy and dice
already<00:04:05.850> admitted<00:04:06.150> that<00:04:06.269> they<00:04:06.450> are<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.980> little

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
already admitted that they are a little

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.920 
already admitted that they are a little
bit<00:04:08.640> over<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:09.060> talk<00:04:09.209> with<00:04:09.420> her<00:04:09.510> today<00:04:09.660> and

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
bit over to talk with her today and

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.840 
bit over to talk with her today and
they're<00:04:10.049> reducing<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.680> however<00:04:11.579> dispatch

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
they're reducing that however dispatch

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.729 
they're reducing that however dispatch
hasn't<00:04:12.150> dropped<00:04:12.299> yet<00:04:12.450> also<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.230> were<00:04:13.350> able<00:04:13.500> to

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
hasn't dropped yet also you were able to

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.430 
hasn't dropped yet also you were able to
see<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:14.220> that<00:04:14.549> lag<00:04:14.850> was<00:04:15.120> pretty<00:04:15.570> bad<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.169> I

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
see that that lag was pretty bad and I

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.250 
see that that lag was pretty bad and I
think<00:04:16.919> a<00:04:17.010> little<00:04:17.940> bit<00:04:18.090> like<00:04:18.299> a<00:04:18.570> couple<00:04:18.959> seconds

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
think a little bit like a couple seconds

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.899 
think a little bit like a couple seconds
ago<00:04:19.440> just<00:04:19.680> shot<00:04:19.890> the<00:04:20.039> guy<00:04:20.220> like<00:04:20.459> Wright<00:04:20.669> and

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
ago just shot the guy like Wright and

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.149 
ago just shot the guy like Wright and
straighten<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.780> chest<00:04:22.080> nothing<00:04:22.890> happened

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
straighten the chest nothing happened

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.570 
straighten the chest nothing happened
like

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
like

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.550 
like
a<00:04:23.639> whole<00:04:24.120> second<00:04:24.479> later<00:04:24.659> I<00:04:24.780> got<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.169> not<00:04:25.319> kill

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
a whole second later I got the not kill

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.619 
a whole second later I got the not kill
notification<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.340> he<00:04:26.460> dropped<00:04:26.699> them<00:04:26.909> yeah

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:27.629 
notification and he dropped them yeah

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:30.140 
notification and he dropped them yeah
this<00:04:27.960> game<00:04:28.280> apparently<00:04:29.280> has<00:04:29.400> some<00:04:29.430> more

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
this game apparently has some more

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.899 
this game apparently has some more
problems<00:04:30.419> after<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.949> addition<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:32.669> the

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909 
problems after the the addition of the

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.540 
problems after the the addition of the
opposite<00:04:33.569> the<00:04:33.719> real<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.590> release<00:04:34.889> of<00:04:35.099> second

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
opposite the real the release of second

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.159 
opposite the real the release of second
assault<00:04:35.729> and<00:04:36.270> many<00:04:36.479> people<00:04:36.689> were<00:04:36.960> complaining

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
assault and many people were complaining

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.350 
assault and many people were complaining
that<00:04:37.500> they're<00:04:37.830> like<00:04:38.280> crashing<00:04:38.819> again<00:04:39.060> a<00:04:39.090> lot

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
that they're like crashing again a lot

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.990 
that they're like crashing again a lot
more<00:04:39.569> the<00:04:39.810> netcode<00:04:40.229> of<00:04:40.680> course<00:04:41.000> everyone's

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
more the netcode of course everyone's

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.760 
more the netcode of course everyone's
favorite<00:04:42.270> word<00:04:42.449> and<00:04:42.659> that<00:04:42.780> code<00:04:42.990> is<00:04:43.229> getting

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
favorite word and that code is getting

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.790 
favorite word and that code is getting
worse<00:04:43.919> again<00:04:44.069> and<00:04:44.430> I<00:04:45.000> I<00:04:45.300> can<00:04:45.719> partly<00:04:45.960> confirm

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
worse again and I I can partly confirm

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.480 
worse again and I I can partly confirm
that<00:04:47.219> the<00:04:48.120> game<00:04:48.389> seems<00:04:48.780> to<00:04:48.870> run<00:04:49.139> a<00:04:49.590> little<00:04:50.310> bit

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
that the game seems to run a little bit

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.330 
that the game seems to run a little bit
weirder<00:04:50.879> and<00:04:51.120> but<00:04:51.810> maybe<00:04:52.680> it's<00:04:52.860> just<00:04:52.949> the<00:04:53.129> case

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
weirder and but maybe it's just the case

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.040 
weirder and but maybe it's just the case
because<00:04:53.490> I<00:04:53.639> played<00:04:53.969> lots<00:04:54.270> of<00:04:54.360> titanfall<00:04:54.689> which

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
because I played lots of titanfall which

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.869 
because I played lots of titanfall which
is<00:04:55.199> actually<00:04:55.379> a<00:04:55.560> game<00:04:55.770> that's<00:04:56.340> running<00:04:56.580> a<00:04:56.729> lot

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879 
is actually a game that's running a lot

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.879 
is actually a game that's running a lot
better<00:04:57.030> also<00:04:57.960> I've<00:04:58.050> played<00:04:58.259> some<00:04:58.469> commerce

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
better also I've played some commerce

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.080 
better also I've played some commerce
right<00:04:59.009> go<00:04:59.159> before<00:04:59.520> as<00:04:59.669> well<00:04:59.819> as<00:04:59.940> some

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
right go before as well as some

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.749 
right go before as well as some
insurgency<00:05:00.780> all<00:05:01.259> games<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.680> run<00:05:02.340> actually<00:05:02.729> a

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 
insurgency all games the run actually a

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.790 
insurgency all games the run actually a
lot<00:05:02.909> better<00:05:02.969> than<00:05:03.300> battlefield<00:05:03.719> 4<00:05:03.930> and<00:05:04.139> I

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
lot better than battlefield 4 and I

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.379 
lot better than battlefield 4 and I
haven't<00:05:05.099> played<00:05:05.340> benefit<00:05:05.669> for<00:05:05.879> for<00:05:06.180> I<00:05:06.210> think

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
haven't played benefit for for I think

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.110 
haven't played benefit for for I think
two<00:05:06.810> weeks<00:05:07.139> now<00:05:07.379> and<00:05:07.620> I'm<00:05:08.400> just<00:05:08.430> am<00:05:08.819> getting

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
two weeks now and I'm just am getting

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.450 
two weeks now and I'm just am getting
back<00:05:09.300> to<00:05:09.479> it<00:05:09.629> I<00:05:10.020> don't<00:05:10.469> know<00:05:10.560> do<00:05:11.159> not<00:05:11.280> worry

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
back to it I don't know do not worry

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.890 
back to it I don't know do not worry
I've<00:05:11.699> lots<00:05:12.000> of<00:05:12.120> gameplay<00:05:12.330> stored<00:05:12.569> up<00:05:12.690> so<00:05:12.840> you

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
I've lots of gameplay stored up so you

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.779 
I've lots of gameplay stored up so you
can<00:05:13.080> see<00:05:13.110> there<00:05:13.379> as<00:05:13.469> well<00:05:13.680> so<00:05:13.860> please<00:05:14.550> let<00:05:14.669> me

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
can see there as well so please let me

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.129 
can see there as well so please let me
know<00:05:14.819> what<00:05:15.029> kind<00:05:15.270> of<00:05:15.330> map<00:05:15.539> you<00:05:15.690> would<00:05:15.840> like<00:05:15.990> to

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
know what kind of map you would like to

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.930 
know what kind of map you would like to
see<00:05:16.289> next<00:05:16.319> maybe<00:05:16.680> firestorm<00:05:17.340> what<00:05:17.639> else<00:05:17.789> is

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
see next maybe firestorm what else is

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.390 
see next maybe firestorm what else is
there<00:05:18.120> I<00:05:18.360> think<00:05:18.870> a<00:05:19.080> springboard<00:05:19.440> is<00:05:19.770> also<00:05:20.129> one

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400
