long<00:01:34.740> time<00:01:34.950> ago<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.369> when<00:01:35.430> i<00:01:36.270> got<00:01:36.420> my<00:01:36.450> new

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
long time ago and when i got my new

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.880 
long time ago and when i got my new
computer<00:01:36.780> was<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.259> old<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.680> wouldn't

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
computer was so old that it wouldn't

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.179 
computer was so old that it wouldn't
even<00:01:37.920> transfer<00:01:38.430> over<00:01:38.670> into<00:01:38.729> my<00:01:39.060> new<00:01:39.840> computer

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
even transfer over into my new computer

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.530 
even transfer over into my new computer
so<00:01:41.189> i<00:01:41.220> went<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.579> go<00:01:41.700> ahead<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.000> purchase<00:01:42.119> and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
so i went to go ahead and purchase and

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.080 
so i went to go ahead and purchase and
then<00:01:42.899> their<00:01:43.259> copy<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.790> worked<00:01:44.970> out

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
then their copy of it it is worked out

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.810 
then their copy of it it is worked out
better<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.600> me<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.890> monthly

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
better for me to get the monthly

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.130 
better for me to get the monthly
subscription<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.720> pay<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> monthly

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
subscription so you just pay a monthly

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.380 
subscription so you just pay a monthly
subscription<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.920> then<00:01:50.070> every<00:01:50.340> month<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.850> get

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
subscription and then every month I get

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.460 
subscription and then every month I get
to<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.600> able<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.869> use<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
to be able to use this and it's the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.069 
to be able to use this and it's the
newest<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.130> whatever<00:01:53.460> black<00:01:54.119> Arab<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:54.899> it's

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
newest in whatever black Arab but it's

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.870 
newest in whatever black Arab but it's
just<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.500> cheaper<00:01:56.070> than<00:01:56.100> paying<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.549> thousand

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
just it's cheaper than paying a thousand

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.700 
just it's cheaper than paying a thousand
dollars<00:01:57.090> all<00:01:57.270> at<00:01:57.390> once<00:01:57.570> well<00:01:57.990> not<00:01:58.290> cheaper<00:01:58.619> in

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
dollars all at once well not cheaper in

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.580 
dollars all at once well not cheaper in

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
of a cell shading kind of technique that

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.230 
of a cell shading kind of technique that
some<00:02:31.490> studios<00:02:32.240> use<00:02:33.020> an<00:02:33.320> animating<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.240> then

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
some studios use an animating and then

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.880 
some studios use an animating and then
after<00:02:35.540> i<00:02:35.570> get<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.870> shading<00:02:36.260> in<00:02:36.380> there<00:02:36.530> i<00:02:36.560> said

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
after i get the shading in there i said

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.400 
after i get the shading in there i said
i<00:02:36.950> would<00:02:37.040> go<00:02:37.220> full<00:02:37.640> born<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.300> go<00:02:38.990> ahead<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.290> do

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
i would go full born and go ahead and do

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.530 
i would go full born and go ahead and do

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
the line coloring it's where you take

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.500 
the line coloring it's where you take
the<00:02:41.780> actual<00:02:42.050> black<00:02:42.530> outlining<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.490> you<00:02:44.150> begin

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
the actual black outlining and you begin

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.020
