00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.770 
on a Saturday to design a garden just
really<00:01:05.830> shows<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.729> movement<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.300> momentum

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
really shows the movement the momentum

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.540 
really shows the movement the momentum
that<00:01:08.020> this<00:01:08.170> project<00:01:08.650> has<00:01:08.770> created<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:09.430> the

that this project has created in the

that this project has created in the
local<00:01:09.820> community<00:01:10.240> what<00:01:10.450> I<00:01:10.479> didn't<00:01:10.810> know<00:01:10.899> is

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
local community what I didn't know is

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.440 
local community what I didn't know is
how<00:01:11.350> inspiring<00:01:11.830> that<00:01:12.009> the<00:01:12.610> undergrads<00:01:13.210> would

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
how inspiring that the undergrads would

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.440 
how inspiring that the undergrads would
be<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.810> me<00:01:13.960> so<00:01:14.550> I'm<00:01:15.550> a<00:01:15.700> slightly<00:01:15.940> older<00:01:16.270> grad

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
be to me so I'm a slightly older grad

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.910 
be to me so I'm a slightly older grad
student<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:16.960> I'm<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.440> only<00:01:17.590> one<00:01:17.740> in<00:01:17.860> the

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
student and I'm the only one in the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.280 
student and I'm the only one in the
group<00:01:18.070> and<00:01:18.460> all<00:01:19.390> these<00:01:19.570> 20-somethings<00:01:19.960> are

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
group and all these 20-somethings are

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.450 
group and all these 20-somethings are
kind<00:01:20.470> of<00:01:20.500> blowing<00:01:20.800> my<00:01:20.890> mind<00:01:21.040> with<00:01:21.340> their

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
kind of blowing my mind with their

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.160 
kind of blowing my mind with their
energy<00:01:21.910> there's<00:01:22.210> this<00:01:22.300> renewed<00:01:22.690> energy

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
energy there's this renewed energy

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.930 
energy there's this renewed energy
towards<00:01:23.500> healing<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.950> earth<00:01:24.100> issues<00:01:24.670> like

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
towards healing the earth issues like

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.800 
towards healing the earth issues like
food<00:01:25.780> systems<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:26.320> are<00:01:26.500> broken<00:01:26.920> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
food systems that are broken and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.920 
food systems that are broken and
agriculture<00:01:28.810> systems<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:31.390> living<00:01:31.750> in<00:01:31.840> a

agriculture systems and just living in a

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.330 
agriculture systems and just living in a
manner<00:01:32.110> that's<00:01:32.259> more<00:01:32.500> sustainable<00:01:32.649> and<00:01:33.160> I

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
manner that's more sustainable and I

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.249 
manner that's more sustainable and I
feel<00:01:33.580> like<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.880> students<00:01:34.390> really<00:01:34.750> get<00:01:35.050> that

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
feel like the students really get that

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.469 
feel like the students really get that
already<00:01:35.619> and<00:01:35.920> it's<00:01:36.100> been<00:01:36.340> fun<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:36.880> watch<00:01:37.119> when

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
already and it's been fun to watch when

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.200 
already and it's been fun to watch when
we<00:01:37.630> started<00:01:37.960> on<00:01:38.110> uncovering<00:01:38.910> you<00:01:39.910> know<00:01:40.030> some

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
we started on uncovering you know some

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.609 
we started on uncovering you know some
of<00:01:40.300> the<00:01:40.360> woodchips<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:40.930> exposing<00:01:41.440> some<00:01:41.590> of

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
of the woodchips and exposing some of

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.949 
of the woodchips and exposing some of
the<00:01:41.709> cardboard<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:42.280> head<00:01:42.670> about<00:01:43.300> you<00:01:43.600> know

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
the cardboard the head about you know

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:45.719 
the cardboard the head about you know
halfway<00:01:44.170> broken-down<00:01:44.740> at<00:01:45.009> this<00:01:45.160> point<00:01:45.399> the

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
halfway broken-down at this point the

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.270 
halfway broken-down at this point the
soil<00:01:46.090> seemed<00:01:46.300> very<00:01:46.600> alive<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:48.009> know<00:01:48.130> we

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
soil seemed very alive you know we

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.800 
soil seemed very alive you know we
noticed<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:48.700> there<00:01:48.940> was<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.090> whole<00:01:49.390> fungi

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
noticed that there was a whole fungi

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.840 
noticed that there was a whole fungi
Network<00:01:50.170> that<00:01:50.740> had<00:01:50.890> taken<00:01:51.069> place<00:01:51.220> we<00:01:51.580> noticed

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
Network that had taken place we noticed

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.240 
Network that had taken place we noticed
that<00:01:51.910> there<00:01:52.090> were<00:01:52.179> worms<00:01:52.619> probably<00:01:53.619> about<00:01:53.800> 15

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
that there were worms probably about 15

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.210 
that there were worms probably about 15
to<00:01:54.610> 20<00:01:54.910> worms<00:01:55.119> every<00:01:55.929> square<00:01:56.229> foot<00:01:56.289> so<00:01:57.009> what

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
to 20 worms every square foot so what

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.980 
to 20 worms every square foot so what
we're<00:01:57.340> talking<00:01:57.459> about<00:01:57.670> here<00:01:57.940> are<00:01:58.179> some<00:01:58.750> of<00:01:58.869> the

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
we're talking about here are some of the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.990 
we're talking about here are some of the
things<00:01:59.890> we're<00:02:00.069> putting<00:02:00.280> in<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.640> planting

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
assumption is that we're trying to

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.249 
assumption is that we're trying to
create<00:02:06.849> an<00:02:07.000> environment<00:02:07.509> that's<00:02:07.539> optimal<00:02:08.140> for

the plants to manifest their full
potential<00:02:10.599> so<00:02:10.869> our<00:02:10.990> objective<00:02:11.440> is<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.130> get<00:02:12.940> a

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
healthily functioning digestive tract

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.350 
healthily functioning digestive tract
that<00:02:14.890> has<00:02:15.370> access<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.790> all<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.030> food<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.330> needs

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
that has access to all the food it needs

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.470 
that has access to all the food it needs
so<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.170> plant<00:02:17.530> can<00:02:17.709> grow

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
so that plant can grow

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.140 
so that plant can grow
healthy<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.560> we<00:02:20.129> won't<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.550> full

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
healthy so we won't have a full

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.890 
healthy so we won't have a full
nutritional<00:02:21.690> profile<00:02:22.459> mineralogical

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
nutritional profile mineralogical

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.470 
nutritional profile mineralogical
biological<00:02:24.900> etc<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:26.730> everything<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.180> plant

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
biological etc of everything that plant

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.039 
biological etc of everything that plant
would<00:02:27.930> like<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.409> have<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.159> can<00:02:29.310> realize<00:02:30.120> its

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
would like to have so it can realize its

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.550 
would like to have so it can realize its
yield<00:02:31.709> growth<00:02:32.400> flavor<00:02:33.090> nutrition<00:02:33.780> pests

you know just on our way to making this
permaculture<00:04:13.730> garden<00:04:14.060> it's<00:04:14.269> gonna<00:04:14.359> be<00:04:14.510> a

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
permaculture garden it's gonna be a

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.270 
permaculture garden it's gonna be a
model<00:04:14.719> for<00:04:14.900> campuses<00:04:15.530> across<00:04:15.709> the<00:04:16.009> entire
