belt<00:02:25.470> carry<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:28.710> clips<00:02:29.070> are<00:02:29.340> very<00:02:29.760> good<00:02:30.030> it's

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
belt carry the clips are very good it's

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.890 
belt carry the clips are very good it's
a<00:02:30.360> spring<00:02:31.340> like<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.370> spring<00:02:32.820> clip<00:02:33.120> with<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
a spring like a spring clip with the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.530 
a spring like a spring clip with the
security<00:02:34.500> hook<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.950> bottom<00:02:35.400> when<00:02:36.240> you<00:02:36.360> put

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
security hook on the bottom when you put

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.400 
security hook on the bottom when you put
it<00:02:36.630> on<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> belt<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.380> close<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:39.120> actually

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
it on the belt and close it it actually

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.900 
it on the belt and close it it actually
like<00:02:40.410> kind<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.710> like<00:02:40.830> closed<00:02:41.190> up<00:02:41.430> completely

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
like kind of like closed up completely

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.970 
like kind of like closed up completely
so<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.240> cannot<00:02:42.510> even<00:02:42.750> if<00:02:42.960> you<00:02:43.080> force<00:02:43.710> it

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
so you cannot even if you force it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.150 
so you cannot even if you force it
upwards<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.420> does<00:02:45.750> not<00:02:46.020> go<00:02:46.350> down<00:02:46.710> from<00:02:47.070> the

belt because hook on that hook

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.210 
belt because hook on that hook
very<00:02:50.880> nice<00:02:51.120> very<00:02:51.660> good<00:02:51.720> retention<00:02:54.320> snap<00:02:55.320> nice

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
very nice very good retention snap nice

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.650 
very nice very good retention snap nice
retention<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:56.910> would<00:02:57.150> have<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.390> shake<00:02:57.630> it

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
retention you would have to shake it

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.310 
retention you would have to shake it
really<00:02:58.110> hard<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.530> get<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.770> out<00:02:59.000> but<00:03:00.000> yet<00:03:00.320> one

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
really hard to get it out but yet one

on the right spot pops right out nice so

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.370 
on the right spot pops right out nice so
here<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:07.950> see<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.520> serial<00:03:08.940> number

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
here it is you see the serial number

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.000 
here it is you see the serial number
name<00:03:10.400> this<00:03:11.400> was<00:03:11.790> struction<00:03:12.390> coded<00:03:12.840> before<00:03:13.010> but

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
name this was struction coded before but

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.370 
name this was struction coded before but
when<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:14.550> was<00:03:14.760> sharpening<00:03:15.210> it<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.720> decided<00:03:16.110> to

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
when I was sharpening it I decided to

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.110 
when I was sharpening it I decided to
get<00:03:16.530> rid<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.980> traction<00:03:17.400> coding<00:03:17.760> for<00:03:18.090> a

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
get rid of the traction coding for a

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.790 
get rid of the traction coding for a
better<00:03:18.390> cutting<00:03:19.100> optional<00:03:20.100> capabilities<00:03:20.820> and

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
better cutting optional capabilities and

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.860 
better cutting optional capabilities and
also<00:03:22.800> it's<00:03:22.980> it's<00:03:23.190> smaller<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:24.209> looks<00:03:24.570> pretty

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
also it's it's smaller it looks pretty

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.570 
also it's it's smaller it looks pretty
cool<00:03:25.080> too<00:03:25.520> but<00:03:26.520> it's<00:03:27.060> more<00:03:27.330> most<00:03:27.660> for<00:03:28.020> the

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
cool too but it's more most for the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.010 
cool too but it's more most for the
performance<00:03:29.580> it's<00:03:29.850> it's<00:03:30.150> better<00:03:30.420> the

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
performance it's it's better the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.190 
performance it's it's better the
traction<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.590> really<00:03:32.010> heavy-duty<00:03:32.330> so<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.900> gets

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
traction is really heavy-duty so it gets

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.910 
traction is really heavy-duty so it gets
in<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.380> way<00:03:35.690> this<00:03:36.690> part<00:03:37.110> acts<00:03:37.380> like<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.650> hatchet

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
in a way this part acts like a hatchet

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.449 
in a way this part acts like a hatchet
with<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.790> weight<00:03:39.770> incredible<00:03:40.770> good<00:03:41.010> strokes

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
with the weight incredible good strokes

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.390 
with the weight incredible good strokes
you<00:03:41.580> can<00:03:41.760> pull<00:03:41.970> incredible<00:03:42.870> chopper<00:03:43.400> also

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
you can pull incredible chopper also

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.210 
you can pull incredible chopper also
good<00:03:44.670> for<00:03:44.820> burning<00:03:45.440> like<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.560> said<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:46.950> saw

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
good for burning like I said the saw

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.460 
good for burning like I said the saw
isn't<00:03:47.670> really<00:03:47.910> for<00:03:48.120> sewing<00:03:48.630> but<00:03:48.930> more<00:03:49.320> like

isn't really for sewing but more like
for<00:03:49.650> notching<00:03:52.070> this<00:03:53.070> part<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.610> very<00:03:53.640> hard<00:03:54.180> to

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
for notching this part is very hard to

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.770 
for notching this part is very hard to
sharpen<00:03:54.780> for<00:03:55.020> me<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:56.160> can<00:03:56.940> sharpen<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.570> knife

I'm<00:03:58.140> not<00:03:58.350> a<00:03:58.380> master<00:03:58.650> sharpener<00:03:59.340> but<00:03:59.520> I<00:03:59.580> can<00:03:59.790> I

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
I'm not a master sharpener but I can I

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.030 
I'm not a master sharpener but I can I
can<00:04:00.270> handle<00:04:00.600> some<00:04:00.780> knives<00:04:00.989> but<00:04:01.380> this<00:04:01.709> guy<00:04:01.980> is

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040
