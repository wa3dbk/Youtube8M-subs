00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.430
 Copacabana neighborhood I think that from here 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.890

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:31.380
 very beautiful vision and up there always 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.479

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.680
 redeemer 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:42.930
 look at it with this look of the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.380
 the top of Babylon's hill on the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.380

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.750
 track we found this building 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.370

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.820
 integrated a larger fortification 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.570
 generally use the environment as 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.489
 camouflage is the proof of the projectiles 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.680
 interesting enemies here 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.860

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.170
 45 the city's defense system has returned 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.630
 to be fired and the Brazilian army 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.299
 built house kills on the hill 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.340
 to protect the city against possible 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:57.630
 attacks maintaining coastal surveillance 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:01.170

 You're going to see this beautiful look. 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.909
 We are here on the top of the hill now. 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:52.389

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:55.150
 side of the south river viewpoint from where 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:58.150
