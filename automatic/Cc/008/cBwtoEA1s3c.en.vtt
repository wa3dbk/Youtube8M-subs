 acquiring new bad 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.740
 we primarily invest their 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.029
 funds in comfort silence 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.259

 this is a capital investment and here we are 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.129
 tell you home 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.439
 what is different from metalplastic 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:18.080
 folkner 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.310
 and how to choose for yourself the best qualities 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.810
 this will help you avoid buying a cat 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.779
 in the bag focusing only on the name of Athos 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.289
 for questions r price or in general advertising 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.310
 phrases 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.450
 first plastic metal experiment 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.660
 windows choice Khabarovsk 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.490
 one of the best profiles on 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.629
 Russian market 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.900
 considered to be in the profile of the century 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.040
 characteristics of this profile were taken 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.670
 quality and coupon when writing them 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.980
 Russian guests 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.620
 shores designed specifically for 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.490
 complex climate 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.559
 conditions northwest 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.159
 excellent cold resistant 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:54.389
 plastic profile 

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:56.759
 which over the years will not turn yellow and not 

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:57.870
 cracked 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.739
 but the profile is just plastic 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.489
 each plastic window Hussein 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.710
 reinforced inside metals then ukok 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.200
 us actually carries the name 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.130
 metal plastic 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.440
 note here that the addresses are opening 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.880
 sash windows can make up more 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.740
 seventy kilograms 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.079
 Needless to say no plastic this weight 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:19.800
 hold down 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.020
 In general, the karama is mounted in the window 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.510
 opening and will support sash 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.310
 However, not all of this falls off and 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.980
 denies precisely due to the metal 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.900
 that the window was stable they 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.620
 resilient as founders should 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.370
 apply durable steel pipe 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.270
 closed square section 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.430
 these are four brothers stiffness and such 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.260
 geometry combined with special 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.320
 Stalin allows you to achieve from 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.830
 superior statistical 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.390
 indicators book avoid unpleasant 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.060
 surprises prescription sash and 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.719
 yet 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.719
 very often cogan makers 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.499
 for economies on quality enhances 

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.090
 window profile for example pipe pl 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.040
 figuratively visiting 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.080
 the choice of accessories is also very important 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.119
 hardware is actually a mechanic 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.140
 all plastic windows if old 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.530
 wooden windows is one or 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.320
 two pens and a pair of children who are mechanics here 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.930
 should be located around 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.259
 perimeter opening on target 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.279
 turning a single handle 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:25.749
 makes complex elements slide 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.349
 mechanics around the perimeter of the sash 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.010
 uneven effort 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.519
 press the sash tap no less than 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.149
 five six points 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:37.069
 Of course, the quality of the metal from which 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.499
 no pore was made 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.629
 attack its technology sense from 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.349
 correct assembly and configuration depends 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.259
 I love very much 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:47.019
 best type fittings on 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.099
 today is russia 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.849

 waxing at the molecular level 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.180
 unlike now Domodedovo 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.060
 much better tolerated in our 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.300
 difficult weather conditions and in general 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.559
 quality haul and toddlers 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:11.329
 fittings must be in profile 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.459
 opening sash practically 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.789
 around the perimeter 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.539
 ap mode hardware must also be 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:19.559
 evenly distributed throughout 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:22.019
 perimeter window should close sites 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.619
 soft them without much effort 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.019
 to facilitate the work of mechanisms and 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.089
 unload heavy windows 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:31.189
 sash window must necessarily 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.199
 be equipped with a micro lift and 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:34.989
 blocker wrong 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.059
 opening 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:38.349
 lifter support sash 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.829
 below thanks to him substantially 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.529
 massive load decreases 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:44.380
 double glazing accessories

 over the frame 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.050
 and soft in rolls prices special 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.860
 pad lock wrong 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.660
 opening prevents 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.080
 erroneous turn the dog handle but 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.100
 in front because they did not hang on one 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.390
 a loop that can pull out the window mechanism 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.719
 out of service 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:04.669
 an important element of design and quality 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.029
 is a rubber doll days 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:08.949
 now there is an opportunity 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.009
 complete side on new 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:12.849
 high quality courage personally 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:13.819
 the winner 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.160
 not a black light color that 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.049
 God will give us a completely new 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.870
 stylish elegant design 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.040
 besides this window sealer 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.830
 does not stain plastic arrival Kohang less 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.650
 subject to aggressive environments and 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.729
 aging effect 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.169
 quality is also important 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.180
 montage 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.820
 just make a level deviation 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.660
 when mounting the frame just a few 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.759
 millimeters

 plastic window replacement 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:48.489
 it is therefore very desirable that 

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:50.349
 installation was done only
