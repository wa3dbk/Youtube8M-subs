batteries<00:03:01.650> on<00:03:01.799> it<00:03:01.829> yet<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:02.209> let's<00:03:03.209> just<00:03:03.480> open

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
batteries on it yet so let's just open

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:11.629 
batteries on it yet so let's just open
this<00:03:03.810> up<00:03:09.379> cracking<00:03:10.379> noise<00:03:10.530> there<00:03:10.829> therefore

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
this up cracking noise there therefore

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.759 
this up cracking noise there therefore
much<00:03:12.599> thing<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:12.989> want<00:03:13.109> to<00:03:13.139> hear<00:03:13.290> particularly

better<00:03:13.920> will<00:03:14.340> they<00:03:14.870> open<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.049> battery<00:03:21.470> ok

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
better will they open the battery ok

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.199 
better will they open the battery ok
shut<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:24.840> over<00:03:25.200> there<00:03:25.519> so<00:03:26.519> that<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:26.939> can<00:03:27.090> go

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209
