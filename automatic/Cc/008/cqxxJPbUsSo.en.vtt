00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:18.042
 Earth is too big, mother. 

00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:22.607
 You can make it smaller. 

00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:27.485
 Listen to my voice! 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.570
 Imagine an island, 

00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:32.638
 out on the ocean. 

00:00:33.268 --> 00:00:34.468
 You see? 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:37.829
 I see. 

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:43.674
 My son was on the bus! 

00:00:45.853 --> 00:00:48.053
 He saw what Clark did. 

00:00:51.527 --> 00:00:54.300
 You must keep this self secret. 

00:00:54.504 --> 00:00:56.204
 What should I do? 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.129
 Let them die? 

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:02.685
 May. 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.169
 NEXT SUMMER 

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.325
 I have a lot of questions. 

00:01:10.472 --> 00:01:11.772
 Where do I come from? 

00:01:20.138 --> 00:01:23.276
 You have to decide what kind of person you want to become, Clark. 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.550
 Either way you decide ... 

00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:33.485
 ... that will change the world. 

00:01:45.044 --> 00:01:47.247
 ZACK SNYDER FROM "WATCHMEN" AND "300" ORDER 

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:57.800
 AND CHRISTOPHER NOLAN FROM "THE DARK LOVER" TRILOGY ORDER 

00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:07.780
 My dad thought the world knew who I was, 

00:02:08.057 --> 00:02:09.357
 kitaszítanának. 

00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:12.321
 He was convinced that the world ... 

00:02:12.953 --> 00:02:14.153
 ... not yet ready. 

00:02:15.848 --> 00:02:17.248
 What do you think? 

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:21.849
