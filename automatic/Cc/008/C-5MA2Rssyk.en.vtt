 Why do you want to tell him about ramen ? 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:31.850
 But the convenience and value of 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:36.950
 If it was delicious, I would eat it. 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.240
 Ramen is delicious because its artificial seasoning is called his and shish 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.370
 I heard

 So it's delicious, so people are not the only ones who work 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.090

 What if some sections when pretending eopjyo very much 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:58.220
 It is very, very bad for my health.

 First, ramen made from white flour 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:08.179
 In the whole tract, vitamins, minerals, plant nutrients, fibrous 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.969
 Only just about okay, because many nutrients tansu Lorca haebeo it during 4 

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:15.289
 It's hard to leave one thing. 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:17.380
 And when the power is so lost that we lose the powder 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:21.159
 So called 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.300
 For those minerals that contain bleach 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.990
 Immigration of radeon 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.890
 As you know that iodine 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.220
 Competing with iodine in many cases for seaweeds 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.900

 No. 2 should be very armed with the enemy and the more thyroid gland thyroid 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.100
 Rather, there is a hormonal 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:48.609
 Because iodine discards brownies from this place 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:55.420
 I do not want to have iodine. So, thyroid hormone 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:59.560
 Shem's health is gone. So If you like to continue their hard sweat 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:04.840
 Something that causes the urethra to run out and the thyroid to grow itself 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:09.640
 Recently, patients are very much at the thyroid gland 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:14.380

 As little bug going to the opening Lamy language 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:43.980
 I've heard a lot of incredibly little amounts, so if that is white flour 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.800
 And artificial seasonings, which are called adosh, and various other sciences 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.540
 Materials and a little bit of work
