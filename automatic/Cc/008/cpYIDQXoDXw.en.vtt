create<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.460> miniature<00:00:45.020> landscape<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.680> would

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
create a miniature landscape that would

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.010 
create a miniature landscape that would
appeal<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.640> draw<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> nearest<00:00:48.570> fairies

and gnomes in wood sprites as with any
container<00:00:51.780> garden<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.230> have<00:00:52.260> drainage<00:00:52.890> in

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
container garden we have drainage in

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.770 
container garden we have drainage in
here<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.640> don't<00:00:53.910> want<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.300> bottom

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.380 
here because you don't want that bottom
layer<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.050> soil<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:56.039> get<00:00:56.129> soggy<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> real

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
layer of soil to get soggy and be a real

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.660 
layer of soil to get soggy and be a real
invitation<00:00:58.020> for<00:00:58.170> bacteria<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.399> want<00:00:59.579> to

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
so we have a lot of things to choose

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.710 
so we have a lot of things to choose
from<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.409> typically<00:01:05.040> start<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:06.270> little<00:01:06.570> bit

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
from I typically start with a little bit

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.590 
from I typically start with a little bit
of<00:01:06.840> something<00:01:07.380> tall<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.580> want<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> variety

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
of something tall you want the variety

of something tall you want the variety
of<00:01:09.630> height<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.530> plant<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.610> leaf<00:01:11.820> texture<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
of height and plant and leaf texture and

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.960 
of height and plant and leaf texture and
we're<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.590> going<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.950> make<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.549> little

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
we're just going to make this a little

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.649 
we're just going to make this a little
tiny<00:01:15.450> hole<00:01:15.780> tuck<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.890> nicely<00:01:17.540> backfill<00:01:18.540> it

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
tiny hole tuck it in nicely backfill it

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.920 
tiny hole tuck it in nicely backfill it
a<00:01:18.750> little<00:01:18.930> bit<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:20.549> looks<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:21.000> exactly

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
a little bit and that looks like exactly

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.630 
a little bit and that looks like exactly
where<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.350> would<00:01:22.680> want<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.920> sit<00:01:23.189> if<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.490> was<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
where I would want to sit if I was a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.820 
where I would want to sit if I was a
little<00:01:23.850> known<00:01:24.030> another<00:01:24.990> tall<00:01:25.259> plant<00:01:25.560> would<00:01:25.680> be

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
little known another tall plant would be

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.219 
little known another tall plant would be
good<00:01:26.119> we're<00:01:27.119> gonna<00:01:27.210> take<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.659> off<00:01:27.780> save<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
good we're gonna take it off save the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.120 
good we're gonna take it off save the
tag<00:01:28.820> there<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:30.030> go

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
tag there we go

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.200 
tag there we go
tickle<00:01:32.130> those<00:01:32.220> roots<00:01:32.520> open<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.119> open

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
tickle those roots open just to open

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.660 
tickle those roots open just to open
them<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.600> tiny<00:01:33.930> little<00:01:34.229> bit<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> maybe<00:01:35.400> put

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
them up a tiny little bit and maybe put

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.710 
them up a tiny little bit and maybe put
