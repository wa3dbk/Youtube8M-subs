00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
they're so big one it's figure is back

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.040 
they're so big one it's figure is back
again<00:02:14.680> smaller<00:02:15.300> making<00:02:16.300> your<00:02:16.510> final<00:02:16.690> drive

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
again smaller making your final drive

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.720

I<00:02:21.010> just<00:02:22.010> pulled<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.370> decomp<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.970> kill<00:02:23.180> it

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
I just pulled the decomp to kill it

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.039 
I just pulled the decomp to kill it
that's<00:02:23.930> why<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.170> sounded<00:02:24.500> weird<00:02:25.569> so<00:02:26.569> yeah<00:02:26.840> for
