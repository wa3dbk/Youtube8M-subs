creative<00:00:30.029> people<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.630> work<00:00:30.840> with<00:00:30.869> very<00:00:31.289> strict

creative people I work with very strict

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.350 
creative people I work with very strict
people<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:33.000> work<00:00:33.180> with<00:00:33.320> visionaries

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360

down with the pen

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.030 
down with the pen
Oh

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:01:05.550 

supercharged

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.310 

sometimes<00:01:06.560> I'll<00:01:06.890> be<00:01:07.100> rehearsing<00:01:07.790> for<00:01:08.510> six

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
sometimes I'll be rehearsing for six

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.700 
sometimes I'll be rehearsing for six
hours<00:01:09.770> eight<00:01:10.160> hours<00:01:10.700> non-stop<00:01:11.150> every<00:01:12.080> day<00:01:12.290> and

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
hours eight hours non-stop every day and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:36.730 
hours eight hours non-stop every day and
it'll<00:01:12.980> be<00:01:13.100> for<00:01:13.400> really<00:01:13.910> a<00:01:13.940> fifteen<00:01:14.480> minute

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.480 

I<00:01:36.829> think<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.820> hardest<00:01:38.270> part<00:01:39.020> of<00:01:39.490> rehearsing

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
I think the hardest part of rehearsing

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.550 
I think the hardest part of rehearsing
is<00:01:41.229> giving<00:01:42.229> it<00:01:42.320> your<00:01:42.439> all<00:01:42.500> every<00:01:43.399> time<00:01:43.670> and

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
is giving it your all every time and

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.190 
is giving it your all every time and
believing<00:01:45.560> that<00:01:45.590> it's<00:01:46.220> going<00:01:46.549> to<00:01:46.670> truly<00:01:47.659> pay

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
believing that it's going to truly pay

00:01:48.200 --> 00:02:03.540 
believing that it's going to truly pay
back

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.880 

I<00:02:03.640> like<00:02:04.180> to<00:02:04.300> have<00:02:04.450> fun<00:02:04.690> when<00:02:04.930> I'm<00:02:05.020> rehearsing<00:02:05.380> I

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
I like to have fun when I'm rehearsing I

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.880 
I like to have fun when I'm rehearsing I
like<00:02:06.640> to<00:02:06.910> get<00:02:07.570> out<00:02:07.720> my<00:02:07.900> nerves<00:02:08.200> while<00:02:08.710> I'm

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
like to get out my nerves while I'm

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.650 
like to get out my nerves while I'm
rehearsing<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:09.670> that<00:02:09.820> I'm<00:02:09.910> not<00:02:09.940> nervous<00:02:10.330> on

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
rehearsing so that I'm not nervous on

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:24.320 
rehearsing so that I'm not nervous on
stage<00:02:21.510> it's<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:22.720> important<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.440> not<00:02:23.650> be

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
stage it's so important to not be

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.610 
stage it's so important to not be
self-conscious<00:02:25.330> because<00:02:26.170> it's<00:02:26.320> all<00:02:26.470> about

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
self-conscious because it's all about

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.520 
self-conscious because it's all about
how<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.070> look<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.790> how<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.420> move<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.260> all

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
how you look and how you move and all

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.280 
how you look and how you move and all
about<00:02:29.980> these<00:02:30.250> physical<00:02:30.970> aesthetics<00:02:31.600> but<00:02:31.960> it

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
about these physical aesthetics but it

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.200 
about these physical aesthetics but it
really<00:02:32.740> should<00:02:32.950> be<00:02:33.070> about<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.550> audience<00:02:33.970> it

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
really should be about the audience it

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.150 
really should be about the audience it
should<00:02:34.420> be<00:02:34.570> about<00:02:34.840> giving<00:02:35.110> them<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.590> good<00:02:35.860> show

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.300 
should be about giving them a good show
really<00:02:36.790> shouldn't<00:02:37.210> be<00:02:37.570> an<00:02:37.990> ego<00:02:38.500> based

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310
