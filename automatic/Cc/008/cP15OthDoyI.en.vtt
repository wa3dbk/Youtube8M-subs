00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.200
 top 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.370
 hello and welcome to the best recipe 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.780
 this is Luis Alberto Oviedo and for 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.130
 continue with the fish block and 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.840
 I'm going to teach you how to prepare seafood 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.640
 calamari with huitlacoche sauce 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.460
 for the huitlacoche sauce we are going to 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.500
 need 40 milliliters of oil 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.800
 olive 40 grams of finely onion 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.340
 chopped 10 grams of finely chopped garlic 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.550
 200 grams of corn smut 3 leaves 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.610
 epazote 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.040
 for the squid we're going to need 40 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.559
 milliliters of olive oil 3 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.190
 calamari baby 15 milliliters of wine 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.449
 white salt and pepper to taste for 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.629
 start preparing our huitlacoche 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.769
 we already have to sell the hot oil 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.879
 and good first thing we have to 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.879
 add is the onion 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.479
 we have to wait almost throne a bit 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.070
 that is to say that it releases the juices as we go 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.130
 to know this when the onion starts to 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.810
 take a transparent tone 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.770
 followed by the onion 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.770
 add the garlic 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.450
 and we add the huitlacoche 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.310
 let them sauté for a few more minutes 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.320
 when the car take one more color 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.320
 we can already add the epazote 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.760
 and we let him skip a few more minutes 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.760
 so that the infusion 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.909
 once our huitlacoche is 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.380
 ready rectify the sun and we will 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.210
 reserve half for the filling of the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.610
 squid and the other half for our 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.820
 huitlacoche sauce for salsa 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.820
 huitlacoche 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.450
 we put it in the blender 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.320
 and we add a little liquid to 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.160
 facilitate your work and to improve 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.160
 texture of the sauce 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.130
 once our sauce has this 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.140
 texture we reserve for our assembly 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.910
 to clean our squid we have 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.680
 that separate the body from the rest of the 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.180
 head then what we have to do 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.180
 is to pull 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.010
 and unfortunately we started here 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.120
 we have to do with our fingers so that 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.610
 out 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.750
 the rest 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.750
 that is very clean 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.720
 in this peak is going to feel something hard is 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.800
 the cartilage of the squid then 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.800
 we have to start it 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.470
 and we remove the skin 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.520
 the squids are from the same family as 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.250
 the octopus and the sepia that is to say they are 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.410
 molluscs what differentiates them is that 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.850
 they have a longer head and they have 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.610
 this pair of fins 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.400
 and that not only have eight tentacles 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.400
 but they have a couple more tentacles 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.989
 long 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.659
 once we remove the skin to the 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.659
 squid head we cut the fins 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.860
 and we cut them into juliana 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.380
 the next thing we have to do is 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.960
 flip the head of the calama this is 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.470
 purely aesthetic since it is not going to 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.470
 affect the taste 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.130
 once we have the head of our 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.290
 flipped squid 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.900
 we will take the rest of the body and we will 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.580
 separate the tentacles from the rest of the 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.030
 head here carefully because sometimes 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.800
 You can skip some ink and 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.190
 remove the squid's mouth just 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.190
 Push 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.180
 finally the squid fins 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.180
 we cut in julienne 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.850
 the next thing we have to do is 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.480
 Fill our calamari with the 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.850
 huitlacoche 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.850
 trying to make it tight 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.349
 that are about two centimeters 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.910
 from the edge of the head this is so that 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.400
 the time to sauté the stuffing does not 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.199
 come out the next thing we're going to do is 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.000
 sauté the squid for this we are going to 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.599
 need to enjoy you have oil and 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.599
 hot the only thing we're going to do is 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.599
 seasoning 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.970
 and in a pan we are going to put our 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.970
 calama heads already stuffed 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.740
 and in another pan 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.740
 our tentacles along with the fins 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.740
 the tentacles and the fins are going to 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.919
 miss until they have a red tone 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.450
 pink while the heads 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.830
 squid we're going to sauté 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.830
 get a golden crust 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.990
 to the tentacles and the fins we are going to 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.990
 lose weight with white wine 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.910
 to remove all the seats that 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.340
 they could have stayed and take advantage of 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.670
 concentration of flavors we let reduce 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.210
 this and good we hope that they are in their 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:44.980
 point to assemble our saucer let's 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.980
 to put the sauce as a base 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:56.939
 Lets put 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.939
 a perfect step leaf 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.140
 the calamari at tel 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:09.210
 the 30 with the tentacles 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.070
 Finally 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.830
 Lets put 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:17.770
 a fried pumpkin flower too 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.229
 to give height the saucer 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.710
 and well is the final presentation of 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.710
 our own 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:31.509
 I hope you enjoyed it and the 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.110
 we look forward to next week at the best 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:34.110
 recipe for this
