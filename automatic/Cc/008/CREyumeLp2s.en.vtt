00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.639
 a real airplane has a span of 10 meters 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.210
 so it has a take-off weight of 700 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.270
 kilogram can carry a payload 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.750
 300 kilograms all aircraft 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.949
 aircraft type assume takeoff from 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.490
 runway and shortened in 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.910
 pp 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.010
 if the apparatus and heavy up is used 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.489
 Python on the runway 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.350
 if the pair is there easier than the type of aircraft 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.890
 An-2 for example who can fly with 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.260
 dirt strip but still it should 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.899
 be dense enough soil dense 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.730
 ground that provides pressure but 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.640
 at least 5 kilograms per square 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.739
 centimeter which means our pressure 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.989
 pillows from on 100 kilograms on 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.430
 square centimeter 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.840
 so on this highway we can 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.020
 pass on any ground 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.250
 we can pass through swampy arable land 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.070
 eg meadow 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.350
 we can take off the list we can 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.110
 We can take off from the water with fly 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.210
 snow that is, we are not tied to 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.910
 runway and that is not 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.680
 tied to a specific world 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.290
 technically it was very difficult because 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.390
 we had to solve problems that 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.430
 are at the junction of various sciences 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.020
 we started designing exactly from the highway 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.270
 on air cushions created 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:30.330
 integral layout which could 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.510
 made a form that cushion us 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.430
 the air membrane more precisely it rests 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.790
 in flight and does not spoil the aerodynamics 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.800
 the planes we made the highway and didn't spoil 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.440
 at the same time the plane means this here 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.570
 model she weighs an example of 32 kilograms 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.500
 if you push on it can not move on 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.650
 from place 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.950
 well worth the air and the model can 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.320
 easy to move by hand now i 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.780
 I will turn on electric fans 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.780
 eat and you will see 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.090
 cat admixture 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.780
 with my fingers 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.780
 hovercraft 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.820
 air lubrication 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.510
 exactly 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.920
 the plane can slide on any 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.440
 underlying surface 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.790
 this is the highlight and 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.790
 the uniqueness of this car
