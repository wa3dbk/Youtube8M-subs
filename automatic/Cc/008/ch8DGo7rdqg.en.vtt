A historic surge heads to Chile, Peru, and Mexico

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
…in a matter of one week.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I was in Europe participating in some tournaments, but the swell had such magnitude that it caught the attention of all big wave surfers.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Hey Ramon… Ok perfect, I'll call you once I'm in Santiago. Bye.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.000
Every time Ramon and I see on the Internet that the waves have perfect conditions, we do our best to follow them… 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:47.500
So, we went to Chile, Peru and Mexico. The next morning we went directly to Ramon's house and there weren't any waves.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.500
It went down a bit.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.000
It was a relief to see that the swell had arrived, because this meant it would make it to Peru and Mexico.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.500
Good session men! Amazing.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We didn't make our flight that night to Peru. We had to sleep at the airport,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:44.000
so that we would get the first flight in the morning. We knew that the swell would be there in the course of the morning.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Pico Alto is a wave that is more intense then dangerous.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:13.500
Ramon surfed really well that day. At the final he fell and hit himself with his board.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.000
Then he didn't have time to catch some air because the wave pulled him in…

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
so he had a tough time. Unfortunately, we couldn't count on a great surfer for Puerto Escondido.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
This is probably one of the most difficult projects that I've participated in my life, 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.000
because of the importance of the waves, the magnitude of the swell and the physical effort that it demanded.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000
For me it was a new experience. I've never surfed in Puerto Escondido with waves of that magnitude. I saw a mountain of water behind me,

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:15.000
did a half turn and started paddling like crazy… and my board went perfectly with the wave.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:23.500
Thank God I did everything ok and got the chance to see one of the greatest visions that I've seen in a while.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
We took a chance… and its true that sometimes you can lose, but when you win, you can win a lot.
