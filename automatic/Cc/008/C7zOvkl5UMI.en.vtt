 moin moin and welcome to 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.389
 new video at vw distributors and today 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.160
 Of course I always have ten 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.140
 preview picture could already remove 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.720
 a g loader of trainer some 40 g 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.310
 loader displace and out again 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.019
 First, the more displeased to go anyway 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.599
 make no displacer 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.300
 has seen live so are the things out 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.800
 here are ball bearings in there or 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.150
 world situation I do not really know what 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.700
 for camps that are now definitely 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.469
 still there, the wave is still going through 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.530
 then we are tight rings in it 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.649
 and that's where they usually sit 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.149
 trim and the dense I afford 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.359
 have even trim says that's yes 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.690
 something of wrong we sit in it too 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.430
 tight again 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.739
 and yes, you can be very nice here too 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.260
 Here you can still the g Lader drives 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.160
 recognize this kÃ¼ber nossol g loader fed 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.620
 Whatever the maintenance of the loader 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.160
 this lubricated on these contracts 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.520
 will have on the repressive and here 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.410
 we again the original vw logo too 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.890
 See, this is a real one 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:23.130
 repressions then act the other side 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.150
 the reason why I displaced these 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:31.500
 Show because is broken you can see it completely 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.670
 clearly here is again a neat 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.290
 taken out of the way 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.000
 As you can see here very good 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.010
 Comparison of this is all right and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.110
 here is just one side 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.480
 The leaders broke out for the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.110
 well, that is very much 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.540
 what a shame 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.100
 and yes, I know what this is 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.190
 not I have as yet 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.630
 seen that this is for an opel 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.930
 equal to know that someone here from my 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.120
 watch what this is for a thing 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.570
 so and so you can clearly 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.170
 the traces of the tracks now look neat 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.410
 dust on it and then of course the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.560
 SG bearing for more damage and you 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.450
 to see more damage except you 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.190
 Broken leadership that afford you 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.930
 for the first time out again 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.310
 of course with my fingers now 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.200
 I also passed my camera here 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.319
 do not ruin it 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.870
 so he looks from the displacer I have 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.750
 sometime also times on ebay auctioned 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.250
 for very little money as I said 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.830
 a little crazy and collector 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.959
 collect these g data parts though 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.450
 These are broken and I already have 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.530
 eternities have the four times too 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.750
 I'll clean that too now 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.670
 soon you will do that too 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.379
 maybe I can touch normally 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.900
 you then again a video if 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.900
 I completely cleaned the thing and 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.970
 somehow I would like to have this thing 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.599
 Out of here but I believe that 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.980
 will be squeezed out here again 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.299
 a warehouse but that is completely 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.130
 scrap as you can see here 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.810
 Somebody is displaced by this 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.390
 it's too busy here 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.760
 something scratched no idea 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.680
 at which company the man was to 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.130
 repair to overhaul or what 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.170
 always 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.239
 or what this funny nails 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.840
 as I said no idea here 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.609
 but sometimes I have one too 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.639
 not seen so good that was first 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:29.680
 a defective bought on ebay 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:31.389
 won w40 displacer and yes if 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.310
 you saw the video and you can 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.900
 some of my questions and ignorance 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.040
 answer me that in the 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.170
 comments really very much 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.069
 are also interested in these pens 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.690
 here and that, albeit g 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.190
 loader screw at home has that 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.840
 like to get rid of and say 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.410
 throw away too bad I would 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.079
 looking forward 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.810
 contact me and tell me something 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.280
 want to get rid of the water and me 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.530
 give your thumbs up if that's you 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.519
 video has fallen new vw fan 3 was 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.519
 until the next video 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.720
 in the off you can also switch off 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.580
 rd 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.659
 then you can take these and not 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.860
 to enjoy the students full hd quality 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.370
 should you really get that this 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:19.500
 the Kremlin dusty the situation well in a 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:24.970
 crate are minimal scratch marks but the 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:26.660
 Remove from falling not on the 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.830
 blissfully beautiful 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.390
 and nothing arrived 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.660
 actually original jersey 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:40.440
 Also take Volkswagen in the pen to me 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.440
 8 71 85 36 79 in front 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.580
 the two lived here too 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.650
 still fully intact is really out 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:57.400
 never tells in that 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.400
 tree had been good so that's it
