00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
processor is also unlocked which means I

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.810 
processor is also unlocked which means I
can<00:02:14.260> overclock<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.010> as<00:02:15.130> high<00:02:15.460> as<00:02:15.520> I

can overclock it to as high as I
possibly<00:02:16.270> want<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.750> also<00:02:17.110> don't<00:02:17.320> recommend<00:02:17.500> the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
possibly want I also don't recommend the
