00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
couple different ways to do it um based

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.340 
couple different ways to do it um based
on<00:00:34.320> like<00:00:34.620> either<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.920> vertical<00:00:35.190> plane<00:00:35.640> or<00:00:35.940> a

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
on like either a vertical plane or a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.139 
on like either a vertical plane or a
horizontal<00:00:37.350> plane<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:40.579> what<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.670> need<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.820> do

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
horizontal plane so what you need to do

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.810 
horizontal plane so what you need to do
is<00:00:42.590> use<00:00:43.590> put<00:00:43.829> one<00:00:44.010> arm<00:00:44.190> over<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> other<00:00:44.610> like

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
really want to happen cross and then

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.069 
really want to happen cross and then
just<00:00:55.559> or<00:00:56.520> top<00:00:56.879> grab<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:58.579> and

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
so up to the side it's going to come

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.679 
so up to the side it's going to come
down<00:01:30.580> you<00:01:30.610> want<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:31.000> make<00:01:31.150> sure<00:01:31.180> that<00:01:31.509> it's

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
down you want to make sure that it's

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.530 
down you want to make sure that it's
Piggy's<00:01:32.490> touching<00:01:33.490> your<00:01:33.640> bag<00:01:34.350> little<00:01:35.350> stay<00:01:36.540> on

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the flat plane so you end up like this

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.170 
the flat plane so you end up like this
and<00:01:42.970> then<00:01:43.869> it's<00:01:44.049> just<00:01:44.170> going<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.470> come<00:01:44.710> down

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and then it's just going to come down

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.050 
and then it's just going to come down
like<00:01:46.180> this<00:01:46.420> my<00:01:46.810> arms<00:01:47.170> didn't<00:01:47.560> move<00:01:47.909> from<00:01:48.909> these

like this my arms didn't move from these

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.520 
like this my arms didn't move from these
place<00:01:49.330> on<00:01:49.539> the<00:01:49.630> hoop<00:01:49.869> you<00:01:50.020> see<00:01:50.229> it's<00:01:50.350> still

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
place on the hoop you see it's still

00:01:50.530 --> 00:02:02.450 
place on the hoop you see it's still
here<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:55.600> go<00:01:55.840> like<00:01:55.990> this<00:01:56.259> so<00:01:58.080> I'm<00:01:59.080> not

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.529 

like<00:02:03.460> this<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:04.750> our<00:02:04.960> fold<00:02:05.970> this<00:02:06.970> one<00:02:07.210> comes

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
like this this our fold this one comes

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:14.970 
like this this our fold this one comes
out<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:10.209> back<00:02:10.959> down<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.560> keep<00:02:14.920> doing

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
out and back down and so you keep doing

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.740 
out and back down and so you keep doing
this

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
this

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.270 
this
however<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.770> can<00:02:18.160> go<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.150> other<00:02:19.330> way<00:02:19.450> but

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
however you can go the other way but

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.860 
however you can go the other way but
that's<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.460> little<00:02:21.640> bit<00:02:22.020> more<00:02:24.270> does<00:02:25.270> it<00:02:25.390> feel<00:02:25.690> is

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
that's a little bit more does it feel is

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.380 
that's a little bit more does it feel is
right<00:02:26.170> if<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.710> really<00:02:26.890> want<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.370> do<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:27.970> then

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
right if you really want to do that then

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.000 
right if you really want to do that then
I<00:02:28.480> would<00:02:28.660> say<00:02:28.950> put<00:02:29.950> your<00:02:30.160> arms<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.880> just<00:02:32.010> go

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
I would say put your arms and just go

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.790 
I would say put your arms and just go
this<00:02:33.190> way<00:02:36.480> but<00:02:37.480> really<00:02:37.840> it's<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.230> skidding

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
this way but really it's the skidding

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.700 
this way but really it's the skidding
this<00:02:39.570> crossing<00:02:40.570> and<00:02:40.840> playing<00:02:41.140> with<00:02:41.380> what<00:02:41.590> you

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
this crossing and playing with what you

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.270 
this crossing and playing with what you
could<00:02:41.860> do<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.970> other<00:02:43.150> way<00:02:43.390> of<00:02:43.420> doing<00:02:43.930> this

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
could do so the other way of doing this

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.230 
could do so the other way of doing this
way<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.340> hold<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.730> poop<00:02:46.890> horizontal<00:02:48.060> your<00:02:49.060> arm

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
way to hold the poop horizontal your arm

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.530 
way to hold the poop horizontal your arm
