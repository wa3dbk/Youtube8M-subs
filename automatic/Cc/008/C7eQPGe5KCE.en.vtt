00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello welcome to here 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.720
 cake yes I have the incredibly good 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.179
 made video of this cat where seen 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.550
 she shows us how to be highly professional 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.259
 she made her and I thought 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.269
 I can do the same thing once 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.119
 Yes, the people are also interested in what we do 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.230
 have youtuber then do so and how 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.939
 we would never have to do it and do it 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.650
 is unfortunately already after 20 o'clock because of that 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.060
 I have to be quiet because otherwise really 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.470
 I still have to go up here 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.390
 I've been sleeping for a long time, too 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.320
 only 11 but I have now easy 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.780
 kept awake 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.399
 First, we take a peel here 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.230
 which came especially for carlos 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.910
 I have to be careful , that's the same thing 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.829
 lie again because my mother is watching 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.550
 then tomorrow and then out that me 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.710
 here was still awake 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.510
 the trunks and just put them on the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.910
 The table must be very symmetrical 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.500
 so that the perfect here with the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.340
 shadow is shut off yes that can 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.379
 also a piece 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.760
 that's perfect then we open slowly 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:05.369
 the sweets are written by my mother 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:07.950
 that I did not hear we are only 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.990
 Let's go here are easy 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.119
 so any recognition I can yes 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.250
 when I look at it 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.750
 the packaging was unfortunately no longer for me 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.950
 that was already thrown away he was a pity 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.780
 So there watching if you like then do 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.180
 I now have to do that too 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.580
 the palm must be down here and 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.070
 with the cr with the middle finger 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.200
 touch that and then pull up 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.130
 I'll take it easy 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.130
 now always children 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:44.819
 that may not be too many because I 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:52.709
 I'm already so fed otherwise 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:54.990
 that was a little luck, that was 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.219
 Of course not yet I leave that 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.380
 of course we have to see the chain 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.689
 bowl nice also next to four fingers the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.250
 a page here because then go 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.770
 the fewest bacteria in the kendox 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.780
 We do not want to take it that way 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.970
 I usually still a few 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.989
 My dream then I just pack 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.269
 She does not dream of a dream 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:23.489
 class then I usually take me 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:24.900
 a little sugar then I take 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.760
 mostly still curry I do that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.739
 me a little bit because 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.879
 that just gives the aromatic one 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.349
 taste of the ingredients turmeric and such 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.799
 This is also very important for the 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.660
 body 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.959
 but I guess not as much so as 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.910
 a bit already enough and from her 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.769
 nothing else 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.060
 then we go into the fridge so 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.630
 I usually do mine that me 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.579
 but now it's not worth it 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.530
 then we always have two in it 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.669
 I have to watch what we open 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.569
 Both feel the same way though 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.569
 this determines openly 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.940
 I turn the camera on, I hope 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.940
 that she gave me that 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.370
 I have nice and slow careful because the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.680
 Do not clean it is not allowed too 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.350
 to be a lot as I said I am too 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.380
 was not as good as you then says 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.900
 I'm doing this again now 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.120
 and then we need another piece 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.190
 butter we think we still need 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.550
 a little bit more that does not hurt 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.160
 Not 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.820
 then we take a knife out 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.720
 this must necessarily be one of those things 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.730
 so take it easy now and 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:04.300
 it did not work that way 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:05.830
 not even I forgot it so yes 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.600
 Already enough is not allowed too much 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.110
 refrain as the mother always there 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:15.370
 now just one 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.600
 because you grab the knife to the since that 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.080
 my mother notes tomorrow i say 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.380
 just do not need still at times we 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:28.030
 ran 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:30.030
 there we need it then we can do that 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.370
 whole once around that really looks 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.680
 really prove by simply times 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:50.760
 I understand that a bit 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:53.380
 definitely has to puke 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:57.430
 sometimes I'm purely in salami 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.180
 or what is that onions that is whole 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:04.150
 differently 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:06.669
 who do people so i'll do this muesli 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.750
 video you liked and yes I have 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.100
 I'm not hungry, I have that 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.480
 just like a video made because of that 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.490
 I just sort of get away from that 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.830
 have to think about it the girl does 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.050
 I'm doing the same 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.370
 Thanks for seeing and see if I am 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:27.300
 do not do a few more videos because 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:27.300
 that just so no chance left
