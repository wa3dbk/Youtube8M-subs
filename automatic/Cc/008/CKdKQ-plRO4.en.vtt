00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Hello to you for a long time I nika 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.569
 there was a request 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.190
 5 videos for my nails and the whole 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:15.120
 my care is various advice and if you 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.369
 interesting this topic well let me have from 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.359
 the nature of the form of nails is very 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.380
 elongated 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.210
 and I am very happy about it because I have 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.830
 never had problems and how to grow 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.830
 nails and because they are always like that 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.619
 It seems very long but even if I 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.710
 I want to have super long nails there 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.070
 can easily grow quickly but in any 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.410
 case is now especially still in the cold 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.770
 the weather, our nails always require care and 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.530
 today I recommend you 2 just 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.079
 insanely simplest nail baths and 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.390
 I personally almost all winter went without 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.489
 varnish that is now the grass that I have varnish 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.280
 there is at least some moment the other way around 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.120
 I wanted to hide them under the lacquer to 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:08.130
 nails were warmer dry 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.200
 that if you are a flock and almost winter I do not 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.100
 wore but I always had protection 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:19.260
 more precisely not the protection of a special varnish which 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.810
 Strengthening now throw here a photo 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.300
 this varnish from willow roshe is just my masthead 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.000
 because I used to use varnish 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.320
 are you ok who is just strengthening him 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.630
 there is a beige color 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.850
 but somehow I came and say hello 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.410
 i need a tank they say created 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.170
 take a piece of firming 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.080
 that here's another lacquer firming and 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.330
 whitening one in one that is and it is 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.220
 already white lacquer's just that now! 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:50.640
 showed about him before white and in fact 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.510
 Eighth smashed my God 2 times left 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.790
 if not to shave and I spent the whole winter with 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.870
 I don't know him in the pipe with my nails if 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.200
 I did not use 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.330
 because i use it just like that 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.310
 I put my nails on him anyway 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.200
 beech well, naturally, that is, they remain 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.020
 natural but gray on whiter 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.130
 if there are two layers, then of course not 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.590
 will burn qa flag 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.020
 but it seems to me anyway a little 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.640
 whitens as well as always when I do 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.250
 any manicure i always use it 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.230
 as a base for lacquer and it dries 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.959
 very fast so just perfect 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.630
 shorter thing so let's move on to 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.790
 bath 1 bath just crazy 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.550
 easy to prepare 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.820
 take a glass of warm water and take one 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.790
 tablespoon of sea salt and all this 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.459
 mix and just pour the dishes 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.209
 in which it is convenient and we are already leaving ours 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.190
 knurling there cleanly for 15-20 minutes and 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.890
 in fact, the fillet will even be visible because 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.019
 that but still it's sea salt that 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.140
 it's simple 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:00.450
 the simplest jar is not particularly complicated 2 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.880
 bath it is a little harder but for sure 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.100
 do not say that it is difficult to take the floor 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.180
 cups of boiling water is no longer hot water 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.209
 just boiling water and also a tablespoon 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.030
 add green tea and this is already 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.010
 we mix it like tea we make but 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.800
 should still take the usual green 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.690
 tea without different flavors because 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.440
 that all the same who needs a taste 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.570
 green tea supplements are good because 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.600
 There is as fluorine same zinc authors zinc 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.880
 really needed for on 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.830
 shah nails and just the tori gypsies just 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.370
 necessary for the proper growth of our 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.550
 nails 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.000
 and also for our color it is whiteness 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.120
 nails 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.250
 responsible vitamins will appear there and sort of 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.320
 and just green tea in it too 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.770
 helps so that the rolling of a whiter 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.070
 will and grow pro I will that is i 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.730
 always alternate through the time doing the masculine 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:57.160
 bath icon green tea 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.580
 because it is necessary to keep and there it is 15 20 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.640
 Minutes there is no difference and to be honest, then I 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.890
 happy with my nails when i have 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.540
 there was a moment that was not stratifying and all such 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.970
 bullshit but since i make these jars 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.150
 there at least once a week there not with 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.570
 nails all more or less good i hope 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.700
 then I'll answer your questions if 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.640
