a long-term perspective so when you

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.349 
a long-term perspective so when you
start<00:00:23.220> lifting<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.910> know<00:00:24.029> if<00:00:24.119> you're<00:00:24.240> on<00:00:24.330> a

your weights with linear progression

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.810 
your weights with linear progression
maybe<00:00:28.050> every<00:00:28.560> workout<00:00:28.980> or<00:00:29.189> every<00:00:29.400> other<00:00:29.460> work

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
going to have fairly linear progress and

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.790 
going to have fairly linear progress and
everything<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.480> go<00:00:36.570> up<00:00:36.660> but<00:00:37.440> anyone

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
points those plateaus for me one of

points those plateaus for me one of
those<00:00:46.140> big<00:00:46.379> areas<00:00:46.829> has<00:00:47.070> been<00:00:47.309> with<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> bench

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
those big areas has been with a bench

those big areas has been with a bench
press<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.570> been<00:00:48.719> pretty<00:00:48.960> slow<00:00:49.020> progress

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
press and it's been pretty slow progress

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.330

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
some shoulder issues so I wouldn't

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.150 
some shoulder issues so I wouldn't
always<00:00:54.719> touch<00:00:55.020> my<00:00:55.199> chest<00:00:55.469> but<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.770> bring<00:00:56.039> it

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
always touch my chest but I bring it

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.950 
always touch my chest but I bring it
down<00:00:56.309> about<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.760> an<00:00:56.910> inch<00:00:57.000> off<00:00:57.239> my<00:00:57.420> chest<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960

cheat and all that type of stuff but
even<00:01:00.180> doing<00:01:00.660> these<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.960> know<00:01:01.079> reps<00:01:01.710> that

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
even doing these you know reps that

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.319 
even doing these you know reps that
would<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.129> counted<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.579> competition<00:01:03.210> or

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
would have counted in competition or

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.299 
would have counted in competition or
anything<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.769> still<00:01:04.920> benching

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
anything like that I was still benching

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.440 
anything like that I was still benching
over<00:01:05.580> 400<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.920> now<00:01:07.920> I'm<00:01:08.159> benching<00:01:08.939> close<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
over 400 and now I'm benching close to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.200 
over 400 and now I'm benching close to
500<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:10.200> that's<00:01:10.380> been<00:01:10.650> almost<00:01:10.799> what<00:01:11.189> seven<00:01:12.119> or

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
500 but that's been almost what seven or

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.630 
500 but that's been almost what seven or
eight<00:01:12.330> years<00:01:13.010> actually<00:01:14.010> about<00:01:14.340> nine<00:01:14.610> years

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
eight years actually about nine years

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.910 
eight years actually about nine years
now<00:01:15.030> since<00:01:15.780> i<00:01:15.930> was<00:01:16.049> at<00:01:16.200> those<00:01:16.350> numbers<00:01:16.560> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
now since i was at those numbers and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.520 
now since i was at those numbers and
it's<00:01:17.130> slow<00:01:17.430> progress<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:18.659> i<00:01:18.689> showed<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.290> here

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
it's slow progress so i showed in here

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.820 
it's slow progress so i showed in here
this<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.520> believe<00:01:20.909> 375<00:01:21.780> from<00:01:22.409> two<00:01:22.650> years

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
this is a I believe 375 from two years

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.700 
this is a I believe 375 from two years
ago<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> triple<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.710> you

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
ago and you see a triple here and you

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.560 
ago and you see a triple here and you
know<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.950> moves<00:01:26.159> okay<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.000> last<00:01:27.210> rep

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
know it moves okay but this last rep

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.230 
know it moves okay but this last rep
here<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.869> about<00:01:28.110> all<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> had<00:01:28.729> now<00:01:29.729> compare<00:01:30.180> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
here is about all I had now compare that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.080 
here is about all I had now compare that
triple<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.470> what<00:01:31.650> I'm<00:01:31.950> able<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.369> do<00:01:32.579> two<00:01:32.850> years

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
triple to what I'm able to do two years

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.770 
triple to what I'm able to do two years
later<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.020> same<00:01:34.229> gym<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> same<00:01:35.369> way

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
later in the same gym with the same way

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.429 
later in the same gym with the same way
right<00:01:36.780> here<00:01:38.450> it's<00:01:39.450> pretty<00:01:39.689> much<00:01:39.900> become<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
right here it's pretty much become the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.679 
right here it's pretty much become the
speed<00:01:40.770> work<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.280> do<00:01:41.400> now<00:01:41.700> instead<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.420> my

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
speed work that I do now instead of my

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.749 
speed work that I do now instead of my
free<00:01:42.990> rep<00:01:43.200> max<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> see<00:01:44.130> me<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:44.520> just

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
free rep max and you see me here just

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
for a fourth like no problem that's what

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.649 
for a fourth like no problem that's what
you<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.549> look<00:01:50.700> at<00:01:51.030> when<00:01:51.210> you're<00:01:51.299> thinking

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
you have to look at when you're thinking

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.109 
you have to look at when you're thinking
about<00:01:51.720> training<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:53.490> was<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> difference

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
about training that was a difference

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.359 
about training that was a difference
between<00:01:54.479> two<00:01:54.689> years<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.200> bench<00:01:55.799> pressing<00:01:56.219> body

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
between two years of bench pressing body

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.270

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.580 
weight maybe up another 10 or 15 pounds
and<00:01:59.750> sometimes<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.899> will<00:02:00.960> feel<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.229> you're

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
and sometimes it will feel like you're

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.020 
and sometimes it will feel like you're
stuck<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> lift<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.490> you're<00:02:02.610> making<00:02:02.759> no

stuck on a lift and you're making no

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.910 
stuck on a lift and you're making no
progress<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:03.780> what<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.079> really<00:02:04.110> need<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.619> do

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
progress but what you really need to do

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.700 
progress but what you really need to do
is<00:02:05.189> look<00:02:06.119> back<00:02:06.420> at<00:02:06.630> some<00:02:06.659> old<00:02:06.990> training

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
is look back at some old training

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.680 
is look back at some old training
footage<00:02:08.069> look<00:02:08.670> back<00:02:08.879> at<00:02:09.060> what<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.330> were<00:02:09.450> doing

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
footage look back at what you were doing

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.240 
footage look back at what you were doing
a<00:02:09.780> year<00:02:10.110> or<00:02:10.289> two<00:02:10.500> ago<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.739> see<00:02:11.039> if<00:02:11.129> you're

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
a year or two ago and see if you're

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.120 
a year or two ago and see if you're
making<00:02:11.520> progress<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.209> right<00:02:12.239> direction

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
making progress in the right direction

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.500 
making progress in the right direction
it's<00:02:13.400> not<00:02:13.640> always<00:02:13.820> going<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.150> be<00:02:14.210> immediately

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
it's not always going to be immediately

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.410 
it's not always going to be immediately
obvious<00:02:14.810> how<00:02:15.350> well<00:02:15.620> you're<00:02:15.890> doing<00:02:16.300> when<00:02:17.300> you

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
obvious how well you're doing when you

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.090 
obvious how well you're doing when you
look<00:02:17.600> at<00:02:17.720> something<00:02:17.960> week<00:02:18.320> to<00:02:18.470> week<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.830> even

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
look at something week to week and even

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.490 
look at something week to week and even
microcycle<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.240> micro<00:02:20.600> cycle<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.200> can<00:02:21.230> have

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
microcycle the micro cycle you can have

microcycle the micro cycle you can have
a<00:02:21.530> bad<00:02:21.800> training<00:02:22.280> cycle<00:02:22.670> but<00:02:23.450> what<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:23.630> need

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
a bad training cycle but what you need

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.720 
a bad training cycle but what you need
to<00:02:23.960> do<00:02:24.170> is<00:02:24.290> track<00:02:24.590> your<00:02:24.800> volume<00:02:25.190> over<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.520> long

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
to do is track your volume over the long

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.820 
to do is track your volume over the long
haul<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.300> as<00:02:26.570> you<00:02:26.720> keep<00:02:26.900> working<00:02:27.230> over<00:02:27.650> long

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
haul and as you keep working over long

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.620 
haul and as you keep working over long
periods<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.310> time<00:02:28.370> you're<00:02:29.180> going<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.510> see

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
periods of time you're going to see

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.480 
periods of time you're going to see
changes<00:02:30.080> you're<00:02:30.230> going<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.620> see<00:02:30.770> adaptation

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
changes you're going to see adaptation

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.760 
changes you're going to see adaptation
and<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.450> don't<00:02:32.660> be<00:02:32.870> concerned<00:02:33.410> if<00:02:33.650> you're

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
and so don't be concerned if you're

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.290 
and so don't be concerned if you're
stuck<00:02:34.010> on<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.190> lift<00:02:34.460> right<00:02:34.670> now<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.060> feel

working and putting in the time with a
solid<00:02:38.840> program<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.590> you'll<00:02:39.680> break<00:02:39.950> through

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
solid program and you'll break through

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.190 
solid program and you'll break through
those<00:02:40.340> plateaus<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.060> things<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:41.930> used<00:02:42.140> to

those plateaus and things that used to
