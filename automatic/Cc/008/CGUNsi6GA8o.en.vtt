00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.840
 but 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.090
 Hi, I'm Taylor, and as you can see 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.910
 we are created from gta maps online 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.509
 this time I bring you a new 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.330
 strong game this time is how you see in 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.340
 the title a death game in the water 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.190
 as you are now seeing all the 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.950
 points of appearance of equipment and 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.710
 other points of appearance are all 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.550
 on top of the water floating on top of the water 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.520
 and this so that later to get 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.100
 make a game completely in the 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.870
 water which in that way we make a 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.120
 departure of which there is no 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.090
 site and I at least have not played 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.430
 never a game just alone in the water and 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.660
 Well you see here I am testing it for 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.460
 that you can see the operation the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.770
 you already see that I appear 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.600
 directly in the water and then the 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.390
 forced weapon as you see is a knife 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.200
 because it is the only weapon with which 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.990
 being in the water you can attack 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.210
 then also you noticed it 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.100
 the position in the submarine and I've put the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.960
 boat that well to do a little 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.450
 grace then if you want to run over your 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.250
 friends or do you want to make a fool of yourself 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.229
 and play like that with the mini submarines and 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.970
 Well, well, you can also take the 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.189
 laughs as I say running over people 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.950
 with coiling it better said more than 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.280
 running over it and the truth is very very 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.229
 handsome although as you see here in the test 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.659
 I do not know what's going on because here in this 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.880
 I'm not teaching you the game 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.860
 playing now but trying the voucher 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.560
 You were testing this in the 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.630
 map maker computers do not know the bots 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.240
 I imagine that of course how this is not 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.670
 thought to play well as you see the 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.520
 bots are a bit stunned sometimes 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.670
 they do not even attack me and what they usually do 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.099
 do if you look at the minimum to 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.039
 choose to go to the mountain I do not know why 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:07.840
 and they go catch water instead of going go 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.179
 stick to you try to stay with the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.920
 knife is what I say I imagine 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.569
 how clear is not prepared that 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.810
 can put the control points in the 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.959
 water is not ready 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.910
 can act well in the water but good 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.660
 like the other time just like in the 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.720
 career of the biggest jump I'll do 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.580
 the same thing that I did with that video first 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.690
 I will teach you how to feel now 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.190
 split and then after it's 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.080
 uploaded this video forgive for having 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.010
 coughing after this is up 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.810
 video in a ratillo I 'll upload another 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.030
 teaching how I have done this as I have 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.620
 done the trick this to be able to put the 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.510
 Good control points forgive the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.230
 control points the points of 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.340
 appearance in the middle of the water and this is 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.980
 You can do it anywhere 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.080
 where it goes where there is water is like the other 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.530
 thing if you are creative you can do 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.959
 Quite a lot of pretty cool things ya 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.690
 I say it is not very difficult, you can already 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.099
 be attentive because as I say I went up 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.560
 from here a saucer that is uploaded 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.150
 this video because I teach how to do the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.790
 flow in case you want to create 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.519
 some game somewhere else or what 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.790
 you can also create it 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.579
 and well you know if you want to add 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.640
 the game is now you can see that it is not 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.079
 created is created but I here in the 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.360
 video in the video that is recorded me 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.460
 was missing to put the name 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.980
 but good when the video is uploaded to 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.680
 youtube will have the link as always 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.470
 in the description to be able to put the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.500
 game to death if you want in your 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.840
 game and also play it in this 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.600
 occasion at the end of the video I teach you very 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.480
 easy is a gentleman quickly how is it 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.250
 to add the item that does not have 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.960
 mystery I've told you all the times 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.720
 who has uploaded videos of this style is 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.160
 very easy to add the games and can 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.700
 play you with your friends 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.730
 what you want the truth that as 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.260
 you see you see everything in the water and this was 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.050
 what I wanted I wanted to be able to do 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.900
 leaving everything in the water that was like that 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.569
 well 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.519
 knife and so on and be able to take advantage of 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.889
 little ability capacity 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.440
 lung capacity that is not in 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.780
 no site is almost not at all 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.150
 site thesun that skill sorry no 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.770
 it is used almost for nothing that skill but 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.080
 here at least in this game as a 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.300
 Sometimes you can answer 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.650
 get under the water because you can go 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.110
 raising ability ability 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.729
 muscular and nothing then here now here 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.770
 nothing comes the cut where it was taught 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.780
 here it comes as you see the cut this is 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.000
 the social club page and here is 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.530
 where would you go to add the 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.199
 death game on this occasion as you see 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.300
 I have the race but good you will go here 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.720
 to add the death game and nothing 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.400
 plus 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.320
 It's very easy as you can see simply 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.169
 add and then restart the game and 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.970
 you already have it in marked activities 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:03.349
 I hope you liked the game 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:05.780
 I hope you liked the idea 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.580
 with the trick of putting it in the water and 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.270
 nothing as I say be attentive because the 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:16.090
 template when 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.090
 teaching how is this
