I'm just going to show you how to cut

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.150 
I'm just going to show you how to cut
just<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.660> little<00:01:25.690> piece<00:01:26.200> of<00:01:26.230> it<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.710> also<00:01:26.920> to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
just a little piece of it and also to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
whichever feathers that you want you can

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.920 
whichever feathers that you want you can
do<00:01:32.650> that<00:01:32.860> or<00:01:33.130> you<00:01:33.160> can<00:01:33.760> layer<00:01:34.000> fabric<00:01:34.390> across

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
do that or you can layer fabric across

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.810 
do that or you can layer fabric across
the<00:01:35.140> whole<00:01:35.320> die<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:35.860> cut<00:01:36.190> all<00:01:36.430> at<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.640> same

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
the whole die and cut all at the same

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.850 
the whole die and cut all at the same
time<00:01:36.880> so<00:01:37.720> we're<00:01:37.930> just<00:01:37.960> going<00:01:38.290> to<00:01:38.350> cut<00:01:38.560> one

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
time so we're just going to cut one

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.490 
time so we're just going to cut one
feather<00:01:39.190> and<00:01:39.520> I<00:01:39.940> have<00:01:40.240> here<00:01:40.960> I've<00:01:41.080> got<00:01:41.260> pre

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
feather and I have here I've got pre

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.620 
feather and I have here I've got pre
fused<00:01:41.830> fabric<00:01:42.310> so<00:01:42.430> I'm<00:01:42.520> going<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.060> cut<00:01:43.330> four

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
fused fabric so I'm going to cut four

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.810 
fused fabric so I'm going to cut four
layers<00:01:43.930> as<00:01:44.230> I<00:01:44.320> mentioned<00:01:44.710> before<00:01:44.830> so<00:01:45.550> we<00:01:45.640> just

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
layers as I mentioned before so we just

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.060 
layers as I mentioned before so we just
put<00:01:46.030> that<00:01:46.060> over<00:01:46.420> that<00:01:46.930> feather<00:01:47.440> right<00:01:47.770> there

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
put that over that feather right there

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.340 
put that over that feather right there
and<00:01:48.310> then<00:01:48.880> here's<00:01:49.120> another<00:01:49.390> trick<00:01:49.660> if<00:01:49.930> you're

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
and then here's another trick if you're

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.040 
and then here's another trick if you're
using<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:51.010> whole<00:01:51.040> die<00:01:51.580> you<00:01:52.000> can<00:01:52.210> use<00:01:52.450> your<00:01:52.600> six
