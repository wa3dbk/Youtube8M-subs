00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.609
 good greetings to all people 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.160
 who are watching this video the people 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:11.500
 of colombia more than all this is a 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.030
 iPhone 5 must be said that it is a 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:19.270
 incredible machine after all 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:23.020
 and surprised by their abilities and their 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:27.370
 specifications but with clear the 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.920
 service and the machine is not that us that 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.660
 be the best 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.620
 Here I refer the internet service 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.160
 it is lousy 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.670
 with the company stated at this time 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.710
 I pay 128 thousand pesos a month with one 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.989
 supposedly unlimited navigation 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.379
 and in the vast majority of the time 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.879
 service does not work and I should stay with 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.040
 this service has a clause of 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.680
 stay of two years may already be 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.640
 imagine the way this company ties 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.980
 to people to this lousy service 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.980
 I'm showing for example twitter 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.540
 to change my personal account 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.680
 aspire to load 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.130
 you can stay hours 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.060
 I insist the phone to charge the 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.060
 timeline to see what happens 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.679
 absolutely nothing either charges for 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:01.200
 course it does not load any tweets and 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.090
 followers or the number of people 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.159
 that follow us 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.159
 is still showing facebook 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.750
 exactly the same 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.780
 they are not supposed to understand the service to 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.850
 sometimes have 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.230
 and interferences or things like that but in 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.810
 this moment I am in a fifth 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.810
 flat in Bogota for man 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.470
 equal facebook 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.719
 if you try to open a web page 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.200
 the same 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.200
 time 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.550
 without neglecting that recently clarified 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.940
 he was fined many millions 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.410
 for activating the international chroma well 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.780
 that users would have asked for this 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.040
 service now I 'm going to show you the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.040
 difference activating the wifi 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.590
 in order twitter 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.880
 wifi is activated 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.150
 of one 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.430
 followers the people that I follow from some 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.590
 update timeline 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.590
 at once facebook like 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.920
 it takes a bit but at one time 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.920
 update 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.570
 the time has to be said that this 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.540
 phone also has a collection 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.520
 ultra fast and when it 's with wifi at 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.570
 100 amazing the time of a 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.070
 because it has to be so slow so 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.050
 speed then declared man a 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.940
 called 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.100
 to the regulatory centers hopefully the 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.290
 superintendence 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.090
 and do the corrective 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.370
 corresponding because it's not fair to 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.310
 the user and with millions of people 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.530
 normally against the phone that 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.760
 offer such a terrible service and a 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.370
 reception so bad 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.040
 thanks to everyone for the video and that yes no 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.380
 hesitate to buy the iphone 5 which is a 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:25.740
 excellent machine but hopefully if 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.740
 they may not know how to buy a greeting
