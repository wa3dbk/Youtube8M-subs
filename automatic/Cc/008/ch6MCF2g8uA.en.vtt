00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
synchronizations that on better dive I

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.690 
synchronizations that on better dive I
think<00:00:40.079> from<00:00:40.350> Tonya<00:00:40.860> just<00:00:41.100> because<00:00:41.370> she<00:00:41.489> had<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
think from Tonya just because she had a

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.910 
think from Tonya just because she had a
better<00:00:41.940> line<00:00:42.180> through<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> water<00:00:42.800> it's<00:00:43.800> still
