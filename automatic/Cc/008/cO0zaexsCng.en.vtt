around<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> basket<00:01:09.860> um<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.100> think<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> main

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
around the basket um I think the main

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.340 
around the basket um I think the main
thing<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:12.270> us<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.689> forcing<00:01:13.020> anything

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
thing for us is now forcing anything

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.830 
thing for us is now forcing anything
around<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.920> basket<00:01:14.100> because<00:01:14.490> he<00:01:14.909> he<00:01:15.360> changes

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
around the basket because he he changes

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.390 
around the basket because he he changes
a<00:01:15.869> lot<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.259> shots<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.650> he<00:01:16.710> blocks<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.100> lot<00:01:17.130> of

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
a lot of shots and he blocks a lot of

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.429 
a lot of shots and he blocks a lot of
shots<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.060> long<00:01:18.450> as<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:18.780> stick<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.170> our<00:01:19.200> game

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
shots so as long as we stick to our game

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.160

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
back-to-backs eight and five this season

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.359 
back-to-backs eight and five this season
on<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.720> those<00:01:30.900> games<00:01:31.140> brad<00:01:31.530> has<00:01:31.710> said<00:01:31.920> over<00:01:32.100> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
on in those games brad has said over and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
on in those games brad has said over and
over<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.670> he<00:01:32.820> emphasizes<00:01:33.420> these<00:01:33.750> games<00:01:34.020> you

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
over that he emphasizes these games you

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.960 
over that he emphasizes these games you
don't<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.950> many<00:01:35.070> opportunities<00:01:35.759> left

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
don't have that many opportunities left

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.399 
don't have that many opportunities left
to<00:01:36.119> plan<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> second<00:01:36.750> night<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.900> back-to-back

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
to plan the second night of back-to-back

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.929 
to plan the second night of back-to-back
so<00:01:37.530> how<00:01:37.650> does<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.890> emphasis<00:01:38.310> change<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:38.880> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
so how does that emphasis change as you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.210 
so how does that emphasis change as you
get<00:01:39.479> fewer<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.960> fewer<00:01:40.110> opportunities<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:41.070> try

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
get fewer and fewer opportunities to try

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.649 
get fewer and fewer opportunities to try
to<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.460> success<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:41.880> those<00:01:42.119> those

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
to have success in those those

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.050 
to have success in those those
situations<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.470> think<00:01:44.250> every<00:01:44.490> games<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> same

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
