00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.310
 we have here formed monero 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.109
 presenting his new video that he 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.850
 Do this because you are giving blown away 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.279
 well you will know by title 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.559
 this is the gameplay the advance the video 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.940
 advance because it's not a replay of 30 20 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.769
 of 2014 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.050
 only this you see how the 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:23.109
 logo and there is nothing else of this 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.669
 game then the 30 militated 2014 that 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.980
 As you can see, all we know is the 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.230
 release date September 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.140
 2013 specifically on September 26 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.020
 of 2012 we have of 2013 we have 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.120
 only 54 sorry 4 images here 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.810
 you are seeing the first one corresponds 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.110
 with the line in hamburg hanover and 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.360
 well this line was inaugurated in the 3000 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.060
 2013 milestone recently I think the 26th 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.190
 of July like that a few days ago then 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.040
 will be in training later 2014 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.710
 for free 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.330
 adapted to the new graphics next to 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.610
 this will be the faber line 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:04.960
 london high speed that I told you 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.790
 and the line with the country then the 3000 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.580
 2014 active another image is 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.660
 surely it will be the logo of the cde 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.430
 or an image of the game is not this game 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.500
 you can buy physically in stores and 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.380
 in estimated then that brings this game 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.570
 because it brings some graphic improvements 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.710
 graphics a new graphic engine say 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.620
 that will be some graphics 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.800
 impressive rather more real 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.369
 some real life routes and also 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.100
 the scenario is going to be more complex 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.990
 career as a train driver then 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.810
 you are going to be able to have a greater variety of 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.070
 trains you will not be able to seem the way 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.170
 they will improve it and they will 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.640
 make broader more difficult they have 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.979
 more challenges 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.570
 then as I told you we will be able to 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.640
 also create your own routes and 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.380
 share them in steam download 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.000
 contents of other players and create your 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.280
 own collection and its own routes 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.590
 as it could be done now but improved 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.410
 with the two fast and such also brings 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.850
 a new interface of 3000 2014 more 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.560
 intuitive 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.619
 as I said a greater career mode and 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.539
 a series of geographic improvements those that 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.190
 have bought the 30th liter 2013 in 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.069
 steam will be able to update 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.080
 free at 30th later 2014 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.880
 therefore they will be able to have the new 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.280
 graphics and everything new here you are seeing 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.050
 the train of the high speed london line to 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.670
 faber sham that I am telling you is already 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.850
 updated with new graphics 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.470
 then it is important if you have bought 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.620
 this dlc or the stuttgart you are going to 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.870
 be able to update for free at 30 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.580
 2014 with the new graphics then 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.380
 it's pretty good that that changes in the 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.900
 game that evolution does not do 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.700
 lack to pay more new is simply 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.500
 basically basically update the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.300
 of the e3 that they take out that they will cost you 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.430
 money assigned kids here are you 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.110
 seeing launch date 26 of 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.850
 September and you will see it on the channel 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.960
 then in English so if you know the 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.700
 I play a little English, appreciating a little 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.710
 then good here and before you finish 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.710
 I teach that they have told me a web page 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.110
 the rails and m and I have seen the alvia s-130 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.360
 between the train alvia de españa 'by 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.160
 excellence and I did not know how to install it what 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.710
 I downloaded and I had to install 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.630
 with the package manager the file that 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.010
 was with the utilities or something like that 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.710
 yes I could do it but then it puts me 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.260
 to activate providers that I do not have a 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.420
 idea of ​​what it is then here did not tell me 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.450
 as in the scenario editor as 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.830
 place the tractor car train at 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.470
 then I do not know how to install a train 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.730
 inside the game this I installed it from 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.710
 yes I have done but did not show me 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.810
 the games so I ask for help for 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.880
 get the s-130 alvia that I think that 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.470
 It will be worthwhile and if I get you 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.270
 I upload it to the channel so nothing kids 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.340
 I hope your help here you see through 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.330
 of the finished trailer and greetings to all 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.330
 goodbye
