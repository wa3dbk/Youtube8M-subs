00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello visitors youtube channel and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.720
 good mother of all trades 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.110
 today i will tell you how i make the sauce 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.420
 bechamel to cook the sauce 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.430
 bechamel hee we need such 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.910
 the products are oil after 60 to 70 grams two 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.980
 tablespoons flour salt pepper nutmeg 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.019
 walnut and half a liter I took very milk 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.660
 we begin preparations in order to 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.070
 We had a good bÃ©chamel sauce in 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.680
 we have such a small subtlety should 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.079
 get out the butter with flour when we will 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.140
 overheat one temperature with 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.200
 milk to avoid lumps and so 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.020
 at first we still got milk from 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:55.520
 take the refrigerator take and heat 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.050
 naturally mass that is , we will have 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:03.329
 melt and the temperature will 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.510
 over 50 even 70 degrees then we will 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.130
 add well naturally 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.920
 we bring milk so that we have it 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.060
 hot 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.210
 pokamist we will warm milk 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:22.280
 laying 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.280
 but he must have completely fallen apart 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:45.530
 yes who repent oil will completely melt not 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:46.930
 we will add mobil oil melted from 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.399
 cars 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.399
 tidy up pour out 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:11.920
 interfered with 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:14.510
 Oil brewed our to Vike 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.940
 when we got mixed up with mars my 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:24.530
 it turned out as it seems well, and now we will 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:28.010
 quietly pour milk a little 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.760
 trickle but called acharya as much steam goes 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.760
 little by little 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.470
 in small portions pour in because 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.130
 flour 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:47.190
 when we add milk brewed 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.610
 that is, roughly it turns out custard 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.300
 cream 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.370
 and who does the custard in the know that 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.370
 need to stir 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.870
 kind of quietly, quietly, I pour in 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.280
 interfering 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:15.390
 it turns out to be equal as we 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:19.290
 masterly make pancakes too 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.540
 make thick mass like sour cream 3 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.930
 let's either pale on first we 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.960
 do empty and then dilute 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.080
 milk to the desired consistency 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.130
 not my even beloved husband helps keep 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.120
 a griddle so that it does not jump off 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:43.440
 still leave some people add more 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:48.870
 overdoes onions overdoes 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.930
 then add oil flour and then 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:56.390
 quietly pour in 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:04:00.300
 Milk these as my husband does not like 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.050
 smell the aroma of la lista so i dont 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.060
 add 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:10.130
 I now when fully interfere milk 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:13.080
 it will be necessary to add salt a pinch 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.810
 freshly ground pepper 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.140
 I helped black and fragrant along with 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.690
 displaced 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:28.210

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.740
 degree sour cream 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.350
 on low heat so we have it 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:47.280
 gradually 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:50.620
 brewed bag see what we have 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.800
 uniform if such a flock consistency 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:05:06.120
