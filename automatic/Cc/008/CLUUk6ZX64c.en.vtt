so<00:05:18.930> that<00:05:19.080> Balotelli's<00:05:19.620> behavior<00:05:20.039> would<00:05:20.129> be

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:20.279 
so that Balotelli's behavior would be

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.029 
so that Balotelli's behavior would be
not<00:05:20.520> suitable<00:05:21.120> for<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.810> club<00:05:22.050> name<00:05:22.710> I<00:05:22.830> think

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
not suitable for the club name I think

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:23.899 
not suitable for the club name I think
that<00:05:23.129> doesn't<00:05:23.279> seem<00:05:23.490> so<00:05:23.639> unreasonable

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
that doesn't seem so unreasonable

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:25.700 
that doesn't seem so unreasonable
presumably<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:24.930> owner<00:05:25.050> merely<00:05:25.319> wants<00:05:25.620> to

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
presumably the owner merely wants to

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.110 
presumably the owner merely wants to
maintain<00:05:25.860> standards<00:05:26.490> of<00:05:26.550> this<00:05:26.639> club<00:05:26.879> because

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
maintain standards of this club because

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.760 
maintain standards of this club because
