awkward shape and that's really going to

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.050 
awkward shape and that's really going to
be<00:02:52.490> our<00:02:52.520> eye<00:02:52.910> shape<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:54.550> even<00:02:55.550> that<00:02:55.640> might<00:02:55.880> be

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
be our eye shape and even that might be

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:05.020 
be our eye shape and even that might be
too<00:02:56.300> long<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:03.530> looks<00:03:03.800> better<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:04.880> we're
