00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
like in Canada in the US as 3gp as you

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.699 
like in Canada in the US as 3gp as you
go<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.479> carriers<00:02:10.479> in<00:02:10.780> North<00:02:11.140> America<00:02:11.590> are

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
go and carriers in North America are

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.590 
go and carriers in North America are
really<00:02:11.950> only<00:02:12.069> concerned<00:02:12.580> about<00:02:12.700> like<00:02:13.030> 4G<00:02:13.569> or

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
really only concerned about like 4G or

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.930 
really only concerned about like 4G or
LTE<00:02:13.780> at<00:02:14.410> this<00:02:14.590> point<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.550> can<00:02:15.670> see<00:02:15.819> as<00:02:15.910> a

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
LTE at this point so you can see as a

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.090 
LTE at this point so you can see as a
sticker<00:02:16.420> on<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.540> back<00:02:16.720> as<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.110> speaker<00:02:17.830> on<00:02:18.010> the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
sticker on the back as a speaker on the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.979 
sticker on the back as a speaker on the
back<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.700> know<00:02:18.819> our<00:02:19.030> views<00:02:19.330> on<00:02:19.510> speakers<00:02:19.840> on

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
back you know our views on speakers on

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.660 
back you know our views on speakers on
the<00:02:20.080> back<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:20.560> I'm<00:02:20.709> not<00:02:20.860> going<00:02:21.069> to<00:02:21.130> rehash<00:02:21.340> old

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
the back so I'm not going to rehash old

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.030 
the back so I'm not going to rehash old
ground<00:02:21.970> but<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.300> it's<00:02:22.870> pretty<00:02:23.080> light<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.530> mean

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
ground but it it's pretty light I mean

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.920 
ground but it it's pretty light I mean
certainly<00:02:24.340> like<00:02:24.790> lighter<00:02:25.090> than<00:02:25.360> say<00:02:25.599> like<00:02:25.810> the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
certainly like lighter than say like the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.890 
certainly like lighter than say like the
motorola<00:02:26.440> xoom<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.819> 8<00:02:27.970> inch<00:02:28.150> version<00:02:28.390> as<00:02:28.720> much

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
motorola xoom the 8 inch version as much

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.809 
motorola xoom the 8 inch version as much
again<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.500> has<00:02:29.680> all<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:29.950> same<00:02:30.310> features<00:02:30.790> but

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
again it has all the same features but

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.090 
again it has all the same features but
as<00:02:31.239> you<00:02:31.420> can<00:02:31.540> see<00:02:31.780> it's<00:02:31.959> just<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.739> know<00:02:32.769> a

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
as you can see it's just you know a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.050 
as you can see it's just you know a
little<00:02:33.549> bit<00:02:33.730> smaller<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:35.670> if<00:02:36.670> you've<00:02:36.850> ever

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.539 
little bit smaller so if you've ever
seen<00:02:37.450> like<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.230> honeycomb<00:02:38.680> experience<00:02:39.310> you

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
seen like the honeycomb experience you

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.720 
seen like the honeycomb experience you
know<00:02:40.030> what<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.299> see<00:02:40.709> it's<00:02:41.709> very<00:02:41.830> quick<00:02:42.430> the

know what to see it's very quick the
dual-core<00:02:43.690> 1.5<00:02:44.250> processor<00:02:45.250> really<00:02:45.519> makes<00:02:45.730> it

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
dual-core 1.5 processor really makes it

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.559 
dual-core 1.5 processor really makes it
really<00:02:46.030> quickly<00:02:46.360> so<00:02:47.819> over<00:02:48.819> there<00:02:48.970> for<00:02:49.390> more
