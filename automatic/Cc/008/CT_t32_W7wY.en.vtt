specifications<00:00:16.529> quickly<00:00:17.220> first<00:00:17.430> we're<00:00:17.670> going

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
specifications quickly first we're going

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.880 
specifications quickly first we're going
to<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> bit<00:00:18.000> more<00:00:18.119> detail<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:19.109> one<00:00:19.529> hundred

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
to a bit more detail so one hundred

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.410 
to a bit more detail so one hundred
eighty<00:00:20.100> seven<00:00:20.340> grams<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.939> very<00:00:21.119> light<00:00:21.300> weight

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
eighty seven grams of very light weight

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.290 
eighty seven grams of very light weight
on<00:00:21.539> your<00:00:21.660> head<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.470> shines<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.980> total<00:00:23.670> maximum

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
on your head it shines a total maximum

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.790 
on your head it shines a total maximum
brightness<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:25.080> three<00:00:25.320> hundred<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.650> thirty

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
brightness of three hundred and thirty

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.580 
brightness of three hundred and thirty
55<00:00:26.369> lumens<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.090> extremely<00:00:27.660> bright<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.080> has

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
55 lumens it's extremely bright and has

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.040 
55 lumens it's extremely bright and has
a<00:00:28.619> maximum<00:00:29.039> travel<00:00:29.279> distance<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.640> 108<00:00:30.269> meters

a maximum travel distance of 108 meters

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.080 
a maximum travel distance of 108 meters
so<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.590> shines<00:00:31.920> best<00:00:32.189> really<00:00:32.460> brightly<00:00:32.669> and

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
so it shines best really brightly and

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.450 
so it shines best really brightly and
very<00:00:33.420> long<00:00:33.600> distance<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.350> obviously<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.370> it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
very long distance and obviously what it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.580 
very long distance and obviously what it
does<00:00:35.610> feature<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.420> rechargeable<00:00:36.989> battery<00:00:37.380> in

wherever you are no matter how bright or
dark<00:00:55.829> things<00:00:56.160> are<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.399> it's<00:00:56.910> got<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> sensor

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
dark things are that it's got a sensor

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.869 
dark things are that it's got a sensor
up<00:00:57.840> here<00:00:58.140> take<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> look<00:00:58.710> there<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.640> will

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
up here take a look there this will

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.880 
up here take a look there this will
basically<00:00:59.969> measure<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.079> intensity<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
basically measure the intensity of the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.950 
basically measure the intensity of the
light<00:01:02.070> around<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.670> at<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.850> time<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.690> which

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
light around you at that time and which

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.539 
light around you at that time and which
will<00:01:04.110> then<00:01:04.229> feed<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.680> information<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.400> each

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
will then feed the information to each

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.570 
will then feed the information to each
bulb<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.330> will<00:01:06.689> adjusts<00:01:07.350> as<00:01:07.530> such<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.490> it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
bulb here and will adjusts as such so it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.000 
bulb here and will adjusts as such so it
can<00:01:08.700> shine<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.510> spot<00:01:10.110> if<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.500> need<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.860> or

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
can shine like spot if you need it or

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.039 
can shine like spot if you need it or
white<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.640> knows<00:01:11.939> what<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.390> needs<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.689> do<00:01:12.869> you

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
white it knows what it needs to do you

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.450 
white it knows what it needs to do you
don't<00:01:13.260> need<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.470> adjust<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:13.920> manually<00:01:14.369> it's

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
don't need to adjust this manually it's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.670 
don't need to adjust this manually it's
all<00:01:14.610> automatic<00:01:15.110> got<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> button<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.500> side

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
all automatic got a button on the side

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.280 
all automatic got a button on the side
here<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.159> simply<00:01:17.520> twist<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.990> simply<00:01:18.990> turn<00:01:19.140> it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
here you simply twist it simply turn it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.830 
here you simply twist it simply turn it
on<00:01:19.439> as<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.700> light<00:01:20.880> comes<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.360> now

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
on as you see the light comes on now

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.990 
on as you see the light comes on now
just<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.200> imitate<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.100> idea<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.670> does<00:01:23.820> if

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
just to imitate the idea that it does if

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.840 
just to imitate the idea that it does if
I<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.390> cover<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> sensor<00:01:25.670> see<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.729> get

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
I just cover the sensor see you get

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.179 
I just cover the sensor see you get
lighter<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.659> don't<00:01:27.810> move<00:01:27.900> my<00:01:28.080> finger<00:01:28.409> gets

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
lighter if I don't move my finger gets

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.010 
lighter if I don't move my finger gets
darker<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.939> knows<00:01:30.119> when<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.450> gets<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.869> as

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
darker so it knows when it gets one as

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.929 
darker so it knows when it gets one as
it<00:01:31.170> gets<00:01:31.290> darker<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.280> light<00:01:32.460> will<00:01:32.610> increase

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it gets darker the light will increase

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.390 
it gets darker the light will increase
and<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.299> forth<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.409> extremely<00:01:35.220> extremely

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and so forth it is extremely extremely

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.609 
and so forth it is extremely extremely
clever<00:01:35.790> no<00:01:36.420> need<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.750> sort<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:36.990> play<00:01:37.200> with<00:01:37.380> all

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
clever no need to sort or play with all
