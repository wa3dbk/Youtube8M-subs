00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
keys k is two millimeters so i

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.160 
keys k is two millimeters so i
definitely<00:01:05.580> say<00:01:06.030> two<00:01:06.420> millimeters<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.140> a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
definitely say two millimeters is a

definitely say two millimeters is a
little<00:01:07.470> bit<00:01:07.560> thin<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.180> recommend

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
choose k plus or the keys k heavy so

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.300 
choose k plus or the keys k heavy so
probably<00:01:18.420> get<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.380> cuse<00:01:19.619> k<00:01:19.740> plus<00:01:19.950> which<00:01:20.189> is

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
bad so you want something cool like this

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.840 
bad so you want something cool like this
um<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.180> main<00:01:40.170> difference<00:01:40.530> being<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
um so main difference being this and the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.719 
um so main difference being this and the
fiber<00:01:42.630> technology<00:01:42.869> used<00:01:43.680> endeavour<00:01:44.130> glide<00:01:44.399> in

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
fiber technology used endeavour glide in

whatever<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.490> feels<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.600> little

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
whatever is that it it feels a little

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.969 
whatever is that it it feels a little
bit<00:01:52.140> quicker<00:01:53.240> quicker<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> sense<00:01:54.840> that

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
bit quicker quicker in the sense that

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.039 
bit quicker quicker in the sense that
it's<00:01:55.979> easier<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.909> move<00:01:57.090> your<00:01:57.299> mouse<00:01:57.509> from<00:01:57.780> one

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
side to the other like this there's a

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.670 
side to the other like this there's a
little<00:02:00.149> less<00:02:00.479> resistance<00:02:00.990> than<00:02:01.049> fiber<00:02:01.409> tank

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
little less resistance than fiber tank

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.819 
little less resistance than fiber tank
but<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.670> asked<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.149> personal<00:02:03.509> lover
