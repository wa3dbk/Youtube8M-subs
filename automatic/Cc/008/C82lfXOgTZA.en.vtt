00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
did what I just use the words this with

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.469 
did what I just use the words this with
the<00:01:45.600> HD<00:01:46.340> HD<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.549> don't<00:01:47.759> know<00:01:47.850> how<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.000> color<00:01:48.270> this

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the HD HD I don't know how to color this

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.359 
the HD HD I don't know how to color this
 so<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.590> put<00:01:49.950> over<00:01:50.070> here<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.009> get
