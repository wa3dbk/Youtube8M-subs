talking<00:05:55.500> about<00:05:55.770> a<00:05:55.890> web<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.490> ecological<00:05:57.450> web

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
talking about a web the ecological web

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.690 
talking about a web the ecological web
where<00:05:57.930> everything<00:05:58.380> interacts<00:05:58.770> together<00:05:59.190> you

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
where everything interacts together you

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.510 
where everything interacts together you
save<00:06:00.000> a<00:06:00.480> an<00:06:01.260> elephant<00:06:01.800> you're<00:06:02.070> saving<00:06:02.430> the

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
save a an elephant you're saving the

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.100 
save a an elephant you're saving the
environment<00:06:02.670> that<00:06:03.210> element<00:06:03.600> lives<00:06:03.810> including

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
environment that element lives including

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.640 
environment that element lives including
small<00:06:04.740> animals<00:06:05.190> it's<00:06:05.850> a<00:06:05.940> large<00:06:06.150> project<00:06:06.650> so

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
small animals it's a large project so

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.770 
small animals it's a large project so
for<00:06:07.890> a<00:06:07.920> species<00:06:08.430> like<00:06:08.460> the<00:06:08.910> ferret<00:06:09.330> that<00:06:09.540> has

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
for a species like the ferret that has

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.120 
for a species like the ferret that has
been<00:06:10.910> removed<00:06:11.910> from<00:06:12.270> an<00:06:12.570> ecosystem<00:06:13.130> because

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
been removed from an ecosystem because

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.700 
been removed from an ecosystem because
of<00:06:14.280> something<00:06:14.490> that<00:06:14.670> humans<00:06:15.120> have<00:06:15.300> done<00:06:15.710> and

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
of something that humans have done and

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.410 
of something that humans have done and
because<00:06:16.980> of<00:06:17.250> different<00:06:17.610> beliefs<00:06:17.850> that<00:06:18.120> we<00:06:18.240> had

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.420 
because of different beliefs that we had

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.970 
because of different beliefs that we had
when<00:06:18.630> that<00:06:18.780> happened<00:06:19.140> you<00:06:19.200> know<00:06:19.230> 50<00:06:19.620> years<00:06:19.650> ago

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
when that happened you know 50 years ago

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.000 
when that happened you know 50 years ago
predators<00:06:20.700> were<00:06:20.970> viewed<00:06:21.240> as<00:06:21.360> a<00:06:21.420> bad<00:06:21.720> thing<00:06:22.010> so

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
predators were viewed as a bad thing so

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.130 
predators were viewed as a bad thing so
we<00:06:23.220> felt<00:06:23.400> that<00:06:23.550> humans<00:06:24.390> felt<00:06:24.630> that<00:06:24.780> if<00:06:24.930> we

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.140 
we felt that humans felt that if we

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.010 
we felt that humans felt that if we
eliminated<00:06:25.710> predators<00:06:26.510> we<00:06:27.510> would<00:06:27.660> have<00:06:27.810> more

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
eliminated predators we would have more

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.800 
eliminated predators we would have more
prey<00:06:28.230> species<00:06:28.500> and<00:06:28.860> they<00:06:28.950> were<00:06:29.010> the<00:06:29.190> good<00:06:29.370> ones

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
prey species and they were the good ones

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.900 
prey species and they were the good ones
now<00:06:30.810> we<00:06:30.870> know<00:06:31.230> much<00:06:31.530> more<00:06:31.790> intelligently<00:06:32.790> that

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
now we know much more intelligently that

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.030 
now we know much more intelligently that
you<00:06:33.360> need<00:06:33.570> the<00:06:33.720> entire<00:06:34.050> ecosystem<00:06:34.440> to

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
you need the entire ecosystem to

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.580 
you need the entire ecosystem to
function<00:06:35.490> and<00:06:35.670> so<00:06:36.360> in<00:06:36.690> order<00:06:36.900> for<00:06:37.230> it<00:06:37.320> to<00:06:37.350> be

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
function and so in order for it to be

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.110 
function and so in order for it to be
healthy<00:06:37.770> it<00:06:38.130> needs<00:06:38.340> to<00:06:38.520> have<00:06:38.670> all<00:06:38.850> of<00:06:38.970> its

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
healthy it needs to have all of its

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.640 
healthy it needs to have all of its
parts<00:06:39.480> kind<00:06:39.690> of<00:06:39.810> like<00:06:39.990> an<00:06:40.110> airplane<00:06:40.380> you're

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
parts kind of like an airplane you're

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.440 
parts kind of like an airplane you're
not<00:06:40.770> going<00:06:40.890> to<00:06:40.950> get<00:06:41.100> an<00:06:41.220> airplane<00:06:41.730> that

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.450 
not going to get an airplane that

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.570 
not going to get an airplane that
doesn't<00:06:42.840> have<00:06:42.990> a<00:06:43.050> wing<00:06:43.290> or<00:06:43.530> that's<00:06:44.100> missing<00:06:44.520> a

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
doesn't have a wing or that's missing a

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.370 
doesn't have a wing or that's missing a
bunch<00:06:44.760> of<00:06:44.880> nuts<00:06:45.060> and<00:06:45.210> bolts<00:06:45.510> from<00:06:45.690> you<00:06:46.260> know

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
bunch of nuts and bolts from you know

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.530 
bunch of nuts and bolts from you know
the<00:06:46.620> wing<00:06:46.800> and<00:06:47.070> so<00:06:47.670> we<00:06:48.120> don't<00:06:48.270> necessarily

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
the wing and so we don't necessarily

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.380 
the wing and so we don't necessarily
know<00:06:49.230> which<00:06:49.830> parts<00:06:50.370> are<00:06:50.550> the<00:06:50.670> most<00:06:50.820> important

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:51.390 
know which parts are the most important

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.670 
know which parts are the most important
so<00:06:51.570> we<00:06:51.690> want<00:06:51.870> to<00:06:51.960> make<00:06:52.050> sure<00:06:52.080> that<00:06:52.350> we<00:06:52.470> have<00:06:52.650> all

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
so we want to make sure that we have all

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.879 
so we want to make sure that we have all
of

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:53.889 
of

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:57.059 
of
so<00:06:54.190> the<00:06:54.310> opportunity<00:06:54.970> for<00:06:55.650> Kansas<00:06:56.650> zoos<00:06:57.039> to

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:57.069 
so the opportunity for Kansas zoos to

00:06:57.069 --> 00:06:59.850 
so the opportunity for Kansas zoos to
participate<00:06:58.030> in<00:06:58.180> a<00:06:58.270> project<00:06:58.479> that<00:06:58.930> returns<00:06:59.440> a

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
participate in a project that returns a

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.309 
participate in a project that returns a
missing<00:07:00.400> link<00:07:00.610> from<00:07:01.419> a<00:07:01.750> prairie<00:07:02.169> ecosystem

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 
missing link from a prairie ecosystem

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.089 
missing link from a prairie ecosystem
was<00:07:03.280> just<00:07:03.550> an<00:07:03.669> opportunity<00:07:04.270> that<00:07:04.479> was<00:07:04.720> a<00:07:05.319> very

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:06.099 
was just an opportunity that was a very

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:08.580 
was just an opportunity that was a very
natural<00:07:06.310> fit<00:07:06.819> for<00:07:07.120> all<00:07:07.270> of<00:07:07.449> us<00:07:07.569> it's<00:07:08.470> a<00:07:08.560> matter

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:08.590 
natural fit for all of us it's a matter

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.320 
natural fit for all of us it's a matter
of<00:07:08.860> just<00:07:09.039> retaining<00:07:09.699> and<00:07:09.879> bringing<00:07:10.150> back

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330 
of just retaining and bringing back

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.879 
of just retaining and bringing back
something<00:07:10.629> that<00:07:10.930> is<00:07:11.050> critically<00:07:11.470> important

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:11.889 
something that is critically important

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:16.139 
something that is critically important
to<00:07:11.919> us<00:07:12.039> in<00:07:12.220> the<00:07:12.280> whole<00:07:12.490> balance<00:07:13.000> of<00:07:13.139> nature
