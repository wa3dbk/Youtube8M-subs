00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.760
 again to Felix the cat the only 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.570
 unique and in this house sir I am 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.040
 recording because if it was the player for a 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.559
 little of which does not matter 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.660
 then it was the home internet so it's 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.810
 I was going up I said the episode yesterday 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.039
 12 part tight then I imagine that 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.449
 I will not do anything when 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.009
 computer during traffic that 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.480
 return the intermediate and I finished uploading 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.149
 the video the processes and had said that 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.890
 Today there are 23 hours left to climb 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.589
 mothers and not yet the pressures of 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.170
 intermediate the good thing is that the mother who 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.730
 upload the videos from youtube 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.160
 recently made and if you are going to avoid 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.350
 main fart when I return fire continues 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.700
 going up keeps on rising that from his mother 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.060
 I thank the engineers of 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.600
 google at your job so at least 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.830
 he does his bastard job more than he 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.080
 many people could say and 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:01:00.030
 get many lives because it is possible 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.030
 let him die a couple of times 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.130
 maybe at that time no longer because one 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.740
 grab practice grab callus and 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.390
 Suddenly patients with a child are 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.390
 absurdly easy 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:25.710
 also agreed because a 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.710
 streaming the movie 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.610
 having a streaming and movie of 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.610
 the saints that America had 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.640
 then I saw one of the old videos 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:43.490
 as Cordoba of the old I lived inclusive 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.250
 I remembered what once we already had 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.720
 you calling right now that some 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.180
 classes that he should have taken to the 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.180
 first semesters of university but 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.810
 do not carry because the race was 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.430
 closing at the university then 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.530
 bad things happened in life and I had 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.330
 that bring this material the semesters 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.560
 high before they will stop 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.300
 imparting that subject I had to 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.729
 changing campus 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.750
 one thing that happens a lot 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.250
 in some races they are not complete 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.549
 people who change strange campus 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.890
 of friends who have gone through that their 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.379
 career is not complete instead in the 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.080
 campus 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:33.580
 I'm going to talk about them a friend yes and 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.580
 returned to give physics classes to the state 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.420
 what things happen and I remembered the proposal 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.019
 of a morra 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.090
 I was curious about the context because 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.950
 she proposed that return to the videos 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.379
 mtv that in the videos at this time already 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.750
 they are not profitable for in you villa is a 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.250
 time after going to youtube and see the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.610
 video you want as many times as you want 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.220
 anytime 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.920
 without having to wait for the warm 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:07.560
 advertising then is no longer necessary 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.560
 shoot to watch music videos 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.970
 and that's why they do nothing else 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.220
 sell is a business gentlemen of the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.629
 population on television are businesses 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.189
 we are here on youtube doing the 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:23.579
 things in a good way but good if not 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.579
 I am going to mark 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.959
 and they 're deleted by putting that and she 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:34.959
 it was again income that is 45 years 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.170
 less than me 6 years younger than me at 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.489
 it hosts a lot and I remember seeing 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.489
 when I was very child 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.510
 it was good that he had 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.940
 the rare mtv commercials alone 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.480
 same and many of you no longer 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.299
 touched 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.160
 you are minors, you are not 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.709
 they had to see online or about to 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.859
 girls counting in their good eyes where 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:10.440
 the wave when I had good programming 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.440
 critical the stops went bankrupt 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.840
 and this get milk because if it's not going to 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:34.330
 be mothers of this transformation 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:37.389
 it can give a little nerves mothers but 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.610
 yes sir and we are possibly touched him 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.669
 the mtv la for you I remember when 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.160
 I was in high school eighth the 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:48.370
 primary when I was going out of elementary school 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.039
 they bit into warm and they marketed it 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.370
 way the ball titula american and 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:57.430
 they removed if I can say that term if 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.590
 is correct and if I'm not worth mother 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.510
 I do not know neither night trips nor how 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.390
 express the synthesis and that first thing 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.700
 that I came up sorry sorry to the 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.990
 purists of the language 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:14.910
 it's not by the way big is improvised 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.910
 I suddenly sole purpose is the swear 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:22.960
 this moral when I was in the 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:25.960
 secondary return for mtv 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.960
 Latin America 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.699
 it's enough to blame it takes you out of the 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.020
 terms and tells the fuck story 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:37.039
 so 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.379
 because with this always always gold between 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:42.349
 yes it was not like before it was no longer 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:45.940
 eggs what used to be the beautiful thing 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.940
 the one that I was used to today 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:54.240
 it's nothing stupid because immediately 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:05.270
 when I was little 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.270
 where you possibly remember mtv 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:16.900
 this is the series is politically 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:19.740
 wrong chest where they remember 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:23.009
 that merchant in order 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:26.699
 the mouse write that has announced the 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:29.699
 apocalypse and from the series the rain and 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:31.229
 stimpy use forests on both 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:34.660
 princes who enjoy spending the 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:36.820
 crotch if I remember correctly 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.520
 they remember that kind of thing 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.380
 she did not experience that she already had the 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.750
 mtv half jacket had him videos 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.550
 borrowed Mary Charro because not all 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.930
 they had internet at home or not all 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.970
 they had the possibility of having internet 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:52.000
 decent to watch videos at home in 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.770
 that then watching videos was era was a 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.840
 you 're an ox, I just went to the 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.990
 cyber and have a level if da vinci mona 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.889
 to watch videos no mames but yes gentlemen 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:07.259
 because in this era 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:09.479
 and it was not a big deal youtube I do not remember 

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:15.379
 well the dates but good of Felix the 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:15.379
 cat in which possibly 

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:20.990
 possibly never enjoy the good and 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.990
 anti fuck
