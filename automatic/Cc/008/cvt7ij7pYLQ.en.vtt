00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.980 

for<00:00:34.220> musicians<00:00:34.550> one<00:00:35.540> of<00:00:35.660> the<00:00:35.780> greatest

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
for musicians one of the greatest

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.900 
for musicians one of the greatest
feelings<00:00:36.500> is<00:00:36.740> actually<00:00:37.220> sitting<00:00:37.520> in<00:00:37.670> the

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
feelings is actually sitting in the

feelings is actually sitting in the
orchestra<00:00:38.780> we<00:00:39.050> love<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.350> music<00:00:39.650> we<00:00:39.770> play<00:00:39.980> but

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
orchestra we love the music we play but

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.370 
orchestra we love the music we play but
there's<00:00:40.400> a<00:00:40.489> certain<00:00:40.880> energy<00:00:41.360> that<00:00:42.230> comes

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
there's a certain energy that comes

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.560 
there's a certain energy that comes
along<00:00:42.560> with<00:00:42.680> playing<00:00:43.130> in<00:00:43.430> a<00:00:43.850> group<00:00:44.120> that's<00:00:44.330> the

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
along with playing in a group that's the

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.750 
along with playing in a group that's the
size<00:00:44.809> of<00:00:44.989> an<00:00:45.110> orchestra<00:00:45.710> so<00:00:46.010> we<00:00:46.250> decided<00:00:46.580> to

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
size of an orchestra so we decided to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.250 
size of an orchestra so we decided to
have<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:46.880> audience<00:00:47.360> sit<00:00:47.720> within<00:00:48.020> the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
have the audience sit within the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.900 
have the audience sit within the
orchestra<00:00:48.739> right<00:00:48.950> next<00:00:49.309> to<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.430> musicians

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.850 

I<00:00:53.970> think<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:54.900> really<00:00:55.140> exciting<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
I think it's really exciting to have the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.160 
I think it's really exciting to have the
audience<00:00:56.100> sit<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:56.850> us<00:00:56.910> because<00:00:57.840> if

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
audience sit in with us because if

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.870 
audience sit in with us because if
there's<00:00:58.560> a<00:00:58.650> really<00:00:58.890> loud<00:00:59.130> entrance<00:00:59.610> we're

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
there's a really loud entrance we're

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.490 
there's a really loud entrance we're
going<00:00:59.970> to<00:01:00.060> see<00:01:00.300> their<00:01:00.480> reactions<00:01:00.989> seconds

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
going to see their reactions seconds

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.380 
going to see their reactions seconds
that<00:01:01.650> it<00:01:01.739> happens<00:01:04.339> they<00:01:05.339> may<00:01:05.550> see<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:06.150> our

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
that it happens they may see in our

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.330 
that it happens they may see in our
bodies<00:01:06.750> ask<00:01:06.990> intense<00:01:07.350> before<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> solo<00:01:08.070> they're

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
bodies ask intense before a solo they're

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.650 
bodies ask intense before a solo they're
seeing<00:01:08.610> our<00:01:08.820> interaction<00:01:09.390> with<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
seeing our interaction with the

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.560 
seeing our interaction with the
conductor<00:01:10.170> they're<00:01:10.710> seeing<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:12.000> work<00:01:12.360> that

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
conductor they're seeing the work that

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.300 
conductor they're seeing the work that
we<00:01:12.720> do<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.050> goes<00:01:13.170> into<00:01:13.380> our<00:01:13.650> art<00:01:13.800> as<00:01:13.979> opposed

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
we do that goes into our art as opposed

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.800 
we do that goes into our art as opposed
to<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.520> seeing<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:14.970> beautiful<00:01:15.390> picture<00:01:15.690> on

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
to just seeing this beautiful picture on

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.750 
to just seeing this beautiful picture on
a<00:01:15.840> stage<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:17.160> that<00:01:17.280> makes<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.640> more

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
a stage and I think that makes it more

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.779 
a stage and I think that makes it more
accessible

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.899 

resistance<00:01:22.789> perspective<00:01:23.479> having<00:01:24.100> been<00:01:25.100> in<00:01:25.549> an

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
resistance perspective having been in an

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.190 
resistance perspective having been in an
audience<00:01:26.329> listening<00:01:26.719> to<00:01:26.810> classical<00:01:27.140> music

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
audience listening to classical music

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.560 
audience listening to classical music
concerts<00:01:27.770> for<00:01:28.009> years<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.549> having<00:01:29.060> sat<00:01:29.329> in<00:01:29.479> a

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
concerts for years and having sat in a

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.660 
concerts for years and having sat in a
brass<00:01:29.810> section<00:01:30.259> I<00:01:30.409> know<00:01:30.500> that<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.039> energy

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
brass section I know that the energy

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.039 
brass section I know that the energy
that<00:01:31.700> comes<00:01:32.119> out<00:01:32.479> of<00:01:32.509> a<00:01:32.689> warrenville

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
that comes out of a warrenville

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.599 
that comes out of a warrenville
something<00:01:33.469> you<00:01:33.590> can't<00:01:33.890> experience<00:01:34.250> unless

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
something you can't experience unless

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.620 
something you can't experience unless
you're<00:01:34.819> right<00:01:35.000> next

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.139 

I<00:01:38.740> think<00:01:39.740> something<00:01:40.100> collectors<00:01:40.759> come<00:01:41.030> to

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
I think something collectors come to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.600 
I think something collectors come to
accept<00:01:41.539> is<00:01:41.869> that<00:01:42.289> what<00:01:42.469> we're<00:01:42.619> doing<00:01:42.920> looks

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
accept is that what we're doing looks

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.690 
accept is that what we're doing looks
too<00:01:44.060> many<00:01:44.270> outsiders<00:01:44.750> kind<00:01:45.710> of<00:01:45.799> absurd<00:01:46.189> the

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
too many outsiders kind of absurd the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.499 
too many outsiders kind of absurd the
level<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.350> emotion<00:01:49.030> histrionics<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:50.210> yet

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
level of emotion histrionics and yet

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:59.880 
level of emotion histrionics and yet
control<00:01:51.259> one<00:01:51.649> has<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:52.039> possess

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.800 

the<00:02:00.890> conductor<00:02:01.160> operates<00:02:01.850> on<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.150> couple

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
the conductor operates on a couple

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.020 
the conductor operates on a couple
different<00:02:03.230> levels<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.800> first<00:02:04.100> is<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.370> very

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
different levels the first is a very

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.150 
different levels the first is a very
much<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:05.270> logistical<00:02:06.110> level<00:02:06.500> for<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.860> audience

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
much a logistical level for the audience

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.530 
much a logistical level for the audience
sitting<00:02:07.490> there<00:02:07.760> watching<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.330> conductor

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
sitting there watching the conductor

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.359 
sitting there watching the conductor
going<00:02:09.200> through<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.470> motions<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:10.040> bringing

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
going through the motions of bringing

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.270 
going through the motions of bringing
people<00:02:10.700> in<00:02:10.940> at<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.660> right<00:02:11.840> time<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.410> so<00:02:12.980> forth

people in at the right time and so forth

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.220 
people in at the right time and so forth
they<00:02:13.820> get<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.030> sense<00:02:14.360> of<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:14.660> but<00:02:14.900> they<00:02:15.020> also

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
they get a sense of that but they also

they get a sense of that but they also

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
the the sort of intangible expression

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.240 
the the sort of intangible expression
that<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.960> conductor<00:02:21.380> can<00:02:21.560> bring<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:22.040> how

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
that the conductor can bring to how

that<00:02:39.550> we<00:02:39.760> play<00:02:39.819> humanities<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.900> arts<00:02:41.019> I<00:02:41.319> think

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
that we play humanities and arts I think

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.930 
that we play humanities and arts I think
are<00:02:41.680> just<00:02:41.709> a<00:02:41.950> reflection<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.519> human<00:02:42.910> thought

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
are just a reflection of human thought

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.339 
are just a reflection of human thought
and<00:02:43.390> emotion<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:44.950> it's<00:02:45.549> not<00:02:45.790> that

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
and emotion and so it's not that

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.809 
and emotion and so it's not that
classical<00:02:47.349> music<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.739> this<00:02:47.890> alley<00:02:48.220> art<00:02:48.519> form

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
that people can't relate to i think it

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.559
