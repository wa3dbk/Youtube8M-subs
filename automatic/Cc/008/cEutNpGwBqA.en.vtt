00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.289 
the head there are set appointed times
which<00:04:18.269> shows<00:04:18.570> it<00:04:18.989> was<00:04:19.139> different<00:04:19.409> than<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.829> norm

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
which shows it was different than a norm

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.700 
which shows it was different than a norm
so<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.450> night<00:04:21.599> of<00:04:21.750> Passover<00:04:21.989> they<00:04:22.469> ate<00:04:22.620> at

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
so the night of Passover they ate at

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.890 
so the night of Passover they ate at
nighttime<00:04:23.099> this<00:04:23.909> was<00:04:24.210> different<00:04:24.450> than<00:04:24.780> the

nighttime this was different than the
normal

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
normal

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.130 
normal
so<00:04:26.220> so<00:04:26.790> shows<00:04:27.120> even<00:04:27.360> more<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:27.810> couldn't<00:04:28.050> have

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
so so shows even more it couldn't have

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.170 
so so shows even more it couldn't have
been<00:04:28.170> the<00:04:28.320> same<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:29.460> know<00:04:29.640> that<00:04:29.910> again

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
been the same so you know that again

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.700 
been the same so you know that again
