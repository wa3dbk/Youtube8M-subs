quarterly color and I'm just going to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.530

add one dot or two dots to the center of

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.899 
add one dot or two dots to the center of
the<00:01:41.720> flower<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:42.710> then<00:01:43.100> I'm<00:01:43.220> going<00:01:43.430> to<00:01:43.520> drag<00:01:43.850> it

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
the flower and then I'm going to drag it

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.850 
the flower and then I'm going to drag it
on<00:01:44.119> because<00:01:44.300> you<00:01:44.960> don't<00:01:45.140> want<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.710> nail

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
on because you don't want the nail

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.859 
on because you don't want the nail
polish<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.340> dry<00:01:46.520> I<00:01:46.880> think<00:01:47.330> it<00:01:47.450> gives<00:01:47.570> it<00:01:47.720> a

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
polish to dry I think it gives it a

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.390 
polish to dry I think it gives it a
little<00:01:48.050> bit<00:01:48.229> of<00:01:48.260> a<00:01:48.409> better<00:01:48.619> effect<00:01:48.800> when<00:01:49.280> you

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
little bit of a better effect when you

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.010 
little bit of a better effect when you
mix<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.790> colors<00:01:50.119> or<00:01:50.330> some<00:01:50.540> other<00:01:50.690> colors

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
mix the colors or some other colors

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.160 
mix the colors or some other colors
together<00:01:51.200> like<00:01:51.590> this<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:53.600> finish<00:01:53.869> out<00:01:54.050> the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
together like this to finish out the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.870 
together like this to finish out the
flowers<00:01:54.350> I'm<00:01:54.680> going<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:54.950> be<00:01:55.070> using<00:01:55.250> this
