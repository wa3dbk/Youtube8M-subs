00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.579 

now<00:00:02.520> let's<00:00:02.760> take<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.030> look<00:00:03.300> at<00:00:03.540> creating<00:00:04.319> and

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
now let's take a look at creating and

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.400 
now let's take a look at creating and
accessing<00:00:05.580> databases<00:00:05.790> using<00:00:06.690> hierarchs

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
accessing databases using hierarchs

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.129 
accessing databases using hierarchs
chess<00:00:07.649> Explorer<00:00:08.300> the<00:00:09.300> screen<00:00:09.510> as<00:00:09.630> we<00:00:09.750> see<00:00:09.929> now

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
chess Explorer the screen as we see now

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.080 
chess Explorer the screen as we see now
is<00:00:10.290> pretty<00:00:10.530> much<00:00:10.650> how<00:00:11.070> hax<00:00:11.550> will<00:00:11.759> look<00:00:11.940> when

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
is pretty much how hax will look when

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.110 
is pretty much how hax will look when
you<00:00:12.210> load<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.660> up<00:00:12.780> for<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.049> very<00:00:13.230> first<00:00:13.440> time

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
you load it up for the very first time

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.300 
you load it up for the very first time
so<00:00:15.120> we<00:00:15.240> want<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.509> create<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:16.170> new<00:00:16.560> database<00:00:16.800> to

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
so we want to create a new database to

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.820 
so we want to create a new database to
work<00:00:17.460> from<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.660> simplest<00:00:19.470> way<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.619> do

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
work from and the simplest way to do

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.849 
work from and the simplest way to do
that<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.279> go<00:00:20.369> up<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.490> file<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.119> click<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.449> new

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
that just go up to file and click on new

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.960 
that just go up to file and click on new
this<00:00:22.859> brings<00:00:23.100> up<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.279> screen<00:00:23.580> where<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.820> get

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
this brings up the screen where you get

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.390 
this brings up the screen where you get
to<00:00:24.090> choose<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.300> name<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.840> new<00:00:24.930> database

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
to choose the name of the new database

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.679 
to choose the name of the new database
generally<00:00:26.400> speaking<00:00:26.670> all<00:00:27.060> you'll<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.539> do

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
generally speaking all you'll have to do

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.450 
generally speaking all you'll have to do
is<00:00:27.990> type<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.590> name<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.160> want<00:00:29.340> to

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
is type in the name that you want to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.580 
is type in the name that you want to
save<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.849> database<00:00:30.179> under<00:00:30.510> can<00:00:31.109> be<00:00:31.199> anything

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
save this database under can be anything

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.799 
save this database under can be anything
it's<00:00:32.399> usually<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.669> good<00:00:32.790> idea<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.120> save<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.630> so

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
it's usually a good idea to save it so

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.270 
it's usually a good idea to save it so
you'll<00:00:33.989> know<00:00:34.230> what<00:00:34.590> sort<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.890> games<00:00:35.130> you've

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
you'll know what sort of games you've

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.160 
you'll know what sort of games you've
saved<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.730> database<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.390> future<00:00:36.750> but

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
saved in that database in the future but

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.869 
saved in that database in the future but
for<00:00:37.230> now<00:00:37.469> we'll<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.649> call<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.010> my<00:00:38.250> games

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
for now we'll just call it my games

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.580 
for now we'll just call it my games
that's<00:00:39.540> probably<00:00:39.780> all<00:00:40.020> you'll<00:00:40.200> need<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.350> do

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
that's probably all you'll need to do

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.369 
that's probably all you'll need to do
but<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.489> reference<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.390> saying

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
but just for reference this is saying

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.930 
but just for reference this is saying
where<00:00:43.710> you've<00:00:43.890> saved<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.280> database<00:00:44.579> too

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
where you've saved that database too

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.240 
where you've saved that database too
it's<00:00:45.719> saving<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.200> databases<00:00:46.710> folder

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it's saving it to the databases folder

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.150 
it's saving it to the databases folder
which<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.600> your<00:00:48.780> documents<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
which is in your documents this is the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.680 
which is in your documents this is the
default<00:00:50.370> location<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.239> shouldn't<00:00:51.570> need

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
default location so you shouldn't need

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.060 
default location so you shouldn't need
to<00:00:51.840> change<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.289> but<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.590> always<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> good

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
to change that but it's always a good

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.529 
to change that but it's always a good
idea<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.489> know<00:00:53.610> where<00:00:53.640> you're<00:00:54.059> saving<00:00:54.420> your

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
idea to know where you're saving your

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.540 
idea to know where you're saving your
databases<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.289> especially<00:00:56.039> if<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.309> want<00:00:56.460> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
databases to especially if you want to

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.520 
databases to especially if you want to
back<00:00:56.699> them<00:00:56.940> up<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> future<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.899> also

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
back them up in the future and also

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.349 
back them up in the future and also
we've<00:00:59.039> mentioned<00:00:59.250> before<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.789> format<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
you can go back to the file menu here

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.319 
you can go back to the file menu here
and<00:01:39.210> click<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:39.990> open<00:01:40.610> or<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.939> simply<00:01:42.150> just

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
use this icon the open database icon so

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.060 
use this icon the open database icon so
let's<00:01:45.960> do<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.140> now<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.470> brings<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
let's do that now that brings up the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.249 
let's do that now that brings up the
open<00:01:47.399> database<00:01:47.640> window<00:01:48.060> you're<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.110> the

worth<00:02:45.870> noting<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.680> once<00:02:46.980> you've<00:02:47.220> opened<00:02:47.579> a

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
worth noting is once you've opened a

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.699 
worth noting is once you've opened a
database<00:02:48.299> for<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.510> first<00:02:48.750> time<00:02:49.049> it<00:02:49.590> will

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
database for the first time it will

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.680 
database for the first time it will
appear<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.099> this<00:02:50.190> list<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.700> recently<00:02:51.329> opened

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
appear in this list of recently opened

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.990 
appear in this list of recently opened
databases<00:02:52.379> so<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.010> don't<00:02:53.190> actually<00:02:53.400> need<00:02:53.940> to

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
databases so you don't actually need to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.390 
databases so you don't actually need to
know<00:02:54.299> where<00:02:55.200> you've<00:02:55.349> saved<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:55.980> although

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
know where you've saved it to although

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.039 
know where you've saved it to although
of<00:02:56.489> course<00:02:56.670> that's<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:56.909> good<00:02:57.030> idea<00:02:57.150> because<00:02:57.870> if

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
of course that's a good idea because if

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.660 
of course that's a good idea because if
you<00:02:58.139> close<00:02:58.379> the<00:02:58.560> databases<00:02:59.129> down<00:02:59.340> you've

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
you close the databases down you've

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.059 
you close the databases down you've
opened<00:02:59.790> go<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.540> file<00:03:00.959> menu<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.530> open<00:03:01.859> recent

accessed databases clicking on any one

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.509 
accessed databases clicking on any one
of<00:03:06.750> these<00:03:06.989> will<00:03:07.379> bring<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.709> database<00:03:08.129> back

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
of these will bring that database back

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.059 
of these will bring that database back
and<00:03:09.030> one<00:03:09.810> interesting<00:03:10.409> thing<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.709> note<00:03:10.859> is<00:03:11.040> if

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
and one interesting thing to note is if
