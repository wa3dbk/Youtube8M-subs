00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659

but that's important with with all
breeds<00:01:43.960> I<00:01:44.110> mean<00:01:44.290> you<00:01:44.799> know<00:01:44.860> they<00:01:45.009> they<00:01:45.430> should

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
breeds I mean you know they they should

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.060 
breeds I mean you know they they should
be<00:01:45.820> taken<00:01:46.509> care<00:01:46.540> of<00:01:46.750> if<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.320> don't<00:01:47.500> like<00:01:47.680> fur

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070

all<00:01:48.280> over<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.700> place

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
all over the place

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.660 
all over the place
then<00:01:49.299> a<00:01:49.329> collie<00:01:49.630> maybe<00:01:49.899> isn't<00:01:50.080> a<00:01:50.770> dog<00:01:51.250> for<00:01:51.549> you

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
then a collie maybe isn't a dog for you

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.710 
then a collie maybe isn't a dog for you
but<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:52.509> find<00:01:53.110> it<00:01:53.200> worth<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.530> fur
