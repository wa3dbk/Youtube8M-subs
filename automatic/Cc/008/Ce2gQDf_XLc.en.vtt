to have a passport it had a little bit

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.620 
to have a passport it had a little bit
of<00:01:27.860> that<00:01:27.950> lost<00:01:28.250> in<00:01:28.460> translation<00:01:28.880> feeling

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
of that lost in translation feeling

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.530
