00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
the Rusk system on my hair I think it's

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.009

called<00:00:26.039> Rusk<00:00:26.340> straight<00:00:27.180> with<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.779> number

eight<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.410> their<00:00:28.590> first<00:00:28.769> straight<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.990> anyway

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
eight in their first straight and anyway

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.450 
eight in their first straight and anyway
I<00:00:31.019> get<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.320> done<00:00:31.470> about<00:00:31.679> every<00:00:31.980> eight<00:00:32.250> months

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460
