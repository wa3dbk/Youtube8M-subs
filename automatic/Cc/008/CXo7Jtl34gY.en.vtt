for this place defender tighten with
flashbang<00:00:41.730> grenade<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.239> good<00:00:42.540> but<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.170> can

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
flashbang grenade is good but if you can

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.650

only<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:43.649> Titan<00:00:44.250> go<00:00:44.550> defender<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
only have one Titan go defender the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.150 
only have one Titan go defender the
first<00:00:45.930> step<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> get<00:00:46.440> past<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.890> three

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
first step is to get past the three

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.279 
first step is to get past the three
waves<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.520> enemies<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.030> front<00:00:48.329> door<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
waves of enemies at the front door the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.720 
waves of enemies at the front door the
first<00:00:49.559> two<00:00:49.739> waves<00:00:49.950> are<00:00:50.129> not<00:00:50.280> particularly

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
first two waves are not particularly

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.880 
first two waves are not particularly
difficult<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> third<00:00:52.289> wave<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:52.739> give

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
difficult but the third wave can give

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.600 
difficult but the third wave can give
you<00:00:52.980> some<00:00:53.190> trouble

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
you some trouble

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.580 
you some trouble
for<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> third<00:00:54.510> wave<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.870> should<00:00:55.050> back<00:00:55.260> up<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
for the third wave you should back up to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.889 
for the third wave you should back up to
the<00:00:55.710> doorway<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.280> came<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.789> two<00:00:56.969> wizards
