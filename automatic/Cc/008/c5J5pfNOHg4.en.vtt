alright guys this is going to be a video
on<00:00:06.629> my<00:00:06.870> homemade<00:00:07.170> breeding<00:00:07.919> tank<00:00:08.510> this<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.570> an

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
on my homemade breeding tank this is an

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.110 
on my homemade breeding tank this is an
interesting<00:00:10.080> design<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.309> thought<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.880> I've

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
interesting design I thought of I've

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.959 
interesting design I thought of I've
never<00:00:12.330> seen<00:00:12.660> anything<00:00:13.650> like<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:14.190> on<00:00:14.370> YouTube

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
never seen anything like this on YouTube

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.599 
never seen anything like this on YouTube
and<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.269> was<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:15.540> simple<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.379> just<00:00:16.619> don't<00:00:17.490> know

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
and it was so simple I just don't know

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.380 
and it was so simple I just don't know
how<00:00:17.960> it<00:00:18.960> hasn't<00:00:19.140> been<00:00:19.380> posted<00:00:19.830> before<00:00:20.390> so

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
how it hasn't been posted before so

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.140 
how it hasn't been posted before so
basically<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.960> used<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.560> regular<00:00:22.949> 20<00:00:23.670> gallon

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
basically I used a regular 20 gallon

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.490 
basically I used a regular 20 gallon
long<00:00:24.359> fish<00:00:25.230> tank<00:00:26.180> non<00:00:27.180> refresh<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:28.410> I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
long fish tank non refresh that I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.410 
long fish tank non refresh that I
divided<00:00:29.130> with<00:00:29.900> black<00:00:30.900> acrylic<00:00:31.109> panels<00:00:32.420> right

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
divided with black acrylic panels right

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.479 
divided with black acrylic panels right
if<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.780> know<00:00:33.899> how<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.079> make<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> sump<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.280> can

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
if you know how to make a sump you can

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.889 
if you know how to make a sump you can
make<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.940> very<00:00:36.600> easily<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.980> basically<00:00:38.899> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
make this very easily so basically the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.150 
make this very easily so basically the
first<00:00:41.390> wall<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.899> highest<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.649> second<00:00:44.040> one

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
first wall is the highest the second one

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.150 
first wall is the highest the second one
is<00:00:44.420> there's<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.570> quarter<00:00:45.870> inch<00:00:46.050> shorter<00:00:46.500> so

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
is there's a quarter inch shorter so

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.369 
is there's a quarter inch shorter so
that<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.610> goes<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.899> sump<00:00:49.200> dose

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
that it goes just like a sump dose

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.189 
that it goes just like a sump dose
higher<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:50.010> lower<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.489> lowest<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.780> also<00:00:51.899> put

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
higher to lower to lowest and I also put

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.369 
higher to lower to lowest and I also put
these<00:00:52.379> egg<00:00:52.620> crates<00:00:53.719> so<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> fish<00:00:55.110> can't

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
these egg crates so that the fish can't

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.750 
these egg crates so that the fish can't
jump<00:00:55.649> over<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:57.329> then<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> used<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.500> hang<00:00:59.399> on<00:00:59.550> back

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
jump over and then I used a hang on back

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.050 
jump over and then I used a hang on back
refugium<00:01:02.719> to<00:01:03.719> get<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> water<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.500> go<00:01:04.700> it<00:01:05.700> sucks

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
refugium to get the water to go it sucks

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.090 
refugium to get the water to go it sucks
in<00:01:06.360> from<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.810> through<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.049> pump<00:01:07.350> flows

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
in from here through this pump flows

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.429 
in from here through this pump flows
back<00:01:08.340> into<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.670> refugium<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.780> normally<00:01:10.320> it

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
back into the refugium and normally it

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.530 
back into the refugium and normally it
would<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.710> go<00:01:10.830> back<00:01:10.979> into<00:01:11.220> your<00:01:11.310> tank<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.510> I

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
would just go back into your tank but I

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.310 
would just go back into your tank but I
use<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.229> keep<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.470> flow<00:01:14.570> going<00:01:15.570> pretty

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
use this to keep the flow going pretty

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.130 
use this to keep the flow going pretty
much<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> reef<00:01:17.520> ready<00:01:17.869> almost<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
much like a reef ready almost like a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.640 
much like a reef ready almost like a
reef<00:01:19.409> ready<00:01:19.710> fish<00:01:20.700> tank<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:22.140> inside<00:01:22.470> there

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
reef ready fish tank and inside there

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.960 
reef ready fish tank and inside there
I'm<00:01:22.740> not<00:01:22.890> going<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.159> do<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> refugium

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
I'm not going to do a refugium

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.690 
I'm not going to do a refugium
I'm<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.869> going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.020> keep<00:01:25.350> carving<00:01:25.700> probably

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
I'm just going to keep carving probably

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.580 
I'm just going to keep carving probably
some<00:01:26.820> pure<00:01:27.030> Jen<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.820> I'll<00:01:29.820> come<00:01:30.000> up<00:01:30.150> with<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.230 
some pure Jen and I'll come up with the
some<00:01:31.590> walls<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.159> put<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.430> between<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.000> can

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
some walls I can put in between so I can

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.730 
some walls I can put in between so I can
put<00:01:33.450> filter<00:01:33.780> floss<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.320> it'll<00:01:34.470> pass<00:01:34.710> through

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
put filter floss and it'll pass through

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.390 
put filter floss and it'll pass through
it<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.900> clean<00:01:36.900> some<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.259> water<00:01:37.470> right<00:01:38.130> now

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
it and clean some of the water right now

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.639 
it and clean some of the water right now
I<00:01:38.759> put<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.740> barely<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:42.210> piece<00:01:42.720> of

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.670 

carbon<00:01:46.970> pads<00:01:47.970> over<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> intake<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
carbon pads over the intake of the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.630 
carbon pads over the intake of the
filter<00:01:50.600> there<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.720> go<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.979> does<00:01:53.430> some

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
filter there we go so that it does some

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.120 
filter there we go so that it does some
cleaning<00:01:54.350> cleans<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> water<00:01:55.500> out<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> little

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
cleaning cleans the water out a little

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.359 
cleaning cleans the water out a little
bit<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.640> you'll<00:01:57.329> notice<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:58.380> water<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:59.310> is

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
bit so you'll notice this water here is

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.010 
bit so you'll notice this water here is
a<00:01:59.399> little<00:01:59.579> bit<00:01:59.790> lower<00:01:59.969> actually<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.659> fill

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
a little bit lower actually have to fill

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.010 
a little bit lower actually have to fill
it<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.590> because<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.920> evaporation<00:02:02.899> once<00:02:03.899> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
it up just because of evaporation once a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.139 
it up just because of evaporation once a
day<00:02:04.200> probably<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:06.170> quarter

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
day probably a quarter

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.070 
day probably a quarter
less<00:02:08.780> than<00:02:08.959> a<00:02:09.080> quarter<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.920> mean<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:11.080> water

less than a quarter I mean a a water

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.600 
less than a quarter I mean a a water
bottle<00:02:12.349> or<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:12.830> on<00:02:13.160> those<00:02:13.310> 16<00:02:13.730> ounces<00:02:14.319> and

flowerpot these two black ones I just
took<00:02:25.160> out<00:02:25.370> my<00:02:25.910> 28<00:02:26.750> nano<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.580> put<00:02:28.580> them<00:02:28.670> in<00:02:28.760> here

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
took out my 28 nano I put them in here

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.030 
took out my 28 nano I put them in here
oh<00:02:29.180> my<00:02:29.780> flower<00:02:30.050> pots<00:02:30.319> not<00:02:30.530> in<00:02:30.709> there<00:02:30.860> yet

oh my flower pots not in there yet

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.030 
oh my flower pots not in there yet

water<00:02:34.220> being<00:02:34.819> cured<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:36.080> don't<00:02:36.230> want<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.530> put

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
water being cured you don't want to put

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.880 
water being cured you don't want to put
them<00:02:37.250> directly<00:02:37.370> into<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:38.540> fish<00:02:39.200> tank<00:02:39.230> it

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
them directly into the fish tank it

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.920 
them directly into the fish tank it
makes<00:02:40.100> a<00:02:40.190> whole<00:02:40.280> bunch<00:02:40.519> of<00:02:40.670> bubbles<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.540> I'm

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
makes a whole bunch of bubbles and I'm

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.539 
makes a whole bunch of bubbles and I'm
not<00:02:42.260> I'm<00:02:42.440> not<00:02:42.680> sure<00:02:42.860> that's<00:02:43.010> great<00:02:43.280> for<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
not I'm not sure that's great for the

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.520 
not I'm not sure that's great for the
fish<00:02:43.600> there's<00:02:44.600> just<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.870> rock<00:02:45.049> in<00:02:45.230> there<00:02:45.380> right

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
fish there's just a rock in there right

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.949 
fish there's just a rock in there right
now<00:02:46.150> because<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.269> don't<00:02:47.420> have<00:02:47.480> any<00:02:47.630> fish<00:02:47.780> in

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
now because I don't have any fish in

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.360 
now because I don't have any fish in
there<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.380> took<00:02:48.769> these<00:02:48.920> fish<00:02:49.160> out<00:02:49.340> of

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
there and I took these fish out of

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.520 
there and I took these fish out of
another<00:02:49.940> tank<00:02:50.269> that<00:02:50.780> had<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.049> rock<00:02:51.230> in<00:02:51.410> there

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
another tank that had the rock in there

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.190 
another tank that had the rock in there
just<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.860> keep<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.900> biological<00:02:53.900> filtration

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
just to keep the biological filtration

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.110 
just to keep the biological filtration
going<00:02:54.769> I'll<00:02:54.950> probably<00:02:55.220> end<00:02:55.459> up<00:02:55.549> sticking<00:02:55.849> that

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
going I'll probably end up sticking that

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.229 
going I'll probably end up sticking that
rock<00:02:56.360> into<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.980> refugium<00:02:57.980> when<00:02:58.849> I<00:02:58.880> get<00:02:59.120> them

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
rock into the refugium when I get them

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.330 
rock into the refugium when I get them
as<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.360> pair<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.780> put<00:02:59.930> in<00:03:00.019> here<00:03:00.230> possibly<00:03:00.650> a

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
as a pair to put in here possibly a

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.600 
as a pair to put in here possibly a
black<00:03:02.000> clownfish<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.349> a<00:03:03.650> regular<00:03:04.280> clownfish

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
or a snowflake clownfish who knows they

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.500 
or a snowflake clownfish who knows they
came<00:03:10.700> out<00:03:10.730> of<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:11.200> 28<00:03:12.850> gallon<00:03:13.850> Nano<00:03:14.209> that<00:03:14.390> was

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
came out of a 28 gallon Nano that was

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.140 
came out of a 28 gallon Nano that was
over<00:03:14.840> here<00:03:15.230> with<00:03:15.829> corals<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.730> clownfish

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
over here with corals and the clownfish

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.229 
over here with corals and the clownfish
I<00:03:17.510> took<00:03:18.500> down<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.920> 28<00:03:19.310> nano<00:03:19.609> put<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:19.910> corals

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
I took down the 28 nano put the corals

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.009 
I took down the 28 nano put the corals
into<00:03:20.510> this<00:03:21.070> 12<00:03:22.070> gallon<00:03:22.400> nano<00:03:22.760> it's<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.840> lot

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
into this 12 gallon nano it's a lot

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.930 
into this 12 gallon nano it's a lot
cleaner<00:03:24.319> and<00:03:25.250> this<00:03:25.370> will<00:03:25.489> just<00:03:25.670> be<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:25.790> little

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
cleaner and this will just be a little

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.479 
cleaner and this will just be a little
frag<00:03:26.239> tank<00:03:26.569> not<00:03:27.560> that<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.799> need<00:03:27.980> one<00:03:28.220> because

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
frag tank not that I need one because

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.460 
frag tank not that I need one because
I've<00:03:28.609> got<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:28.790> full-sized<00:03:29.390> reef<00:03:30.079> ready<00:03:30.290> one

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
I've got a full-sized reef ready one

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.890 
I've got a full-sized reef ready one
right<00:03:30.650> there<00:03:31.359> this<00:03:32.359> just<00:03:32.600> looks<00:03:32.750> awesome

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
right there this just looks awesome

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.789 
right there this just looks awesome
though<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.470> like<00:03:33.890> it<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:37.989> that's<00:03:38.989> basically

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
though I like it and that's basically

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.879 
though I like it and that's basically
how<00:03:40.190> you<00:03:41.060> can<00:03:41.299> make<00:03:41.420> an<00:03:41.510> all-in-one<00:03:41.930> almost<00:03:42.739> an

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
how you can make an all-in-one almost an

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.059 
how you can make an all-in-one almost an
all-in-one<00:03:43.750> breeding<00:03:44.750> setup<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.560> here's

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
all-in-one breeding setup the here's

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.379 
all-in-one breeding setup the here's
something<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:46.459> would<00:03:46.639> have<00:03:46.760> done<00:03:46.940> different

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
something I would have done different

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:48.640 
something I would have done different
though<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:47.750> think<00:03:47.810> I<00:03:48.049> might<00:03:48.230> change<00:03:48.410> in<00:03:48.620> the

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
though and I think I might change in the

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.160 
though and I think I might change in the
future<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:49.790> get<00:03:49.970> keep<00:03:50.389> some<00:03:50.600> of<00:03:50.690> this<00:03:50.780> dirt

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
future to get keep some of this dirt

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.759 
future to get keep some of this dirt
from<00:03:51.590> settling<00:03:52.100> at<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.310> bottom<00:03:53.470> what<00:03:54.470> I<00:03:54.500> would

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
from settling at the bottom what I would

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.920 
from settling at the bottom what I would
do<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.280> what<00:03:55.489> I'm<00:03:55.609> probably<00:03:55.940> going<00:03:56.329> to<00:03:56.540> do<00:03:56.660> is

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
do and what I'm probably going to do is

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.199 
do and what I'm probably going to do is
I'm<00:03:57.079> going<00:03:57.109> to<00:03:57.560> make<00:03:58.069> this<00:03:58.280> modify<00:03:59.150> this

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
I'm going to make this modify this

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.190 
I'm going to make this modify this
refugium<00:04:00.489> just<00:04:01.489> take<00:04:01.639> some<00:04:01.790> PVC<00:04:02.090> from<00:04:02.450> Lowe's

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200

refugium just take some PVC from Lowe's
and<00:04:03.620> attach<00:04:04.160> it<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:04.519> make<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:04.730> go<00:04:04.940> all<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.420> way

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
and attach it and make it go all the way

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.449 
and attach it and make it go all the way
to<00:04:05.600> where<00:04:05.959> it's<00:04:06.109> like<00:04:06.260> an<00:04:06.500> inch<00:04:07.010> above<00:04:07.310> the

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
to where it's like an inch above the

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.629 
to where it's like an inch above the
water<00:04:07.670> I<00:04:07.970> mean<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.510> floor<00:04:09.049> so<00:04:09.950> that<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.489> keeps

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
water I mean the floor so that it keeps

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.910 
water I mean the floor so that it keeps
the<00:04:10.819> bottom

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
the bottom

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.070 
the bottom
keeps<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:13.940> water<00:04:14.090> movement<00:04:14.360> down<00:04:14.690> there<00:04:14.930> and

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
keeps the water movement down there and

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.560 
keeps the water movement down there and
keeps<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.500> fish<00:04:15.980> poop<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.609> D<00:04:17.209> treats

keeps the fish poop and D treats

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.599 
keeps the fish poop and D treats
floating<00:04:18.320> in<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.530> water<00:04:18.739> so<00:04:19.100> they<00:04:19.220> can<00:04:19.250> flow

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
floating in the water so they can flow

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.750 
floating in the water so they can flow
back<00:04:19.790> over<00:04:20.120> here<00:04:20.560> I'm<00:04:21.560> not<00:04:21.919> sure<00:04:22.220> how<00:04:22.460> I'll<00:04:22.610> get

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
back over here I'm not sure how I'll get

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.820 
back over here I'm not sure how I'll get
the<00:04:22.880> water<00:04:23.060> flow<00:04:23.450> at<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.900> bottom<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.710> be

I would actually get a longer PVC as
well<00:04:40.460> and<00:04:40.700> make<00:04:40.820> it<00:04:40.940> go<00:04:41.030> all<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.389> way<00:04:41.419> to<00:04:41.540> the

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
well and make it go all the way to the

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
bottom just an inch or so to keep the

to<00:04:54.950> keep<00:04:55.100> them<00:04:55.250> clean<00:04:55.460> but<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.450> middle<00:04:56.690> one

to keep them clean but the middle one
more<00:04:57.110> more<00:04:57.320> than<00:04:57.470> likely<00:04:57.650> need<00:04:57.979> a<00:04:58.010> power<00:04:58.250> head
