 Simeon who lived in the city must

 Bethulia besieged by the Assyrian general 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.860
 holofernes having heard that the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.329
 magistrates were going to deliver the city ​​to 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.820

 field of the Assyrians led to the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.979
 presence of holofernes manages to gain its 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.580
 sympathy and deceive him in such a way that 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:08.850
 invites you to a feast come to night 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.280
 Judith cuts his head back to 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.500
 betulia and hangs the head of holofernes 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.270
 of the wall 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.219
 from the city 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.820
 the Assyrians seeing the corpse 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:23.310
 bloody his general undertake the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.530
 leakage 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.810
 the historicity of these events has been 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.049
 attacked by many among those who 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.700
 they also placed some Catholics there 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.939
 three opinions on the character 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.439
 historical or non-historical of this book 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.439
 some take it strictly 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.130
 historical others attribute character 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.229
 didactic or even in ethical and others mix 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.299
 the two literary genres is to say 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.530
 consider the book as historical in 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.759
 general sense but not in the details 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.580
 it is therefore necessary to determine the character 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.759
 literary of this book subject that should 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.080
 be resolved in accordance with the 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.380
 luminous doctrine expressed in the 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.830
 encyclical of pio 12 divine atlante 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.960
 nacre spirit column 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.660
 for the defenders of historicity 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.730
 the time of the events is that sad 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.820
 period when the Manassan king was 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.910
 taken captive to Babylon what 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.510
 explains that playing was without a boss 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.489
 Nor does the Kingdom of Israel exist 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.459
 also about the time of the 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.790
 composition diverge opinions among 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.760
 the Catholic exegetes seems certain that 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.370
 was written the time post exit lico or 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.310
 be after the captivity of Babylon 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.650
 On the other hand, we must recognize the 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.610
 freshness of the story and the accuracy of 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.790
 geographic genealogical data 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.340
 historical chronological etcetera that its 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.710
 Ignored author a Jew from Palestine 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.290
 he knew well in depth 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.110
 the versions like in the book of tobias 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.410
 they are several and different in details 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.590
 there is no original that seems 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.530
 have been done that seems to have been 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.569
 Hebrew or Aramaic 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.940
 regarding the moral content and 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.890
 spiritual of this sublime book what 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.420
 will understand with great benefit who 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.160
 meditate carefully we have not intended 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.830
 certainly justify God as if he 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.510
 will need our defense the 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.910
 God's justification is in his 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.620
 own words as the prophet says 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.080
 David 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.110
 there is no original Hebrew and 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.690
 Aramaic we follow in this translation the 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.709
 text of the vulgate that comes from a 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:49.599
 Aramaic Chaldean text revising from time to time 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.599
 when towers to kill
