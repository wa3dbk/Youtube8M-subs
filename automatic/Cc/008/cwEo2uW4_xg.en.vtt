00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.409
 Holly Ritchie or is certainly not the case here 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.409
 we play a live today then go 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.489
 apparently on his people 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.730
 So I can live again 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.589
 yes it is already ok 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.179
 and here we play nothing at home 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.109
 so will be a thousand 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.570
 Used CD dollar 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.680
 and 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.520
 and we see earths 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.460
 Borken light off again 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.460
 gives more money 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.500
 with me is always the problem I can with the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.290
 whether ride to the world alive 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.880
 but luckily 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.070
 on what opponent 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.500
 and then again luck and now 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.350
 yes with the fun 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.350
 to cope well with competence 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.590
 Plus sometimes there you get back on the bus way is Bond 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.980
 Fenin promoted the movement 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.150
 Both should be even more laughing mushroom as the crops have bred wrinkles »she said 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
 are a lot to do 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.850
 800 off 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.890
 OK 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.890
 around 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.000
 because 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.030
 the devices should go to Poland 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.030
 but the last animals are in the sky table 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.700
 the latter heavy Berger 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.240
 Knutson sense 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.240
 It always happens when you can not find your opponent 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.590
 Dr then you just can not cat made 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.220
 and suddenly it will 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.300
 Well 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.110
 as an Aigner 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.830
 Rossa 8 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.830
 Algeria while we will 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.299
 Kitzingen 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.299
 now increase good luck 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:26.249
 «We want 16 of the evening now lets up 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:29.199
 and again Deuce Nadal why and Hey Ho 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:33.009
 how can you be now also with the city then who but I recognize myself 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.189
 never tested it yourself 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.049
 that I play full now 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.099
 start to score 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.259
 but with 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.629
 here with these words you can still quite simplify me 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.719
 Century from 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.799
 SOA from the spring there 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.729
 the project is not the venues 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.729
 because with the monkey I just can not choose 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.949
 under Hortig in Bautzen dpa lucky guy 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:04.809
 two play 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.079
 Although could 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.079
 Oliver for Nierstein Fach 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:13.519
 Order La Familia 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.269
 Something like that meant lucky guy Ehlers one in front of the gun 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.019
 "Of course 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.640
 the wave band as well as the ones suffering but because the area has seen me 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.319
 I can just use it differently 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.620
 yes but the suffering there is always such a thing bring says I have a shit 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.889
 in his collection and 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.889
 yes the last details a bit heavier 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:38.689
 yes, but I'm lucky 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.819
 Runs exactly at 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.779
 like EADS 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:46.209
 not only from the back 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.739
 He was consistently not fit 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.739
 but always decimated every time 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.669
 Red 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.609
 i hate those i hate all is all exhausted 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.209
 to missiles 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.599
 should it be annoying me this back 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.599
 it can help me with it 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.659
 but if they come too close to each other then it is very stupid 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.659
 ran 

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:18.179
 if they do not come 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.110
 he was good 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.499
 and then we take the place Mertes and now drives on 4 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:30.809
 the last super fast after 

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:33.349
 I have no idea model world 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.349
 Suddenly I'm sort of out here in the ground 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.090
 I do not know 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.090
 and now get dressed in how fast he laughs madness 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.629
 Beichler finances her again between Jerry at gamescom Lohmann 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:49.770
 slower down 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.789
 where from behind 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:53.980
 maybe nevertheless 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.150
 there ito 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.150
 the theme route deprives 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:03.929
 Bonn which is the most important to me that you are always so slow here but so 

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:05.719
 would suffer right 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:09.169
 we want it is 12 percent 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.169
 Meier Phil 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:17.359
 No, the mating title on top of that, the air would be no more 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.110
 we have to use it 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:26.469
 last was not because of this shit with Samba rearview mirror of the 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:28.819
 go all over 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:30.300
 Yes 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.559
 and now the Crossbow 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:36.289
 I hope they are still doing some really fast Kil Pröll with it 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.289
 not so easy anymore 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.120
 we want 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.419
 who shot often so now that should put me right in the nose way 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:48.469
 will give with light 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.469
 and help everyone 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.639
 Gaylord probably also give the game a relatively short 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.919
 at 20 12 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.290
 not that bad 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.110
 I did not even humiliate them and I really hope people want to 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.629
 until the next video also at ERF an Ex
