00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
as reps like as far as Billy mass reps

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.430 
as reps like as far as Billy mass reps
high<00:00:39.249> reps<00:00:39.550> or<00:00:39.760> what<00:00:39.909> yeah<00:00:40.420> muscle<00:00:40.780> it's

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
high reps or what yeah muscle it's

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.410 
high reps or what yeah muscle it's
interesting<00:00:41.800> about<00:00:42.129> me<00:00:42.339> because<00:00:42.639> the<00:00:42.760> answer

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
interesting about me because the answer

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.319 
interesting about me because the answer
really<00:00:43.629> is<00:00:43.960> that<00:00:44.199> you<00:00:44.319> need<00:00:44.469> both<00:00:44.649> okay<00:00:45.550> and<00:00:46.239> I

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
really is that you need both okay and I

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.450 
really is that you need both okay and I
think<00:00:46.389> we<00:00:46.780> need<00:00:46.899> to<00:00:47.050> define<00:00:47.199> what<00:00:47.829> low<00:00:48.159> reps

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
think we need to define what low reps

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.419 
think we need to define what low reps
are<00:00:48.729> because<00:00:49.149> that's<00:00:49.359> you<00:00:49.479> know<00:00:49.539> something

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
are because that's you know something

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.469 
are because that's you know something
definition<00:00:51.429> is<00:00:51.519> not<00:00:51.699> a<00:00:51.729> thing<00:00:52.030> for<00:00:52.210> a<00:00:52.299> right

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
definition is not a thing for a right

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.110 
definition is not a thing for a right
you<00:00:52.719> know<00:00:53.079> some<00:00:53.350> people<00:00:53.469> say<00:00:53.620> think<00:00:54.159> low<00:00:54.819> reps

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
you know some people say think low reps

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.079 
you know some people say think low reps
two<00:00:55.659> reps<00:00:55.899> yeah<00:00:56.459> and<00:00:57.459> that's<00:00:57.549> what<00:00:57.699> we<00:00:57.760> do

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
two reps yeah and that's what we do

higher<00:01:12.340> repetition<00:01:13.180> training<00:01:13.660> what<00:01:14.200> you're

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
higher repetition training what you're

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.150 
higher repetition training what you're
doing<00:01:14.770> you<00:01:14.920> know<00:01:15.040> 13<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.790> 15<00:01:16.240> reps<00:01:16.480> okay<00:01:17.160> you

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
doing you know 13 to 15 reps okay you

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.490 
doing you know 13 to 15 reps okay you
could<00:01:18.310> go<00:01:18.460> as<00:01:18.550> low<00:01:18.760> as<00:01:18.940> 10<00:01:19.210> reps<00:01:19.480> and<00:01:19.720> then<00:01:20.320> you

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
could go as low as 10 reps and then you

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.120 
could go as low as 10 reps and then you
have<00:01:20.710> weeks<00:01:21.070> of<00:01:21.310> higher<00:01:22.200> weight<00:01:23.200> but<00:01:23.830> lower

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
have weeks of higher weight but lower

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.250 
have weeks of higher weight but lower
reps<00:01:24.580> worse<00:01:25.000> so<00:01:25.330> you<00:01:25.360> do<00:01:25.630> you<00:01:25.780> know<00:01:25.900> between

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
reps worse so you do you know between

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.650 
reps worse so you do you know between
five<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:26.560> seven<00:01:27.100> four<00:01:27.310> okay<00:01:27.730> so<00:01:28.270> typically

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
five to seven four okay so typically

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.170 
five to seven four okay so typically
what<00:01:28.870> I<00:01:28.900> do<00:01:29.020> is<00:01:29.350> that<00:01:29.500> in<00:01:29.710> my<00:01:29.950> in<00:01:30.280> my<00:01:30.340> workouts<00:01:31.000> I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
what I do is that in my in my workouts I

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.850 
what I do is that in my in my workouts I
have<00:01:31.360> what<00:01:31.540> I<00:01:31.570> call<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.930> loading<00:01:32.350> phase<00:01:32.560> and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
have what I call the loading phase and

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.040 
have what I call the loading phase and
I'm<00:01:32.920> in<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.250> loading<00:01:33.670> phase<00:01:33.700> where<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.660> do<00:01:34.750> that<00:01:35.020> I

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
I'm in a loading phase where I do that I

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.040 
I'm in a loading phase where I do that I
do<00:01:35.140> high<00:01:35.590> volume<00:01:36.130> higher<00:01:36.910> reps<00:01:37.330> okay<00:01:37.750> okay<00:01:37.990> so

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
do high volume higher reps okay okay so

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.890 
do high volume higher reps okay okay so
10<00:01:38.410> to<00:01:38.560> 15<00:01:38.920> reps<00:01:39.160> the<00:01:39.340> same<00:01:40.060> way<00:01:40.210> you<00:01:40.810> know

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
10 to 15 reps the same way you know

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.130 
10 to 15 reps the same way you know
sometimes<00:01:41.620> you<00:01:41.770> know<00:01:41.890> sometimes<00:01:42.460> I<00:01:42.640> go<00:01:43.140> even

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140

up to like 20 or 30 you know the blood

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.500 
up to like 20 or 30 you know the blood
going<00:01:47.770> absolutely<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.640> think<00:01:48.730> it's<00:01:49.150> I<00:01:49.390> think

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
going absolutely I think it's I think

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.420 
going absolutely I think it's I think
it's<00:01:49.810> good<00:01:50.050> to<00:01:50.080> have<00:01:50.260> little<00:01:50.890> weeks<00:01:51.190> where

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
it's good to have little weeks where

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.970 
it's good to have little weeks where
you're<00:01:51.580> doing<00:01:51.909> you<00:01:52.060> know<00:01:52.590> super<00:01:53.590> high<00:01:53.740> reps

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
you're doing you know super high reps

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.220 
you're doing you know super high reps
like<00:01:54.159> that<00:01:54.400> between<00:01:54.580> 20<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.210> 30<00:01:55.540> reps<00:01:55.870> even

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
like that between 20 to 30 reps even

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.340 
like that between 20 to 30 reps even
simply<00:01:56.980> research<00:01:57.970> shows<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:58.690> is<00:01:58.990> good<00:01:59.170> for

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
simply research shows that is good for

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.170 
simply research shows that is good for
you<00:01:59.500> okay<00:01:59.680> some<00:02:00.400> research<00:02:00.760> has<00:02:00.940> indicated

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
you okay some research has indicated

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.230 
you okay some research has indicated
that<00:02:01.720> hypertrophy<00:02:02.710> even<00:02:03.040> happens<00:02:03.520> at<00:02:03.729> these

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
that hypertrophy even happens at these

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.360 
that hypertrophy even happens at these
higher<00:02:04.510> rep<00:02:04.810> ranges<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.860> key<00:02:06.040> thing<00:02:06.250> is<00:02:06.340> that

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
higher rep ranges the key thing is that

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.279 
higher rep ranges the key thing is that
you<00:02:06.550> keep<00:02:06.729> that<00:02:06.880> muscle<00:02:07.150> tension<00:02:07.750> going<00:02:07.960> you

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
you keep that muscle tension going you

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.399 
you keep that muscle tension going you
know<00:02:08.409> and<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:09.819> do<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.149> proper<00:02:10.360> form<00:02:10.810> but

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:11.409 
know and that you do the proper form but

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.500 
know and that you do the proper form but
you<00:02:11.890> would<00:02:12.069> definitely<00:02:12.220> gain<00:02:12.730> muscle<00:02:13.209> even

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
you would definitely gain muscle even

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.720 
you would definitely gain muscle even
one<00:02:13.629> of<00:02:13.659> those<00:02:13.870> higher<00:02:14.409> repetition<00:02:15.280> ranges

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
one of those higher repetition ranges

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.059 
one of those higher repetition ranges
okay<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.510> then

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
okay and then

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.619 
okay and then
time<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:17.640> should<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:17.819> working<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.450> know<00:02:18.599> in

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
time you should be working you know in

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.080 
time you should be working you know in
the<00:02:19.079> in<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.469> 10<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.680> 15<00:02:20.159> rep<00:02:20.370> range<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.969> then

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
the in the 10 to 15 rep range and then

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.739 
the in the 10 to 15 rep range and then
what<00:02:21.359> I<00:02:21.389> like<00:02:21.689> to<00:02:21.930> do<00:02:22.079> after<00:02:23.060> loading<00:02:24.060> face<00:02:24.510> as

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:24.749 
what I like to do after loading face as

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.599 
what I like to do after loading face as
I<00:02:24.840> call<00:02:25.079> it<00:02:25.109> where<00:02:25.409> I<00:02:25.439> do<00:02:25.530> high<00:02:25.889> volume<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.400> high

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
I call it where I do high volume I high

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.569 
I call it where I do high volume I high
reps<00:02:26.879> is<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.209> cut<00:02:27.840> back<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:29.129> volume

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
reps is that I cut back on the volume

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.449 
reps is that I cut back on the volume
and<00:02:29.879> I<00:02:30.420> increase<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.049> weight<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.069> do<00:02:32.129> like

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
and I increase the weight and I do like

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.539 
and I increase the weight and I do like
you<00:02:32.670> know<00:02:32.790> 5<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.389> 7<00:02:33.750> repetitions<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.250> just

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
you know 5 to 7 repetitions and I just

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.670 
you know 5 to 7 repetitions and I just
basically<00:02:35.760> do<00:02:36.299> you<00:02:36.480> know<00:02:36.629> just<00:02:36.930> mass<00:02:37.170> building

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
basically do you know just mass building

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.390 
basically do you know just mass building
exercises<00:02:38.280> keep<00:02:39.269> my<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.900> keep<00:02:40.409> my<00:02:40.650> sets<00:02:41.010> up<00:02:41.250> to

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
exercises keep my I keep my sets up to

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.220 
exercises keep my I keep my sets up to
like<00:02:41.549> maybe<00:02:41.790> ten<00:02:42.180> sets<00:02:42.569> tops<00:02:43.049> okay<00:02:43.859> and<00:02:45.230> the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
like maybe ten sets tops okay and the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.599 
like maybe ten sets tops okay and the
whole<00:02:46.379> muscle<00:02:46.560> group<00:02:46.769> where<00:02:46.919> you<00:02:47.219> split<00:02:47.430> it

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
whole muscle group where you split it

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.000 
whole muscle group where you split it
for<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.209> whole<00:02:48.389> month<00:02:48.419> yeah<00:02:49.109> so<00:02:49.409> basically<00:02:49.590> I

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
for the whole month yeah so basically I

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.729 
for the whole month yeah so basically I
could<00:02:50.489> do<00:02:50.639> like<00:02:51.060> two<00:02:51.329> exercises<00:02:51.900> or<00:02:52.200> five<00:02:52.439> sets

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
could do like two exercises or five sets

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.709 
could do like two exercises or five sets
or<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.040> could<00:02:53.250> do<00:02:53.370> one<00:02:53.579> exercise<00:02:53.939> of<00:02:54.239> four<00:02:54.480> and

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:54.719 
or I could do one exercise of four and

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:59.809 
or I could do one exercise of four and
then<00:02:55.230> two<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:56.180> three<00:02:57.180> chocolate<00:02:57.599> okay<00:02:58.169> so<00:02:58.980> for

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
then two of three chocolate okay so for

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.459 
then two of three chocolate okay so for
example<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:00.299> could<00:03:00.449> do<00:03:00.569> incline<00:03:00.930> bench<00:03:01.109> press

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
example I could do incline bench press

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.860 
example I could do incline bench press
and<00:03:01.799> then<00:03:01.980> flat<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.730> then<00:03:03.000> incline<00:03:03.569> flyes

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
and then flat and then incline flyes

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.890 
and then flat and then incline flyes
four<00:03:04.829> three<00:03:05.159> three<00:03:05.239> ten<00:03:06.239> sets<00:03:06.480> right<00:03:06.659> there

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
four three three ten sets right there

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.050 
four three three ten sets right there
yes<00:03:07.079> I<00:03:07.290> know<00:03:07.439> that's<00:03:07.829> just<00:03:08.010> funny<00:03:08.219> that's

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
yes I know that's just funny that's

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.030 
yes I know that's just funny that's
that's<00:03:09.540> more<00:03:09.780> than<00:03:09.989> enough<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.469> lot<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.739> people

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
that's more than enough a lot of people

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.679 
that's more than enough a lot of people
you<00:03:11.159> know<00:03:11.189> they<00:03:11.459> think<00:03:11.519> still<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.359> they<00:03:12.510> need

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
you know they think still that they need

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.599 
you know they think still that they need
to<00:03:12.810> do<00:03:12.930> twenty<00:03:13.349> or<00:03:13.469> thirty<00:03:13.709> cents<00:03:14.069> but<00:03:14.219> if<00:03:14.459> the

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
to do twenty or thirty cents but if the

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.449 
to do twenty or thirty cents but if the
quality<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.120> not<00:03:15.419> there<00:03:15.480> what's<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.989> purpose

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
quality is not there what's the purpose

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.949 
quality is not there what's the purpose
you<00:03:17.459> know<00:03:17.579> plus<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.969> can<00:03:18.120> recover<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.719> mean

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
you know plus you can recover I mean

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.240 
you know plus you can recover I mean
we've<00:03:19.530> had<00:03:20.930> legends<00:03:21.930> in<00:03:22.169> the<00:03:22.290> past<00:03:22.560> like

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
we've had legends in the past like

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.089 
we've had legends in the past like
Arnold's<00:03:23.729> for<00:03:23.909> example<00:03:24.389> super<00:03:25.319> high<00:03:25.530> volume

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
Arnold's for example super high volume

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.399 
Arnold's for example super high volume
which<00:03:26.699> is<00:03:26.729> fine<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.389> worked<00:03:27.629> good<00:03:27.930> for<00:03:28.229> him

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
which is fine that worked good for him

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.080 
which is fine that worked good for him
because<00:03:28.590> he<00:03:28.709> had<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:28.979> genetics<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.729> go<00:03:29.879> ahead

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
because he had the genetics to go ahead

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.119 
because he had the genetics to go ahead
and<00:03:30.239> handle<00:03:30.599> that<00:03:30.750> kind<00:03:30.900> of<00:03:31.019> volume<00:03:31.129> alright

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
and handle that kind of volume alright

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.339 
and handle that kind of volume alright
so<00:03:32.609> you<00:03:32.699> cannot<00:03:33.120> have<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.569> learn<00:03:33.870> how<00:03:34.199> your

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
so you cannot have to learn how your

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.189 
so you cannot have to learn how your
body<00:03:34.680> works<00:03:34.859> okay<00:03:35.519> some<00:03:36.389> of<00:03:36.540> us<00:03:36.689> can<00:03:36.959> handle

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
body works okay some of us can handle

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.800 
body works okay some of us can handle
much<00:03:37.859> higher<00:03:38.099> volume<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.790> certainly<00:03:39.329> can<00:03:39.629> my

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
much higher volume I certainly can my

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.390 
much higher volume I certainly can my
wife<00:03:40.019> can<00:03:40.290> have<00:03:40.470> volume<00:03:41.009> then<00:03:41.159> it's<00:03:41.280> out<00:03:41.370> of

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
wife can have volume then it's out of
