with the hand roll pastels I don't need
to<00:01:58.560> break<00:01:58.860> them<00:01:59.100> into<00:01:59.280> smaller<00:01:59.670> pieces

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
to break them into smaller pieces

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.440 
to break them into smaller pieces
occasionally<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.740> will<00:02:01.950> drop<00:02:02.369> one<00:02:02.729> or<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.240> will

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
occasionally I will drop one or it will

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.660 
occasionally I will drop one or it will
get<00:02:03.630> broken<00:02:03.899> from<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.500> pressure<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.219> that's

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
get broken from the pressure and that's

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.820 
get broken from the pressure and that's
fine<00:02:08.690> try<00:02:09.690> when<00:02:10.200> you're<00:02:10.379> working<00:02:10.800> with

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
fine try when you're working with

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
works very well and makes framing very

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.850 
works very well and makes framing very

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
simple so as I've discussed there are

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.569 
simple so as I've discussed there are

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
them in half if they're extruded so you

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.900 
them in half if they're extruded so you
can<00:04:21.120> have<00:04:21.299> shorter<00:04:21.750> pieces<00:04:22.669> it's<00:04:23.669> also

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
can have shorter pieces it's also

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.510 
can have shorter pieces it's also

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
pastel better and you don't use any fix

pastel better and you don't use any fix
there's<00:04:32.340> no<00:04:32.550> need<00:04:32.730> for<00:04:32.760> fix<00:04:33.240> in<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:33.570> end

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
there's no need for fix in the end

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.840 
there's no need for fix in the end
