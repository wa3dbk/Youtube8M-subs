00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.509
 recommend you subscribe to the channel 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.730
 dedicated to the anime review they're becoming 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.400
 each new video tells about one 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.410
 of the most unusual serious interesting 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.750
 or even bloody so on this channel 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.869
 you will not find reviews on any templates 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.990
 or banal anime only on the most 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.820
 best unique titles in general there 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.590
 really have something to see 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.590
 link in description 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.210
 hello there patriot and today I 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.449
 decided to sort out the history so 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.760
 loved by us japanese animation and 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.640
 so that we understand each other immediately 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.250
 denote some anime terms this 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.489
 animation created in japan 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.500
 but as specified in many sources 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.649
 not all series created in the country 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.990
 the rising sun are anime rather 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.780
 there is not even an important place drawing 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.420
 the place of inventing is important here 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.300
 development and creation of filling 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.429
 and anime can draw anywhere like that 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.860
 way a bunch of cartoon under wow disney 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.960
 painted in japan but that doesn't mean 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.420
 mickey mouse of that one should also 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.420
 know that the term anime was not visible 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.880
 immediately before that the Japanese spoke mango and i 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.369
 but with the advent of the influence of the West was 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.380
 coined the words anime which is 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.740
 abbreviated from the English word they 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.979
 Mishin second is manga everything is much 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.750
 easier this is comics drawn in japan 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:51.090
 herself solowheel famous artist 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.130
 Katsusika hokusai in 1814 although manga 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.579
 already existed long before 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.229
 events on this our animes dictionary 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.100
 ends and in fact the story 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.409
 manga 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.810
 Eigen begins very far away 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.360
 times namely with the appearance of writing 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.190
 in seventh century japanese restructuring 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.259
 very big influence on this very 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.660
 writing and indeed those of Japan 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.420
 since China has had the first time 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.940
 the language was much poorer than 46 syllables 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.460
 against Chinese 422 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.980
 well its influence 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.410
 this very Chinese language spawned 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.150
 a huge number of anonymous words 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.820
 sounding the same but in deed 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.010
 meaning completely different things this 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.290
 Incidentally influenced positively 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.960
 Japanese poetry for the authors could 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.120
 extremely easy to play with words 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.070
 and each poem was attributed 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.440
 individual comments so that you can 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.900
 distinguish the main meaning from the secondary 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.900
 Another problem was the fact that 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.180
 in chinese there were no cases and all 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.820
 words were not changeable but in 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.220
 Japanese everything was different to solve these 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.070
 problems were created two alphabets 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.780
 hiragana and katakana even their functions 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.720
 changed throughout history 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.640
 japan present hiragana 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.040
 used to write case 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.290
 endings of auxiliary words pronouns 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.300
 many words and names and ro glyphs for 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.340
 which were excluded from the Japanese in 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.740
 the seventh century reform well 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.230
 thin and simple to so she 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.690
 used to write foreign words 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.790
 and the name of such an intricate system is not 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.980
 let you know your language at 100 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.140
 percent even in circles of intellectuals and 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.210
 for this reason most of the text in 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.640
 rich supplied with illustrations 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.220
 also during the reforms of the 6th century in Japan 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.560
 widespread buddhism important 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.440
 the concept of which was principled 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.060
 inability to accurately describe the environment 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.640
 the world for this was the beginning 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.580
 symbolic art development 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.430
 which did not describe the world as it is 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.500
 pointed to the illusion already known to people 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.840
 but on the other hand it developed 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.880
 the art of taking a photo 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.040
 this world was thought to be that world 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.410
 inconstant what if drawing such 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.110
 the photo is very long, he will have time 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.540
 change therefore and this path was 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.390
 very succinctly but genuine flourishing 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.590
 mass culture began 3 commander 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.650
 nobunaga oda hideo counting tommy and and i 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.790
 days and goals they combined japan 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.830
 repaired the government of all princes and in 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.460
 1603 tokugawa began to manage 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:28.100
 Japan and the era began barely each 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.790
 year grew the city production centers and 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.250
 cultures 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.400
 the most important of these centers was 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.190
 this is a modern city in tokyo to merge 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.100
 present japan also in this era were 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.290
 formed the main samurai caste 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.240
 peasants and artisans and merchants and 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.790
 chi-men and who became 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.250
 criminals and their descendants of such not 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.979
 considered visible and completely focused 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.740
 It was not always possible to fuck 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.260
 it was to wait for disobedience and in order to distract 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.360
 these guys from government policy 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.910
 encouraged the development of mass cities 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.400
 culture building fun quarters 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.040
 and other similar amusements 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.229
 Naturally in strictly regulated 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.570
 limits but that's just strict 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.120
 political censorship is practically not 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.700
 spread to erotica and therefore 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.340
 the main topic of mass culture became 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.860
 works on love themes of various 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.440
 degree of candor it related to 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.080
 everything from poetry to 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.050
 series of paintings and the most popular 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.750
 the paintings have become engravings of the styles of the way and and 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.910
 they depicted the joy of living with 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.820
 a touch of pessimism and the fact that 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.910
 life is short exactly one of the greatest 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.160
 The authors of this genre was Katsushika Hokusai 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.380
 which as I said at the beginning of the video and 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.979
 coined the term manga to denote 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.830
 their drawings in the early 19th century became 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:53.960
 popular editions of the bush genre review 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.470
 translating meaning stories in pictures 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.900
 and i'm fur reading books 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.550
 many genre principles of this literature 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.180
 subsequently actively started 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.270
 used in 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.370
 mania and on this for today all 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.830
 impossible to tell the whole story about him 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.020
 with in one sitting yes and information i 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.180
 brought to you filmed support this 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.669
 project positive comments and 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:21.020

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:24.020
 a series in touch was a patriot good luck to all

 gentlemen
