right here I got a stack of kind of the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.749 
right here I got a stack of kind of the
main<00:01:30.420> blocks<00:01:31.040> as<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.430> see<00:01:32.610> they<00:01:32.729> look

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
main blocks as you can see they look

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.120 
main blocks as you can see they look
really<00:01:33.090> nice<00:01:33.439> they<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.680> kind<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.100> that

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
really nice they just kind of have that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.359 
really nice they just kind of have that
fine<00:01:36.000> touch<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.930> there's<00:01:37.530> obviously<00:01:38.189> that

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
fine touch and there's obviously that

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.450 
fine touch and there's obviously that
smooth<00:01:38.850> shading<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:40.130> its<00:01:41.130> reflection<00:01:42.090> sort<00:01:42.360> of

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
smooth shading as its reflection sort of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.980 
smooth shading as its reflection sort of
goes<00:01:44.460> onto<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.939> block<00:01:45.360> then<00:01:45.570> it's<00:01:45.720> underneath

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
goes onto the block then it's underneath

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.499 
goes onto the block then it's underneath
I<00:01:46.259> guess<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.619> would<00:01:46.740> say<00:01:47.000> also<00:01:48.000> you're<00:01:48.299> kind

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
two and it is blocky shading if you I've

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.110 
two and it is blocky shading if you I've
never<00:02:25.650> tried<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.010> mod<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.640> know<00:02:26.790> exactly

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.040 
never tried this mod you know exactly
what<00:02:27.300> I'm<00:02:27.390> talking<00:02:27.720> about<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.800> default

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
what I'm talking about just the default

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.120 
what I'm talking about just the default
shading<00:02:31.050> underneath<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.530> tree<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.070> looks

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
shading underneath a tree it looks

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.430 
shading underneath a tree it looks
blocky<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.450> doesn't<00:02:33.810> look<00:02:33.930> too<00:02:34.080> good

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
blocky and it doesn't look too good

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.190 
blocky and it doesn't look too good
so<00:02:34.890> right<00:02:35.250> now<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.820> mod<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.510> not<00:02:36.690> generating

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
so right now this mod is not generating

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.770 
so right now this mod is not generating
hardly<00:02:37.830> any<00:02:38.130> lag<00:02:38.430> for<00:02:38.640> me<00:02:38.670> running<00:02:39.540> on<00:02:39.690> my

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
hardly any lag for me running on my

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.890 
hardly any lag for me running on my
iPhone<00:02:40.080> 5<00:02:40.350> but<00:02:41.240> like<00:02:42.240> I<00:02:42.360> said<00:02:42.570> if<00:02:42.780> you're

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
iPhone 5 but like I said if you're

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.010 
iPhone 5 but like I said if you're
running<00:02:43.140> on<00:02:43.470> an<00:02:43.920> lower<00:02:44.400> end<00:02:45.120> device<00:02:45.540> like<00:02:45.870> an

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
running on an lower end device like an

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.140 
running on an lower end device like an
older<00:02:46.380> version<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:47.310> iOS<00:02:47.550> because<00:02:47.820> this<00:02:48.060> is

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
older version of iOS because this is

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.420 
older version of iOS because this is
what<00:02:48.270> I'm<00:02:48.360> on<00:02:48.510> I'm<00:02:48.750> sure<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:49.380> does<00:02:50.070> work<00:02:50.250> for

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
what I'm on I'm sure it does work for

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.850 
what I'm on I'm sure it does work for
Android<00:02:50.760> as<00:02:50.880> well<00:02:50.959> but<00:02:51.959> I'm<00:02:52.110> not<00:02:52.260> sure<00:02:52.590> those

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
Android as well but I'm not sure those

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.690 
Android as well but I'm not sure those
ways<00:02:53.160> because<00:02:53.730> I'm<00:02:54.000> an<00:02:54.150> iOS<00:02:54.450> user<00:02:54.800> also<00:02:55.800> we

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
ways because I'm an iOS user also we

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.110 
ways because I'm an iOS user also we
have<00:02:56.910> some<00:02:58.190> what<00:02:59.190> if<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.610> can't<00:02:59.910> even<00:02:59.970> think

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
have some what if I can't even think
