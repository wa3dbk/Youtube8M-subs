00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
so let's get into this team now and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.200 
so let's get into this team now and
basically<00:00:40.890> at<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.190> goalkeeping<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
basically at the goalkeeping we have the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.660 
basically at the goalkeeping we have the
best<00:00:42.390> goalkeeper<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.739> game<00:00:44.010> tied<00:00:44.399> along

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
best goalkeeper in this game tied along

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.840 
best goalkeeper in this game tied along
with<00:00:44.879> Moya<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.800> think<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.219> yeah<00:00:47.370> Casillas

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
with Moya and I think it's yeah Casillas

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.049 
with Moya and I think it's yeah Casillas
and<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.899> Buffon<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.680> 26,000<00:00:50.550> turns<00:00:50.820> 50

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
and we have Buffon for 26,000 turns 50

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.910 
and we have Buffon for 26,000 turns 50
coins<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:51.960> quite<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> bargain<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
coins and it's quite a bargain for the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.189 
coins and it's quite a bargain for the
sky<00:00:53.129> because<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.610> look<00:00:53.760> at<00:00:53.850> those<00:00:53.940> stats<00:00:54.300> he

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
sky because just look at those stats he

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.350 
sky because just look at those stats he
has<00:00:55.230> got<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> downgrade<00:00:56.039> from<00:00:56.160> last<00:00:56.430> year<00:00:56.699> from

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
has got a downgrade from last year from

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.470 
has got a downgrade from last year from
87<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:57.989> 86<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:59.100> sure<00:00:59.370> why<00:00:59.579> because<00:00:59.789> he<00:01:00.239> added

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
87 to 86 not sure why because he added

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.180 
87 to 86 not sure why because he added
him<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> season<00:01:01.109> which<00:01:01.379> was<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.800> think<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.100> was

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
him the season which was I think I was

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.130 
him the season which was I think I was
like<00:01:02.280> 92<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.300> doesn't<00:01:03.570> really<00:01:03.660> make<00:01:03.840> much

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
like 92 and it doesn't really make much

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.170 
like 92 and it doesn't really make much
sense<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.860> give<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> team<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> season<00:01:05.729> card<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
sense to give a team a season card and

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.929 
sense to give a team a season card and
then<00:01:06.330> downgrade<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> playoff<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:08.010> anyways<00:01:08.640> I

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
then downgrade the playoff but anyways I

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.520 
then downgrade the playoff but anyways I
do<00:01:09.060> think<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.540> guy<00:01:09.750> will<00:01:09.810> probably<00:01:10.140> rise<00:01:10.320> to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
do think this guy will probably rise to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.250 
do think this guy will probably rise to
about<00:01:10.619> 45,000<00:01:11.610> coins<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:12.720> nice<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.020> see
