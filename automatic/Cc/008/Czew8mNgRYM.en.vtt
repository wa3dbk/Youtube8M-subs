 and carbohydrates are the preferred source 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.919
 fuel human body 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.290
 muscles the brain and other tissues like 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.750
 the liver are based on a continuous contribution 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.630
 of carbohydrates to meet the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.510
 energy demands of the body in the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.449
 human nutrition carbohydrates are the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.359
 main source of energy input the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.060
 50 hyphen 60 percent of calories 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.939
 are the carbohydrates are the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.800
 classifies in monosaccharides also 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.399
 called simple sugars 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.620
 they are glucose dextrose is the most 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.710
 abundantly and physiologically more 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.870
 important thing about monosaccharides is the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.510
 main useful fuel for 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.450
 cells is found free in 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.370
 ripe fruits and also in blood the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.160
 digestion of all forms of 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.530
 carbohydrates produces glucose the same 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.840
 that the process of glucose emission by 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.390
 part of the accumulated in the muscle or in 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.670
 the liver glycogen lysis or formation 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.479
 of glucose by other substances 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.250
 as amino acids and fatty acids 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.040
 glycogenesis 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.920
 and fructose nebula is found in 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.460
 mature fruits and in honey has higher 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.110
 sweetening power than glucose 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.450
 galactose is free in the 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.140
 nature and binds with glucose to 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.170
 form a disaccharide disaccharide is the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.350
 union of two monosaccharides maltose 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.410
 also called malt sugar is 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.450
 formed by the union of two glucose is 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.050
 the product of starch hydrolysis 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.910
 and catalyzed by the enzyme amylase 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.979
 fonts cereals beer liquor malt 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:49.250
 lactose is formed by the union of 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.080
 galactose with glucose intolerance 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.020
 to lactose occurs when the 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.680
 lactase enzyme responsible for dividing the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.899
 galactose and glucose sources appears 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.180
 naturally in the milk in large 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.280
 amounts 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.030
 Sucrose is formed by the union of 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.560
 glucose and fructose is sugar 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.410
 usually used as a sweetener in 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.270
 feeding sources 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.870
 gets from cane sugar and from 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.350
 beet polysaccharides are substances 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.060
 much more complex than carbohydrates 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.850
 They consist of numerous 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.190
 monosaccharide units some of 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.410
 they are polymers of a single type of 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.140
 monosaccharides and receive the name of 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.030
 homo polysaccharides while others are 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.280
 polymers of more than one kind of 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.010
 monosaccharides and are called ether or 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.470
 polysaccharides constitute the largest 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.680
 percentage of daily intake of 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.410
 starch carbohydrates is a substance 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.010
 that fulfills the role of nutritional reserve 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.050
 in vegetables it is deposited in the cells 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.110
 starch is the main hydrate of 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.140
 carbon from human food is 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.420
 composed of amylase and amylopectin 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.580
 both the glucose polymers 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.830
 most common foods it contains 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.940
 large amounts of starch are the 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.970
 cereals legumes potatoes fiber 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.280
 there are only fiber plants 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.650
 increases the speed of digestion and 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.160
 absorption contributing to satiety and 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.410
 in something 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.250
 cases can reduce the total absorption 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:28.220
 of glycogen fat is the polysaccharide of 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.980
 reserves in animal cells the liver and 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.410
 the muscle are the richest tissues in 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.750
 any excess glycogen 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.170
 carbohydrates will accumulate in the form of 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.170
 grease
