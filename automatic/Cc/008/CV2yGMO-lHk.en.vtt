thirty inches deep table on wheels at

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.500 
thirty inches deep table on wheels at
the<00:00:32.099> comodo<00:00:32.369> Joe<00:00:32.579> sitting<00:00:32.910> right<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.239> there

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the comodo Joe sitting right in there

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.080 
the comodo Joe sitting right in there
the<00:00:34.260> legs<00:00:34.500> are<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:35.010> before<00:00:35.370> everything<00:00:35.969> is

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the legs are for before everything is

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.910 
the legs are for before everything is
treated<00:00:36.420> prime<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:38.250> top<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:40.620> counter

treated prime the top of the the counter

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.810 
treated prime the top of the the counter
top<00:00:41.129> part<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.670> actually<00:00:42.230> deck<00:00:43.230> boards<00:00:43.820> that

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
top part is actually deck boards that

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.420 
top part is actually deck boards that
are<00:00:45.059> 1<00:00:45.450> by<00:00:45.629> 6<00:00:45.960> by<00:00:46.170> 5<00:00:46.410> quarter<00:00:46.950> but<00:00:47.219> I

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
are 1 by 6 by 5 quarter but I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.290 
are 1 by 6 by 5 quarter but I
essentially<00:00:48.110> trimmed<00:00:49.110> off<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.320> edges<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:51.270> I

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
essentially trimmed off the edges so I

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.520 
essentially trimmed off the edges so I
make<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.750> give<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.140> butcher-block

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
make it give it that butcher-block

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.880 
make it give it that butcher-block
effect<00:00:53.250> where<00:00:53.789> there's<00:00:54.030> no<00:00:54.149> holes<00:00:54.750> or<00:00:55.170> seams

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
effect where there's no holes or seams

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.740 
effect where there's no holes or seams
in<00:00:56.219> E<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> where<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> boards<00:00:59.010> meet<00:00:59.219> so

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
in E and the where the boards meet so

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.549 
in E and the where the boards meet so
you're<00:01:00.750> trying<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.109> more<00:01:01.320> finished
