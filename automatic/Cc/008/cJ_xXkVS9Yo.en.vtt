00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.830
 we were the first we are not the last 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.010
 but the concept has changed need 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.600
 we are so super goal should our following 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.140
 still stay on dusty 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.330
 paths of distant planets or better 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.610
 asphalt dusty road here 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.610
 in Russia about it in a couple of seconds 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.289
 if you remember the plans after the flight 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.359
 gagarin were huge even buildings 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.359
 space town near Moscow steel 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.119
 build like a giant sickle and 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.379
 hammer to be seen from space 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.839
 symbols of a great power but this 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:36.949
 the project remained unrealized a 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.109
 current space programs of Russia 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:41.450
 not at all like half a century ago 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.760
 maybe it should be 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.330
 people from oil production drove scientists college 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.990
 work is now even greater 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.640
 any nanotechnology and 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.710
 other ambitious things connected session 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.900
 loyalty to the wife of science and technology 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.900
 we need not so we need a small 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.220
 for Russia with one vote for one faith 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.590
 compact for just a large population 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.170
 who is engaged in labor on earth 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.880
 and produces environmentally friendly 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.640
 food that supplies to 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.290
 all greece countries 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.299
 If we 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.180
 remove space between our country 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.910
 as stressed churov who killed his task 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.920
 we are sure that Zhuravko will go down 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.910
 food prices what 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.430
 generally retired 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.340
 there will double 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.370
 33 I'm not sure 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.070
 anyway like all our laws like all ours 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.550
 reform will not come that rich 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.750
 the quality is richer and the poor are poorer 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.020
 and in general any network among the unattainable 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.640
 like 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.750
 in one case with there is discipline and three 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.480
 telling how 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.930
 actress 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.600
 n genre in which we external disciplines 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.310
 nothing will turn out the greatest 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.830
 Vertinskaya 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.690
 this is the most disciplined 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.410
 people 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.390
 no wonder every time you shoot 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.290
 for sure the interview is something 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.320
 sorry handule that it was very modest 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.280
 through a certain person 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.360
 these two achievements were accomplished in 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.549
 a period of great hatred in the twentieth 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:07.930
 century was a confrontation of two 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.149
 systems and even in space were preparing for 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.650
 the battle 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.980
 here is a reminder of this guide for 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.050
 astronauts as you can see they were preparing for 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.569
 fight by any means 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.740
 even with bare hands if necessary but 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.290
 the cold war is over and what 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.310
 do now 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.700
 where are these national goals in space 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.860
 ethylene ground 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.880
 and where to look for the prime minister in the usa in europe or in 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.429
 China 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:33.099
 and joined folklore 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.829
 suppressed radical opposition but not 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.569
 less in the village bastan like tanks and now 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.769
 became the octopus of the future and in the sector managed 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.239
 erected the capital strange past 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.149
 exact maxim klyagin 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:48.059
 yes here we break through the fascist cross 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:51.179
 we will never catch up and overtake China 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:53.959
 because that discipline which 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.509
 exists in eastern countries 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.969
 in our country is unattainable 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:00.299
 we have 40 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.400
 we are the first to be every second 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.450
 by the way in german how 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.219
 we have a different country another mentality 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.109
 sorry but about when 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.079
 realization of dreams this year on the market 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.599
 it was quiet and shorten 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.890
 Now there is mined a place on the night of st. 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.640
 more childbirth is nothing to start saudi 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:23.329
 Arabia 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.410
 that is, the country is developing 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.909
 once again we want to stay in Crimea 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.579
 and where the rockets fly from but where are the people 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.129
 starving well it already needs it only 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.900
 thieves only corrupt them 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.849
 don't give a damn about the country 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.769
 anniversary of the flight of Gagarin held 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.839
 new research in the archives and here 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:45.999
 one mystery has been discovered which so far 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:47.189
 no one explained 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.760
 in the Norwegian newspaper the author lean then 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.689
 On the twelfth of April a little one appeared 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:52.599
 the note 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.799
 that the Soviet Union launched a man in 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.010
 space but the newspaper referred to 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.430
 a message from london as well as genoa 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.139
 April that the newspaper wrote about it 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.969
 british communist business 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:03.739
 cleaning 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.069
 so what is the launch took place earlier 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.229
 official dates and in Moscow they did not speak 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.079
 until you are convinced of success 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.650
 no answer yet 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.629
 aware of that era when all powers were 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.889
 thrown on to overtake the west in 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.969
 a variety of areas unable to bear 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:21.729
 the voltage of this race the Soviet Union burst 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.900
 and how to be now a lot of Russia again 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.349
 by all means fight for status 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.659
 superpowers or go in for small 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.169
 daily chores 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.259
 we do not really need the police 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.300
 ranging from imperial ambitions which 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.650
 the atheists of the Germans suffered and ending 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.659
 Bolshevik ambitions 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:39.999
 damned these most Bolsheviks 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:41.949
 a resident demanded millions 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.279
 and millions of human lives 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:46.279
 in order to satisfy 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:48.279
 the last outrage was the sides of the world 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:50.300
 a war that was very strong 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.710
 demand is almost gone 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.530
 we haven't invested millions of lives 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.990
 we can because I already 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.979
 dying process in full swing 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.770
 only our resources remain 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.249
 these damn natural resources 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:03.810
 undoubtedly Russia 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.300
 ssr scored as a column 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.560
 become apathetic who adored axes say 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.760
 with quarantine if in Russia 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.630
 the director put his friends in front of him 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.360
 a dozen years Gorbachev most important task in the budget 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.050
 was a freight court 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.910
 plot in the village of China Finnish tasks do 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.450
 strange wild living and suddenly 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.630
 infinitely prosperous j me 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.520
 it seems that 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.819
 the worst thing that lost our country 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.330
 with all these changes this is what 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.949
 that 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:34.439
 any scc 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:36.860
 in their homeland core and the desire to live here 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.580
 and I do not know a single person having 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.419
 What kind of success? 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.499
 money that you would like here 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:45.729
 stay 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.110
 and here are more messages that register 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.289
 our today's theme is an anniversary which 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:52.189
 will be celebrating the whole planet of the twelfth 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.960
 april cosmonautics day 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.219
 Moscow planetarium never 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:56.020
 will open 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.020
 the planetarium is being repaired almost 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.870
 17 years old, the authorities promised to open it. 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.789
 Gagarin loved him 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.629
 but here again the transfer is announced 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:06.289
 deadlines for the summer 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:08.039
 and this is another reminder of the change 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:09.710
 priorities about whether 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.869
 these cosmic achievements in the past 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:14.119
 Russia is now completely different 

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:16.279
 however, and in the other former republics 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:18.659
 USSR planetariums are closed or 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:20.859
 reoriented from the history of development 

00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:23.159
 space and the fact that now is more 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:25.699
 interests the public for example in Ukraine 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:27.179
 Kharkov planetarium opened 

00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:29.550
 new cycle of laziness would be on the planet she 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.300
 in this planetarium teaches visitors how 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.669
 prevent alien abductions 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:35.610
 creatures 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.689
 and what to do when the contact took place 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.900
 it turns out the most dangerous is the smallest 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.900
 gray humanoids 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:45.969
 Yakutsk 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:47.860
 he 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.879
 the fact that man 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:53.879
 itar tass 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.899
 torshin 

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:59.659
 up to hundreds of people 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:01.689
 reportedly 

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:03.569
 according to the stories of Ukrainians and residents 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:05.580
 other countries do not know how they gathered 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.550
 11 types of images 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.229
 alone at home but also dr 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.419
 yet it is not counting very ugly 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:13.810
 climate of the planet pounds or chervenka
