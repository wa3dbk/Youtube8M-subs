00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
is to mean it's a transparent compressor

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.590 
is to mean it's a transparent compressor

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.510 

just<00:02:02.870> a<00:02:02.960> very<00:02:03.200> quiet<00:02:03.560> compressor

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
just a very quiet compressor

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.160 
just a very quiet compressor
next<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.690> EBS<00:02:06.320> Dyna<00:02:06.980> verb<00:02:08.020> reason<00:02:09.020> like

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
next is the EBS Dyna verb reason like

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.320 
next is the EBS Dyna verb reason like
that<00:02:09.380> reverb<00:02:09.770> how<00:02:10.039> so<00:02:10.310> much<00:02:10.520> is<00:02:10.700> because<00:02:10.880> it's

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
that reverb how so much is because it's

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:25.900 
that reverb how so much is because it's
a<00:02:11.450> shimmering<00:02:12.230> clean<00:02:13.510> just<00:02:14.510> true<00:02:14.810> reverb

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.570 

it's<00:02:26.910> not<00:02:27.090> like<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.710> chambered<00:02:28.710> reverb<00:02:29.040> from<00:02:29.280> am

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
it's not like a chambered reverb from am

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.400 
it's not like a chambered reverb from am
but<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:29.910> can't<00:02:30.150> acquire<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.540> chamber<00:02:31.080> reverb

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
but you can't acquire a chamber reverb

00:02:31.410 --> 00:03:01.100 
but you can't acquire a chamber reverb
sound<00:02:31.800> as<00:02:31.920> well<00:02:58.550> before<00:02:59.550> the<00:03:00.090> reason<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.660> use<00:03:00.900> it

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
sound as well before the reason I use it

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.670 
sound as well before the reason I use it
is<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:02.040> have<00:03:02.190> an<00:03:02.280> exaggerated<00:03:03.290> very<00:03:04.290> clean
