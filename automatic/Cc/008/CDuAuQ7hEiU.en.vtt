00:00:58.359 --> 00:00:58.369 
that's the g500 if I lifted up that high

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:02.109 
that's the g500 if I lifted up that high
it<00:00:59.470> I'll<00:01:00.470> set<00:01:00.680> up<00:01:00.739> that<00:01:00.949> high<00:01:01.159> it's<00:01:01.519> done<00:01:01.820> it's

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:02.119 
it I'll set up that high it's done it's

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:08.109 
it I'll set up that high it's done it's
not<00:01:02.299> tracking<00:01:02.780> I<00:01:06.520> get<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.549> couple<00:01:07.670> things<00:01:08.000> but

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
not tracking I get a couple things but

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.330 
not tracking I get a couple things but
yeah<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:08.979> right<00:01:10.030> lift<00:01:11.030> up<00:01:11.270> lift<00:01:12.020> up<00:01:12.350> lift<00:01:12.409> up

doesn't<00:01:19.670> move<00:01:21.009> g9x<00:01:22.009> again

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.440 

lift<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:27.500> if<00:01:28.500> I'm<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.670> straight<00:01:29.970> left

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
lift up if I'm just going straight left

lift up if I'm just going straight left
and<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.720> dropped<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.320> see<00:01:31.470> how<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.590> drops

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.950 

I'm<00:01:35.880> picking<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.300> pretty<00:01:36.570> high<00:01:36.630> too<00:01:41.840> it's<00:01:42.840> like

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
I'm picking up pretty high too it's like

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.910 
I'm picking up pretty high too it's like
I'm<00:01:43.020> going<00:01:43.170> over<00:01:43.260> there<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.500> want<00:01:43.650> to<00:01:43.710> come<00:01:43.800> back

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
I'm going over there I want to come back

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.080 
I'm going over there I want to come back
over<00:01:44.070> there<00:01:44.190> /<00:01:44.400> hold<00:01:46.640> if<00:01:47.640> there's<00:01:47.850> any<00:01:47.970> way<00:01:48.060> to

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
over there / hold if there's any way to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.060 
over there / hold if there's any way to
fix<00:01:48.300> that<00:01:48.540> or<00:01:48.720> if<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.350> defective<00:01:49.830> like<00:01:49.950> to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
fix that or if this is defective like to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.200 
fix that or if this is defective like to
know<00:01:50.220> as<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.119> actually<00:01:51.300> prefer<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.990> g9x<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
know as I actually prefer the g9x to the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.660 
know as I actually prefer the g9x to the
g500<00:01:54.210> right<00:01:54.720> now<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.920> I'd<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.280> keep<00:01:56.369> this

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
g500 right now and I'd like to keep this

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.700 
g500 right now and I'd like to keep this
one<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.390> if<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.600> does<00:01:57.720> that<00:01:57.900> I<00:01:57.930> think<00:01:58.590> that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
one but if it does that I think that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.009 
one but if it does that I think that
might<00:01:58.800> be<00:01:58.830> a<00:01:58.950> deal-breaker
