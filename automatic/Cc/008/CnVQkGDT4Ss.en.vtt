00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:55.509 
know I think that Vice President Cheney
has<00:00:47.089> been<00:00:47.769> at<00:00:48.769> the<00:00:49.249> head<00:00:50.210> of<00:00:50.449> a<00:00:53.229> movement<00:00:54.519> whose

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:56.959 
notion is somehow that we can't

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:58.840 
notion is somehow that we can't
reconcile<00:00:57.499> our<00:00:57.799> core<00:00:58.069> values<00:00:58.489> our

him<00:01:09.290> out<00:01:09.640> I<00:01:10.640> think<00:01:11.240> he<00:01:11.390> is<00:01:11.480> that<00:01:12.260> attitude<00:01:12.920> that

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
him out I think he is that attitude that

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.600 
him out I think he is that attitude that
