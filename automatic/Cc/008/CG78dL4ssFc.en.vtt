 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.049
 dvd criticism now once again with a 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.370
 series recommendation or is it about now 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.260
 a mini-series that means one 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.080
 completed format a6 follow 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.480
 About 60 minutes will be emmys and golden 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.330
 globe nominations also look a little off 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.020
 the mass stung out is top of 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.020
 black 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:35.260
 who you are on the edge of the universe 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.600
 what is so terrible that one 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.320
 lost little one and the secret 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.320
 that grows here 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.710
 this is not a big city here and we 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:53.670
 Knowing all secret does not stay long 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.680
 secret or one of us in it knows 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.269
 then I also think that we are in ours 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.040
 sometimes dealing with fate 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.799
 have us too much under the skin 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.390
 you wanted to tell me something bad 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.790
 We never give up, we can not 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.070
 Change everything fine from what they do 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:14.070
 have believed that they are you 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.920
 do not just stand at the edge of the universe 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.500
 what is so terrible there is a lost one 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.500
 little girl and the secret of the 6th 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.840
 top on the ladies from 16 years 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.460
 has been released in november 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.500
 germany available link for you like 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.330
 always for blu ray and dvd in the infobox 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.640
 and comes with six follow from about 60 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.460
 minutes therefore total 360 minutes therefore 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.500
 and is a so-called mini series 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.060
 thus often uses possibilities of 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.860
 a movie and a series that is 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.000
 many character developments too 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.710
 tell several storylines 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.870
 to pick up because you take a lot 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.250
 Higher runtime has it but somewhere 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.290
 a connection point set the scale 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.090
 for season comes along and in detail 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.770
 it is put in the pot in which I think 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.360
 So the series I find where that 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.400
 cover becomes so mystical with this 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.780
 girl the Sun on the lake it says is 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.400
 it's about a girl named stewie 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.229
 twelve years old at the beginning of the 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.670
 season the beginning of this misere 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.290
 tries to kill himself then 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.550
 man is taken up 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.709
 turn out that they are in the fifth month 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.780
 pregnant and the question is who 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.070
 behind it who has raped her 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.690
 and child abuse, however, is one 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.850
 higher-level topic here 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.650
 and that's just what an agent is calling 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.180
 Home leave in New Zealand is because 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.770
 Laptop means the first start 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.959
 plays and new zealand really has her 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.940
 a great atmosphere of beautiful nature 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.560
 but also absolute loneliness in the 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.239
 negative senses because the whole also with 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.220
 reflected in a desolation 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.050
 and these agents tried 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.670
 Find out what's up with this tui 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.110
 and above all you have on the 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.510
 to get on track because she will be in this 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.010
 Miniserie also the one time after the other 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.500
 disappear very many dive 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.450
 characters on and the theme incest 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.950
 just like the topic of drugs acts like 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.720
 the topic of finding oneself like that 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.910
 violence like the violent act between man 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.170
 and woman oppressions of various 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.670
 gender and all that together 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.799
 packed and so a microcosm of 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.510
 society in this drab world and 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.790
 this little town called laptop 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.680
 joins corruption and quite 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.900
 also murder and the whole thing so exciting 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.160
 and many small aspects are packed into it 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.720
 and action strands that you always 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.310
 again, okay, think what's going on here and 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.530
 That makes raging on the way to one 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.269
 miniserie the atmosphere is very high 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.980
 The acting is really crazy 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.110
 blatant is because miss moss he has himself 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.400
 last got the golden globe and 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.840
 you have to say after all honesty the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.269
 completely correct and especially one 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.730
 mini series which is unpredictable and 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.739
 who have a bit mystical thriller 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.500
 Crime moderately marca should have the film 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.350
 now this series even this miniserie 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.240
 has hardly any sun 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.500
 not so high a factor that you can 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.330
 really shook blade okay 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.490
 happening now but still is such a 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.050
 to feel mystical behind every corner 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.880
 we stab in there in this direction 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.740
 wants to like that and, above all, likes it that way 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.390
 from celebrating small discoveries and 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.800
 say the ones of the series then belongs 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.320
 This is not really in Germany 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.000
 the courses are known times on arte der 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.290
 or she can really do it here 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.850
 to grab the glasses and I think 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.340
 only a good 20 euros costs that will work 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.990
 ever for 360 minutes run length and 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.580
 should be quasi here of me was a small one 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.840
 I myself am special 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.310
 through the golden globes is on the 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.500
 hear series they got me 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.790
 immediately brought and do not regret it and 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.900
 so I'm almost through now as well 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.700
 a little description and 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.530
