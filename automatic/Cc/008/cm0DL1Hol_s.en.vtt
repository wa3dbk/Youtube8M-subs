while at it we're going to go ahead and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.670 
while at it we're going to go ahead and
change<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.470> launch<00:00:19.710> parameters<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:21.560> pants<00:00:22.560> I

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
change the launch parameters of pants I

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.060 
change the launch parameters of pants I
do<00:00:23.300> so<00:00:24.300> what<00:00:24.900> we're<00:00:25.050> going<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.380> do<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:25.830> launch

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
do so what we're going to do so launch

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.490 
do so what we're going to do so launch
parameters<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.730> enter<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:28.080> since

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
parameters and enter this in but since

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.410 
parameters and enter this in but since
mines<00:00:28.740> already<00:00:28.980> entered<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.519> that's<00:00:30.210> how<00:00:30.390> you

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
mines already entered in that's how you

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.569 
mines already entered in that's how you
edit<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.410> while<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.130> updating

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
edit it in so while this is updating

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.950 
edit it in so while this is updating
we'll<00:00:32.700> go<00:00:32.850> ahead<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.030> I'll<00:00:33.329> go<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.660> teach<00:00:33.840> you

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.840 

okay<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.980> order<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.250> get<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.550> information

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
okay so in order to get this information

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.209 
okay so in order to get this information
i'm<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> cpu<00:00:48.930> cores<00:00:49.289> mountain<00:00:49.800> maximum

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
i'm on the cpu cores mountain maximum

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.430 
i'm on the cpu cores mountain maximum
range<00:00:50.489> open<00:00:50.969> mouth<00:00:51.210> threads<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.170> we're<00:00:52.350> going

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
range open mouth threads so we're going

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.990 
range open mouth threads so we're going
to<00:00:52.559> need<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.739> program<00:00:53.129> called<00:00:53.460> speci

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
to need a program called speci

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.700 
to need a program called speci
especially<00:00:54.570> will<00:00:54.719> tell<00:00:54.870> us<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> exact

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
especially will tell us the exact

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.520 
especially will tell us the exact
precise<00:00:56.460> amount<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.030> maximum<00:00:57.510> memory<00:00:57.660> through

precise amount of maximum memory through

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.590 
precise amount of maximum memory through
megabytes<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.090> need<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.420> by

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
megabytes and we need to know by

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.380 
megabytes and we need to know by
megabytes<00:01:01.109> because<00:01:01.850> this<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.030> measured<00:01:03.359> by

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
megabytes because this is measured by

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.090 
megabytes because this is measured by
megabytes<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.170> if<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.379> want<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.979> can

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
megabytes and if you want to you can

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.320 
megabytes and if you want to you can
also<00:01:05.309> put<00:01:05.700> put<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.229> /<00:01:07.229> hi<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.520> what<00:01:09.150> will<00:01:09.299> that

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
also put put in / hi and what will that

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.460 
also put put in / hi and what will that
will<00:01:09.570> do<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.830> will<00:01:11.159> turn<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.549> into<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
will do is that it will turn it into a

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.350 
will do is that it will turn it into a
high<00:01:13.470> priority<00:01:13.770> process<00:01:14.640> once<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.150> program

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
high priority process once the program

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.899 
high priority process once the program
is<00:01:15.600> started<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.950> pretty<00:01:17.460> cool<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.880> know

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
is started just pretty cool you know

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.969 
is started just pretty cool you know
just<00:01:18.360> put<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.659> high<00:01:18.780> put<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> slash<00:01:19.560> i<00:01:19.799> will

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
just put it a high put a slash i will

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.010 
just put it a high put a slash i will
put<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.280> hyper<00:01:20.460> process<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.659> want<00:01:21.869> to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
put in a hyper process if you want to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.660 
put in a hyper process if you want to
you<00:01:22.229> don't<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:23.009> don't<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.280> but

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
you don't want to you don't have to but

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.270 
you don't want to you don't have to but
you<00:01:23.729> can't<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.689> /<00:01:24.960> high<00:01:25.200> does<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.799> /<00:01:25.979> into

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
you can't but / high does do that / into

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.890 
you can't but / high does do that / into
a<00:01:26.310> high<00:01:26.520> priority<00:01:26.729> process<00:01:27.390> once<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.750> game

a high priority process once the game

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.240 
a high priority process once the game
starts<00:01:28.340> automatically<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:30.299> um<00:01:30.659> while<00:01:31.290> spaces

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
starts automatically so um while spaces

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.350 
starts automatically so um while spaces
right<00:01:32.430> now<00:01:32.610> being<00:01:32.759> loaded<00:01:35.240> technically<00:01:36.240> i

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
right now being loaded technically i

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.870 
right now being loaded technically i
usually<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.170> loaded<00:01:37.350> before<00:01:37.680> before<00:01:38.670> i

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
usually have it loaded before before i

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.039 
usually have it loaded before before i
start<00:01:39.240> i'm<00:01:39.450> recording<00:01:40.640> but<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:42.360> case<00:01:42.689> um

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
start i'm recording but this case um

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.789 
start i'm recording but this case um
right<00:01:43.649> now<00:01:44.040> we<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.310> let<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.670> analyzed<00:01:45.799> but

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
right now we just let it analyzed but

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.920 
right now we just let it analyzed but
will<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.189> first<00:01:47.399> going<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.030> cpu<00:01:48.479> section

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
will be first going to the cpu section

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.359 
will be first going to the cpu section
so<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.530> get<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> amount<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.070> course

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
so we can get the amount of course

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.730 
so we can get the amount of course
obviously<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.320> need<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.560> show

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
obviously I have to but I need to show

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.899 
obviously I have to but I need to show
you<00:01:52.770> how<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.340> get<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.850> number<00:01:54.240> first

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
you how you can get the number first

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.270 
you how you can get the number first
okay<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:56.969> as<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:57.930> see<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:59.009> right<00:01:59.130> now

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
okay so as you can see it's right now

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.249 
okay so as you can see it's right now

let it finish first installing update

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.359 
let it finish first installing update
because<00:02:03.479> um<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.020> won't<00:02:04.409> work<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:04.860> we<00:02:05.280> don't

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
because um it won't work if we don't

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.550 
because um it won't work if we don't
have<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.759> its<00:02:06.210> latest<00:02:06.570> version<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.409> know

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
have that its latest version you know

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:17.050 
have that its latest version you know
what<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.710> mean

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.010 

ok<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:17.900> it's<00:02:18.319> at<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:19.360> operating<00:02:20.360> system<00:02:20.870> right

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
ok so it's at the operating system right

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:47.680 
ok so it's at the operating system right
now<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.500> have<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.709> windows<00:02:21.980> 8.1

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.800 

okay<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:48.750> got<00:02:49.170> all<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.410> information<00:02:49.670> Ram

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
okay so got all the information Ram

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.920 
okay so got all the information Ram
obviously<00:02:51.810> ram<00:02:52.020> right<00:02:52.230> here<00:02:52.500> for<00:02:53.690> 4096<00:02:54.690> um

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
obviously ram right here for 4096 um

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.580 
obviously ram right here for 4096 um
that<00:02:55.560> means<00:02:55.709> for<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.870> 4096<00:02:57.870> megabytes<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.380> RAM

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
that means for the 4096 megabytes of RAM

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.740 
that means for the 4096 megabytes of RAM
which<00:02:58.800> is<00:02:58.980> also<00:02:59.569> is<00:03:00.620> um<00:03:02.180> four<00:03:03.180> gigabytes<00:03:03.630> of

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
which is also is um four gigabytes of

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.850 
which is also is um four gigabytes of
RAM<00:03:03.990> so<00:03:04.350> we<00:03:04.560> copy<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:05.070> they<00:03:05.610> place<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:05.970> here

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
RAM so we copy that they place it here

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.770 
RAM so we copy that they place it here
the<00:03:07.860> modest<00:03:08.160> let<00:03:08.760> me<00:03:08.820> go<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.000> get<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.450> threads

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
the modest let me go to get the threads

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.660 
the modest let me go to get the threads
and<00:03:10.110> then<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.500> CPU<00:03:10.890> count<00:03:11.160> if<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.400> don't<00:03:11.550> have

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
and then the CPU count if you don't have

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.280 
and then the CPU count if you don't have
threads<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.420> if<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.630> this<00:03:12.780> doesn't<00:03:12.930> show<00:03:13.260> up

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
threads and if it this doesn't show up

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.410 
threads and if it this doesn't show up
right<00:03:13.530> here<00:03:13.770> you<00:03:14.430> can<00:03:14.610> go<00:03:14.730> ahead<00:03:14.820> and<00:03:14.970> get<00:03:15.300> rid

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
right here you can go ahead and get rid

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.229 
right here you can go ahead and get rid
of<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.690> option<00:03:15.959> right<00:03:16.230> here<00:03:16.910> but<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:17.940> have

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
of this option right here but I have

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.090 
of this option right here but I have
four<00:03:18.480> threads<00:03:18.810> so<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.050> put<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.319> there<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.770> I<00:03:19.860> put

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
four threads so I put it there and I put

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.850 
four threads so I put it there and I put
cpu<00:03:20.580> f2<00:03:21.270> so<00:03:21.750> as<00:03:22.110> you<00:03:22.260> can<00:03:22.320> see<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.560> sounds<00:03:22.770> like

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
cpu f2 so as you can see it sounds like

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.350 
cpu f2 so as you can see it sounds like
they're<00:03:23.040> kors<00:03:23.630> kors<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.959> CPU<00:03:25.440> count<00:03:25.709> so<00:03:26.360> after

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
they're kors kors the CPU count so after

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.740 
they're kors kors the CPU count so after
that<00:03:27.630> leadership<00:03:28.200> pretty<00:03:28.590> close<00:03:28.830> out<00:03:29.070> of<00:03:29.100> this

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
that leadership pretty close out of this

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.949 
that leadership pretty close out of this
you<00:03:30.750> copy<00:03:31.019> this<00:03:32.120> let<00:03:33.120> me<00:03:33.209> paste<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.600> into<00:03:33.780> the

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
you copy this let me paste it into the

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.090 
you copy this let me paste it into the
launch<00:03:34.140> parameters<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.769> what<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.010> did

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
launch parameters like what I did

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.210 
launch parameters like what I did
earlier<00:03:35.450> properties<00:03:36.709> set<00:03:37.709> launch<00:03:37.950> options

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
earlier properties set launch options

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.860 
earlier properties set launch options
and<00:03:38.700> it's<00:03:38.790> right<00:03:38.940> there<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.300> paste<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.840> right

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
and it's right there and paste it right

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.620 
and it's right there and paste it right
into<00:03:40.110> there<00:03:40.550> after<00:03:41.550> that<00:03:41.700> you'd<00:03:42.000> be<00:03:42.180> simply

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
into there after that you'd be simply

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.710 
into there after that you'd be simply
don<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.050> game<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:44.269> once<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.360> launch<00:03:45.540> up

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
don to the game and once you launch up

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.780 
don to the game and once you launch up
the<00:03:45.840> game<00:03:46.050> you<00:03:46.470> must<00:03:46.650> have<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:46.980> updates<00:03:47.370> latest

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
the game you must have it updates latest

installing<00:05:18.370> sorry<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.580> video<00:05:19.729> is<00:05:19.939> taking

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
installing sorry the video is taking

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.249 
installing sorry the video is taking
longer<00:05:20.360> than<00:05:20.750> usual<00:05:20.900> but<00:05:22.689> it<00:05:23.689> likes<00:05:23.900> to<00:05:24.020> take

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
longer than usual but it likes to take

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:31.890 
longer than usual but it likes to take
its<00:05:24.469> time

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.640 

yeah<00:05:32.500> as<00:05:32.710> you<00:05:32.800> can<00:05:32.860> see<00:05:33.070> that<00:05:33.340> part<00:05:34.500> so<00:05:35.500> right

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650

yeah as you can see that part so right
now<00:05:35.680> it's<00:05:36.070> on<00:05:36.340> extracting<00:05:37.180> the<00:05:38.280> 64-bit

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
now it's on extracting the 64-bit

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.200 
now it's on extracting the 64-bit
version<00:05:39.639> of<00:05:40.110> planetside<00:05:41.110> 2<00:05:41.940> what<00:05:42.940> we're<00:05:43.090> going

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
version of planetside 2 what we're going

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.550 
version of planetside 2 what we're going
to<00:05:43.330> do<00:05:43.419> is<00:05:43.720> that<00:05:44.169> we're<00:05:44.620> going<00:05:44.800> to<00:05:44.949> be<00:05:46.560> changing

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
to do is that we're going to be changing

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.499 
to do is that we're going to be changing
switching<00:05:48.520> these<00:05:48.699> two<00:05:48.910> out<00:05:49.060> so<00:05:49.300> we're<00:05:49.419> going

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 
switching these two out so we're going

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:55.370 
switching these two out so we're going
to<00:05:49.600> copy<00:05:50.050> control<00:05:50.800> copy<00:05:51.570> paste<00:05:53.250> we're<00:05:54.250> gonna

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
to copy control copy paste we're gonna

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.480 
to copy control copy paste we're gonna
really<00:05:56.380> we're<00:05:56.620> gonna<00:05:56.710> have<00:05:56.889> a<00:05:56.949> backup<00:05:57.250> of

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
really we're gonna have a backup of

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.150 
really we're gonna have a backup of
these<00:05:57.699> files<00:05:57.940> so<00:05:58.419> we're<00:05:59.259> going<00:05:59.440> to<00:05:59.860> go<00:05:59.889> ahead

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
these files so we're going to go ahead

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.890 
these files so we're going to go ahead
and<00:06:01.169> take<00:06:02.169> you<00:06:02.530> control<00:06:03.310> C<00:06:03.610> so<00:06:04.270> we<00:06:04.510> copy<00:06:04.780> the

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
and take you control C so we copy the

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.230 
and take you control C so we copy the
name<00:06:05.220> delete<00:06:06.220> it<00:06:07.050> we<00:06:08.050> know<00:06:08.199> whoops<00:06:08.979> haha<00:06:09.280> silly

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
name delete it we know whoops haha silly

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.140 
name delete it we know whoops haha silly
me<00:06:10.419> control-z<00:06:11.340> we<00:06:12.340> get<00:06:12.550> rid<00:06:12.669> of<00:06:12.760> this<00:06:12.910> one

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
me control-z we get rid of this one

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.719 
me control-z we get rid of this one
maybe<00:06:14.020> copy<00:06:14.350> the<00:06:14.560> name<00:06:14.710> of<00:06:14.889> the<00:06:15.010> 64-bit

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
maybe copy the name of the 64-bit

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.640 
maybe copy the name of the 64-bit
version<00:06:16.120> and<00:06:16.530> then<00:06:18.479> you<00:06:19.479> delete<00:06:19.810> it<00:06:19.930> and<00:06:20.110> then

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
version and then you delete it and then

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.560 
version and then you delete it and then
reap<00:06:20.860> aced<00:06:21.130> it<00:06:21.310> right<00:06:21.520> into<00:06:21.729> here<00:06:22.120> of<00:06:22.240> the

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
reap aced it right into here of the

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.779 
reap aced it right into here of the
32-bit<00:06:23.169> version<00:06:23.500> so<00:06:23.800> it<00:06:23.830> acts<00:06:24.160> as<00:06:24.430> if<00:06:24.610> we're

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
32-bit version so it acts as if we're

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.689 
32-bit version so it acts as if we're
using<00:06:24.970> this<00:06:25.410> 64-bit<00:06:26.410> version<00:06:26.830> but<00:06:27.490> we<00:06:27.639> are

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:27.699 
using this 64-bit version but we are

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:33.050 
using this 64-bit version but we are
using<00:06:27.940> the<00:06:28.150> 32-bit<00:06:28.750> version<00:06:29.080> actually<00:06:29.280> so

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.890 

what<00:06:34.060> we're<00:06:34.210> going<00:06:34.300> to<00:06:34.389> do<00:06:34.509> is<00:06:34.630> we're<00:06:34.750> going<00:06:34.840> to

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.870 
what we're going to do is we're going to
go<00:06:35.020> ahead<00:06:35.050> and<00:06:35.229> launch<00:06:35.650> the<00:06:35.889> game<00:06:36.039> and<00:06:36.310> then

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
go ahead and launch the game and then

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.640 
go ahead and launch the game and then
we'll<00:06:37.030> run<00:06:37.240> in<00:06:37.389> the<00:06:37.479> 32-bit<00:06:38.080> version<00:06:38.380> instead

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
we'll run in the 32-bit version instead

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.800 
we'll run in the 32-bit version instead
of<00:06:38.770> the<00:06:38.830> 64-bit<00:06:39.550> now<00:06:40.150> if<00:06:40.360> you<00:06:40.449> want<00:06:40.660> to<00:06:40.750> get

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
of the 64-bit now if you want to get

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.390 
of the 64-bit now if you want to get
your<00:06:40.930> files<00:06:41.199> back<00:06:41.500> and<00:06:41.710> want<00:06:41.860> to<00:06:41.949> return<00:06:42.160> it<00:06:42.310> to

will automatically turn it back to its
original<00:06:48.610> state<00:06:49.090> so<00:06:49.960> technically<00:06:50.560> you<00:06:50.710> don't

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
original state so technically you don't

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.689 
original state so technically you don't
have<00:06:51.039> to<00:06:51.250> you<00:06:51.940> know<00:06:52.060> do<00:06:52.690> through<00:06:52.900> there<00:06:53.080> um
