this<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.589> 1972<00:00:07.589> C<00:00:08.099> camper<00:00:08.550> don't<00:00:09.000> my<00:00:09.260> warm

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
this is a 1972 C camper don't my warm

this is a 1972 C camper don't my warm
boats<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.769> believe<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.160> Florida<00:00:11.929> there's<00:00:12.929> about

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
boats I believe in Florida there's about

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.709 
boats I believe in Florida there's about
500<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.009> these<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.370> have<00:00:14.490> been<00:00:14.610> built<00:00:14.849> -<00:00:15.120> more

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
500 of these that have been built - more

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.450 
500 of these that have been built - more
or<00:00:15.809> less

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
or less

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.500 
or less
the<00:00:17.460> C<00:00:18.090> campers<00:00:18.510> were<00:00:18.779> designed<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.859> be<00:00:20.580> useful

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
the C campers were designed to be useful

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.560 
the C campers were designed to be useful
on<00:00:21.779> land<00:00:22.580> as<00:00:23.580> well<00:00:23.850> as<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> water

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
on land as well as in the water

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.910 
on land as well as in the water
I'm<00:00:24.630> guessing<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.230> boat<00:00:25.470> weighs<00:00:25.710> about

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
I'm guessing this boat weighs about

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.230 
I'm guessing this boat weighs about
6,000<00:00:26.789> pounds<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.779> toes<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.470> dream

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
6,000 pounds but it toes like a dream

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.220 
6,000 pounds but it toes like a dream
the<00:00:30.240> tires<00:00:30.679> are<00:00:31.759> new<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.059> when<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> say<00:00:33.989> new<00:00:34.200> I

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the tires are new and when I say new I

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.229 
the tires are new and when I say new I
don't<00:00:34.500> mean<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.680> they<00:00:35.640> haven't<00:00:35.820> got<00:00:36.059> many

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
don't mean that they haven't got many

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.510 
don't mean that they haven't got many
miles<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.870> mean<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.559> they're<00:00:37.890> only<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.190> year

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
miles I mean that they're only a year

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.389 
miles I mean that they're only a year
and<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.700> half<00:00:38.850> old<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.739> in<00:00:40.739> extremely<00:00:41.280> good

video<00:00:53.070> what<00:00:53.670> you're<00:00:53.789> saying<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.629> it's

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
video what you're saying is is that it's

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.830 
video what you're saying is is that it's
apparent<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.829> car<00:00:56.129> needs<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.570> read

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
apparent that the car needs to be read

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.279 
apparent that the car needs to be read
but<00:00:57.989> incorrect<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.430> diaphragm<00:01:00.050> in<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
but incorrect that the diaphragm in the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.899 
but incorrect that the diaphragm in the
carburetor<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.730> not<00:01:03.300> delivering<00:01:03.809> fuel

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
carburetor is not delivering fuel

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.030 
carburetor is not delivering fuel
properly<00:01:06.170> but<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.830> engine<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.280> run

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.590 

if<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.000> turn<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.300> over<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.890> add<00:01:13.890> fuel<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.280> it

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
if you turn it over and add fuel to it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.060 
if you turn it over and add fuel to it
it<00:01:15.600> will<00:01:15.870> run

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
it will run

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.130 
it will run
until<00:01:17.730> the<00:01:18.030> fuel<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.420> overloads<00:01:18.870> and<00:01:19.050> it

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
until the fuel just overloads and it

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
until the fuel just overloads and it
will<00:01:19.320> backfire<00:01:19.500> back<00:01:19.890> through<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
will backfire back through the

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.870 
will backfire back through the
carburetor<00:01:20.550> and<00:01:20.810> your<00:01:22.190> estimation<00:01:23.190> is<00:01:23.550> is

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
carburetor and your estimation is is

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.840 
carburetor and your estimation is is
that<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:25.380> really<00:01:26.160> no<00:01:26.310> need<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> do<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that the really no need to do a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.510 
that the really no need to do a
compression<00:01:27.210> test<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:28.080> all<00:01:29.010> indications

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
compression test because all indications

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.850 
compression test because all indications
are<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.910> all<00:01:30.900> indications<00:01:31.290> are<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.650> if

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
are that all indications are that if

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.510 
are that all indications are that if
Myers<00:01:32.100> groans<00:01:32.580> okay<00:01:33.650> good<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.280> card

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
Myers groans okay good so just a card

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.100 
Myers groans okay good so just a card
then<00:01:36.410> you<00:01:37.760> cycled<00:01:38.760> the<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:39.390> drive<00:01:39.690> up<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
then you cycled the out drive up and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.719 
then you cycled the out drive up and
down<00:01:40.200> now<00:01:40.500> drive<00:01:40.740> goes<00:01:40.920> up<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.280> down<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
down now drive goes up and down and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.640 
down now drive goes up and down and
actually<00:01:42.630> put<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.930> into<00:01:43.080> here<00:01:43.260> while<00:01:43.470> we<00:01:43.560> were

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
actually put it into here while we were

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.520 
actually put it into here while we were
starting<00:01:44.010> it<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.900> drive<00:01:45.900> does<00:01:46.050> count

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
starting it and the drive does count

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.469 
starting it and the drive does count
okay<00:01:47.870> so<00:01:48.870> everything<00:01:49.320> functions<00:01:50.040> properly

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
okay so everything functions properly

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.670 
okay so everything functions properly
with<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.509> exception<00:01:52.080> of<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.380> carburetor
