months or so so this was kind of felt a
little<00:01:05.700> bit<00:01:05.909> weird<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:07.220> definitely<00:01:08.220> wasn't

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
little bit weird to be definitely wasn't

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.219

significantly<00:02:03.750> stronger<00:02:04.020> than<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.590> am<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:05.990> but

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
significantly stronger than I am now but

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.180 
significantly stronger than I am now but
then<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.140> had<00:02:07.380> transitioned<00:02:07.740> over<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
then I had transitioned over the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.990 
then I had transitioned over the
dumbbell<00:02:08.610> presses<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.599> think<00:02:10.760> I've<00:02:11.760> been

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
dumbbell presses so I think I've been

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.180 
dumbbell presses so I think I've been
doing<00:02:12.060> fat

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
doing fat

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.250 
doing fat
for<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.310> while<00:02:13.520> before<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:14.090> program<00:02:14.630> Lane

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
for a while before this program Lane

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.960 
for a while before this program Lane
Norton's<00:02:15.620> fat<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.490> I<00:02:16.520> went<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:18.970> dumbo

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
Norton's fat so I went on to dumbo

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.920 
Norton's fat so I went on to dumbo
pressing<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:21.350> think<00:02:22.070> I<00:02:22.130> got<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.550> maybe<00:02:22.760> 36<00:02:23.630> s

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
pressing and I think I got to maybe 36 s

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.660 
pressing and I think I got to maybe 36 s
or<00:02:24.110> something<00:02:24.470> for<00:02:24.650> maybe<00:02:24.800> sets<00:02:25.100> of<00:02:25.250> six<00:02:25.460> to

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
or something for maybe sets of six to

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.330 
or something for maybe sets of six to
eight<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.170> kind<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.500> expected<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:27.950> push<00:02:28.190> at

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
eight so I kind of expected to push at

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.330 
eight so I kind of expected to push at
least<00:02:28.550> sort<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.850> 70<00:02:29.270> kilos<00:02:30.070> for<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.190> military

right there I just completely grind it
out<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.830> that<00:02:49.430> was<00:02:49.520> my<00:02:49.700> very<00:02:49.910> first<00:02:50.180> set<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:50.600> I

was kind of him yeah so I wasn't in the
best<00:02:53.900> kind<00:02:54.170> of<00:02:54.230> frame<00:02:54.380> of<00:02:54.530> mind<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.800> don't<00:02:54.980> think

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
best kind of frame of mind I don't think

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.590 
best kind of frame of mind I don't think
alike<00:02:55.400> i<00:02:55.430> said<00:02:55.640> i<00:02:55.700> was<00:02:55.820> kind<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.060> focused<00:02:56.390> a<00:02:56.510> lot

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
alike i said i was kind of focused a lot

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.600 
alike i said i was kind of focused a lot
on<00:02:56.660> on<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.350> film<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.740> the<00:02:57.860> recording<00:02:58.310> moving

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
on on the film in the recording moving

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.640 
on on the film in the recording moving
the<00:02:58.700> camera<00:02:58.940> around<00:02:59.150> I've<00:03:00.020> really<00:03:00.500> struggled

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
the camera around I've really struggled

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.040 
the camera around I've really struggled
to<00:03:01.040> get<00:03:01.730> into<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.210> session<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:02.720> this<00:03:02.840> my

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
to get into the session so this my

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.010 
to get into the session so this my
second<00:03:03.470> set<00:03:03.740> and<00:03:04.240> on<00:03:05.240> reflection<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.870> mean

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
second set and on reflection I mean

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.770 
second set and on reflection I mean
looking<00:03:06.350> at<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:06.910> probably<00:03:07.910> maybe<00:03:08.450> could

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
looking at it I probably maybe could

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.270 
looking at it I probably maybe could
have<00:03:08.840> gone<00:03:09.080> with<00:03:09.380> my<00:03:09.650> hands<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:09.980> little<00:03:10.100> bit

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
have gone with my hands a little bit

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.810 
have gone with my hands a little bit
wider<00:03:10.490> I<00:03:10.700> think<00:03:10.970> that<00:03:11.090> might<00:03:11.360> have<00:03:11.390> made<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:13.790> a

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
wider I think that might have made it a

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.850 
wider I think that might have made it a
little<00:03:13.970> bit<00:03:14.120> easier<00:03:14.390> for<00:03:14.630> me<00:03:14.750> or<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.410> could<00:03:15.770> have

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
little bit easier for me or I could have

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.530 
little bit easier for me or I could have
been<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.010> little<00:03:16.070> bit<00:03:16.280> stronger<00:03:16.460> or<00:03:17.330> quite

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
been a little bit stronger or quite

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.900 
been a little bit stronger or quite
happy<00:03:17.780> with<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.989> form<00:03:18.230> though<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:19.790> know

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
happy with the form though you know

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.360 
happy with the form though you know
bringing<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.300> all<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.420> way<00:03:20.570> down<00:03:20.680> but<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:22.040> can

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
bringing it all the way down but you can

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.470 
bringing it all the way down but you can
see<00:03:22.489> that<00:03:22.520> I<00:03:22.700> failed<00:03:23.060> there<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:25.060> so<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.120> decided

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
see that I failed there and so I decided

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.080 
see that I failed there and so I decided
to<00:03:26.600> whip<00:03:26.810> go<00:03:27.380> back<00:03:27.590> down<00:03:27.800> to<00:03:28.040> just<00:03:28.520> 15<00:03:28.730> on<00:03:29.060> each

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
to whip go back down to just 15 on each

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.630 
to whip go back down to just 15 on each
side<00:03:29.450> so<00:03:29.720> like<00:03:29.900> 50<00:03:30.590> kilos<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.130> just<00:03:31.310> walk<00:03:31.459> out

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
side so like 50 kilos and just walk out

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.420 
side so like 50 kilos and just walk out
a<00:03:31.670> few<00:03:31.880> more<00:03:32.030> reps<00:03:32.560> again<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:33.800> kind<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.250> looks

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
a few more reps again it kind of looks

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.560 
a few more reps again it kind of looks
like<00:03:34.489> my<00:03:34.670> hands<00:03:34.970> are<00:03:35.030> quite<00:03:35.180> close<00:03:35.330> together

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
like my hands are quite close together

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.270 
like my hands are quite close together
but<00:03:35.930> it's<00:03:36.080> trying<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.320> photo<00:03:36.500> cube<00:03:36.650> my<00:03:36.920> elbows

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
but it's trying to photo cube my elbows

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.009 
but it's trying to photo cube my elbows
forward<00:03:37.580> as<00:03:37.790> well<00:03:40.090> so<00:03:41.090> yeah<00:03:41.239> that's<00:03:41.660> about<00:03:41.780> if

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
forward as well so yeah that's about if

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.500 
forward as well so yeah that's about if
one<00:03:42.350> wasn't<00:03:42.830> happy<00:03:43.220> at<00:03:43.340> all<00:03:43.519> I'm<00:03:44.300> going<00:03:44.420> to
