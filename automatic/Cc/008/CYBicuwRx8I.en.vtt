00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:13.400
 Yes from here it is part 2 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.990
 I would like to check the hardware side, but there is also a place to go back for a moment . 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.550
 But 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.910
 It's an 8-inch liquid crystal. 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.380
 Wintering 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:28.850
 Gorilla glass is adopted and is resistant to shock 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.160
 The proud gorilla glass is adopted 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:37.840
 So eh 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.180
 It seems that it is difficult to ask Nakatani if there is any impact on it . 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.240
 frozen 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.050
 The tablet being released with ss 3 was a lot hd image quality though 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.110
 Also 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.110
 It is overwintering because it corresponds to full hd this time 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.120
 Pictures also look a little beautiful 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:03.440
 You can see it 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.440
 A little 8 but I think I wanna take a look at a little bit of its photo 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.340
 Enter and display a little 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.480
 Kinda well 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.480
 Kedomo I'm not in the photograph that is taken 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.030
 Itae taking in Germany 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:29.000
 Though it is a picture of pottery 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:35.020
 As it looks like it can be taken in 8 full hd 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.020
 It is thinner than when compared to the hd image 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.730
 This is where 8 LCD has evolved, but it is also called wi-fi version 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.050
 A little thing had been released here 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.190
 I apologize but I'm sorry I'm also wi-fi version a suit right 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:56.220
 pad 8 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:59.850
 It is here, but of course the liquid crystal is hd image quality 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.070
 Here's a little different specs here 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.150
 This is the spec of this one 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.810
 So eh 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:11.540
 The cellular version is pretty 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:15.620
 It's a nice place to evolve, so it's the next one, but it looks like this one 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:21.140
 I think not and whether seen kana Let's tell the truth is it a little darker difficult to see or try to think out of reach 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.770
 Do not cares even without'm in now is seen with a cover there is a place to refer to here 8 sd 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.190
 At the You're sd 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.200
 So I thought I'm worried here a little later 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.860
 Entered Te 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.970
 The earphones 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.970
 Eh door Well you have recently become is a good or cap-less I camp less of Yes 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.900
 I do not detect micro usb, but here 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:48.870
 A little bit 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.870
 It's under there for a moment It is in the same position as nexus 7 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:58.890
 Volume button are both on this go here because the power button of 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.670
 It is very hard to see in blue etc. Yes here 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.960
 It is with new negative current 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.220
 Nea little school 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.280
 Kedomo I feel that I have 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.540
 weak 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.600
 I will feel say whether Well a little cheesy plastic say-sensitive 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.600
 eh 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.120
 I understand a little with wood but something 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.120
 I'm doing something that's cheap 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:33.159
 Well Kedomo it I think the kana not be helped because pretty cheap at the Well price Price 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:34.910
 A little bit I'm interested in here I think that the exterior part is a little pla c part 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.450
 However 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:42.110
 Yes, it's music but this music is already 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:47.110
 And more than I expected 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:52.900
 A sound comes out, but in 8 s 3, I introduced vivo 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:57.740
 I have book ace Sano notebook pc north but still had been equipped with Kedomo 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:01.070
 Wintering technology which is said to Sonic master if there is a relocation of the technology 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.810
 8 Well for listening to music 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.550
 The 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.610
 Clean something for district 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:11.610
 ac It seems that there is a technology of 6 o'clock in total, but it is this 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.360
 It seems to be included in Min 8 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:18.329
 Enjoy the sound with the speaker quite 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.409
 This tablet also it is not bad for 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:27.590
 Very very same ace is making 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:27.590
 I thought that I could not compare with nexus 7 for a while 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.740
 so 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:37.639
 It's overwintering, if you just say a bit dare 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:42.820
 I also hear the volume of the speaker a little 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:47.920
 There are times when you think that the sound is a bit short if you are listening 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:50.540
 But it is a wonder if I can say to Ys's General 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.480
 I think so I guess I can not help you 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.940
 think 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.180
 8 It 's this cpu cpu how much cpu 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.180
 8 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:07.319
 A little familiar Anne It is around this elaborate of the I mean is the company in advance 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:11.489
 I did a Jojo benchmark test so let's take a look 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:15.420
 Oh, the record is 41000 brother Shiroka 

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:20.130
 I got a score of 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:25.270
 Well, these two cores are a little listed here, but also xperia z 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:32.350
 I'm going above the average of 2 I'm this ast 21 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:35.129
 Simply above 8 than because you and xperia z 2 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.990
 There Shi view studies of the performance of the 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:40.390
 In terms of being stacked with 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:44.529
 If you move quickly 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.560
 It works even if you do relatively heavy work 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:52.980
 Well this is pretty 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:54.300
 I think I'm glad I think about the benchmark score of other terminals 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.500
 More than before 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:01.660
 Well 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:05.790
 Since it has taken and the videos leave stuck to also link people of there so please visit 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:09.920
 I would appreciate it if I am by all means look at that since it has evolved considerably 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:15.320
 In a ridge Well network though 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:18.129
 Well it is overwintering that wi-fi corresponds to 5 ghz band 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:22.430
 Because there is little radio wave interference, it is early 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:25.530
 You can use it and this is 8 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.950
 Today's topic wimax 2+ 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:32.000
 Does the carrier aggregation Kedomo I do not corresponding to the 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:37.610
 Because you can use the 8 Hoji of au 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.689
 A little and to Tteyuu will Let's Do It ol letter sounds a look at the 2, et al. 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.689
 Please wait a moment 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:49.740
 Do you understand for a moment 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:52.400
 I'm out forge here for a little while 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:57.129
 I can use the internet 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:01.919
 Let's see the speed a little 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:01.919
 The page of Yahoo Japan is open 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.770
 I will try to play sports 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:17.600
 Ee' ThatLookLikeThis 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.600
 I switched to Pappa 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.220
 After all 4 people can also be used 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.270
 I am very thankful 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.169
 Especially au 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:34.969
 Early to than say radio waves 

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:39.349
 I'm out of the way I feel stressed even if I throw away 

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:43.729
 Banao if also carrier aggregation to cope with this I just really thank you 

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:46.940
 I'm wondering if it's good, but the price is so cheap 

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:52.910
 Well I think that's where I can endure 

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:59.570
 Yes , I did 8 part 2 like this 

00:07:52.910 --> 00:08:01.729
 Next is part 3 where this tablet is good 

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:05.839
 A little or a 

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:09.639
 So I want to kinda doing the Tteyuu point that I was a little dissatisfied 

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:09.639
 Please see the next video by all means
