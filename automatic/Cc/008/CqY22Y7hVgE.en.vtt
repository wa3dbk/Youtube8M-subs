 Hello everyone, today I will show you how to prepare "urgent kimchi" 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.680
 If I travel for more than a week, I always carry a few Korean products with me 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.320
 Red pepper and fish sauce 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.900
 Other products can be found anywhere 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.000
 Today I went to the market nearby 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.080
 and I found this cabbage instead of cabbage nappa 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.740
 and I'll show you how to make kimchi urgently 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.740
 Okay, let's start! 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.740
 I will prepare very little 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.280
 Eh, it sounds like I'm cutting a watermelon, is not it? 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.340
 Inside it looks very tasty 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.940
 Crisp is also very juicy 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.300
 I'll cook just that 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.520
 Cut it into thin pieces 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.860
 I'll put them in a large saucepan 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.280
 about a glass of water 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
 a little salt 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.900
 And just mix it up like that 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.220
 If you've seen my other two cuckoo recipes, you've probably seen that I made kimchi messa 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.160
 In this episode I will miss it because it is urgent! 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.200
 All right. Let's make kimchi paste 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.800
 It's the hot red pepper I bought from New York 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.800
 A third glass 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.800
 Sugar 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.800
 About a tablespoon 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.280
 This is very important to me when I make kimchi 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.900
 What do you think it is? 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.920
 Fish sauce 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.960
 and garlic 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.960
 about a quarter glass 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.060
 Looks delicious 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.540
 And talk 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.980
 Eh, smell very tasty 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.960
 The cabbage once looked more 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.320
 After only ten minutes, he really reduced his volume 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.660
 I'll rinse him 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.820
 Drain it well 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.740
 And we will mix it 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.740
 That's how kimchi is doing 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.540
 They do not have a bigger bowl here, so I'll mix it 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
 like this 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.340
 Press it 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
 And our urgent kimchi is ready 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
 So you can make kimchi even if you do not have cabbage nappa 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.880
 You can usually use cabbage 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.880
 Okay, let me try it 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.880
 My urgent knees 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.840
 You can try it now 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.820
 I carry this baked sesame with me 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.620
 Mmm 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.980
 well 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.460
 very good 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.220
 I'll see you next time! Bye ~ ~
