00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 here is the shoe from android pit.de 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.500
 and you see, that's what comes with it 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.960
 we arrived in the editorial 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.590
 namely, when does it burst since yesterday? 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.410
 I think online is available 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.580
 At least if you have a white system 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.770
 and we want that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.109
 course boxing for you now 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.170
 the one pass death self-proclaimed 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.849
 flagship killer 2016 is still here 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.250
 this packaging and without further ado 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.040
 Let's get out of his pole 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.110
 get and we open the box so 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.480
 it looks like when you get that ron 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.120
 ordered pasco and it also with you 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.379
 now would be on the desk 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.420
 you see, it is already 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.059
 shrouded that we take out first 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.680
 and come right to the smartphone though 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.030
 first to the whole accessory things like 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.730
 somebody also lie with it 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.860
 a bit of scribbling and protected 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.489
 life on one side and then 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.260
 namely come to a power plug to 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.670
 Fortunately, this is the one here 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.609
 European or the German standard 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.030
 matches even with ce logo that belongs 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.420
 the scope of delivery and of course the usb 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.320
 type c charging cable not just type c 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.479
 ahead 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.740
 if the device in the purely stuck 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.930
 in the one pass 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.630
 You can see that I do that 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.159
 In short, that means you can do it around 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.970
 Plug it in or it is perfect 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.409
 no matter but this page what in the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.180
 power supply enters it is perfect 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.610
 no matter how you put it, the consumption 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.220
 Reinstetten or vice versa 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.680
 So it's completely charred 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.540
 so you then stop in the night 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.299
 in the dark be times its smartphone 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.070
 can safely charge without 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.860
 but to destroy any things 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.110
 now to the smartphone itself 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.850
 fits for that I just put all times 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.979
 which is not part of the smartphone 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.570
 Just put it aside 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.270
 this is also big and fat want 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.130
 to never saddle the typical logo of 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.700
 one plus and then here is still whole 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.520
 small 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.130
 some things the hai directs what the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.930
 buttons are concerned and once too 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.340
 an ebt of jackass analyzed and 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.229
 of course very important fingerprint 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.920
 sensor is also marked for that 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.770
 that you have to go out just like that 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.099
 it's careful to pull out and worry 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:20.120
 already we see that 55 inches tall 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:25.400
 smartphone to the dimensions 151 8 x 74 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:29.930
 9 and 9 85 mm, the dimensions are clear 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.510
 wherein it is in the ac- 151 mm high then 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.180
 just 74 centimeters millimeter 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.100
 wide and thick and sees that people 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.450
 is very nice, of course, a thickest 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.250
 8 at the 98 is 5 millimeters thick 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.769
 slightly cloudy and if at the 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.580
 back there are times there are only the 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.920
 sense on black variant you can if 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.510
 your content has an invite too 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.580
 order other covers 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.340
 that's about 30 euros 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.600
 the extra cost and what we have here 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.760
 still see the back 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.850
 The cover is very removable here 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.610
 the laser autofocus and then the 3 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.910
 10 megapixel main camera and of course 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.760
 dual led what then content is very nice 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.450
 when its natural tones in 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.170
 darken it wants to create on the side 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.959
 is here the on and 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.269
 switch off and the volume will be in 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.100
 alu look then it is also the metal 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.590
 complete framework is now in contrast 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.680
 to the predecessor content to fully metal 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.209
 alu housing and only front and back 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.560
 are not always made of metal 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.260
 up here you can still see the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.690
 interruption for the antenna called 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.660
 You can also see stories and tyrol 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.130
 in addition to the additional microphone too 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.859
 even a headphone jack, a 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.890
 headphone jack millimeter jack and 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.989
 on the opposite side to 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.390
 the left side is here 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.640
 Unfortunately for the notification one can 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.739
 to adjust the three steps 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.590
 That's the top stop then there 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.450
 it the middle position and then the under 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.890
 are velocity as you can so that once 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.200
 define that for example everyone 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.639
 notifications gets no or 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.049
 just just the most important 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.820
 Disadvantage that can be found in the 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:16.250
 software and then down 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:19.880
 Here is the type C connection 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.980
 for the micro usb cable here simply 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.260
 plug in it does not matter how it works 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.990
 it's always safe to put in it 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.560
 it is very firm so say that 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.250
 phone is safe here s.us usb 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.130
 electric wire 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.350
 but it is only a usb 2.0 has the 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.000
 restriction it is not a 300 version 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.500
 and if you look at the front then 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.720
 I'll drive it up 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.910
 then there is the downstairs 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.490
 fingerprint sensor and left and right 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.530
 next to the softkeys you then 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.820
 can prove individually because yes 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.370
 are not labeled or im 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.460
 special signs because you have then 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.830
 always only a small number of colors led 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.990
 behind it and a special feature 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.169
 from the fingerprint sensor is here too 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.640
 that's not just not physical 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.010
 physical button is just one 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.230
 I could not give them a sensor field 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.940
 but you can escape the emergency stairs 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.700
 that's what it looks like when it's complete 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.200
 is set up is the 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.060
 Of course, then then of 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.950
 our christian review content 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.150
 want to write and want to last 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.919
 I also mention that above, too 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.950
 another front camera is the 5 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.450
 megapixel dissolves to the interna can 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.430
 you actually read carefully in 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.880
 our first hands-on or even the 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.290
 review 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.720
 All technical details will always be there 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:36.220
 choose only as much a snapdragon 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.860
 810 is in there with 1 8 ghz clocking and 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.950
 we do not have the 64 gigabyte version 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.350
 the 32 the 16 gigabyte variant the 64 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.450
 gb variant also has one 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.070
 larger memory of 4 gb instead 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.110
 the three gigabytes in the 16 variant 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.620
 and you can already see something 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.020
 namely, there are two up here 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.320
 sim cards displayed, this means that 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.450
 what you as dual sim variant on the 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.960
 market comes and then we have two sim cards 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:08.930
 could incorporate content that was so 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.370
 first our first unboxing of one 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.350
 pass do of course if more 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.150
 videos follow and also a complete one 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.560
 test report to each other with us 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.490
 on the website can read 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.610
 that is on 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.970
 today.de and a few more 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.050
 Additional information the children too 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.400
 did not mention the battery 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.590
 3300 milliamps and the weight of 175 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.650
 gram is already a big club but at 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.240
 such a smartphone with noble 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.889
 Metal frame is the one to forgive that 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.569
 the weight gain then content since it 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.849
 this is the quality correspond to the 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:39.800
 if you like the video now 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.490
 There is then in a thumb 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.650
 up 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.090
 share it with your friends in social 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.889
 networks like facebook google + and 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.370
 Of course you can also use twitter here 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:47.870
 consequences 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.520
 my name is we will see each other for sure 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.970
 soon back up here in this canal 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.419
 youtube 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.419
 bye for now
