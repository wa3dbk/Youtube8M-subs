00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.650
 it's christophe soumillon the hero at 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.529
 Japan congratulations first congratulations 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.269
 christophe feliz it 's a pleasure to 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.500
 races so much to win beautiful but 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.519
 this one is more than a hundred thousand 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.640
 what does it do 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.230
 well, it's already been for me 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.719
 very sincerely a race that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.100
 I imagined more won since I 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.079
 am more given goals to come back 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.219
 in Japan the winter so it's very 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.170
 difficult to be invited 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.640
 today I'm lucky that the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.140
 jockeys championship be the same 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.460
 day that the japan cup ski before was 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.780
 not the case that's what gave me 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.039
 the opportunity to go up to japan 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.329
 cup and then could it's difficult when we 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.649
 did not mount the preparations for 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.520
 find on a shock and a good 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.989
 luck before the shot it's true that 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.370
 I was not in the first two first three 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.270
 favorites but here it was 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.480
 four five best horses of the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.309
 very delicate horse race and 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.660
 sincerely I wanted to won it by 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.280
 revenge because I really 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.379
 the impression I think a lot of 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.850
 people are agree with with that that 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.760
 this race there we had a little 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.890
 to steal unfairly was a hindrance 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.229
 but who was not at the end of a lot 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.729
 really serious people and here it is 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.530
 bonavista did not deserve to be outdistanced 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.180
 that day and that's part of 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.900
 races unfortunately here I was 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.070
 really the following years very very 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.409
 disappointed because I thought I could 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.030
 going up she then went up other 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.290
 as silversmiths and I was not invited 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.460
 by the jirs has to be able to mount them 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.920
 because I had supposedly been a 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.750
 little too dangerous so I was really 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.329
 hurt and disappointed and today that's it 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.460
 it's a revenge on on destiny 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.320
 and sometimes rules that are not 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.790
 always to everyone's taste but 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.259
 well here I am back I'm lucky 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.060
 to win a race that was missing from my 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.159
 charts and that I absolutely wanted 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.540
 to see but I had a little clear of my 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.710
 head some time ago but 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.990
 good here is today I have the chance 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.250
 to be especially very closely followed by the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.600
 yoshida family that he always names the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.490
 chance to ride their best horses 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.050
 when they come to europe where when i 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.240
 in Japan but as I said ah 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.190
 to your colleagues I have a lot of trouble 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.230
 with the weight everyone knows I 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.360
 can not go up here at a lower weight 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.400
 to 55 kg so by the way today 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.500
 study eat a fine unfortunately 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.940
 because then the regulations are 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.780
 like that I arrived on time but 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.460
 I was told that I had to make myself 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.320
 an hour before so that's it 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.150
 I took a fine but it's part 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.950
 races we know that here in japan 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.270
 rules are very strict and have made 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.470
 no gift so here is a word either 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.060
 I did not do it I won the race 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.770
 I wanted to win on bravo 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.770
 christophe bravo congratulations bravo
