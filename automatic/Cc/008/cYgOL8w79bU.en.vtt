also for accuracy but most importantly

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.960 
also for accuracy but most importantly
the<00:00:28.650> guns<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.490> safe<00:00:29.699> range

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the guns have to be in a safe range

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.229 
the guns have to be in a safe range
between<00:00:30.300> about<00:00:30.449> 275<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.859> 280<00:00:32.399> feet<00:00:32.669> per<00:00:32.850> second

between about 275 to 280 feet per second

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.540 
between about 275 to 280 feet per second
and<00:00:33.719> that's<00:00:33.930> because<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.440> want<00:00:34.620> don't<00:00:35.399> want

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and that's because you want don't want

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.650 
and that's because you want don't want
to<00:00:35.610> exceed<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.030> speed<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.360> would<00:00:36.480> break

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
to exceed the speed that would break

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.709 
to exceed the speed that would break
your<00:00:37.140> paintball<00:00:37.469> lenses<00:00:38.450> alright<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> way<00:00:39.660> to

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
your paintball lenses alright the way to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.270 
your paintball lenses alright the way to
test<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> speed<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.530> your<00:00:40.649> paintball<00:00:40.950> gun<00:00:41.160> is

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
test the speed of your paintball gun is

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.190 
test the speed of your paintball gun is
by<00:00:41.370> using<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.730> chronograph<00:00:42.059> I'm<00:00:42.750> using<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
by using a chronograph I'm using a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.080 
by using a chronograph I'm using a
shooting<00:00:43.590> crony<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.640> does<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.969> it

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
shooting crony and what it does is it

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.819 
shooting crony and what it does is it
measures<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.420> speed<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.020> ball<00:00:46.170> as<00:00:46.379> it

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
measures the speed of the ball as it

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.410 
measures the speed of the ball as it
goes<00:00:46.980> through<00:00:47.010> either<00:00:47.489> end<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
goes through either end of the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.060 
goes through either end of the
coronagraph<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:50.670> here's<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> display

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
coronagraph and here's the display

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.490 
coronagraph and here's the display
that's<00:00:53.070> read<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.550> feet<00:00:53.820> per<00:00:53.850> second<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.410> you

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
that's read in feet per second so you

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.560 
that's read in feet per second so you
want<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.739> follow<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:56.039> owner's<00:00:56.340> manual<00:00:56.570> now

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.310 
our goggles on and get ready to tune the
gun<00:01:58.100> take<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.159> barrel<00:01:59.490> cover<00:01:59.670> off<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.899> gun<00:02:01.079> is

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
gun take the barrel cover off the gun is

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.249 
gun take the barrel cover off the gun is
gassed<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:02.329> safety<00:02:03.329> was<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.509> go<00:02:04.020> ahead<00:02:04.079> and

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
gassed up safety was on go ahead and

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.050 
gassed up safety was on go ahead and
take<00:02:04.380> your<00:02:04.530> safety<00:02:04.710> off<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.280> shoot<00:02:05.850> through

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
take your safety off and shoot through

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.119 
take your safety off and shoot through
the<00:02:06.180> chrome<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:07.380> want<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.619> hold<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.950> gun

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
the chrome you want to hold it a gun

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.790 
the chrome you want to hold it a gun
kind<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.819> straight<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.479> follows<00:02:09.899> through

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
kind of straight so it follows through

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.690 
kind of straight so it follows through
the<00:02:10.920> chronograph

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
the chronograph

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.580 
the chronograph
now<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.760> gun<00:02:13.989> shooting<00:02:14.989> kind<00:02:15.140> of<00:02:15.200> high

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
now the gun shooting kind of high

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.410 
now the gun shooting kind of high
again<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.579> range<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:16.879> you<00:02:16.939> want<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.180> get<00:02:17.299> is

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
again the range that you want to get is

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.530 
again the range that you want to get is
between<00:02:17.689> 275<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:19.180> 284

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
between 275 and 284

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.390 
between 275 and 284
so<00:02:21.049> now<00:02:21.200> we<00:02:21.260> need<00:02:21.439> to<00:02:21.500> go<00:02:21.650> ahead<00:02:21.739> and<00:02:21.890> tune<00:02:22.280> the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
so now we need to go ahead and tune the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.089 
so now we need to go ahead and tune the
gun<00:02:22.579> down<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.090> little<00:02:23.359> bit<00:02:26.890> alright

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
gun down a little bit alright

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.759 
gun down a little bit alright
and<00:02:28.790> we<00:02:28.879> need<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.090> go<00:02:29.209> ahead<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:29.359> turn<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.260> in<00:02:30.560> a

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
and we need to go ahead and turn it in a

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.490 
and we need to go ahead and turn it in a
little<00:02:31.519> bit<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:31.909> we<00:02:32.030> want<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.420> decrease<00:02:33.079> the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
little bit so we want to decrease the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.160 
little bit so we want to decrease the
velocity<00:02:34.090> alright<00:02:35.090> do<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.750> just<00:02:35.930> about<00:02:36.049> a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
velocity alright do a just about a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:44.470 
velocity alright do a just about a
quarter<00:02:36.379> turn<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:36.980> we'll<00:02:37.670> shoot<00:02:37.849> it<00:02:38.030> again<00:02:43.480> as

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
quarter turn and we'll shoot it again as

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.479 
quarter turn and we'll shoot it again as
you<00:02:44.659> can<00:02:44.750> see<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.019> gun<00:02:45.170> it's<00:02:45.530> it's<00:02:46.280> getting

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
you can see the gun it's it's getting

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.949 
you can see the gun it's it's getting
closer<00:02:46.700> but<00:02:47.000> it's<00:02:47.120> still<00:02:47.269> shooting<00:02:47.599> a<00:02:47.659> little

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
closer but it's still shooting a little

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.619 
closer but it's still shooting a little
bit<00:02:48.079> high<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.670> will<00:02:49.670> turn<00:02:49.849> the<00:02:49.970> velocity<00:02:50.389> down<00:02:50.599> a

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
bit high I will turn the velocity down a

00:02:50.629 --> 00:03:10.170 
bit high I will turn the velocity down a
little<00:02:50.959> bit<00:02:51.139> more<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:58.400> it's<00:02:59.590> going<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.739> high

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.379 

okay

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
we've obviously gone in the wrong

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.679 
we've obviously gone in the wrong
direction<00:03:12.829> so<00:03:13.370> we'll<00:03:13.790> need<00:03:13.909> to<00:03:14.090> back<00:03:14.269> it<00:03:14.480> out

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:14.689 
direction so we'll need to back it out

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.800 
direction so we'll need to back it out
just<00:03:15.319> a<00:03:15.500> little<00:03:15.530> bit<00:03:16.359> we're<00:03:17.359> trying<00:03:17.569> to<00:03:17.629> stay

within<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.169> the<00:03:19.099> correct<00:03:19.340> range<00:03:19.639> 275<00:03:20.599> to<00:03:20.930> 280

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
within the the correct range 275 to 280

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:36.930 
within the the correct range 275 to 280
feet<00:03:22.159> per<00:03:22.310> second<00:03:31.540> take<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.659> down<00:03:32.780> some<00:03:33.049> more
