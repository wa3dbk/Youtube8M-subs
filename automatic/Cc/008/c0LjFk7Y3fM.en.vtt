make<00:01:32.189> each<00:01:32.400> word<00:01:32.700> its<00:01:33.060> own<00:01:33.240> group<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.159> just

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
make each word its own group so I just

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.520 
make each word its own group so I just
highlight<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> word<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> want<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.720> then

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
highlight the word that I want and then

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.840 
highlight the word that I want and then
hit<00:01:37.710> ctrl<00:01:38.100> G<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.520> make<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.880> group<00:01:40.640> now<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.790> I

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
hit ctrl G to make it a group now that I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.370 
hit ctrl G to make it a group now that I
have<00:01:41.970> these<00:01:42.119> grouped<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.869> move<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.200> one

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
have these grouped I can move just one

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.130 
have these grouped I can move just one
word<00:01:43.530> at<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.770> time<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:44.310> its<00:01:44.610> own<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:45.720> now<00:01:45.960> that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
word at a time on its own it's now that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.510 
word at a time on its own it's now that
I<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.439> make<00:01:46.560> some<00:01:46.680> design<00:01:47.009> decisions

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
I have to make some design decisions

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.969 
I have to make some design decisions
whether<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.180> want<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> video<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.960> rotate<00:01:49.590> or<00:01:49.950> I

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
whether I want the video to rotate or I

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.740 
whether I want the video to rotate or I
want<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> words<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.700> all<00:01:50.790> fly<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.270> from<00:01:51.540> one

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
want the words to all fly on from one

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.649 
want the words to all fly on from one
side<00:01:52.140> or<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.470> other<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:54.000> I'm<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.450> going<00:01:54.570> to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
side or the other so I'm just going to

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.120 
side or the other so I'm just going to
take<00:01:54.750> some<00:01:54.810> time<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.320> rotate<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> couple<00:01:56.070> of

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
take some time to rotate a couple of

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.120 
take some time to rotate a couple of
these<00:01:56.219> words<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:57.530> we'll<00:01:58.530> try<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.710> find<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.040> good

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
these words and we'll try to find a good

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.080 
these words and we'll try to find a good
fit<00:01:59.399> for<00:01:59.430> them

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.280 

most<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.270> it's<00:02:05.360> all<00:02:05.510> just<00:02:05.720> trial<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.110> error

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
most of it's all just trial and error

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.260 
most of it's all just trial and error
the<00:02:06.470> first<00:02:06.590> time<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:07.040> do<00:02:07.160> it<00:02:07.190> so<00:02:07.640> don't<00:02:08.030> be<00:02:08.119> too

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
the first time you do it so don't be too

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.990 
the first time you do it so don't be too
worried<00:02:08.539> about<00:02:08.600> getting<00:02:08.840> everything<00:02:09.050> perfect

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
worried about getting everything perfect

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.990 
worried about getting everything perfect
because<00:02:11.000> you're<00:02:11.180> not<00:02:11.330> going<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:12.790> had<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.820> do

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
a number of these before I had anything

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.790 
a number of these before I had anything
that<00:02:15.650> was<00:02:15.770> good<00:02:15.890> enough<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.100> post<00:02:17.620> okay<00:02:18.620> now

vector<00:02:28.610> still<00:02:29.000> be<00:02:29.480> careful<00:02:29.900> though<00:02:30.020> if<00:02:30.110> you

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
vector still be careful though if you

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.500 
vector still be careful though if you
start<00:02:30.440> working<00:02:30.709> with<00:02:30.740> bitmap<00:02:31.160> images<00:02:31.700> because

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
start working with bitmap images because

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.090 
start working with bitmap images because
you<00:02:32.660> don't<00:02:32.840> just<00:02:33.170> have<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.410> use<00:02:33.530> text<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.010> can

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
you don't just have to use text you can

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.650 
you don't just have to use text you can
have<00:02:34.250> images<00:02:34.580> fly<00:02:34.790> under<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.060> screen<00:02:35.360> as<00:02:35.510> well

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
have images fly under the screen as well

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.350 
have images fly under the screen as well
however<00:02:36.440> if<00:02:36.740> you<00:02:36.890> use<00:02:37.130> bitmap<00:02:37.520> images<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.300> you

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
however if you use bitmap images and you

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.699 
however if you use bitmap images and you
stretch<00:02:38.570> them<00:02:38.780> out<00:02:38.870> like<00:02:39.020> i<00:02:39.140> just<00:02:39.170> did<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.620> the

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
stretch them out like i just did to the

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.590 
stretch them out like i just did to the
word<00:02:39.740> coolest<00:02:40.280> you're<00:02:41.090> going<00:02:41.240> to<00:02:41.300> get<00:02:41.420> some

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
pixilation and it's going to look really

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.430 
pixilation and it's going to look really
nasty<00:02:43.790> okay<00:02:44.420> once<00:02:44.630> i<00:02:44.720> have<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.870> layout<00:02:45.080> that<00:02:45.230> I'm

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
nasty okay once i have a layout that I'm

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.900 
nasty okay once i have a layout that I'm
happy<00:02:45.590> with<00:02:45.739> I<00:02:46.100> can<00:02:46.250> take<00:02:46.430> each<00:02:46.610> one<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:46.820> these

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
happy with I can take each one of these

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.430 
happy with I can take each one of these
different<00:02:47.090> words<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.780> break<00:02:48.230> them<00:02:48.380> apart

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
different words and break them apart

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.350 
different words and break them apart
into<00:02:48.800> their<00:02:49.010> own<00:02:49.130> separate<00:02:49.520> layer<00:02:49.730> we're

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
into their own separate layer we're

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.190 
into their own separate layer we're
going<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.510> need<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.660> do<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.020> we<00:02:51.080> can

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
going to need to do that so we can

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.750 
going to need to do that so we can
animate<00:02:51.500> them<00:02:51.680> individually<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.430> after

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
animate them individually and after

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.180 
animate them individually and after
effects<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.959> here's<00:02:54.140> my<00:02:54.200> first<00:02:54.590> illustrator

I did as you can see I laid out all the
words<00:03:00.230> here<00:03:00.590> each<00:03:00.800> one<00:03:01.040> as<00:03:01.250> an<00:03:01.340> individual

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
words here each one as an individual

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.840 
words here each one as an individual
layer<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:02.870> wanted<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.350> animate<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.130> I

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.320 
also made this little calendar thing
here<00:03:06.830> because<00:03:07.100> they<00:03:07.520> mentioned<00:03:07.910> day<00:03:08.030> after

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
here because they mentioned day after

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.520 
here because they mentioned day after
day<00:03:08.480> or<00:03:08.630> something<00:03:08.810> like<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:09.019> in<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.320> poem

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
day or something like that in the poem

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.979 
day or something like that in the poem
so<00:03:09.860> I<00:03:10.610> wanted<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.299> make<00:03:11.450> sure<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.780> there<00:03:11.900> was

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
so I wanted to make sure that there was

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.330 
so I wanted to make sure that there was
a<00:03:12.019> calendar<00:03:12.410> here<00:03:12.500> that<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:12.680> could<00:03:12.830> animate<00:03:13.070> on

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
a calendar here that I could animate on

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.310 
a calendar here that I could animate on
each<00:03:13.670> day<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.180> week<00:03:14.299> individually<00:03:15.170> and

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
each day of the week individually and

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.289 
each day of the week individually and
then<00:03:15.980> there's<00:03:16.160> also<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.519> second<00:03:16.880> scene<00:03:17.090> down

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
then there's also the second scene down

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.390 
then there's also the second scene down
here<00:03:17.330> that<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.840> goes<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.200> eventually<00:03:18.739> again

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
here that it goes to eventually again

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.580 
here that it goes to eventually again
with<00:03:19.549> each<00:03:19.670> word<00:03:19.940> as<00:03:20.150> its<00:03:20.330> own<00:03:20.510> group<00:03:20.840> and

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
with each word as its own group and

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.350 
with each word as its own group and
layer<00:03:21.980> when<00:03:22.610> you're<00:03:22.730> done<00:03:22.880> laying<00:03:23.060> everything

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
layer when you're done laying everything

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.120 
layer when you're done laying everything
out<00:03:23.570> an<00:03:23.720> illustrator<00:03:24.200> make<00:03:24.500> sure<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:24.650> save<00:03:24.950> the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
out an illustrator make sure to save the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.500 
out an illustrator make sure to save the
file<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.640> then<00:03:26.000> we're<00:03:26.150> going<00:03:26.239> to<00:03:26.330> take<00:03:26.450> it

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
file and then we're going to take it

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.680 
file and then we're going to take it
over<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.930> after<00:03:27.650> effects<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:29.239> this<00:03:29.390> is<00:03:29.420> after

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
over to after effects so this is after

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.449 
over to after effects so this is after
effects<00:03:30.140> and<00:03:30.440> I've<00:03:30.530> already<00:03:30.739> imported<00:03:31.220> the

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
effects and I've already imported the

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.860 
effects and I've already imported the
file<00:03:31.610> we<00:03:31.820> were<00:03:31.910> working<00:03:32.030> on<00:03:32.269> an<00:03:32.360> illustrator

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
file we were working on an illustrator

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.660 
file we were working on an illustrator
as<00:03:33.110> you<00:03:33.590> can<00:03:33.739> see<00:03:33.920> each<00:03:34.130> one<00:03:34.280> of<00:03:34.340> these<00:03:34.430> words

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
as you can see each one of these words

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.030 
as you can see each one of these words
is<00:03:34.940> an<00:03:35.060> individual<00:03:35.690> layer<00:03:35.870> here<00:03:36.230> it's<00:03:36.920> here

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
is an individual layer here it's here

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.530 
is an individual layer here it's here
that<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.370> can<00:03:37.489> start<00:03:37.730> animating<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.360> words

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
that you can start animating the words

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.590 
that you can start animating the words
using<00:03:38.780> keyframes<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:40.160> each<00:03:40.489> individual<00:03:41.360> word

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
using keyframes so each individual word

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.539 
using keyframes so each individual word
will<00:03:41.840> have<00:03:41.959> a<00:03:41.989> start<00:03:42.380> point<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.830> a<00:03:42.950> stop<00:03:43.220> point

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
will have a start point and a stop point

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.539 
will have a start point and a stop point
and<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.930> keyframes<00:03:45.410> will<00:03:45.709> animate<00:03:46.040> that<00:03:46.340> word

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
and the keyframes will animate that word

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.400 
and the keyframes will animate that word
from<00:03:46.880> one<00:03:47.060> point<00:03:47.269> to<00:03:47.450> another<00:03:47.570> on<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:47.989> screen

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
from one point to another on the screen

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.410 
from one point to another on the screen
so<00:03:48.650> if<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.340> scroll<00:03:49.580> through<00:03:49.790> this<00:03:49.880> backwards

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
so if I scroll through this backwards

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.449 
so if I scroll through this backwards
you'll<00:03:50.959> see<00:03:51.200> everything<00:03:51.410> kind<00:03:51.830> of<00:03:51.950> fall<00:03:52.310> apart

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
you'll see everything kind of fall apart

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.090 
you'll see everything kind of fall apart
from<00:03:53.299> where<00:03:53.420> it's<00:03:53.570> all<00:03:53.690> been<00:03:53.870> set<00:03:54.080> in<00:03:54.230> place<00:03:54.410> so

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
from where it's all been set in place so

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.250 
from where it's all been set in place so
first<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.459> boxes<00:03:55.880> disappear<00:03:56.450> then<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.110> word

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
first the boxes disappear then the word

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.860 
first the boxes disappear then the word
start<00:03:57.620> flying<00:03:57.950> off<00:03:58.160> one<00:03:58.430> at<00:03:58.519> a<00:03:58.610> time<00:03:58.880> now<00:03:59.630> those

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
start flying off one at a time now those

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.990 
start flying off one at a time now those
words<00:04:00.079> we're<00:04:00.320> all<00:04:00.410> just<00:04:00.560> animated<00:04:01.070> on<00:04:01.310> with

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
words we're all just animated on with

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.420 
words we're all just animated on with
little<00:04:02.390> individual<00:04:03.040> keyframes<00:04:04.040> which<00:04:04.310> I'll

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
little individual keyframes which I'll

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.370 
little individual keyframes which I'll
show<00:04:04.610> you<00:04:04.640> in<00:04:04.760> just<00:04:04.850> a<00:04:05.060> second<00:04:05.450> okay<00:04:06.049> let's

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
show you in just a second okay let's

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.530 
show you in just a second okay let's
first<00:04:06.590> just<00:04:06.650> focus<00:04:07.070> on<00:04:07.160> this<00:04:07.310> word<00:04:07.519> you<00:04:07.790> down

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
first just focus on this word you down

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.180 
first just focus on this word you down
in<00:04:08.660> our<00:04:08.780> timeline<00:04:09.019> we<00:04:09.290> have<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:09.410> position<00:04:09.680> track

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
in our timeline we have a position track

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.430 
in our timeline we have a position track
and<00:04:10.459> by<00:04:11.000> studying<00:04:11.360> key<00:04:11.630> frames<00:04:11.989> from<00:04:12.230> one

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
and by studying key frames from one

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.949 
and by studying key frames from one
point<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.800> another<00:04:13.090> over<00:04:14.090> that<00:04:14.239> elapsed<00:04:14.690> time

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
point to another over that elapsed time

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.110 
point to another over that elapsed time
after<00:04:15.950> effects<00:04:16.190> is<00:04:16.310> automatically<00:04:16.820> going<00:04:17.000> to

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
after effects is automatically going to

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.740 
after effects is automatically going to
move<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.450> word

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
move the word

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.050 
move the word
to<00:04:17.959> wherever<00:04:18.109> I<00:04:18.260> tell<00:04:18.500> it<00:04:18.680> so<00:04:19.640> if<00:04:19.730> I<00:04:19.820> drag<00:04:20.030> this

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
to wherever I tell it so if I drag this

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.030 
to wherever I tell it so if I drag this
point<00:04:20.600> out<00:04:20.720> here<00:04:21.200> you'll<00:04:21.440> see<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:21.920> word

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
point out here you'll see that the word

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.280 
point out here you'll see that the word
you<00:04:22.280> animates<00:04:22.790> on<00:04:22.910> a<00:04:22.940> lot<00:04:23.090> slower<00:04:23.510> than<00:04:23.810> it

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
you animates on a lot slower than it

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.950 
you animates on a lot slower than it
should<00:04:24.560> okay<00:04:25.160> so<00:04:26.000> basically<00:04:26.180> everything<00:04:26.600> here

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
should okay so basically everything here

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.930 
should okay so basically everything here
are<00:04:27.050> just<00:04:27.140> a<00:04:27.290> timing<00:04:27.680> game<00:04:27.890> you<00:04:28.460> have<00:04:28.580> a<00:04:28.610> start

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
are just a timing game you have a start

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.180 
are just a timing game you have a start
point<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.360> an<00:04:29.660> end<00:04:29.840> point<00:04:30.140> and<00:04:30.440> use<00:04:31.010> at<00:04:31.160> the

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
point and an end point and use at the

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.910 
point and an end point and use at the
time<00:04:31.280> all<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:31.880> words<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.660> fly<00:04:33.530> on<00:04:33.710> at<00:04:33.830> the

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
time all the words to fly on at the

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.310 
time all the words to fly on at the
right<00:04:34.100> time<00:04:34.510> to<00:04:35.510> do<00:04:35.600> this<00:04:35.750> you'd<00:04:35.930> want<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.140> play

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
right time to do this you'd want to play

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.530 
right time to do this you'd want to play
your<00:04:36.560> mp3<00:04:37.100> along<00:04:37.370> with<00:04:37.580> your<00:04:37.760> animation<00:04:38.330> as

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
your mp3 along with your animation as

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.990 
your mp3 along with your animation as
you<00:04:38.960> can<00:04:39.050> see<00:04:39.260> have<00:04:39.410> imported<00:04:39.830> my<00:04:40.250> mp3<00:04:40.820> right

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000

here<00:04:41.560> that<00:04:42.560> will<00:04:42.770> play<00:04:42.980> along<00:04:43.280> when<00:04:43.670> I<00:04:43.700> preview

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
here that will play along when I preview

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.150 
here that will play along when I preview
the<00:04:44.780> animation<00:04:44.870> that<00:04:45.380> I'm<00:04:45.470> working<00:04:45.650> on<00:04:45.860> so<00:04:46.100> I

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
the animation that I'm working on so I

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.920 
the animation that I'm working on so I
can<00:04:46.190> make<00:04:46.430> sure<00:04:46.460> that<00:04:46.610> each<00:04:47.090> word<00:04:47.420> hits<00:04:47.720> when

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
can make sure that each word hits when

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.840 
can make sure that each word hits when
it's<00:04:48.080> supposed<00:04:48.200> to<00:04:48.560> to<00:04:49.250> match<00:04:49.550> up<00:04:49.700> with<00:04:49.790> the

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
it's supposed to to match up with the

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.880 
it's supposed to to match up with the
recording<00:04:50.360> once<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.169> have<00:04:51.200> your<00:04:51.350> animation

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
recording once you have your animation

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.520 
recording once you have your animation
timed<00:04:52.100> up<00:04:52.280> to<00:04:52.460> your<00:04:52.640> mp3<00:04:53.600> you're<00:04:54.080> going<00:04:54.260> to<00:04:54.320> pre

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
timed up to your mp3 you're going to pre

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.820 
timed up to your mp3 you're going to pre
compose<00:04:54.950> each<00:04:55.550> scene<00:04:56.200> now<00:04:57.200> again<00:04:57.470> this<00:04:57.590> is<00:04:57.740> an

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
compose each scene now again this is an

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.560 
compose each scene now again this is an
After<00:04:58.100> Effects<00:04:58.400> term<00:04:58.640> which<00:04:58.940> basically<00:04:59.330> means

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
After Effects term which basically means

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.120 
After Effects term which basically means
we're<00:04:59.810> going<00:04:59.900> to<00:04:59.990> take<00:05:00.230> all<00:05:00.440> this<00:05:00.710> animation

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
we're going to take all this animation

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.210 
we're going to take all this animation
that<00:05:01.370> we<00:05:01.460> made<00:05:01.700> and<00:05:01.850> group<00:05:02.570> it<00:05:02.800> into<00:05:03.800> one<00:05:04.010> group

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
that we made and group it into one group

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.180 
that we made and group it into one group
so<00:05:04.460> that<00:05:04.550> we<00:05:04.669> can<00:05:04.930> zoom<00:05:05.930> in<00:05:06.169> and<00:05:06.200> have<00:05:07.040> the

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
so that we can zoom in and have the

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.580 
so that we can zoom in and have the
camera<00:05:07.610> follow<00:05:07.850> along<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.330> words<00:05:08.570> however<00:05:09.290> we

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
camera follow along the words however we

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.440 
camera follow along the words however we
want<00:05:09.770> so<00:05:10.370> here's<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.730> animation<00:05:11.180> for<00:05:11.330> that

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
want so here's the animation for that

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.610 
want so here's the animation for that
scene<00:05:11.660> that<00:05:11.810> I<00:05:11.840> just<00:05:12.020> may<00:05:12.169> let<00:05:12.320> me<00:05:12.380> play<00:05:12.590> it

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
scene that I just may let me play it

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.280 
scene that I just may let me play it
through<00:05:12.890> for<00:05:13.130> you<00:05:13.250> again<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:14.510> word<00:05:14.630> new<00:05:14.930> drops

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
through for you again the word new drops

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.159 
through for you again the word new drops
and<00:05:15.770> then<00:05:16.040> one<00:05:16.340> a<00:05:16.370> social<00:05:16.880> life<00:05:17.030> with<00:05:17.480> friends

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
and the rest of the words animate on but

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.300 
and the rest of the words animate on but
as<00:05:20.450> you<00:05:20.570> can<00:05:20.690> see<00:05:20.930> nothing's<00:05:21.530> rotating

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
as you can see nothing's rotating

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.830 
as you can see nothing's rotating
nothing's<00:05:22.669> readable<00:05:23.120> because<00:05:23.360> now<00:05:23.510> it's<00:05:23.690> all

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
nothing's readable because now it's all

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.130 
nothing's readable because now it's all
on<00:05:23.990> the<00:05:24.080> side<00:05:24.290> and<00:05:25.150> there<00:05:26.150> we<00:05:26.240> go<00:05:26.360> so<00:05:26.510> that<00:05:26.570> text

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
on the side and there we go so that text

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.810 
on the side and there we go so that text
is<00:05:27.200> upside<00:05:27.590> down<00:05:27.620> then<00:05:28.220> it's<00:05:28.340> back<00:05:28.490> on<00:05:28.669> its

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
is upside down then it's back on its

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.270 
is upside down then it's back on its
side<00:05:29.060> again<00:05:29.450> and<00:05:29.810> then<00:05:30.320> the<00:05:30.440> calendar<00:05:30.890> appears

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
side again and then the calendar appears

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.360 
side again and then the calendar appears
okay<00:05:31.880> so<00:05:32.660> all<00:05:32.690> that's<00:05:33.020> great<00:05:33.320> for<00:05:33.500> this<00:05:33.740> but<00:05:34.190> it

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
okay so all that's great for this but it

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.010 
okay so all that's great for this but it
doesn't<00:05:34.610> make<00:05:34.669> a<00:05:34.729> very<00:05:34.820> good<00:05:35.030> video<00:05:35.479> it's<00:05:35.900> all

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
doesn't make a very good video it's all

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.140 
doesn't make a very good video it's all
just<00:05:36.260> sitting<00:05:36.410> there<00:05:36.500> very<00:05:36.740> static<00:05:37.250> so<00:05:38.030> what

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
just sitting there very static so what

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.210 
just sitting there very static so what
you<00:05:38.270> do<00:05:38.419> is<00:05:38.450> then<00:05:38.720> you<00:05:38.840> pre<00:05:39.050> compose<00:05:39.410> this<00:05:39.919> and

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
you do is then you pre compose this and

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.340 
you do is then you pre compose this and
make<00:05:40.400> it<00:05:40.430> into<00:05:40.700> a<00:05:40.850> group<00:05:41.210> and<00:05:41.540> then<00:05:42.080> we<00:05:42.169> bring

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
make it into a group and then we bring

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.990 
make it into a group and then we bring
it<00:05:42.500> over<00:05:42.710> here<00:05:42.740> so<00:05:43.250> this<00:05:43.340> is<00:05:43.490> our<00:05:43.610> main<00:05:43.760> video

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
it over here so this is our main video

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.610 
it over here so this is our main video
window<00:05:44.479> where<00:05:44.870> our<00:05:44.990> video<00:05:45.260> is<00:05:45.350> going<00:05:45.470> to<00:05:45.530> be

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
window where our video is going to be

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.040 
window where our video is going to be
directed<00:05:46.340> here<00:05:47.240> we<00:05:47.390> can<00:05:47.510> take<00:05:47.660> that<00:05:47.690> group

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
directed here we can take that group

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.100 
directed here we can take that group
that<00:05:48.260> we<00:05:48.350> just<00:05:48.500> made<00:05:48.770> and<00:05:48.800> we<00:05:49.280> can<00:05:49.600> zoom<00:05:50.600> in<00:05:50.840> we

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
that we just made and we can zoom in we

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.530 
that we just made and we can zoom in we
can<00:05:51.290> pan<00:05:51.620> we<00:05:52.040> can<00:05:52.250> rotate<00:05:52.460> we<00:05:53.120> can<00:05:53.240> do<00:05:53.300> all

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
can pan we can rotate we can do all

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.120 
can pan we can rotate we can do all
kinds<00:05:53.570> of<00:05:53.900> fun<00:05:53.960> stuff<00:05:54.229> here<00:05:54.500> with<00:05:54.620> the<00:05:54.710> camera

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
kinds of fun stuff here with the camera

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.890 
kinds of fun stuff here with the camera
to<00:05:55.580> give<00:05:55.790> the<00:05:56.090> video<00:05:56.270> a<00:05:56.419> little<00:05:56.720> bit<00:05:56.810> of

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
to give the video a little bit of

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.890 
to give the video a little bit of
movement<00:05:57.220> so<00:05:58.220> this<00:05:58.400> time<00:05:58.610> if<00:05:58.880> you<00:05:58.970> watch<00:05:59.210> our

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
movement so this time if you watch our

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.630 
movement so this time if you watch our
words<00:06:00.229> are<00:06:00.350> going<00:06:00.500> to<00:06:00.560> drop<00:06:00.710> into<00:06:00.979> place<00:06:01.220> just

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
words are going to drop into place just

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.890 
words are going to drop into place just
as<00:06:01.790> they<00:06:01.940> did<00:06:02.000> before<00:06:02.240> in<00:06:02.780> our<00:06:03.500> little<00:06:04.040> group

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
as they did before in our little group

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.150 
as they did before in our little group
however<00:06:05.900> this<00:06:06.110> time<00:06:06.410> instead<00:06:06.590> of<00:06:06.740> just<00:06:06.890> stayin

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
however this time instead of just stayin

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.570 
however this time instead of just stayin
static<00:06:07.760> we're<00:06:08.630> going<00:06:08.810> to<00:06:08.960> rotate<00:06:09.229> and<00:06:09.710> zoom<00:06:09.740> in

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
static we're going to rotate and zoom in

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.020 
static we're going to rotate and zoom in
so<00:06:11.060> we<00:06:11.240> can<00:06:11.270> read<00:06:11.570> the<00:06:11.690> next<00:06:12.050> section<00:06:12.380> of<00:06:12.470> words

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
so we can read the next section of words

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.870 
so we can read the next section of words
now<00:06:14.080> nothing's<00:06:15.080> changed<00:06:15.860> in<00:06:16.040> our<00:06:16.310> pre

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
now nothing's changed in our pre

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.630 
now nothing's changed in our pre
composition<00:06:17.570> okay<00:06:17.960> in<00:06:18.229> our<00:06:18.350> group<00:06:18.650> all<00:06:19.340> those

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
composition okay in our group all those

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.950 
composition okay in our group all those
layers<00:06:19.880> that<00:06:20.060> we<00:06:20.180> had<00:06:20.360> here<00:06:20.570> all<00:06:20.810> the

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
layers that we had here all the

that's moving very quickly is going to

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.850 
that's moving very quickly is going to
be<00:07:13.030> blurred<00:07:13.300> out<00:07:13.480> because<00:07:14.170> the<00:07:14.290> camera<00:07:14.620> can't

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 
however computers can keep up and it

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.240 
however computers can keep up and it
makes<00:07:19.000> things<00:07:19.210> very<00:07:19.360> sharp<00:07:19.810> and<00:07:19.990> detailed

which is great sometimes but other times

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.480 
which is great sometimes but other times
makes<00:07:23.080> things<00:07:23.260> look<00:07:23.380> really<00:07:23.560> fake<00:07:23.920> so<00:07:24.400> it

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.490 
makes things look really fake so it

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.060
