00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hi girls, how are you waiting? 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.160
 find very well today 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.430
 I bring a video that maybe I can 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.430
 to serve 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.690
 before starting I want to send greetings 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.600
 a carol estrada asmr a johanna famila 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.090
 carri pÃ©rez rice and cabanillas a monetti 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.770
 and Monica virtuoso and makes videos in the 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:31.210
 description I'm going to leave the link 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:32.950
 your channel the bag is an accessory that does not 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.930
 it is only useful but also 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.670
 complements our wardrobe in the 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.710
 market we found an immense variety 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.600
 but we do not always have to choose the 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.460
 that we like but we must have 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.350
 in account which one is best seen 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.839
 according to our body type if we are 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.850
 body type or something we are chubby what 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.710
 we must avoid these small abortions 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.659
 because by doing it our body will look 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.699
 with much more volume instead we should 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.110
 choose to use for your big shaped 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.000
 straight and structured 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.220
 if we are body type triangle we are 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.019
 What we should avoid is to use 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.549
 bags that take us just from the hip 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.229
 well this is going to make it look more 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:07.090
 volume this part and on the contrary 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.940
 we should look for their big or 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.920
 medium sized with defined forms 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.600
 preferably carry them on the shoulder or 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.820
 in the hand if we are type bodies 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.470
 inverted triangle we have little hip 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.600
 what we have to do is avoid the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.130
 Large handbags with hanging handles 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.690
 on the shoulders, this is what is going to 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.820
 do is give us more volume in this 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.380
 instead we can choose handbags 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.120
 large or medium hung 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.770
 preferably on the elbows any 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.630
 those who are crossed and come to us just 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.490
 the race to give us proportion and 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.620
 we are five hourglass bodies with 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.510
 many curves with body type rectangle 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.280
 with a few tombs we can use almost 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.170
 Any type of bag simply 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.790
 we must take into account the doubts more 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.290
 high we must enable it for its 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.030
 small because they will be lost in 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.860
 our stature and on the contrary and 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.780
 they mattered in large or medium and 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.280
 we are short, we should avoid it with their 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.650
 great because we're going to look like a 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.510
 bag accessory and an opposite in 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.400
 change we should look for small bags of 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.229
 according to our stature finally if 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.240
 we have some inside where we have to 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.020
 go smart we should always choose a 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.820
 handbag 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.680
