but those still remain the most

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.730 
but those still remain the most
efficient<00:02:56.580> way<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.730> level<00:02:57.030> unfortunately<00:02:57.740> so

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
efficient way to level unfortunately so

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.890 
efficient way to level unfortunately so
what<00:02:58.920> we<00:02:59.070> saw<00:02:59.280> when<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.000> season<00:03:00.390> started<00:03:00.780> is

what we saw when the season started is
that<00:03:00.930> those<00:03:01.320> who<00:03:01.350> got<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.010> level<00:03:02.250> 70<00:03:02.550> first

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
that those who got to level 70 first

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.240 
that those who got to level 70 first
were<00:03:03.060> those<00:03:03.270> abusing<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.410> these<00:03:04.650> exploits

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
were those abusing of these exploits

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.520 
were those abusing of these exploits
specifically<00:03:06.060> splitting<00:03:06.900> up<00:03:07.020> into<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.350> group

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
specifically splitting up into a group

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.060 
specifically splitting up into a group
of<00:03:07.680> four<00:03:07.980> each<00:03:08.460> hunting<00:03:09.120> for<00:03:09.450> these<00:03:10.080> bounties

and obviously when you have someone who

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.620 
and obviously when you have someone who
finds<00:03:14.070> them<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.580> call<00:03:14.850> everyone<00:03:15.150> into<00:03:15.480> your

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630

off<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.730> run<00:03:47.910> once<00:03:48.270> we<00:03:48.480> hit<00:03:48.660> level<00:03:48.900> 10<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.740> third

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
off the run once we hit level 10 a third

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.420 
off the run once we hit level 10 a third
party<00:03:50.940> joined<00:03:51.270> us<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:52.170> he<00:03:52.440> was<00:03:52.620> ten<00:03:53.190> levels

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
party joined us so he was ten levels

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.120 
party joined us so he was ten levels
below<00:03:53.760> us<00:03:54.120> he<00:03:54.690> was<00:03:54.900> slowing<00:03:55.260> us<00:03:55.530> down<00:03:55.560> he<00:03:56.010> was

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
below us he was slowing us down he was

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.560 
below us he was slowing us down he was
making<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.550> game<00:03:56.730> more<00:03:56.760> difficult<00:03:57.150> without

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
making the game more difficult without

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.290 
making the game more difficult without
contributing<00:03:58.260> any<00:03:58.500> dps<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.400> party<00:03:59.760> we

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
contributing any dps to the party we

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.820 
contributing any dps to the party we
were<00:04:00.450> carrying<00:04:00.810> him<00:04:01.110> basically<00:04:01.590> throughout

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
were carrying him basically throughout

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.120 
were carrying him basically throughout
the<00:04:02.520> entire<00:04:02.880> leveling<00:04:03.450> process<00:04:03.930> again<00:04:04.740> that

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
the entire leveling process again that

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.130 
the entire leveling process again that
slowed<00:04:05.520> us<00:04:05.700> down<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.240> only<00:04:06.330> took<00:04:06.570> us<00:04:06.750> seven

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
slowed us down and it only took us seven

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.470 
slowed us down and it only took us seven
hours<00:04:07.590> without<00:04:08.340> him<00:04:08.610> it<00:04:09.030> could<00:04:09.209> have<00:04:09.300> easily

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
hours without him it could have easily

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.900 
hours without him it could have easily
taken<00:04:09.959> us<00:04:10.080> five<00:04:10.440> hours<00:04:10.860> some<00:04:11.550> of<00:04:11.670> you<00:04:11.760> guys

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
taken us five hours some of you guys

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.610 
taken us five hours some of you guys
asked<00:04:12.510> for<00:04:12.570> a<00:04:12.810> little<00:04:12.990> more<00:04:13.110> guidance<00:04:13.290> with

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
asked for a little more guidance with

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.640 
asked for a little more guidance with
respect<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:14.340> what<00:04:14.850> difficulty<00:04:15.540> or<00:04:15.720> my

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
respect to what difficulty or my

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.260 
respect to what difficulty or my
thoughts<00:04:16.890> on<00:04:17.130> what<00:04:17.280> difficulty<00:04:17.609> benchmarks

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
thoughts on what difficulty benchmarks

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.240 
thoughts on what difficulty benchmarks
to<00:04:18.330> go<00:04:18.540> for<00:04:18.840> what<00:04:19.320> we<00:04:19.500> saw<00:04:19.739> was<00:04:19.980> in<00:04:20.160> the

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
to go for what we saw was in the

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.039 
to go for what we saw was in the
beginning<00:04:20.400> we<00:04:20.820> were<00:04:20.970> playing<00:04:21.239> on<00:04:21.419> hard<00:04:21.750> so

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
beginning we were playing on hard so

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.320 
beginning we were playing on hard so
relatively<00:04:22.530> easy<00:04:22.800> difficulty<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.700> the

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
relatively easy difficulty and the

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.580 
relatively easy difficulty and the
reason<00:04:24.600> for<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:24.750> was<00:04:24.960> we<00:04:25.140> just<00:04:25.169> didn't<00:04:25.560> have

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
reason for that was we just didn't have

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.129 
reason for that was we just didn't have
gear

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
gear

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.409 
gear
it<00:04:26.469> took<00:04:26.740> us<00:04:26.919> several<00:04:27.460> levels<00:04:27.909> before<00:04:28.060> we<00:04:28.330> were

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
it took us several levels before we were

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.119 
it took us several levels before we were
able<00:04:28.599> to<00:04:28.749> start<00:04:29.110> getting<00:04:29.349> weapons<00:04:29.710> we<00:04:30.039> were

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:30.129 
able to start getting weapons we were

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:32.159 
able to start getting weapons we were
able<00:04:30.219> to<00:04:30.400> craft<00:04:30.699> ourselves<00:04:31.180> weapons<00:04:31.569> we<00:04:31.960> just

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
able to craft ourselves weapons we just

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.929 
able to craft ourselves weapons we just
weren't<00:04:32.289> getting<00:04:32.469> drops<00:04:32.860> we<00:04:33.490> weren't<00:04:33.759> getting

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:33.939 
weren't getting drops we weren't getting

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.239 
weren't getting drops we weren't getting
anything<00:04:34.389> good<00:04:34.599> but<00:04:34.840> once<00:04:35.560> we<00:04:35.770> were<00:04:35.889> able<00:04:35.949> to

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:36.249 
anything good but once we were able to

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:39.420 
anything good but once we were able to
craft<00:04:36.580> ourselves<00:04:37.210> sort<00:04:37.930> of<00:04:38.050> best<00:04:38.650> in<00:04:38.860> slot<00:04:39.009> or

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
craft ourselves sort of best in slot or

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.450 
craft ourselves sort of best in slot or
at<00:04:39.669> least<00:04:39.909> level<00:04:40.539> appropriate<00:04:41.219> weapons<00:04:42.219> at

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
at least level appropriate weapons at

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.339 
at least level appropriate weapons at
that<00:04:42.939> point<00:04:43.210> we<00:04:43.330> were<00:04:43.419> able<00:04:43.569> to<00:04:43.719> crank<00:04:44.050> up<00:04:44.259> the

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
that point we were able to crank up the

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.260 
that point we were able to crank up the
difficulty<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:45.069> we<00:04:45.669> eventually<00:04:45.939> found

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
difficulty and we eventually found

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.330 
difficulty and we eventually found
ourselves<00:04:46.479> on<00:04:46.960> about<00:04:47.289> master<00:04:47.860> and<00:04:48.039> we<00:04:48.159> ended

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
ourselves on about master and we ended

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.040 
ourselves on about master and we ended
up<00:04:48.400> spending<00:04:48.669> I<00:04:48.879> think<00:04:48.909> most<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.449> our<00:04:49.599> time<00:04:49.840> on

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
up spending I think most of our time on

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.619 
up spending I think most of our time on
torment<00:04:50.710> 1<00:04:51.039> which<00:04:51.520> I<00:04:51.699> found<00:04:51.939> actually<00:04:52.330> very

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:52.629 
torment 1 which I found actually very

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:54.119 
torment 1 which I found actually very
surprising<00:04:53.229> I<00:04:53.439> didn't<00:04:53.620> realize<00:04:53.889> that<00:04:53.919> as

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:54.129 
surprising I didn't realize that as

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:56.159 
surprising I didn't realize that as
levels<00:04:54.520> would<00:04:54.639> go<00:04:54.759> up<00:04:54.939> we<00:04:55.090> would<00:04:55.240> be<00:04:55.360> cranking

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
levels would go up we would be cranking

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.390 
levels would go up we would be cranking
up<00:04:56.379> the<00:04:56.529> difficulty<00:04:56.889> it<00:04:57.129> seems

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
up the difficulty it seems

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.490 
up the difficulty it seems
counterintuitive<00:04:57.849> you'd<00:04:58.449> think<00:04:58.629> low<00:04:59.139> level

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
counterintuitive you'd think low level

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.379 
counterintuitive you'd think low level
start<00:05:00.009> off<00:05:00.129> with<00:05:00.279> a<00:05:00.340> hard<00:05:00.550> difficulty<00:05:01.029> and<00:05:01.210> go

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
start off with a hard difficulty and go

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.360 
start off with a hard difficulty and go
down<00:05:01.689> as<00:05:01.930> you<00:05:02.439> level<00:05:02.710> up<00:05:02.800> but<00:05:02.979> it<00:05:03.099> turned<00:05:03.279> out

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
down as you level up but it turned out

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.890 
down as you level up but it turned out
to<00:05:03.610> be<00:05:03.639> the<00:05:03.879> opposite<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.539> reason<00:05:04.870> for

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
to be the opposite and the reason for

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.950 
to be the opposite and the reason for
that<00:05:05.020> was<00:05:05.349> the<00:05:05.729> gear<00:05:06.729> we<00:05:07.240> were<00:05:07.389> getting<00:05:07.719> better

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
that was the gear we were getting better

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.779 
that was the gear we were getting better
gear<00:05:08.229> we<00:05:08.379> were<00:05:08.500> crafting<00:05:08.979> better<00:05:09.129> gear<00:05:09.400> as<00:05:09.580> we

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
gear we were crafting better gear as we

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.399 
gear we were crafting better gear as we
were<00:05:09.879> going<00:05:10.029> up<00:05:10.300> so<00:05:10.479> we<00:05:10.569> were<00:05:10.629> able<00:05:10.719> to<00:05:10.870> tackle

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
were going up so we were able to tackle

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.040 
were going up so we were able to tackle
those<00:05:11.590> higher<00:05:12.210> difficulties<00:05:13.210> and<00:05:13.360> of<00:05:13.750> course

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
those higher difficulties and of course

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.809 
those higher difficulties and of course
once<00:05:14.319> I<00:05:14.439> got<00:05:14.560> my<00:05:14.680> level<00:05:14.979> reduced<00:05:15.279> requirement

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:15.819 
once I got my level reduced requirement

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.640 
once I got my level reduced requirement
gear<00:05:16.000> that<00:05:16.210> was<00:05:16.360> cheat<00:05:16.689> codes<00:05:16.930> basically<00:05:17.469> that

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
gear that was cheat codes basically that

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.290 
gear that was cheat codes basically that
was<00:05:17.800> easy<00:05:18.310> mode<00:05:18.669> I<00:05:18.699> think<00:05:18.819> we<00:05:19.089> could<00:05:19.210> have

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
was easy mode I think we could have

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.839 
was easy mode I think we could have
easily<00:05:19.509> done<00:05:19.750> torment<00:05:20.560> -<00:05:20.710> or<00:05:20.830> at<00:05:20.889> least<00:05:20.919> myself

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
easily done torment - or at least myself

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.579 
easily done torment - or at least myself
I<00:05:22.000> could<00:05:22.300> have<00:05:22.389> done<00:05:22.569> torment<00:05:22.990> -<00:05:23.110> or<00:05:23.259> probably

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:23.589 
I could have done torment - or probably

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.379 
I could have done torment - or probably
even<00:05:23.680> higher<00:05:24.099> than<00:05:24.400> that<00:05:24.520> but<00:05:24.819> because<00:05:25.120> I<00:05:25.150> was

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
even higher than that but because I was

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.269 
even higher than that but because I was
with<00:05:25.539> them<00:05:25.779> and<00:05:25.990> they<00:05:26.349> were<00:05:26.409> dying<00:05:26.680> a<00:05:26.889> lot<00:05:27.039> we

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:29.379 
had to go on the easier difficulty stay

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:31.170 
had to go on the easier difficulty stay
on<00:05:29.499> torment<00:05:29.919> 1<00:05:30.099> but<00:05:30.460> otherwise<00:05:30.669> we<00:05:30.969> stayed<00:05:31.150> on

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
on torment 1 but otherwise we stayed on

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.939 
on torment 1 but otherwise we stayed on

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:34.529 
torment 1 all the way to level 70 I
don't<00:05:33.370> understand<00:05:33.819> it<00:05:33.939> I<00:05:34.000> think<00:05:34.210> maybe<00:05:34.300> this

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
don't understand it I think maybe this

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:37.140 
don't understand it I think maybe this
game<00:05:34.719> was<00:05:34.870> just<00:05:34.990> gone<00:05:35.289> easier<00:05:35.979> I<00:05:36.219> don't<00:05:37.060> know

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
game was just gone easier I don't know

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.999

maybe<00:05:37.330> we<00:05:37.479> just<00:05:37.659> know<00:05:37.810> builds<00:05:38.289> better<00:05:38.439> now<00:05:38.770> I

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
maybe we just know builds better now I

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.879 
maybe we just know builds better now I
don't<00:05:39.610> know<00:05:39.789> what<00:05:39.939> to<00:05:40.029> say<00:05:40.210> but<00:05:40.270> again<00:05:40.900> 5<00:05:41.500> hours
