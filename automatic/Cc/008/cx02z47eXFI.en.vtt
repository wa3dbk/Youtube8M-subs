and for example in this room there's a
very<00:02:40.359> large<00:02:40.629> mirror<00:02:41.079> over<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.620> Draper's<00:02:42.220> table

the scale of the Draper's table is long

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.830 
the scale of the Draper's table is long
but<00:02:45.129> it's<00:02:45.280> really<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.670> piece<00:02:45.879> of<00:02:46.030> junk<00:02:46.269> but<00:02:46.659> the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
but it's really a piece of junk but the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.449 
but it's really a piece of junk but the
way<00:02:47.019> that<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.319> combine<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.889> together<00:02:48.040> with

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
way that you combine it together with

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.699 
way that you combine it together with
the<00:02:48.639> wonderful<00:02:49.120> old<00:02:49.540> mirror<00:02:50.079> above<00:02:50.470> it

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
the wonderful old mirror above it

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.970 
the wonderful old mirror above it
suddenly<00:02:51.489> makes<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.879> look<00:02:52.030> very<00:02:52.239> special<00:02:52.980> this

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
suddenly makes it look very special this

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.159 
suddenly makes it look very special this
is<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.189> newly<00:02:54.549> finished<00:02:55.060> room<00:02:55.329> so<00:02:55.629> I'm<00:02:55.959> as

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.169 
is a newly finished room so I'm as

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.679 
is a newly finished room so I'm as
curious<00:02:56.680> about<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.430> as<00:02:57.609> anybody<00:02:58.030> else<00:02:58.239> but<00:02:58.569> it

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
curious about it as anybody else but it

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.559 
curious about it as anybody else but it
already<00:02:58.959> has<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.319> feel<00:02:59.739> of<00:03:00.040> somewhere<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:01.030> has

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
already has a feel of somewhere that has

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.479 
already has a feel of somewhere that has
evolved<00:03:02.319> but<00:03:02.500> hasn't<00:03:02.919> just<00:03:03.069> come<00:03:03.310> in

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
evolved but hasn't just come in

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.220 
evolved but hasn't just come in
overnight<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.239> I<00:03:04.329> think<00:03:04.599> that's<00:03:04.840> one<00:03:05.049> of<00:03:05.079> the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
overnight and I think that's one of the

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.229 
overnight and I think that's one of the
secrets<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.799> interior<00:03:06.220> design<00:03:06.489> not<00:03:06.879> to<00:03:07.060> make

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
secrets of interior design not to make

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.819 
secrets of interior design not to make
it<00:03:07.419> look<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.810> fresh<00:03:08.139> in<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.650> you're

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
it look so fresh in you that you're

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.890 
it look so fresh in you that you're
scared<00:03:09.189> to<00:03:09.430> take<00:03:09.609> one<00:03:09.879> step<00:03:10.239> in<00:03:10.389> the<00:03:10.510> room<00:03:10.659> let

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
scared to take one step in the room let

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.589 
scared to take one step in the room let
alone<00:03:11.109> mess<00:03:11.530> up<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:11.829> cushion<00:03:12.010> what<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:12.970> love<00:03:13.389> is

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
alone mess up a cushion what I love is

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.240 
alone mess up a cushion what I love is
to<00:03:13.780> actually<00:03:13.930> mix<00:03:14.500> all<00:03:14.769> these<00:03:14.919> things

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
to actually mix all these things

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.580 
to actually mix all these things
together<00:03:15.549> and<00:03:16.060> make<00:03:16.150> them<00:03:16.989> into<00:03:17.260> something

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
together and make them into something

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.339 
together and make them into something
special<00:03:18.120> it's<00:03:19.120> really<00:03:19.449> about<00:03:19.629> function<00:03:20.169> and

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
special it's really about function and

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.890 
special it's really about function and
form<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.919> scale<00:03:21.549> and<00:03:21.879> that's<00:03:22.359> something<00:03:22.659> that

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
form and scale and that's something that

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.340 
form and scale and that's something that
you<00:03:23.349> learn<00:03:23.680> over<00:03:24.159> time
