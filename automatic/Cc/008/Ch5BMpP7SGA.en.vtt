00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
alright that looks pretty good at spread

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.990 
alright that looks pretty good at spread
out<00:02:38.300> some<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:39.340> shine<00:02:40.340> back<00:02:40.610> it's<00:02:40.940> still

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
out some of the shine back it's still

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.360 
out some of the shine back it's still
got<00:02:41.270> some<00:02:41.410> satiny<00:02:42.410> areas<00:02:42.800> which<00:02:43.010> is<00:02:43.130> really

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
got some satiny areas which is really

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.910 
got some satiny areas which is really
good<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:44.110> now<00:02:45.110> we're<00:02:45.260> gonna<00:02:45.410> hit<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.680> back

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
good and now we're gonna hit the back

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.940 
good and now we're gonna hit the back
and<00:02:46.790> then<00:02:47.690> we'll<00:02:47.900> probably<00:02:48.500> have<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.770> do<00:02:48.860> the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
and then we'll probably have to do the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.090 
and then we'll probably have to do the
sides<00:02:49.250> my<00:02:49.700> hand
