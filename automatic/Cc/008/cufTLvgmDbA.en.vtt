muskie<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.829> I've<00:00:37.980> heard<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:38.610> muskies

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
muskie and I've heard that with muskies

two<00:00:39.390> percent<00:00:39.810> of<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.960> anglers<00:00:40.380> catch

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
two percent of the anglers catch

two percent of the anglers catch
ninety-eight<00:00:41.610> percent<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.149> fish<00:00:42.530> so<00:00:43.530> I

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
ninety-eight percent of the fish so I

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.200 
ninety-eight percent of the fish so I
figured<00:00:43.920> if<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.130> really<00:00:44.489> wanted<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.790> catch<00:00:44.940> one

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.000 
figured if I really wanted to catch one
I<00:00:45.239> should<00:00:45.450> hook<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:46.050> with<00:00:46.290> one<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.500> those<00:00:46.680> two

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
I should hook up with one of those two

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.569 
I should hook up with one of those two
percent<00:00:47.540> so<00:00:48.540> my<00:00:48.690> fishing<00:00:49.050> partner<00:00:49.350> Jean<00:00:50.010> Colin
