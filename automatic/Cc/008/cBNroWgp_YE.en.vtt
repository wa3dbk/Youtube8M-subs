when<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.540> world<00:01:39.840> did<00:01:40.619> not<00:01:40.650> end<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:42.380> defiance

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
when the world did not end in defiance

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
of all the doomsday prophecy and going

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.120 
of all the doomsday prophecy and going
on<00:01:45.659> which<00:01:45.869> i<00:01:46.020> think<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.439> load<00:01:46.680> of
