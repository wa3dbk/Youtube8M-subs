lock the screen and we could access

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.640 
lock the screen and we could access
weather<00:00:38.620> through<00:00:39.010> here<00:00:39.250> if<00:00:39.340> we<00:00:39.490> have<00:00:40.150> a<00:00:40.650> link

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
weather through here if we have a link

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.670 
weather through here if we have a link
with<00:00:41.890> our<00:00:41.920> cellphone<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:44.020> that's<00:00:44.230> one<00:00:44.500> way<00:00:44.650> of

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
with our cellphone so that's one way of

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.310 
with our cellphone so that's one way of
accessing<00:00:45.280> those<00:00:45.700> settings<00:00:46.450> the<00:00:46.870> other<00:00:47.080> way

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
accessing those settings the other way

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.680 
accessing those settings the other way
is<00:00:47.500> through<00:00:47.740> the<00:00:47.920> tools<00:00:48.250> icon<00:00:48.760> down<00:00:49.240> here<00:00:49.300> in

is through the tools icon down here in

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.170 
is through the tools icon down here in
them<00:00:49.810> into<00:00:50.290> system<00:00:50.920> then<00:00:51.430> we<00:00:51.550> have<00:00:51.580> display

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
them into system then we have display

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.300 
them into system then we have display
when<00:00:52.900> we<00:00:53.020> go<00:00:53.170> into<00:00:53.380> here<00:00:53.650> we<00:00:53.770> have<00:00:53.950> slightly

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
when we go into here we have slightly

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.730 
when we go into here we have slightly
different<00:00:54.930> options<00:00:55.930> we<00:00:56.200> still<00:00:56.560> have<00:00:56.710> our

backlight timeout option here you can
change<00:01:01.930> that<00:01:02.170> up<00:01:02.380> to<00:01:02.530> two<00:01:02.740> minutes<00:01:03.010> or<00:01:03.460> have<00:01:03.940> it

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
change that up to two minutes or have it

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.850 
change that up to two minutes or have it
always<00:01:04.299> stay<00:01:04.659> on<00:01:04.839> of<00:01:05.079> course<00:01:05.320> you<00:01:05.530> want<00:01:05.680> it<00:01:05.770> to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
always stay on of course you want it to

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.370 
always stay on of course you want it to

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
timeout to save some battery life we

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.910 
timeout to save some battery life we
have<00:01:11.680> our<00:01:12.040> color<00:01:12.550> mode<00:01:13.500> right<00:01:14.500> now<00:01:14.650> I<00:01:14.710> have<00:01:14.890> it

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
have our color mode right now I have it

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.920 
have our color mode right now I have it
set<00:01:15.040> to<00:01:15.220> auto<00:01:15.490> or<00:01:15.940> you<00:01:16.330> can<00:01:16.480> have<00:01:16.630> it<00:01:16.659> in

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
set to auto or you can have it in

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.510 
set to auto or you can have it in
daytime<00:01:17.409> or<00:01:17.620> nighttime<00:01:18.040> and<00:01:18.310> what<00:01:18.400> the

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
daytime or nighttime and what the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.980 
daytime or nighttime and what the
difference<00:01:18.880> is<00:01:19.060> daytime<00:01:19.479> is<00:01:19.659> a<00:01:19.720> little

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
difference is daytime is a little

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.399 
difference is daytime is a little
brighter<00:01:20.650> and<00:01:21.040> nighttime<00:01:21.700> uses<00:01:22.630> more<00:01:22.870> darker

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
brighter and nighttime uses more darker

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.960 
brighter and nighttime uses more darker
colors<00:01:23.740> like<00:01:23.860> black<00:01:24.370> so<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:24.820> get<00:01:24.970> less<00:01:25.180> glare

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
colors like black so you get less glare

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.240 
colors like black so you get less glare
we<00:01:27.970> have<00:01:28.210> our<00:01:28.510> screen<00:01:29.110> captured<00:01:29.890> we<00:01:30.100> could

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
we have our screen captured we could

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.860 
we have our screen captured we could
turn<00:01:30.370> that<00:01:30.460> on<00:01:30.729> or<00:01:30.880> off<00:01:30.909> and<00:01:31.360> that<00:01:31.450> allows<00:01:31.840> us

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
turn that on or off and that allows us

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.960 
turn that on or off and that allows us
to<00:01:32.140> take<00:01:32.470> pictures<00:01:32.979> of<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.280> screens<00:01:33.610> we're<00:01:33.850> on

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
to take pictures of the screens we're on

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.690 
to take pictures of the screens we're on
so<00:01:34.659> if<00:01:34.840> I<00:01:34.960> hit<00:01:35.110> on<00:01:35.320> it's<00:01:36.220> going<00:01:36.370> to<00:01:36.460> give<00:01:36.549> me<00:01:36.580> a

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
so if I hit on it's going to give me a

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.110 
so if I hit on it's going to give me a
little<00:01:37.799> information<00:01:38.799> on<00:01:39.190> how<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.490> use<00:01:39.760> it<00:01:39.940> so

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
little information on how to use it so

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.700 
little information on how to use it so
we<00:01:40.150> just<00:01:40.450> press<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.870> power<00:01:41.049> key<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.530> do<00:01:41.680> a

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
we just press the power key to do a

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.600 
we just press the power key to do a
screen<00:01:42.400> shot<00:01:44.010> so<00:01:45.010> I'm<00:01:45.100> going<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.310> turn<00:01:45.430> that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
screen shot so I'm going to turn that

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.910 
screen shot so I'm going to turn that
off<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:47.610> last<00:01:48.610> we<00:01:48.790> have<00:01:48.820> calibrate<00:01:49.750> screen<00:01:50.409> so

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
off and last we have calibrate screen so

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.140 
off and last we have calibrate screen so
we're<00:01:51.010> going<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.159> select<00:01:51.369> this<00:01:51.549> to<00:01:51.729> begin<00:01:52.000> then

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
we're going to select this to begin then

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.320 
we're going to select this to begin then
we're<00:01:52.240> going<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.390> chase<00:01:52.720> dots<00:01:53.080> and<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:55.180> want

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
we're going to chase dots and you want

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.810 
we're going to chase dots and you want
to<00:01:55.390> be<00:01:55.540> as<00:01:55.659> accurate<00:01:55.900> as<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.380> can<00:01:56.650> when<00:01:57.400> doing

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
to be as accurate as you can when doing

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.280 
to be as accurate as you can when doing
this<00:01:59.369> maybe<00:02:00.369> use<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.670> stylus<00:02:01.479> or<00:02:01.810> something

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
this maybe use a stylus or something

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.140 
this maybe use a stylus or something
with<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.439> fine<00:02:03.040> tip<00:02:03.490> that's<00:02:03.790> not<00:02:03.939> going<00:02:04.090> to

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
with a fine tip that's not going to

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.330 
with a fine tip that's not going to
wreck<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.750> screen<00:02:05.080> so<00:02:05.650> you<00:02:05.740> get<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.189> best

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
wreck the screen so you get the best

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.499 
wreck the screen so you get the best
accuracy<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:09.340> was<00:02:09.489> a<00:02:09.519> quick<00:02:09.759> look<00:02:10.060> at<00:02:10.269> the

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
accuracy that was a quick look at the

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.410 
accuracy that was a quick look at the
display<00:02:11.020> settings<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.830> your<00:02:11.980> Garmin<00:02:12.520> Edge<00:02:12.640> 810
