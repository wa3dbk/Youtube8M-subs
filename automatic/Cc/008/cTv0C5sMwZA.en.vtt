paper and so for someone else it might
be<00:00:52.230> best<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.789> online<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.110> know

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
be best to do it online or like you know

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.260 
be best to do it online or like you know
digitally<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.760> an<00:00:56.850> app<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.090> my<00:00:57.149> phone

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270

digitally and I have an app on my phone
called<00:00:57.629> StudyBlue<00:00:58.199> I've<00:00:58.469> never<00:00:58.739> used<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.280> but

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
called StudyBlue I've never used it but

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.130 
called StudyBlue I've never used it but
I<00:00:59.550> know<00:00:59.640> people<00:00:59.760> make<00:01:00.180> flashcards<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.930> there

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
I know people make flashcards on there

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.860 
I know people make flashcards on there
so<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.320> might<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.680> useful<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.129> some<00:01:02.489> people

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
so that might be useful for some people

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.810 
so that might be useful for some people
so<00:01:03.870> what<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.260> with<00:01:04.619> notebook<00:01:05.010> paper<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.519> I

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
so what I do with notebook paper is I

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.210 
so what I do with notebook paper is I
write<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.659> combining<00:01:07.200> form<00:01:07.439> or<00:01:07.650> prefix<00:01:08.070> or

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
write the combining form or prefix or

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.710 
write the combining form or prefix or
suffix<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> very<00:01:09.030> left<00:01:09.210> side<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
suffix on the very left side of the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.310 
suffix on the very left side of the
paper<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:11.390> then<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> right<00:01:12.869> side<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
paper and then on the right side of the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.590 
paper and then on the right side of the
paper<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.979> write<00:01:14.580> what<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.030> means<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.869> meaning

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
paper I write what it means the meaning

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.240 
paper I write what it means the meaning
so<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:19.950> probably

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
so I do this so that you can probably

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.789 
so I do this so that you can probably
see<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.299> fold<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.930> half<00:01:21.960> when<00:01:22.470> I'm<00:01:22.560> doing

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
see I can fold it in half when I'm doing

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.210 
see I can fold it in half when I'm doing
self<00:01:23.100> studying<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.500> first<00:01:25.770> step<00:01:26.009> is

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
self studying so the first step is

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.520 
self studying so the first step is
transferring<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.330> paper<00:01:27.570> or<00:01:27.720> flashcards

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
transferring to paper or flashcards

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.249 
transferring to paper or flashcards
whatever's<00:01:28.890> best<00:01:29.159> for<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.570> these

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
whatever's best for you and then these

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.230 
whatever's best for you and then these
steps<00:01:31.590> 2<00:01:31.829> &amp;<00:01:31.860> 3<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.280> kind<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.640> mixed<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.030> or

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
steps 2 &amp; 3 can kind of be mixed up or

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.690 
steps 2 &amp; 3 can kind of be mixed up or
mixed<00:01:33.509> matched<00:01:33.689> or<00:01:34.049> whatever<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.950> what<00:01:35.670> I

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
mixed matched or whatever so what I

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.149 
mixed matched or whatever so what I
usually<00:01:36.030> do<00:01:36.360> next<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.320> Nate<00:01:37.560> quiz<00:01:37.920> me

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
usually do next is I have Nate quiz me

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.050 
usually do next is I have Nate quiz me
over<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.909> next<00:01:38.939> few<00:01:39.479> days<00:01:39.659> um<00:01:40.759> I've<00:01:41.759> seen<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
over the next few days um I've seen a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.789 
over the next few days um I've seen a
lot<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.299> these<00:01:42.509> terms<00:01:42.750> multiple<00:01:43.170> times<00:01:43.409> that's

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
lot of these terms multiple times that's

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.649 
lot of these terms multiple times that's
why<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.040> kind<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.729> jump<00:01:45.000> into<00:01:45.210> him

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
why I kind of just jump into him

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.260 
why I kind of just jump into him
quizzing<00:01:46.110> me<00:01:46.229> but<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.430> might<00:01:47.700> be<00:01:47.880> best<00:01:48.090> if

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
quizzing me but it might be best if

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.730 
quizzing me but it might be best if
you've<00:01:48.390> never<00:01:48.509> seen<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> terms<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.320> look<00:01:49.470> over

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
you've never seen the terms to look over

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.289 
you've never seen the terms to look over
them<00:01:49.890> at<00:01:50.040> least<00:01:50.189> once<00:01:50.460> or<00:01:50.579> twice<00:01:50.640> before<00:01:51.000> you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
them at least once or twice before you

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.980 
them at least once or twice before you
pair<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:52.079> someone<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.820> then<00:01:54.090> next<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.869> me

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
pair with someone so then next for me

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.160 
pair with someone so then next for me
step<00:01:55.290> number<00:01:55.409> three<00:01:55.710> for<00:01:55.950> me<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.340> usually<00:01:57.170> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
step number three for me is usually the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.440 
step number three for me is usually the
self<00:01:58.439> study<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> will<00:01:59.280> fold<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.850> half<00:01:59.880> and

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
self study so I will fold it in half and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.690 
self study so I will fold it in half and
try<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.689> produce<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.979> my<00:02:02.009> mind<00:02:02.340> or<00:02:02.549> out<00:02:02.670> loud

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
try to produce in my mind or out loud

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.510 
try to produce in my mind or out loud
what<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> other<00:02:03.630> side<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.250> really

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
what is on the other side so that really

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.240 
what is on the other side so that really
helps<00:02:06.110> because<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.590> will<00:02:07.860> go<00:02:08.009> by<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
helps because I will go by the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.790 
helps because I will go by the
highlighted<00:02:08.819> ones<00:02:09.209> which<00:02:09.869> Nate<00:02:10.140> will<00:02:10.349> mark<00:02:10.530> or

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
highlighted ones which Nate will mark or

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.460 
highlighted ones which Nate will mark or
myself<00:02:10.979> will<00:02:11.340> mark<00:02:11.610> if<00:02:12.000> I'm

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
myself will mark if I'm

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.870 
myself will mark if I'm
getting<00:02:12.770> them<00:02:12.920> wrong<00:02:13.100> or<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:13.340> just<00:02:13.580> cannot

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
getting them wrong or I just cannot

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.070 
getting them wrong or I just cannot
think<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.500> after<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.530> few<00:02:16.010> times<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.490> just

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
think of it after a few times of just

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.600 
think of it after a few times of just
talking<00:02:18.080> through<00:02:18.290> them<00:02:18.560> if<00:02:18.800> I<00:02:18.890> cannot<00:02:19.220> get<00:02:19.490> it

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
talking through them if I cannot get it

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.490 
talking through them if I cannot get it
still<00:02:19.880> I'll<00:02:20.060> highlight<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.410> know

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
still I'll highlight it so that I know

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.870 
still I'll highlight it so that I know
those<00:02:21.860> are<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.040> ones<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.490> pay<00:02:22.670> attention<00:02:23.150> to

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
those are the ones to pay attention to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.180 
those are the ones to pay attention to
so<00:02:25.880> then<00:02:26.060> step<00:02:26.330> number<00:02:26.510> four<00:02:26.870> already<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.470> we

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
so then step number four already is we

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.810 
so then step number four already is we
actually<00:02:28.400> have<00:02:28.700> two<00:02:29.240> there's<00:02:29.960> two<00:02:30.700> types<00:02:31.700> of

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
actually have two there's two types of

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.370 
actually have two there's two types of
questions<00:02:32.210> on<00:02:32.360> our<00:02:32.390> quizzes<00:02:32.870> there's<00:02:33.110> ones

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
questions on our quizzes there's ones

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.690 
questions on our quizzes there's ones
that<00:02:33.620> are<00:02:33.710> multiple-choice<00:02:34.070> where<00:02:34.490> we<00:02:34.580> have

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
that are multiple-choice where we have

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.280 
that are multiple-choice where we have
to<00:02:34.850> select<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.270> right<00:02:35.390> answer<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.900> words<00:02:36.110> are

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
to select the right answer the words are

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.840 
to select the right answer the words are
already<00:02:36.650> formed<00:02:36.950> for<00:02:37.190> us<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.550> that's<00:02:37.670> pretty

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
already formed for us and that's pretty

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.980 
already formed for us and that's pretty
easy<00:02:38.260> but<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.440> last<00:02:39.650> part<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:40.580> um<00:02:43.990> formulating

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
easy but the last part is um formulating

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.970 
easy but the last part is um formulating
the<00:02:45.080> word<00:02:45.290> yourself

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
the word yourself

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.460 
the word yourself
so<00:02:46.700> like<00:02:47.470> nocturia<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.980> would<00:02:49.730> have<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:50.470> like

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
so like nocturia I would have to like

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.960 
so like nocturia I would have to like
she<00:02:51.680> would<00:02:51.860> say<00:02:53.320> give<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.500> term<00:02:54.830> for<00:02:55.370> when<00:02:55.670> you

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
she would say give the term for when you

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.280 
she would say give the term for when you
are<00:02:57.610> voluntarily<00:02:58.610> using<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.630> restroom<00:03:00.140> at

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
are voluntarily using the restroom at

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.170 
are voluntarily using the restroom at

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
the evening not evening night then I

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.910 
the evening not evening night then I

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
would have to produce the term nocturia

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.580 
would have to produce the term nocturia
so<00:03:10.090> because<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.390> have<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.720> produce<00:03:11.900> terms<00:03:12.380> like

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
so because I have to produce terms like

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.830 
so because I have to produce terms like
that<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.400> may<00:03:13.550> not<00:03:13.700> even<00:03:13.880> seen<00:03:14.510> one<00:03:14.720> of

put that in a word our medical book has
words<00:03:21.440> already<00:03:21.920> formed<00:03:22.310> with<00:03:22.459> just<00:03:22.670> examples

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
words already formed with just examples

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.990 
words already formed with just examples
so<00:03:23.660> then<00:03:23.810> what<00:03:24.019> I<00:03:24.050> do<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.620> day<00:03:24.769> before<00:03:25.190> or<00:03:25.760> the
