00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
collectively coming together as a group

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.020 
collectively coming together as a group
I<00:02:13.510> believe<00:02:14.200> this<00:02:14.350> is<00:02:14.410> our<00:02:14.770> eighth<00:02:15.340> show<00:02:15.730> as<00:02:16.000> a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
I believe this is our eighth show as a

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.160 
I believe this is our eighth show as a
band<00:02:16.570> so<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.980> mean<00:02:18.820> we<00:02:19.420> still<00:02:19.600> have<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.750> long<00:02:19.900> way

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
band so I mean we still have a long way

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.420 
band so I mean we still have a long way
to<00:02:20.200> go<00:02:20.440> but<00:02:20.680> people<00:02:20.980> think<00:02:21.130> we've<00:02:21.310> been

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
to go but people think we've been

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.430 
to go but people think we've been
playing<00:02:21.610> together<00:02:21.790> for<00:02:21.970> five<00:02:22.330> years<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:23.290> it's

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
playing together for five years so it's

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.229
