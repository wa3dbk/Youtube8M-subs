officially<00:00:12.929> well<00:00:13.710> I'm<00:00:13.889> using<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.250> adapter

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
officially well I'm using this adapter

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.090 
officially well I'm using this adapter
called<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.000> cronusmax<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.650> basically

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
called the cronusmax and it basically

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.790 
called the cronusmax and it basically
allows<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.640> use<00:00:17.910> any<00:00:18.119> controller<00:00:18.930> like<00:00:19.619> on

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
allows you to use any controller like on

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.849 
allows you to use any controller like on
any<00:00:19.920> other<00:00:20.510> platforms<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:21.720> I'll<00:00:21.840> say<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.740> have

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
any other platforms so I'll say you have

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.580 
any other platforms so I'll say you have
this<00:00:23.039> Xbox<00:00:23.490> one<00:00:23.699> wheel<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.930> could<00:00:25.199> use<00:00:25.380> this

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
this Xbox one wheel and I could use this

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.109 
this Xbox one wheel and I could use this
on<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:26.430> say<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.849> piece<00:00:27.090> for<00:00:27.359> Wii<00:00:27.810> U<00:00:28.109> Xbox<00:00:29.119> 360

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
on on say the piece for Wii U Xbox 360

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.299 
on on say the piece for Wii U Xbox 360
pretty<00:00:30.359> much<00:00:30.510> anything<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.890> same<00:00:32.070> goes

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
pretty much anything and the same goes

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.100 
pretty much anything and the same goes
with<00:00:32.489> ps4<00:00:32.850> controllers<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.630> could<00:00:33.780> use<00:00:33.930> them

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
with ps4 controllers you could use them

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.250 
with ps4 controllers you could use them
on<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.350> Xbox<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:34.829> or<00:00:34.980> Wii<00:00:35.250> U<00:00:35.489> or<00:00:36.030> Xbox<00:00:36.660> 360

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
on the Xbox one or Wii U or Xbox 360

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.830 
on the Xbox one or Wii U or Xbox 360
yeah<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:38.430> yeah<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:39.450> really<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:39.780> a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
yeah so it's yeah it's really it's a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.209 
yeah so it's yeah it's really it's a
really<00:00:39.870> good<00:00:40.170> adapter<00:00:40.590> works<00:00:40.829> really<00:00:41.010> good

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
really good adapter works really good

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.010 
really good adapter works really good
and<00:00:42.050> not<00:00:43.050> only<00:00:43.110> problem<00:00:43.530> with<00:00:43.649> wheels<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.250> that

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
and not only problem with wheels is that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.360 
and not only problem with wheels is that
basically<00:00:46.020> when<00:00:46.410> uses<00:00:46.800> adapt<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> game

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
basically when uses adapt to the game

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.330 
basically when uses adapt to the game
recognize<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.329> wheel<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> controller<00:00:49.340> so

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
recognize the wheel as a controller so

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.400 
recognize the wheel as a controller so
you<00:00:50.399> won't<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.090> any<00:00:51.329> force<00:00:51.660> feedback<00:00:51.899> and

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
you won't have any force feedback and

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.400 
you won't have any force feedback and
like<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.579> sounds<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
like the that that sounds and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.369 
like the that that sounds and
sensitivity<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> kind<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.800> messed<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.360> but<00:00:57.379> yeah

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
sensitivity a kind of messed up but yeah

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.229 
sensitivity a kind of messed up but yeah
I<00:00:58.410> still<00:00:59.100> think<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.489> better<00:00:59.670> than<00:00:59.879> using<00:01:00.180> a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
I still think it's better than using a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.490 
I still think it's better than using a
controller<00:01:00.690> though<00:01:00.930> because<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.289> absolutely

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
controller though because I absolutely

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.039 
controller though because I absolutely
hate<00:01:02.100> using<00:01:02.430> controllers<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.180> driving<00:01:03.840> games

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
hate using controllers on driving games

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.890 
hate using controllers on driving games
and<00:01:04.769> say<00:01:05.700> I'm<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:05.909> gonna<00:01:06.180> start<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> race<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and say I'm just gonna start a race and

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.310 
and say I'm just gonna start a race and
show<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.590> some<00:01:07.740> driving<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.960> tell<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.080> some

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
show you some driving and tell you some

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.560 
show you some driving and tell you some
more<00:01:10.590> about<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.549> problems<00:01:11.970> with<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.299> with

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
more about the problems with this with

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.219 
more about the problems with this with
this<00:01:12.720> wheel<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.530> ps4<00:01:14.509> class<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.840> has<00:01:15.930> quite

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
this wheel on the ps4 class it has quite

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.440 
this wheel on the ps4 class it has quite
a<00:01:16.259> lot<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.590> problems<00:01:16.979> actually<00:01:19.640> okay<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.700> yeah

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
a lot of problems actually okay so yeah

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.999 
a lot of problems actually okay so yeah
it<00:01:21.659> doesn't<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.049> doesn't<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.710> clutch

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
it doesn't have doesn't have a clutch

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.899 
it doesn't have doesn't have a clutch
feature<00:01:23.280> either<00:01:23.549> because<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.299> using<00:01:24.630> am

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
feature either because it's using am

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.249 
feature either because it's using am
because<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.090> recognized<00:01:27.689> as<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.840> controller

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
because it's recognized as a controller

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.020 
because it's recognized as a controller
so<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.950> then<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.280> game<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.579> cannot<00:01:29.820> set

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so and then this game you cannot set

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.819 
so and then this game you cannot set
like<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> button<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.079> wheel<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
like a button on the wheel on the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.190 
like a button on the wheel on the
controller<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.430> use<00:01:32.670> as<00:01:32.850> clutch<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.930> yeah<00:01:34.140> you

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
controller to use as clutch so yeah you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.780 
controller to use as clutch so yeah you
cannot<00:01:34.439> map<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> clutch<00:01:35.040> pedal<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.579> like<00:01:35.759> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
cannot map the clutch pedal to like a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.350 
cannot map the clutch pedal to like a
button<00:01:36.090> either<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:37.880> yeah<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> same<00:01:39.150> goes<00:01:39.329> for

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
button either and yeah the same goes for

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.690 
button either and yeah the same goes for
H<00:01:39.689> shifter<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.350> can't<00:01:40.530> use<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.799> either<00:01:41.040> you

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
H shifter you can't use that either you

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.950 
H shifter you can't use that either you
were<00:01:41.759> probably<00:01:41.970> able<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.299> use<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> sequential

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
were probably able to use a sequential

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
were probably able to use a sequential
chef<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.470> though<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.310> HF<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.329> now

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.350 

and<00:01:51.980> as<00:01:52.190> you<00:01:52.280> can<00:01:52.370> see<00:01:52.430> I'm<00:01:52.700> using<00:01:52.730> a<00:01:53.060> fairly

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
and as you can see I'm using a fairly

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.350 
and as you can see I'm using a fairly
low<00:01:53.900> of<00:01:54.140> like<00:01:54.860> degrees<00:01:55.340> on<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.610> wheel<00:01:55.790> only

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
low of like degrees on the wheel only

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.680 
low of like degrees on the wheel only
only<00:01:56.930> 180<00:01:57.860> degrees<00:01:58.280> which<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:58.850> 90<00:01:59.210> degrees<00:01:59.540> to

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
only 180 degrees which is 90 degrees to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.710 
only 180 degrees which is 90 degrees to
the<00:01:59.720> left<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.350> 90<00:02:01.010> degrees<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.580> right

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
the left and 90 degrees to the right

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.480 
the left and 90 degrees to the right
because<00:02:02.720> if<00:02:03.020> you<00:02:03.200> use<00:02:03.350> more<00:02:03.620> than<00:02:03.770> that<00:02:03.950> you

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
because if you use more than that you

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.000 
because if you use more than that you
would<00:02:04.640> just<00:02:04.790> have<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.000> turn<00:02:05.270> way<00:02:06.200> too<00:02:06.260> much<00:02:06.740> to

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
would just have to turn way too much to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.040 
would just have to turn way too much to
make<00:02:07.190> like<00:02:07.400> a<00:02:07.430> slight<00:02:07.790> turn<00:02:08.060> like<00:02:08.570> on<00:02:08.899> this

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
make like a slight turn like on this

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.359 
make like a slight turn like on this
road<00:02:09.260> for<00:02:09.290> example<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.920> would<00:02:10.040> have<00:02:10.130> still

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
road for example you would have still

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.310 
road for example you would have still
like<00:02:10.550> ball<00:02:10.790> away<00:02:10.940> like<00:02:11.210> that<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.930> actually

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
like ball away like that to actually

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.790 
like ball away like that to actually
move<00:02:12.710> a<00:02:12.920> little<00:02:13.070> bit<00:02:16.510> but<00:02:17.510> yeah<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:18.020> still<00:02:18.650> think

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
move a little bit but yeah I still think

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.410 
move a little bit but yeah I still think
it's<00:02:18.920> battling<00:02:19.280> using<00:02:19.550> control<00:02:19.940> up<00:02:20.120> because

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
it's battling using control up because

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.810 
it's battling using control up because
this<00:02:20.660> yeah<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.380> just<00:02:21.650> hate<00:02:21.770> driving<00:02:22.040> which

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
this yeah I just hate driving which

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.960 
this yeah I just hate driving which
controls<00:02:23.240> on<00:02:23.420> games

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.020 

and<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.870> delay<00:02:30.170> between<00:02:30.460> my<00:02:31.460> wheel<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:31.940> the

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
and the delay between my wheel and the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.510 
and the delay between my wheel and the
screen<00:02:32.330> isn't<00:02:32.660> isn't<00:02:32.960> too<00:02:33.200> bad<00:02:33.400> it's<00:02:34.400> pretty

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
screen isn't isn't too bad it's pretty

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.190 
screen isn't isn't too bad it's pretty
much<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.790> same<00:02:34.970> as<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.240> Xbox<00:02:35.600> one<00:02:35.780> actually

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
much the same as the Xbox one actually

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.600 
much the same as the Xbox one actually
auction<00:02:36.710> that<00:02:36.830> was<00:02:36.950> about<00:02:37.160> turn<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:40.040> yeah<00:02:40.280> that

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
auction that was about turn so yeah that

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.870 
auction that was about turn so yeah that
that<00:02:40.730> isn't<00:02:41.030> too<00:02:41.150> bad<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:42.310> don't<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.460> don't

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
that isn't too bad and don't you don't

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.030 
that isn't too bad and don't you don't
you<00:02:44.060> don't<00:02:44.600> notice<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.320> at<00:02:45.470> all<00:02:45.590> when<00:02:45.860> you're

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
you don't notice it at all when you're

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.230 
you don't notice it at all when you're
driving<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:47.210> that's<00:02:47.420> good

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.450 

I<00:02:53.410> just<00:02:54.410> wish<00:02:54.650> there<00:02:54.830> was<00:02:54.860> some<00:02:55.160> kind<00:02:55.400> of

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
I just wish there was some kind of

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.460 
I just wish there was some kind of
rumble<00:02:55.880> or<00:02:56.090> voice<00:02:56.510> feedback<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.170> because

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
rumble or voice feedback that I because

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.920 
rumble or voice feedback that I because
it<00:02:57.620> will<00:02:58.070> make<00:02:58.250> this<00:02:58.460> will<00:02:59.240> just<00:02:59.360> make<00:02:59.480> driving

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
it will make this will just make driving

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.780 
it will make this will just make driving
with<00:03:00.170> as<00:03:00.290> we<00:03:00.440> own<00:03:00.590> this<00:03:00.710> game<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.980> lot<00:03:01.220> panel<00:03:01.580> I

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
with as we own this game a lot panel I

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.760 
with as we own this game a lot panel I
think<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:02.690> would<00:03:02.810> be<00:03:02.840> actually<00:03:03.290> able<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.620> get

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
think you would be actually able to get

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.550 
think you would be actually able to get
the<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:05.090> rumble<00:03:05.480> effects<00:03:05.930> but<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.170> forgot<00:03:06.470> to

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
the the rumble effects but I forgot to

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.280 
the the rumble effects but I forgot to
look<00:03:06.710> into<00:03:06.950> that<00:03:07.070> how<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.310> get<00:03:07.580> that<00:03:08.260> but<00:03:09.260> I

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
look into that how to get that but I

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.570 
look into that how to get that but I
think<00:03:09.470> you'll<00:03:09.770> be<00:03:09.830> able<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.040> get<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.310> force

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
think you'll be able to get that force

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.610 
think you'll be able to get that force
beat<00:03:10.760> force<00:03:11.180> feedback<00:03:11.390> is<00:03:11.690> no<00:03:11.870> option<00:03:12.320> because

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
beat force feedback is no option because

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.070 
beat force feedback is no option because
it's<00:03:12.800> yeah<00:03:13.520> basically<00:03:14.060> on<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.690> controller

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
it's yeah basically on the controller

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.290 
it's yeah basically on the controller
layout<00:03:15.620> right<00:03:16.040> now<00:03:16.280> but<00:03:16.640> Rumble<00:03:17.000> effects

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
layout right now but Rumble effects

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.660 
layout right now but Rumble effects
should<00:03:17.450> be<00:03:17.510> possible<00:03:18.140> I<00:03:18.370> just<00:03:19.370> got<00:03:19.490> a<00:03:19.520> look

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
should be possible I just got a look

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.760 
should be possible I just got a look
into<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:21.490> but<00:03:22.490> for<00:03:22.610> now<00:03:22.670> it's<00:03:23.330> good<00:03:24.200> enough<00:03:24.530> I

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
into that but for now it's good enough I

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:41.360 
into that but for now it's good enough I
guess<00:03:25.720> balance

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.850 

I<00:03:41.400> really<00:03:42.090> think<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.959> maps<00:03:43.290> or<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
I really think that the maps or the

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.460 
I really think that the maps or the
tracks<00:03:44.280> on<00:03:44.489> this<00:03:44.580> game<00:03:44.819> are<00:03:45.030> really<00:03:45.060> awesome

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
tracks on this game are really awesome

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.650 
tracks on this game are really awesome
there's<00:03:47.280> all<00:03:47.400> these<00:03:47.519> mounds<00:03:47.849> and<00:03:48.090> roads<00:03:48.360> and

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
there's all these mounds and roads and

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.390 
there's all these mounds and roads and
stuff<00:03:48.989> like<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.349> are<00:03:49.950> sick<00:03:52.400> this

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
stuff like that are sick this

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.430 
stuff like that are sick this
game<00:03:53.670> really<00:03:53.879> reminds<00:03:54.330> me<00:03:54.360> of<00:03:54.480> off<00:03:54.900> project

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
game really reminds me of off project

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.259 
game really reminds me of off project
cultivating<00:03:56.010> for<00:03:56.220> as<00:03:56.340> well<00:03:56.519> because<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.209> has

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
cultivating for as well because it has

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.130 
cultivating for as well because it has
like<00:03:57.599> this<00:03:57.780> song<00:03:57.989> like<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.739> same<00:03:59.069> kind<00:03:59.430> of

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
like this song like the same kind of

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.449 
like this song like the same kind of
vain<00:04:01.140> thing<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.739> stuff<00:04:01.980> like<00:04:02.129> like<00:04:02.310> the

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
vain thing and stuff like like the

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.490 
vain thing and stuff like like the
vector<00:04:02.730> that<00:04:02.940> fries<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.360> stuff<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.810> the

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
vector that fries and stuff and the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.050 
vector that fries and stuff and the
driving<00:04:04.739> feels<00:04:05.099> kind<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.580> same<00:04:05.790> as<00:04:05.910> well

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
driving feels kind of the same as well

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.589 
driving feels kind of the same as well
like<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.360> physics<00:04:07.069> it's<00:04:08.069> not<00:04:08.250> much<00:04:08.400> different

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
like the physics it's not much different

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.150 
like the physics it's not much different
which<00:04:09.599> is<00:04:09.629> a<00:04:09.750> good<00:04:09.989> thing<00:04:10.019> cuz<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.379> like<00:04:10.799> I<00:04:11.010> like

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
which is a good thing cuz I like I like

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.070 
which is a good thing cuz I like I like
I<00:04:11.220> really<00:04:11.459> like<00:04:11.700> project<00:04:12.420> column<00:04:12.629> rating<00:04:12.900> for

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
I really like project column rating for

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
battle though sometimes this game looks

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.310

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
to actually looks better than this my

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199
