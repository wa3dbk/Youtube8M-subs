 want to conquer this title from the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.879
 world as piaui and the classification 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.010
 the other reinforcement is already known 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.289
 black rump the right side 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.629
 lion arrives to give more experience to 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.480
 Each group that you pass the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.090
 until you give more experience in 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.010
 new experience in this Brazilian 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.629
 jack of the parnaíba 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.820
 now is to continue the work 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.920
 here in Flemish is to seek this vacancy in the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.260
 Cup of Brazil so we can 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.030
 have a year that is well ventilated in the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.430
 last Saturday the Flemish went to the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.950
 city ​​of caxias in maranhão play a 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.170
 friendly match and there the coach paulo 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.140
 moroni can evaluate the very good group 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.430
 realize that some players are well 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.189
 below what is required for 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.200
 start the competition on the week and it was good 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.640
 Because I was the type you got to see. 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.189
 characteristics of a player that we 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.350
 I did not know and especially a moment 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.090
 what's the technician paulo ricardo morone 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.470
 made a positive evaluation of the friendly 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.520
 which the Flemish held last Saturday 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.900
 in caxias 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.579
 the Flemish entered the field with the base 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.479
 that disputed the Piauían championship of 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.759
 2013 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.979
 but for the black coach the right one 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.140
 to the base of the champion team so 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.159
 the Flemish today will count on players 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.890
 who played the Piauiense championship 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.110
 wearing the shirt Parnaíba proposal 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.909
 we did with the board to bring 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.990
 players so the flamengo does not 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.000
 start from scratch 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.259
 logically that in two weeks and that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.689
 they are equal 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.890
 but this first week the flamengo had 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.229
 a bit of a disadvantage over the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.290
 adversary 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.570
 eheheheheh these players we arrived not 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.740
 1 the normal striking condition for equal 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.979
 for equal against July 14 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.979
 in person
