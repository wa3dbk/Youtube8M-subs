game I'd like to help you guys to work
on<00:00:47.789> your<00:00:47.969> game<00:00:48.180> now<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> reasons<00:00:49.500> that

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
on your game now one of the reasons that

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.770 
on your game now one of the reasons that
I<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.950> been<00:00:50.430> successful<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.570> golf

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
I have been successful in the golf

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.959 
I have been successful in the golf
instruction<00:00:52.230> field<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.699> wasn't

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
instruction field is that I wasn't

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.880 
instruction field is that I wasn't
actually<00:00:54.480> teaching<00:00:54.870> golf<00:00:55.170> instruction<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.770> was

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
actually teaching golf instruction I was

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.770 
actually teaching golf instruction I was
teaching<00:00:56.340> body<00:00:56.670> movements<00:00:57.180> believe<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.690> or

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
teaching body movements believe that or

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.080 
teaching body movements believe that or
not<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:57.960> I've<00:00:58.260> studied<00:00:58.949> anatomy<00:00:59.550> physiology

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
not so I've studied anatomy physiology

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.139 
not so I've studied anatomy physiology
biomechanics<00:01:01.820> neuroscience<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.059> I

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
biomechanics neuroscience so that I

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.119 
biomechanics neuroscience so that I
could<00:01:03.329> understand<00:01:03.719> exactly<00:01:04.199> how<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.739> body<00:01:05.010> is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
could understand exactly how the body is

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.370 
could understand exactly how the body is
supposed<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.670> move<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.810> help<00:01:07.049> other

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
supposed to move and to help other

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.230 
supposed to move and to help other
people<00:01:07.770> improve<00:01:08.189> their<00:01:08.220> body<00:01:08.580> motions<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
people improve their body motions and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.670 
people improve their body motions and
that's<00:01:09.360> really<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:10.110> we're<00:01:10.229> doing<00:01:10.439> when<00:01:10.560> we're

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
that's really all we're doing when we're

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.560 
that's really all we're doing when we're
playing<00:01:10.830> tennis<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:11.760> we're<00:01:11.880> playing<00:01:12.060> golf<00:01:12.299> or

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
playing tennis or we're playing golf or

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.750 
playing tennis or we're playing golf or
baseball<00:01:13.049> or<00:01:13.080> any<00:01:13.680> other<00:01:13.830> sport<00:01:14.159> we're<00:01:14.549> just

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
baseball or any other sport we're just

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.969 
baseball or any other sport we're just
talking<00:01:15.090> about<00:01:15.210> making<00:01:16.080> body<00:01:16.350> motions<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
talking about making body motions and

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.740 
talking about making body motions and
making<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.250> correct<00:01:17.549> body<00:01:17.700> motions<00:01:18.150> now

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
making the correct body motions now

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.929 
making the correct body motions now
before<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:19.560> start<00:01:19.890> making<00:01:20.460> these<00:01:20.580> correct

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
before we can start making these correct

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.820 
before we can start making these correct
body<00:01:21.090> motions<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.840> understand<00:01:22.229> what

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
body motions we have to understand what

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.200 
body motions we have to understand what
are<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.040> correct<00:01:23.460> motions<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:23.939> that's<00:01:24.060> why

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
are the correct motions and that's why

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.940 
are the correct motions and that's why
over<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.900> last<00:01:24.990> couple<00:01:25.229> years<00:01:25.409> I've<00:01:25.680> really

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
over the last couple years I've really

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.490 
over the last couple years I've really
studied<00:01:26.790> tennis<00:01:27.170> extensively<00:01:28.170> I've<00:01:28.320> studied

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
studied tennis extensively I've studied

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.440 
studied tennis extensively I've studied
all<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> great<00:01:28.890> players<00:01:29.159> players<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:29.909> Roger
