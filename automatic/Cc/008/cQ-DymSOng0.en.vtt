00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
against in here now we've got this other

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.679 
against in here now we've got this other
AR<00:03:14.019> one<00:03:14.230> its<00:03:14.379> return<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.769> second<00:03:15.129> time<00:03:15.480> any<00:03:16.480> on

warrior<00:03:17.079> where<00:03:17.230> did<00:03:17.409> this<00:03:17.530> too<00:03:17.709> so<00:03:17.829> it's<00:03:17.920> not

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
warrior where did this too so it's not

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.160 
warrior where did this too so it's not
like<00:03:18.159> it's<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.340> big<00:03:18.370> deal<00:03:18.549> but<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.360> think<00:03:19.900> it

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
like it's a big deal but I think it

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.210 
like it's a big deal but I think it
might<00:03:20.319> be<00:03:20.349> a<00:03:20.439> concern<00:03:20.709> for<00:03:20.739> people<00:03:20.950> who<00:03:21.129> are

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
might be a concern for people who are

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.410 
might be a concern for people who are
taking<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.549> their<00:03:21.670> first<00:03:21.819> time<00:03:22.060> out<00:03:22.090> there

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
taking it their first time out there

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.910 
taking it their first time out there

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
like oh I'm playing the same thing over

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.470

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
again but the variety actually is pretty

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.160 
again but the variety actually is pretty
