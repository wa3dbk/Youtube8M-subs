so<00:00:10.610> with<00:00:10.850> us<00:00:11.000> mayor<00:00:11.270> we<00:00:11.690> have<00:00:11.990> a<00:00:12.320> she's<00:00:13.130> also<00:00:13.340> in

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:13.640 
so with us mayor we have a she's also in

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.000 
so with us mayor we have a she's also in
rehab<00:00:14.090> you'll<00:00:14.360> see<00:00:14.570> that<00:00:14.780> the<00:00:15.020> right<00:00:15.710> front

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
rehab you'll see that the right front

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.400 
rehab you'll see that the right front
leg<00:00:16.070> is<00:00:16.400> shaved<00:00:16.670> up<00:00:16.940> and<00:00:17.180> you'll<00:00:18.020> notice<00:00:18.260> that

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
leg is shaved up and you'll notice that

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.200 
leg is shaved up and you'll notice that
if<00:00:18.800> you<00:00:18.980> look<00:00:19.160> closely<00:00:19.430> at<00:00:19.700> the<00:00:19.820> heels<00:00:20.029> and

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
if you look closely at the heels and

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.120 
if you look closely at the heels and
we'll<00:00:20.390> show<00:00:20.570> you<00:00:20.600> as<00:00:20.960> we<00:00:20.990> come<00:00:21.350> down<00:00:21.380> work<00:00:21.950> and

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
we'll show you as we come down work and

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.179 
we'll show you as we come down work and
look<00:00:22.279> at<00:00:22.430> this<00:00:22.520> more<00:00:22.760> closely<00:00:22.790> at<00:00:23.360> the<00:00:24.050> heel<00:00:24.380> on

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
look at this more closely at the heel on

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.490 
look at this more closely at the heel on
the<00:00:25.640> left<00:00:26.000> side<00:00:26.270> is<00:00:26.600> closer<00:00:27.020> to<00:00:27.170> the<00:00:27.289> ground

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
the left side is closer to the ground

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.529 
the left side is closer to the ground
and<00:00:27.800> what<00:00:27.920> we're<00:00:28.070> talking<00:00:28.400> about<00:00:28.430> here<00:00:28.610> is<00:00:29.000> the

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
and what we're talking about here is the

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.750 
and what we're talking about here is the
bulbs<00:00:29.900> of<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.110> heel<00:00:30.350> versus<00:00:31.160> where<00:00:31.340> the<00:00:31.490> bulbs

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
bulbs of the heel versus where the bulbs

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.450 
bulbs of the heel versus where the bulbs
of<00:00:31.880> a<00:00:31.970> heel<00:00:32.210> are<00:00:32.390> on<00:00:32.629> the<00:00:32.870> other<00:00:32.989> side<00:00:33.160> so<00:00:34.160> we

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
of a heel are on the other side so we

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.400 
of a heel are on the other side so we
have<00:00:34.670> an<00:00:34.879> asymmetrical<00:00:35.629> heel<00:00:35.900> height<00:00:36.140> and

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
have an asymmetrical heel height and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.580 
have an asymmetrical heel height and
this<00:00:37.250> changes<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:38.090> angle<00:00:38.270> of<00:00:38.750> every<00:00:39.350> joint

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
this changes the angle of every joint

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.020 
this changes the angle of every joint
coming<00:00:40.040> all<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.460> way<00:00:40.489> up<00:00:40.580> through<00:00:40.850> the

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
coming all the way up through the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.410 
coming all the way up through the
shoulder<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:41.690> it<00:00:42.530> causes<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.400> shoulder<00:00:43.909> to

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
shoulder and it causes the shoulder to

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.619 
shoulder and it causes the shoulder to
rotate<00:00:45.019> here<00:00:45.530> open<00:00:46.040> up<00:00:46.129> this<00:00:46.309> angle<00:00:46.790> and<00:00:46.970> that

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
rotate here open up this angle and that

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.750 
rotate here open up this angle and that
causes<00:00:47.960> us<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.350> have<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.949> appearance<00:00:49.280> of<00:00:49.610> his

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
causes us to have the appearance of his

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.689 
causes us to have the appearance of his
shoulder<00:00:50.239> being<00:00:50.570> more<00:00:51.260> bows<00:00:51.530> doubt<00:00:51.890> i<00:00:52.159> will

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
shoulder being more bows doubt i will

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.700 
shoulder being more bows doubt i will
take<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.120> show<00:00:53.330> you<00:00:53.390> from<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:53.839> back<00:00:54.379> side<00:00:54.409> and

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
take and show you from the back side and

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.500 
take and show you from the back side and
you<00:00:55.040> can<00:00:55.159> compare<00:00:55.549> this<00:00:55.760> side<00:00:56.030> with<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.360> other

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
you can compare this side with the other

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.350 
you can compare this side with the other
side<00:00:56.839> quite<00:00:57.110> nicely<00:00:57.409> that<00:00:57.769> way<00:00:57.949> so<00:00:58.729> it<00:00:59.030> really

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
side quite nicely that way so it really

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.689 
side quite nicely that way so it really
doesn't<00:00:59.690> distorts<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.409> entire<00:01:00.920> tracking<00:01:01.549> of

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
doesn't distorts the entire tracking of

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.969 
doesn't distorts the entire tracking of
the<00:01:01.790> horse<00:01:02.000> this<00:01:02.960> is<00:01:03.199> also<00:01:03.589> in<00:01:03.739> this

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
the horse this is also in this

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.250 
the horse this is also in this
particular<00:01:04.190> horses<00:01:04.879> cases<00:01:05.390> associated<00:01:05.870> with

particular horses cases associated with
the<00:01:06.350> fact<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:06.830> this<00:01:07.220> is<00:01:07.430> a<00:01:07.460> right<00:01:07.790> forelimb

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
the fact that this is a right forelimb

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.980 
the fact that this is a right forelimb
dominant<00:01:09.320> horse<00:01:09.619> as<00:01:09.830> part<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.119> laterality

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
dominant horse as part of the laterality

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.650 
dominant horse as part of the laterality
or<00:01:12.530> natural<00:01:13.010> crookedness<00:01:13.369> syndrome<00:01:13.940> that<00:01:14.510> we

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
or natural crookedness syndrome that we

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.450 
or natural crookedness syndrome that we
see<00:01:14.840> essentially<00:01:15.380> in<00:01:15.560> all<00:01:15.680> horses<00:01:16.010> it's<00:01:16.280> more

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
see essentially in all horses it's more

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.580 
see essentially in all horses it's more
pronounced<00:01:16.940> in<00:01:17.000> some<00:01:17.300> than<00:01:17.480> the<00:01:17.600> other<00:01:17.750> but

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
pronounced in some than the other but

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.010 
pronounced in some than the other but
since<00:01:18.950> this<00:01:19.130> is<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:19.370> free<00:01:19.730> leg<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.270> she<00:01:20.870> would

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
since this is a free leg and she would

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.350 
since this is a free leg and she would
spend<00:01:21.200> more<00:01:21.500> time<00:01:21.740> with<00:01:22.010> her<00:01:22.160> leg<00:01:22.820> out<00:01:23.000> and

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
spend more time with her leg out and

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.380 
spend more time with her leg out and
putting<00:01:23.930> on<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.320> heel<00:01:24.620> whereas<00:01:25.490> this<00:01:26.030> right

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
putting on the heel whereas this right

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.570 
putting on the heel whereas this right
front<00:01:26.660> leg<00:01:26.750> is<00:01:27.110> more<00:01:27.470> of<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.620> support<00:01:27.830> leg<00:01:28.340> and

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
front leg is more of a support leg and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.140 
front leg is more of a support leg and
so<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.840> heel<00:01:30.200> does<00:01:30.680> not<00:01:30.860> get<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.580> crushing

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
so the heel does not get the crushing

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.720 
so the heel does not get the crushing
effect<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:32.900> they<00:01:33.080> ballooning<00:01:33.650> out<00:01:33.800> of<00:01:34.070> it<00:01:34.220> so

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
effect and they ballooning out of it so

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.480 
effect and they ballooning out of it so
this<00:01:35.210> heel<00:01:35.420> stays<00:01:35.780> higher<00:01:36.170> now<00:01:37.010> the

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
this heel stays higher now the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.820 
this heel stays higher now the
interesting<00:01:37.760> part<00:01:38.300> of<00:01:38.420> this<00:01:38.540> is<00:01:38.870> that<00:01:39.500> when<00:01:39.800> I

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
interesting part of this is that when I

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.950 
interesting part of this is that when I
look<00:01:40.160> at<00:01:40.280> these<00:01:40.430> horses<00:01:40.940> and<00:01:41.180> I<00:01:41.270> determined

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
look at these horses and I determined

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.790 
look at these horses and I determined
this<00:01:42.440> laterality<00:01:43.190> aspect<00:01:43.730> of<00:01:43.910> it<00:01:44.060> about<00:01:44.800> 75%

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
this laterality aspect of it about 75%

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.370 
this laterality aspect of it about 75%
of<00:01:46.370> the<00:01:46.520> injuries<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.060> we<00:01:47.300> get<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:47.870> check

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
of the injuries that we get to check

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.070 
of the injuries that we get to check
ligaments<00:01:48.980> suspensory<00:01:49.910> ligaments<00:01:50.420> will

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
ligaments suspensory ligaments will

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.370 
ligaments suspensory ligaments will
occur<00:01:51.470> on<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:52.460> dominant<00:01:53.150> limb<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:54.050> one<00:01:54.230> that

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
occur on the dominant limb the one that

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.560 
occur on the dominant limb the one that
is<00:01:54.530> being<00:01:54.740> used<00:01:54.980> for<00:01:55.190> support<00:01:55.730> the<00:01:56.210> one<00:01:56.390> that

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
is being used for support the one that

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.210 
is being used for support the one that
lands<00:01:56.810> with<00:01:57.050> more<00:01:57.260> concussion<00:01:57.890> with<00:01:58.070> each

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
lands with more concussion with each

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.670 
lands with more concussion with each
stride<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:58.940> it's<00:01:59.600> interesting<00:01:59.720> because<00:02:00.260> this

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
stride and it's interesting because this

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.250 
stride and it's interesting because this
matter<00:02:01.130> follows<00:02:01.520> that<00:02:01.640> pattern<00:02:01.720> exactly<00:02:02.720> she

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
matter follows that pattern exactly she

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.740 
matter follows that pattern exactly she
had<00:02:03.470> an<00:02:03.650> injury<00:02:03.980> to<00:02:04.159> a<00:02:04.190> check<00:02:04.520> ligament<00:02:05.000> got

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
had an injury to a check ligament got

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.810 
had an injury to a check ligament got
that<00:02:05.990> fairly<00:02:06.409> well<00:02:06.560> cleared<00:02:06.890> up<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.280> then<00:02:07.550> she

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
that fairly well cleared up and then she

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.600 
that fairly well cleared up and then she
had<00:02:07.970> an<00:02:08.300> injury<00:02:08.659> to<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.989> suspensory<00:02:09.619> so<00:02:10.190> that

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
had an injury to the suspensory so that

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.089 
had an injury to the suspensory so that
all<00:02:10.789> fits<00:02:11.060> together<00:02:11.209> here<00:02:11.720> so<00:02:12.319> if<00:02:12.560> we<00:02:12.739> can<00:02:12.920> get

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
all fits together here so if we can get

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.949 
all fits together here so if we can get
a<00:02:13.310> horse<00:02:13.700> like<00:02:13.909> this<00:02:14.180> again<00:02:14.599> where<00:02:14.840> we

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
a horse like this again where we

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.809 
a horse like this again where we
relieved<00:02:15.379> the<00:02:15.620> muscle<00:02:15.650> T<00:02:16.159> issues<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:16.640> so

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
relieved the muscle T issues and so

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.539 
relieved the muscle T issues and so
forth<00:02:17.120> then<00:02:17.659> we<00:02:17.989> can<00:02:18.200> do<00:02:18.829> a<00:02:18.859> lot<00:02:19.129> toward

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
forth then we can do a lot toward

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.640 
forth then we can do a lot toward
speeding<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.329> healing<00:02:20.569> it's<00:02:21.139> still<00:02:21.439> going

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
speeding up the healing it's still going

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.110 
speeding up the healing it's still going
to<00:02:21.769> take<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.129> rehab<00:02:22.519> period

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
to take the rehab period

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.360 
to take the rehab period
tissue<00:02:23.360> has<00:02:23.599> got<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.959> heal<00:02:24.200> but<00:02:24.890> if<00:02:25.010> we<00:02:25.129> take

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
tissue has got to heal but if we take

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.850 
tissue has got to heal but if we take
the<00:02:25.610> tension<00:02:25.879> off<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.480> muscles<00:02:26.900> then<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
the tension off of the muscles then the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.280 
the tension off of the muscles then the
ligaments<00:02:28.400> check<00:02:28.909> ligament<00:02:29.360> suspensory

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
ligaments check ligament suspensory

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.530 
ligaments check ligament suspensory
ligament<00:02:30.709> have<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.549> better<00:02:31.760> chance<00:02:31.849> of<00:02:32.299> healing

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
ligament have a better chance of healing

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.500 
ligament have a better chance of healing
here<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.650> now<00:02:34.400> whether<00:02:34.879> we've<00:02:35.180> determined

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
here so now whether we've determined

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.449 
here so now whether we've determined
that<00:02:35.720> what<00:02:36.170> we<00:02:36.260> want<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.560> do<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:36.890> have<00:02:37.099> a<00:02:37.159> look

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
that what we want to do is have a look

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.020 
that what we want to do is have a look
over<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.940> top<00:02:38.209> of<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.480> horse<00:02:38.690> here<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.140> see

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
over the top of the horse here and see

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.210 
over the top of the horse here and see
the<00:02:41.030> asymmetry<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.349> have<00:02:42.530> from<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.860> shoulder

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
the asymmetry you have from the shoulder

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.009 
the asymmetry you have from the shoulder
from<00:02:43.370> one<00:02:43.519> side<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.060> other<00:02:44.180> this

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
from one side to the other this

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.110 
from one side to the other this
asymmetry<00:02:45.470> is<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.860> major<00:02:46.069> concern<00:02:46.430> because<00:02:46.970> not

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
asymmetry is a major concern because not

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
asymmetry is a major concern because not
only<00:02:47.150> does<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.319> affect<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:49.220> horse<00:02:50.030> itself<00:02:50.269> but

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
only does it affect the horse itself but

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.509 
only does it affect the horse itself but
it<00:02:51.260> affects<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.650> way<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:51.890> saddle<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.340> going

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
it affects the way the saddle is going

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.130 
it affects the way the saddle is going
to<00:02:52.579> set<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:52.819> on<00:02:52.879> a<00:02:53.000> horse<00:02:53.239> it<00:02:53.780> therefore

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
to set it on a horse it therefore

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.960 
to set it on a horse it therefore
affects<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.890> way<00:02:55.010> that<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.310> rider<00:02:55.549> is<00:02:55.700> going

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
affects the way that the rider is going

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.000 
affects the way that the rider is going
to<00:02:56.060> sit<00:02:56.239> on<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.569> horse<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:57.019> cause<00:02:57.500> twisting

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
to sit on the horse and cause twisting

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.309 
to sit on the horse and cause twisting
and<00:02:58.160> torquing<00:02:58.519> of<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.760> body<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.629> we<00:02:59.989> end<00:03:00.140> up

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
and torquing of the body so we end up

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.130 
and torquing of the body so we end up
with<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.560> whole<00:03:00.799> chain<00:03:01.220> reaction<00:03:01.940> all<00:03:02.180> starting

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
with a whole chain reaction all starting

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.140 
with a whole chain reaction all starting
from<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.739> difference<00:03:04.129> in<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.549> heel<00:03:04.879> heights

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
from the difference in that heel heights

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.199 
from the difference in that heel heights
of<00:03:05.390> these<00:03:05.629> two<00:03:05.900> feet<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:07.640> because<00:03:08.060> the

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
of these two feet so because the

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.140 
of these two feet so because the
shoulder<00:03:08.659> blade<00:03:08.870> has<00:03:09.170> rotated<00:03:09.620> up<00:03:09.950> now<00:03:10.760> this

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
shoulder blade has rotated up now this

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.839 
shoulder blade has rotated up now this
appears<00:03:11.599> to<00:03:11.659> be<00:03:11.780> bigger<00:03:12.140> on<00:03:12.409> this<00:03:12.620> side<00:03:12.890> with

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
appears to be bigger on this side with

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.660 
appears to be bigger on this side with
time<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:15.170> muscles<00:03:15.560> themselves<00:03:15.709> will<00:03:16.280> also

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
time the muscles themselves will also

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.380 
time the muscles themselves will also
enlarge<00:03:17.090> here<00:03:17.450> so<00:03:18.049> on<00:03:18.859> this<00:03:19.099> side<00:03:19.430> you'll<00:03:20.239> be

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
enlarge here so on this side you'll be

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.729 
enlarge here so on this side you'll be
able<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.659> see<00:03:20.840> that<00:03:21.019> there's<00:03:21.230> a<00:03:21.290> little<00:03:21.470> bit<00:03:21.680> of

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
able to see that there's a little bit of

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.890 
able to see that there's a little bit of
dipping<00:03:22.220> down<00:03:22.400> here<00:03:22.879> and<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.569> little<00:03:23.690> bit<00:03:23.870> of

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
dipping down here and a little bit of

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.899 
dipping down here and a little bit of
enlargement<00:03:24.440> here<00:03:24.950> let's<00:03:25.370> see<00:03:25.579> if<00:03:25.670> we<00:03:25.760> can

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
enlargement here let's see if we can

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:27.460 
enlargement here let's see if we can
just<00:03:25.940> ask<00:03:26.209> her<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.599> lower<00:03:26.780> her<00:03:26.840> head<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.290> little

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
just ask her to lower her head a little

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.339 
just ask her to lower her head a little
bit<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:27.919> that<00:03:28.400> will<00:03:28.579> emphasize<00:03:29.090> that<00:03:29.930> just<00:03:30.260> a

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
bit and that will emphasize that just a

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.659 
bit and that will emphasize that just a
little<00:03:30.590> bit<00:03:30.680> as<00:03:30.829> well<00:03:31.010> here<00:03:33.310> alrighty<00:03:34.310> that

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
little bit as well here alrighty that

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.539 
little bit as well here alrighty that
should<00:03:34.910> be<00:03:35.060> quite<00:03:35.269> good<00:03:35.769> okay<00:03:36.769> beautiful

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
should be quite good okay beautiful

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.390 
should be quite good okay beautiful
beautiful<00:03:37.819> there<00:03:38.450> we<00:03:38.599> go<00:03:38.799> so<00:03:39.799> we<00:03:40.160> won't<00:03:40.340> be

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
beautiful there we go so we won't be

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.250 
beautiful there we go so we won't be
able<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.669> hold<00:03:40.790> her<00:03:40.940> in<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.180> position<00:03:41.260> but

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
able to hold her in that position but

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.289 
able to hold her in that position but
that's<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.829> key<00:03:43.069> to<00:03:43.310> what's<00:03:43.489> going<00:03:43.579> on<00:03:43.940> here

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
that's the key to what's going on here

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.440 
that's the key to what's going on here
and<00:03:44.480> so<00:03:45.049> we<00:03:45.290> have<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.560> different<00:03:46.250> degree<00:03:47.090> of

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
and so we have a different degree of

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.900 
and so we have a different degree of
rotation<00:03:47.629> in<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:48.349> scapula<00:03:48.769> from<00:03:49.400> one<00:03:49.639> side

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
rotation in the scapula from one side

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.659
