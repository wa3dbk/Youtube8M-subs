doesn't have a scrolling feel like the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.170 
doesn't have a scrolling feel like the
ipod<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.290> sure<00:01:13.560> looks<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.180> that's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
ipod but it sure looks like it that's

not<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> nice<00:01:15.540> rubberized<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.229> i<00:01:16.290> guess<00:01:16.439> if<00:01:16.590> you

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
not a nice rubberized so i guess if you

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.830 
not a nice rubberized so i guess if you
drop<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.970> not<00:01:18.119> going<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.390> crack<00:01:18.630> or

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
drop it it's not going to crack or

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.270 
drop it it's not going to crack or
scratch<00:01:19.140> right<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.460> not<00:01:20.549> too<00:01:20.729> bad<00:01:20.939> okay

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
scratch right so it's not too bad okay

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.940 
scratch right so it's not too bad okay
but<00:01:23.280> again<00:01:23.549> still<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> very<00:01:24.390> simple<00:01:24.990> display<00:01:25.200> it
