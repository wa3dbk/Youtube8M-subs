00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.840 
kind of annoying so this is without a
doubt<00:01:50.140> better<00:01:50.590> than<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.130> original<00:01:51.700> version

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
doubt better than the original version

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.820 
doubt better than the original version
if<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.780> haven't<00:01:52.990> seen<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.229> original<00:01:53.260> click

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
if you haven't seen the original click

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.920 
if you haven't seen the original click
right<00:01:54.040> here<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.570> even<00:01:55.570> though<00:01:55.660> it<00:01:55.750> doesn't

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
right here and even though it doesn't

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.660 
right here and even though it doesn't
cover<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.260> whole<00:01:56.350> head<00:01:56.710> this<00:01:57.220> is<00:01:57.400> definitely

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
cover the whole head this is definitely

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.640 
cover the whole head this is definitely
fatter<00:01:58.000> so<00:01:58.660> this<00:01:58.810> is<00:01:58.930> a<00:01:58.960> step<00:01:59.259> in<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.560> right

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
fatter so this is a step in the right

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.430 
fatter so this is a step in the right
direction<00:01:59.830> and<00:02:00.340> creating<00:02:00.910> a<00:02:01.090> homemade<00:02:01.600> large

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440
