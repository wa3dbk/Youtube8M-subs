00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.629
 good guys this afternoon we are going to 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.010
 disassemble the shock absorber the telescopic 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.720
 of a motorcycle ts 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.230
 as well as what are the parts 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.640
 internal and what is the order of disarmed 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.720
 the unarmed protocol in these genres 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.400
 parts of the motorcycle what is 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.580
 Find navarra is that was 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.710
 it seems a lot because of the impact on both the 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.570
 of right but if for some reason you 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.570
 began to get to twist the convenient 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.460
 is to change the whole world 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.810
 because there are people who straighten it but not 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.730
 remain the same whenever they do a 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.680
 problems and the telescope with the case of 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.990
 motorcycles 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.520
 it has a lot to do with stability 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.020
 so if we have the telescopic ones 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.760
 one is crooked and the other is right 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.460
 the bike can fall more than one side 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.760
 or you can fall and stay stuck in a 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.230
 side what will cause an accident 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.360
 most accidents happen because of that 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.080
 because that knowledge of us 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.190
 involved in the elements of the 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.500
 motorcycle 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.350
 then as a seal when telescopic 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.110
 this is crooked is very difficult to see 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.640
 the eye is very difficult to say is 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.170
 comic is crooked or is continuing this 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.330
 twisted rod this toxicity is difficult 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.760
 then what is done is going to disarm 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.920
 you yes to be able to take that piece 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.170
 environment and that it takes a review 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.510
 to see if there are indeed any 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.910
 twist 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.700
 fundamental we have take care with 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.590
 the retainer that is here 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.360
 these elements are very good elements 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.210
 but they are practically damaged by pure 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.280
 careless here a retainer and here over 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.929
 a dust cover this part how will 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.360
 approaching the tire splashes a lot of mud 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.039
 dirt grime here and in motion 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.929
 upwards down this earth it 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.369
 It is getting and is damaging the retainers 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.890
 that's why it's convenient that here 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.229
 place in a dust cover or a 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.479
 overall here another retainer on the 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.860
 retainer to remove the 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.530
 earth falling inland 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.360
 entertainer who goes there then gentlemen 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.429
 let's start the process unarmed where 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.569
 they start by removing the key that is 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:00.569
 here in the back and you the 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.569
 see there is a key there in the high part 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.630
 tranqui you get tired of the key for one 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.670
 ring removing that key already 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.500
 we find the spring that is 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.230
 inside after we remove from 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.430
 key but we must remove the 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.770
 screw if it holds the valve of the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.540
 shock absorber 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.130
 as soon as any screw system that 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.410
 is in charge of the valve all the 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.080
 set is disarmed and then we continue 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.510
 with this other key that is another arito 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.030
 of wire 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.210
 that supports me or adjusts me of the cushion 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.980
 the retainer 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.310
 is ready guys we start with that 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.310
 so
