and<00:00:59.609> what<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> mean<00:01:00.660> by<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.550> look

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
and what I mean by this is if you look

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.880 
and what I mean by this is if you look
at<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> power<00:01:03.210> he<00:01:03.570> displays<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.229> film<00:01:04.500> he

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
at the power he displays in the film he

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.660 
at the power he displays in the film he
flicked<00:01:05.220> Goku<00:01:05.729> away<00:01:06.060> with<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.900> finger<00:01:07.860> which<00:01:08.490> is

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
flicked Goku away with a finger which is

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.789 
flicked Goku away with a finger which is
very<00:01:08.880> very<00:01:09.180> impressive<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.200> my<00:01:10.380> itself

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
very very impressive and that my itself

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.649 
very very impressive and that my itself
would<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.000> make<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.240> imagine<00:01:12.600> how

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
would have to make you imagine how

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.960 
would have to make you imagine how
strong<00:01:12.990> he<00:01:13.170> really<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.280> at<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.580> point<00:01:14.820> in

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
strong he really is and at that point in

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
strong he really is and at that point in
the<00:01:15.060> film<00:01:15.330> Goku<00:01:16.140> had<00:01:16.259> asked<00:01:16.619> him<00:01:16.740> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the film Goku had asked him to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.230 
the film Goku had asked him to
demonstrate<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.400> little<00:01:17.430> bit<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.909> his<00:01:18.000> power

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
demonstrate a little bit of his power

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240 
demonstrate a little bit of his power
and<00:01:18.570> beer<00:01:19.080> says<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.530> want<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.799> see<00:01:19.920> my<00:01:20.070> power

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and beer says you want to see my power

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.190 
and beer says you want to see my power
so<00:01:20.850> he<00:01:21.030> showed<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> little<00:01:21.659> bit<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> his<00:01:21.990> power

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
so he showed a little bit of his power

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.170 
so he showed a little bit of his power
we<00:01:22.350> don't<00:01:22.380> know<00:01:22.619> how<00:01:22.770> much<00:01:22.950> exactly<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.939> could

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
estimate but we don't know exactly how

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.510 
estimate but we don't know exactly how
much<00:01:27.180> now<00:01:27.780> he<00:01:28.380> did<00:01:28.619> finish<00:01:28.890> him<00:01:29.130> off<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.460> a

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
getting flicked away by finger I think

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.350 
getting flicked away by finger I think
Goku<00:02:26.230> been<00:02:26.410> out<00:02:26.530> for<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:26.740> count<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:28.090> you

his<00:03:12.040> kicks<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.640> punches<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:13.239> stuff<00:03:13.570> he

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
his kicks and punches and stuff he

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.960 
his kicks and punches and stuff he
didn't<00:03:14.500> land<00:03:14.680> anything<00:03:15.010> i'm<00:03:15.340> beers<00:03:15.640> but<00:03:15.850> he

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
didn't land anything i'm beers but he

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.759 
didn't land anything i'm beers but he
was<00:03:16.120> blocking<00:03:16.450> some<00:03:16.750> attacks<00:03:17.080> and<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.560> could

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
was blocking some attacks and you could

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:18.900 
was blocking some attacks and you could
say<00:03:18.010> that<00:03:18.040> this<00:03:18.250> could<00:03:18.489> be<00:03:18.640> attributed<00:03:18.880> to

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
say that this could be attributed to

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.449 
say that this could be attributed to
beers<00:03:19.450> maybe<00:03:19.690> testing<00:03:20.170> vegeta<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.860> that<00:03:21.190> is

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
beers maybe testing vegeta and that is

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.850 
beers maybe testing vegeta and that is
true<00:03:21.959> but<00:03:22.959> I<00:03:23.019> still<00:03:23.080> think<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.680> other

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
true but I still think the other

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.790 
true but I still think the other
examples<00:03:24.459> like<00:03:24.550> boo<00:03:25.330> coming<00:03:25.810> back<00:03:26.019> you<00:03:26.769> know

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
examples like boo coming back you know

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.940 
examples like boo coming back you know
Gohan<00:03:27.400> did<00:03:28.300> grab<00:03:28.630> beerus<00:03:29.140> actually<00:03:29.739> I<00:03:29.800> mean

Gohan did grab beerus actually I mean

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.830 
Gohan did grab beerus actually I mean
Goku<00:03:30.310> didn't<00:03:30.550> necessarily<00:03:30.670> into<00:03:31.269> him<00:03:31.450> beers

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
Goku didn't necessarily into him beers

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.110 
Goku didn't necessarily into him beers
but<00:03:32.140> Gohan<00:03:33.010> didn't<00:03:33.310> grab<00:03:33.489> beers<00:03:33.760> even<00:03:34.030> though

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
but Gohan didn't grab beers even though

but Gohan didn't grab beers even though
beerus<00:03:34.450> wasn't<00:03:34.720> really<00:03:34.870> paying<00:03:35.050> attention

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
beerus wasn't really paying attention

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.940 
beerus wasn't really paying attention
you<00:03:35.470> grab<00:03:35.680> beers<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:36.220> then<00:03:36.310> Gohan<00:03:37.209> had<00:03:37.950> butted

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
you know not get knocked out by that he

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.050

got knocked out from the kick and I mean
those<00:03:46.180> two<00:03:46.239> hits<00:03:46.570> are<00:03:46.720> very<00:03:46.900> impressive<00:03:48.150> so

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
those two hits are very impressive so

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.240 
those two hits are very impressive so
just<00:03:49.450> it's<00:03:49.690> weird<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:50.110> me<00:03:50.200> guys<00:03:50.440> is<00:03:50.590> his<00:03:51.010> power

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
just it's weird to me guys is his power

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.100 
just it's weird to me guys is his power
he<00:03:51.459> is<00:03:51.580> very<00:03:51.880> very<00:03:52.209> powerful<00:03:52.390> don't<00:03:52.810> get<00:03:52.989> me

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.710 
he is very very powerful don't get me
wrong<00:03:53.140> I'm<00:03:53.709> just<00:03:53.830> saying<00:03:54.280> that<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:55.360> way<00:03:55.390> that

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
wrong I'm just saying that the way that

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.870 
wrong I'm just saying that the way that
Vegeta<00:03:56.320> in<00:03:56.620> particular<00:03:57.100> did<00:03:57.459> against<00:03:57.670> Pierce

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
Vegeta in particular did against Pierce

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.520 
Vegeta in particular did against Pierce
I'm<00:03:58.000> not<00:03:58.150> gonna<00:03:58.269> include<00:03:58.510> raging<00:03:58.959> Vegeta<00:03:59.350> here

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
I'm not gonna include raging Vegeta here

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.870 
I'm not gonna include raging Vegeta here
because<00:03:59.769> it's<00:03:59.920> so<00:04:00.100> complicated<00:04:00.489> when<00:04:00.820> you

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
because it's so complicated when you

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.580 
because it's so complicated when you
include<00:04:01.180> that<00:04:01.390> but<00:04:01.900> if<00:04:01.989> you<00:04:02.080> include<00:04:02.350> the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
include that but if you include the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.350 
include that but if you include the
juice<00:04:02.830> performance<00:04:03.340> I<00:04:03.430> don't<00:04:03.610> I<00:04:03.820> don't<00:04:03.940> see

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
juice performance I don't I don't see

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.479 
juice performance I don't I don't see
how<00:04:04.510> Vegeta<00:04:05.019> would<00:04:05.980> have<00:04:06.100> done<00:04:06.280> much

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
how Vegeta would have done much

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.190 
how Vegeta would have done much
different<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.330> way<00:04:07.480> he<00:04:07.600> did<00:04:07.780> against<00:04:07.959> Pierce

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
different the way he did against Pierce

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.180 
different the way he did against Pierce
I<00:04:08.290> don't<00:04:08.440> see<00:04:08.590> how<00:04:08.709> it<00:04:08.769> would<00:04:08.830> have<00:04:09.010> looked

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
I don't see how it would have looked

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.830 
I don't see how it would have looked
much<00:04:09.340> different<00:04:09.880> if<00:04:09.940> he<00:04:10.000> fought<00:04:10.269> someone<00:04:10.540> like

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
much different if he fought someone like

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.400 
much different if he fought someone like
in<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:12.220> boos<00:04:12.489> saw<00:04:12.730> at<00:04:12.970> least<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.450> Buu<00:04:13.780> saga<00:04:14.049> via

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
in the boos saw at least a Buu saga via

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.170 
in the boos saw at least a Buu saga via
if<00:04:14.560> he<00:04:14.739> fought<00:04:14.980> someone<00:04:15.220> like<00:04:15.430> boo<00:04:16.000> boo

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
if he fought someone like boo boo

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.900 
if he fought someone like boo boo
super-boob<00:04:17.170> Gohan<00:04:17.590> absorbed<00:04:18.040> I<00:04:18.130> think<00:04:18.850> it

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
super-boob Gohan absorbed I think it

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.259 
super-boob Gohan absorbed I think it
would<00:04:19.000> be<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.090> very<00:04:19.299> similar<00:04:19.690> situation

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
would be a very similar situation

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.119 
would be a very similar situation
that's<00:04:20.449> maybe<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.780> gaps<00:04:21.079> in<00:04:21.199> power<00:04:21.650> kind<00:04:22.069> of

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:22.129 
that's maybe the gaps in power kind of

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:23.710 
that's maybe the gaps in power kind of
similar<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.460> that<00:04:22.520> but<00:04:23.120> that's<00:04:23.330> just<00:04:23.539> an

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
similar to that but that's just an

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.400 
similar to that but that's just an
assumption

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
assumption

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.490 
assumption
I'm<00:04:24.949> not<00:04:25.160> saying<00:04:25.430> Bierce<00:04:25.669> is<00:04:25.819> a<00:04:25.849> stress<00:04:26.500> you

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
I'm not saying Bierce is a stress you

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.649 
I'm not saying Bierce is a stress you
know<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.710> same<00:04:27.919> strength<00:04:28.160> as<00:04:28.370> boo<00:04:29.030> Gohan

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:29.659 
know the same strength as boo Gohan

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:32.170 
know the same strength as boo Gohan
absorbed<00:04:30.139> I'm<00:04:30.289> saying<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:30.919> if<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:32.000> were<00:04:32.120> to

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
absorbed I'm saying that if you were to

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.850 
absorbed I'm saying that if you were to
take<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:32.569> power<00:04:32.780> gaps<00:04:33.139> it<00:04:33.319> would<00:04:33.409> be<00:04:33.560> similar

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
take the power gaps it would be similar

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.930 
take the power gaps it would be similar
to<00:04:33.919> Z<00:04:34.550> Vegeta<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:35.710> Super<00:04:36.710> Buu<00:04:36.830> Gohan<00:04:37.460> absorbed

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
to Z Vegeta and Super Buu Gohan absorbed

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.869 
to Z Vegeta and Super Buu Gohan absorbed
and<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:38.659> would<00:04:39.530> be<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.830> same<00:04:40.069> gap<00:04:40.370> as<00:04:40.610> the

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:40.879 
and it would be the same gap as the

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:42.999 
and it would be the same gap as the
valve<00:04:41.210> gods<00:04:41.539> vegeta<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.050> beerus<00:04:42.650> if<00:04:42.860> that

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
valve gods vegeta and beerus if that

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:43.869 
valve gods vegeta and beerus if that
makes<00:04:43.220> sense<00:04:43.460> to<00:04:43.580> you<00:04:43.699> guys

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:43.879 
makes sense to you guys

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.360 
makes sense to you guys
and<00:04:44.319> one<00:04:45.319> more<00:04:45.530> thing<00:04:45.710> i<00:04:45.770> want<00:04:45.979> to<00:04:46.039> point<00:04:46.220> out

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
and one more thing i want to point out

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.909 
and one more thing i want to point out
is<00:04:46.780> later<00:04:47.780> in<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:47.990> film<00:04:48.199> we<00:04:48.289> see<00:04:48.470> that<00:04:48.590> beerus

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
is later in the film we see that beerus

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.279 
is later in the film we see that beerus
was<00:04:49.129> you<00:04:49.280> know<00:04:49.370> had<00:04:49.699> gotten<00:04:49.909> very<00:04:50.780> upset<00:04:51.110> after

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
one chop to the neck and that was one of

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.490 
one chop to the neck and that was one of
the<00:04:59.479> things<00:04:59.720> that<00:04:59.870> really<00:05:00.020> confused<00:05:00.470> me

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
the things that really confused me

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.860 
the things that really confused me
because<00:05:00.770> we<00:05:00.979> siz<00:05:01.220> supposed<00:05:01.520> to<00:05:01.669> be<00:05:01.870> 50%

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
because we siz supposed to be 50%

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.270 
because we siz supposed to be 50%
stronger<00:05:03.650> than<00:05:04.099> beerus<00:05:05.319> so<00:05:06.319> where<00:05:06.889> does<00:05:07.069> that

stronger than beerus so where does that

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.920 
stronger than beerus so where does that
really<00:05:07.430> put<00:05:07.789> the<00:05:07.909> other<00:05:08.060> Z<00:05:08.300> fighters<00:05:08.509> in<00:05:08.750> terms

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.339 
lot to go off of here and you know it

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
could be done for effect all these

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.830 
could be done for effect all these
things<00:05:27.650> like<00:05:27.860> Dokus<00:05:28.280> Goku<00:05:29.180> I<00:05:29.210> think<00:05:29.630> got

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
things like Dokus Goku I think got

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.420 
things like Dokus Goku I think got
beaten<00:05:30.110> pretty<00:05:30.650> much<00:05:30.770> the<00:05:30.949> worst<00:05:31.159> out<00:05:31.340> of

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
beaten pretty much the worst out of

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.010 
beaten pretty much the worst out of
everyone<00:05:31.880> honestly

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
everyone honestly

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.439 
everyone honestly
aside<00:05:33.560> from<00:05:33.590> tien<00:05:34.130> and<00:05:34.159> piccolo<00:05:34.699> I'd<00:05:34.880> say<00:05:35.120> and

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
aside from tien and piccolo I'd say and

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.370 
aside from tien and piccolo I'd say and
maybe<00:05:35.659> 18<00:05:36.229> as<00:05:36.440> well<00:05:36.650> but<00:05:37.490> from<00:05:37.849> them<00:05:37.969> the

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
maybe 18 as well but from them the

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.680 
maybe 18 as well but from them the
Vegeta<00:05:39.380> Gohan<00:05:39.949> and<00:05:39.979> Buu<00:05:40.310> did<00:05:40.789> better<00:05:41.210> against

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
Vegeta Gohan and Buu did better against

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.269 
Vegeta Gohan and Buu did better against
beerus<00:05:41.960> uh<00:05:42.050> my<00:05:42.199> opinion<00:05:42.529> and<00:05:42.680> goku<00:05:42.979> did<00:05:43.130> and

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:43.279 
beerus uh my opinion and goku did and

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:45.640 
beerus uh my opinion and goku did and
Goku<00:05:43.849> is<00:05:43.909> way<00:05:44.090> stronger<00:05:44.330> than<00:05:44.479> all<00:05:44.690> of<00:05:44.840> them<00:05:44.990> so

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
Goku is way stronger than all of them so

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.140 
Goku is way stronger than all of them so
it<00:05:45.800> doesn't<00:05:46.039> make<00:05:46.130> sense<00:05:46.400> why<00:05:46.520> Goku<00:05:46.849> did<00:05:47.029> the

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
it doesn't make sense why Goku did the

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.540 
it doesn't make sense why Goku did the
worst<00:05:47.360> and<00:05:47.719> and<00:05:48.229> beerus<00:05:48.680> was<00:05:48.830> using<00:05:49.099> even<00:05:49.370> less

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
worst and and beerus was using even less

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.779 
worst and and beerus was using even less
less<00:05:50.240> power<00:05:50.659> when<00:05:51.380> he<00:05:51.409> fought<00:05:51.710> goku<00:05:52.159> if<00:05:52.370> that

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
less power when he fought goku if that

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.730 
less power when he fought goku if that
makes<00:05:52.969> sense<00:05:53.029> to<00:05:53.300> you<00:05:53.360> guys<00:05:53.389> so<00:05:53.779> that's<00:05:54.469> really

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
makes sense to you guys so that's really

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.260 
makes sense to you guys so that's really
all<00:05:54.800> i<00:05:54.860> have<00:05:54.979> to<00:05:55.009> say<00:05:55.159> but<00:05:55.430> remember<00:05:56.090> what<00:05:56.210> I

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:04.159 
a karate shot to the neck it was a

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:06.640 
a karate shot to the neck it was a
harder<00:06:04.550> quraysh<00:06:04.849> up<00:06:05.060> than<00:06:05.240> beers<00:06:06.080> had<00:06:06.319> landed

harder quraysh up than beers had landed

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.370 
harder quraysh up than beers had landed
on<00:06:06.740> Goku<00:06:07.159> but<00:06:07.719> still<00:06:08.719> you<00:06:08.810> gotta<00:06:08.990> think<00:06:09.199> of<00:06:09.319> the

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
on Goku but still you gotta think of the

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.339 
on Goku but still you gotta think of the
power<00:06:09.620> differences<00:06:10.159> there<00:06:10.370> I<00:06:10.400> mean<00:06:11.080> it's<00:06:12.080> it's

power differences there I mean it's it's

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:13.390 
power differences there I mean it's it's
definitely<00:06:12.469> something<00:06:12.860> worth<00:06:12.979> talking<00:06:13.190> about

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
definitely something worth talking about
