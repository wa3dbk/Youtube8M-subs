00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.600
 we breed our kolk port 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.290
 fish farming goldfish schukies is too 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.570
 unique style and red feathers gold open 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.840
 very lively fish as well as the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.320
 BlaurÃ¶cke the offerers are only 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:47.580
 in conjunction with the mussels multiplied 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:50.129
 and various other nature fishermen too 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.829
 beginning of spring spawning 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.470
 female the so-called rogner and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.660
 male the so-called Munich 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:04.979
 fished off the natural particles and after 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.810
 sorted fish species then takes place 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.930
 the transport to the corpses 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.580
 where exactly and milk will be outside the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.950
 spawning time kept separate 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.310
 this increases the activity of the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.780
 fish when composing would be so 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.360
 in the morning exposed positive signs resp 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.500
 the ponds are filled with the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.700
 as warm as possible water then I 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.860
 again within the first hours 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.319
 once again warms up for 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.929
 An optimal breeding success is one 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.679
 water temperature of over 20 if possible 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.440
 centigrade 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.990
 a special challenge 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.119
 the purchase addiction there when the male the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.229
 the female is drifting through the water 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.530
 come spawning time 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.640
 the kois need it 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.130
 water temperatures also at night 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.130
 stay constantly above twelve degrees celsius 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.200
 winsen and grasses stimulate the rogers 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.200
 to strip their eggs 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.619
 after the spawning, the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.330
 Parents in the nature ponds 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.860
 reset that you would otherwise 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.860
 eat the eggs 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.720
 already one day after the fishing off the 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.489
 parents the koi babys hatch them 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.650
 are few in the first days 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.000
 Millimeter tall and are in short supply 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.530
 one week into larger ponds 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.209
 for the multiplication is very positive if 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.219
 you always so maybe in june 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.140
 it does not actually increase what it actually does 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.549
 more because the fishermen from the winter 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.159
 must accordingly be great to have 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.989
 so be at least 34 5 cm tall with it 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.549
 The sensible winter come because you 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.280
 with us in the natural particles 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.500
 stay and the swans with and 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:51.510
 if it's two inches tall that's 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.109
 not yet growing vigorously relative 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.299
 slowly 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.730
 after four weeks they are around three 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.129
 centimeters tall with one to two years 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.750
 come on body lengths between 10 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.750
 and 25 centimeters 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.650
 at the age of three, the length of the 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.530
 koi carp usually between 20 and 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.329
 30 cm 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.040
 how many circle the fish breed persists 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.670
 one produces it ponds annually 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.140
 mainly depends on the weather when we are 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.079
 start very early with the multiplication 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.970
 The fish are quite big in autumn 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.290
 let's start in a year later 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.420
 multiplication because it was always cold there 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.519
 shifts always around 4 6 weeks then 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.670
 the fish stay pretty small 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.879
 you can say that 70 to 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:41.489
 100 thousand fishes around the year 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:44.440
 deliver and sell zoo business 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.120
 the colorful koi carp are standing 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.000
 at the customers of peter hartmann 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.849
 especially high in the course he has a good one 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.120
 Hands on the fish and the year 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.120
 for year
