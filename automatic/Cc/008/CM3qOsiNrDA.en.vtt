00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
through half the game without it before

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.050 
through half the game without it before
I<00:01:28.200> realized<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.950> do<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.520> didn't<00:01:29.939> think

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.460 
I realized you can do it I didn't think
this<00:01:30.180> game<00:01:30.509> could<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.869> done<00:01:31.020> at<00:01:31.140> all<00:01:31.290> in

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
this game could be done at all in

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.030 
this game could be done at all in
identity<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:33.180> detail<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.140> vivid<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
identity and the detail is so vivid and

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.490 
identity and the detail is so vivid and
i'm<00:01:35.850> only<00:01:36.030> running<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.600> these<00:01:37.110> settings

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.270 

so<00:01:43.079> those<00:01:43.229> details<00:01:43.619> aren't<00:01:43.860> even<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.130> highest

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280

so those details aren't even the highest
they<00:01:45.030> don't<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.439> detail<00:01:46.829> even<00:01:47.039> on

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
they don't have to be the detail even on

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.200 
they don't have to be the detail even on
a<00:01:47.280> mid-grade<00:01:47.789> setting<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.079> still<00:01:49.409> amazing

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
odd or shouldn't be there those are

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.960 
odd or shouldn't be there those are
usually<00:05:41.620> in<00:05:41.920> the<00:05:42.010> cutscenes<00:05:42.520> and<00:05:42.700> you<00:05:42.820> can

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
usually in the cutscenes and you can

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.990 
usually in the cutscenes and you can
