00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
society so what would a Google car

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.690 
society so what would a Google car
company<00:01:04.379> look<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.710> besides<00:01:05.070> being<00:01:05.339> filled

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
company look like besides being filled

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.240

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
with no solar batteries and Tanglers

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.190 
with no solar batteries and Tanglers
maybe<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.150> Google<00:01:09.479> car<00:01:09.659> company<00:01:09.960> would<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.170> a

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
maybe a Google car company would be a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.390 
maybe a Google car company would be a
lot<00:01:10.409> more<00:01:10.590> collaborative

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
lot more collaborative

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.370 
lot more collaborative
maybe<00:01:11.670> they'd<00:01:11.909> want<00:01:12.150> us<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.750> help<00:01:12.869> them<00:01:13.110> design

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
maybe they'd want us to help them design

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.560 
maybe they'd want us to help them design
cars<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.369> sell<00:01:14.640> them<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.060> figure<00:01:15.299> them<00:01:15.420> out

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
cars and sell them and figure them out

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.789 
cars and sell them and figure them out
maybe<00:01:15.810> they'd<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.080> lot<00:01:16.229> more<00:01:16.380> interesting

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
maybe they'd be a lot more interesting

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.359 
maybe they'd be a lot more interesting
than<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.159> now

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
than we have now

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.969 
than we have now
what<00:01:18.150> would<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> Google<00:01:18.630> restaurant<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.710> I

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
what would a Google restaurant be like I

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.410 
what would a Google restaurant be like I
think<00:01:20.340> we'd<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.729> voting<00:01:21.090> what<00:01:21.240> should<00:01:21.360> be

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
think we'd all be voting what should be

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.890 
think we'd all be voting what should be
on<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> menu

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
on the menu

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.020 
on the menu

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
we probably wouldn't be stuck going to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.620 
we probably wouldn't be stuck going to
one<00:01:25.950> quad<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.700> campus<00:01:27.090> we'd<00:01:27.210> take<00:01:27.390> courses

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
one quad and campus we'd take courses

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.510 
one quad and campus we'd take courses
from<00:01:27.869> anywhere<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.680> great<00:01:28.979> linked<00:01:29.340> world

from anywhere in this great linked world

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.270 
from anywhere in this great linked world
of<00:01:29.700> Google<00:01:30.030> what<00:01:30.960> would<00:01:31.110> Google<00:01:31.560> insurance<00:01:32.070> be

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
of Google what would Google insurance be

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.039 
of Google what would Google insurance be
like<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:33.150> maybe<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.479> would<00:01:33.600> finally<00:01:33.780> even

Buzz<00:01:36.540> machine<00:01:36.810> comm<00:01:37.170> where<00:01:37.380> I've<00:01:37.500> explored<00:01:38.159> a

Buzz machine comm where I've explored a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.190 
Buzz machine comm where I've explored a
lot<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.700> ideas<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.360> book<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.780> I

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
lot of the ideas for this book and I

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260 
lot of the ideas for this book and I
found<00:01:40.439> there's<00:01:40.740> universal<00:01:41.579> appeal<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.119> this

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
found there's universal appeal for this

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.300 
found there's universal appeal for this
I've<00:01:42.540> gone<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.200> conferences<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.710> Davos<00:01:44.159> and

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
I've gone to conferences like Davos and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.950 
I've gone to conferences like Davos and
talked<00:01:44.490> about<00:01:44.700> these<00:01:44.820> ideas<00:01:44.970> with<00:01:45.299> CEOs<00:01:45.659> and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
talked about these ideas with CEOs and

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.600 
talked about these ideas with CEOs and
they're<00:01:46.439> all<00:01:46.619> wondering<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> same<00:01:47.280> thing

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
they're all wondering the same thing

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.850 
they're all wondering the same thing
what<00:01:48.329> would<00:01:48.479> Google<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.590> we'll<00:01:49.770> explore

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
what would Google do so we'll explore

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.340 
what would Google do so we'll explore
that<00:01:50.130> together<00:01:50.430> right<00:01:51.210> now<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> blog<00:01:51.930> in

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
that together right now on the blog in

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.020 
that together right now on the blog in
the<00:01:52.680> book<00:01:52.829> itself<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> discussion

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
the book itself and in a discussion

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.399 
the book itself and in a discussion
afterwards<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:54.990> hope<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.380> a

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
afterwards and I hope we have a

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.929 
afterwards and I hope we have a
community<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> people<00:01:56.130> who<00:01:56.250> try<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.520> figure

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
community of people who try to figure

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.789 
community of people who try to figure
this<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.540> try<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.960> look<00:01:58.320> at<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.619> world

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
this out and try to look at the world

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.780 
this out and try to look at the world
differently

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
differently

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.179 
differently
so<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.780> isn't<00:02:00.930> about<00:02:01.110> thinking<00:02:01.649> like<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> geek

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
so this isn't about thinking like a geek

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.300 
so this isn't about thinking like a geek
it's<00:02:02.850> about<00:02:03.030> thinking<00:02:03.390> differently<00:02:04.040> we<00:02:05.040> all

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
it's about thinking differently we all

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.740 
it's about thinking differently we all
need<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.790> ask<00:02:06.200> what<00:02:07.200> would<00:02:07.290> Google<00:02:07.619> do
