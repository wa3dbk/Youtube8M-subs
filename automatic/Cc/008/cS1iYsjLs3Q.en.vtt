00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.879
 ah 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.840
 hi hello oompa peanut loompas 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.550
 this video belongs to a compilation 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.520
 what I've done in the blog about masses 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.200
 broken this is the third video of 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.910
 this compilation that you mentioned that 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.189
 by the way I leave it so much here in the 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.529
 video like in the soft soft box in 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.809
 the first video you can find the mass 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.059
 saber in the second sucre cake video 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.250
 that is to say sugary paste and in this 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.710
 third video I'm going to show you the saber 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.140
 Breton in the post of the blog also os 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.050
 indicated the differences between a saber and 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.410
 a Breton sword 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.930
 let's stop the mushroom oompa loompas 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.940
 We're going to need 130 g of butter 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.570
 without very cold salt 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.570
 350 grams of flour 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.940
 15 grams of yeast type royale 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.620
 we are also going to need 180 g of 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.620
 icing sugar 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.250
 4 buds about 100 grams approximately 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.630
 and two medium eggs 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.360
 and a pinch of salt the aromas to taste I 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.030
 in this recipe is lemon because I 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.680
 I really like the taste that leaves the 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.630
 just like the other mass recipes 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.010
 Broken is exactly the same 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.220
 first let's put the elements 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.800
 dried flour sugar glas 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.050
 aromas and we have and butter and 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.119
 let's mix well until everything 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.119
 start to make it a bit gritty 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.930
 when we see that all this starts 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.810
 to make as sandy we are going to add the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.630
 egg yolks and very important we go 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.150
 to sift the yeast we also add 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.520
 the pinch of salt and we continue moving 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.820
 unlike the breeze mass and the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.340
 part its believe this mass is stickier 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.560
 so do not worry about not adding more 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.930
 flour this dough is like this you have two 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.000
 options one directly you put in 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.750
 manga and you put it inside the 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.819
 molds or two as you are seeing you can 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.159
 cool and then we start to stretch 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.290
 very important oompa loompas has to 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.989
 rest in the refrigerator at least one hour 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.389
 when that time has passed we can already 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.489
 add flour to our countertop and 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:35.400
 begin to work the look this is the 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.470
 texture that has to be 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.530
 and after having a good time all over the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.140
 Flour with our floured rolling pin 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.599
 let's start stretching but before 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.269
 always agree to have half of the 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.010
 mass inside the fridge so if it is 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.230
 it warms up and starts to get sticky 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.420
 you can put it in the fridge and use it 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.420
 other 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.420
 do not confuse and always remember that 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.890
 the sword does not carry yeast but the sword 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.959
 Breton which is what you are seeing now 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.980
 same therefore therefore this mass remains 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.810
 super fluffy and very very very delicious 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.650
 I love doing them always for 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.650
 the smallest of the house 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.220
 I'm stretching here so that 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.810
 you see that there is no problem 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.390
 remember you whenever we stretch 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.190
 the dough we are going to raise and throw flour 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.200
 below and above when we pass 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.170
 the roller again so that we do not get 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.850
 paste the dough here I show you what happens 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.320
 if you are going to use this dough to make 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.720
 cookies look at the thickness that I've 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.570
 left because unlike the saber 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.910
 crisp sap le bret 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.900
 although so soft and fluffy if 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.880
 you make cookies 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.160
 This is the texture that will keep me 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.800
 before baking I pass a brush with 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.960
 egg like that shine above and this 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.630
 sponge cake from salou breton yo 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.980
 I have filled it with nutella I teach you the 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.020
 cut that you already know whenever I 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.840
 I love to show you how it is inside 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.240
 and look is with a kind of bit with 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.190
 cookie or something like that but the truth is that 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.380
 it is very delicious 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.200
 for this texture in the Breton saber is 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.860
 bakes with the preheated oven to 160 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.050
 degrees for 10 12 minutes the saber 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.210
 Breton is used a lot for bases of 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.000
 cake is that you are seeing the image 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.680
 is the hazelnut recipe you have in 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.380
 the blog if you add 100 grams of 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.600
 hazelnuts will be exquisite here 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.650
 you have an image where you can see the 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.630
 base together with this raspberry mousse 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.550

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.320
