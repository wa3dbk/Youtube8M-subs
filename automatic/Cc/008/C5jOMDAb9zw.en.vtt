took me as long as the Ultron this one
it<00:03:18.599> took<00:03:18.750> me<00:03:18.870> about<00:03:19.049> three<00:03:19.109> days<00:03:19.769> three<00:03:20.430> good

it took me about three days three good
days<00:03:20.879> and<00:03:21.829> there's<00:03:22.829> so<00:03:23.159> many<00:03:23.280> ways<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.669> wanted

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
days and there's so many ways I wanted

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.879 
days and there's so many ways I wanted
to<00:03:23.970> go<00:03:24.060> about<00:03:24.269> doing<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:24.750> pixel<00:03:25.079> art<00:03:25.229> and<00:03:25.319> I

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
to go about doing this pixel art and I

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.430 
to go about doing this pixel art and I
decided<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:26.790> pretty<00:03:27.479> much<00:03:27.629> with<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.139> just

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
decided to pretty much with this just

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.409 
decided to pretty much with this just
decided<00:03:28.829> with<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.370> layers<00:03:29.639> of<00:03:29.879> shading<00:03:30.299> I

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
decided with the layers of shading I

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.750 
decided with the layers of shading I
might<00:03:31.260> have<00:03:31.409> gone<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.799> little<00:03:32.010> overboard<00:03:32.250> when

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
might have gone a little overboard when

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.289 
might have gone a little overboard when
it<00:03:32.909> came<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:34.069> putting<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.250> shades<00:03:35.579> or<00:03:36.150> the

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
it came to putting the shades or the

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.699 
it came to putting the shades or the
different<00:03:36.629> type<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.780> shades<00:03:37.079> in<00:03:37.199> his<00:03:37.319> face<00:03:37.530> as

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
different type of shades in his face as

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.699 
different type of shades in his face as
you<00:03:38.069> can<00:03:38.189> see<00:03:38.340> there's<00:03:38.549> just<00:03:38.819> a<00:03:38.970> bunch

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
you can see there's just a bunch

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.399 
you can see there's just a bunch
clustered<00:03:40.709> right<00:03:41.189> there<00:03:41.790> all<00:03:42.629> over<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.229> place

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
clustered right there all over the place

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.589 
clustered right there all over the place
