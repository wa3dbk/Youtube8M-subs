00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.309
 especially for trolling 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.420
 strike pro i series of spinning trolling 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:24.689
 medium dreams trolling spin rods have 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:27.570
 length from 2.1 meters to 2.4 meters with 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.189
 their test is within 2060 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.110
 and 60 100 grams model trolling spin 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.600
 has a test of 20 60 grams 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.379
 this spinning is intended for 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.809
 delicate trolling fishing on rivers 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.410
 model trolling medium spin more powerful 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.850
 he has a test of 60 100 grams and 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.910
 designed for fishing using 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.190
 glider systems and downrigger a both 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.219
 fishing rods are comparatively flexible 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.530
 vershinku bright red color is 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.629
 made to visually 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.729
 control bait work during 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.270
 medium spinning wiring 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.579
 modular graphite 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.820
 it gives about amazing strength and 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.990
 flexibility 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.420
 high modulus graphite is good at spinning 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.920
 in trolling fishing it is absolutely not 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.560
 need and power and real trolling 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.159
 you roots very eloquently speaks 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:31.090
 thickness of the rods data by the way 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.009
 at the junction of the rod you can clearly see the thin ring 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.740
 glass plastic backing and thick 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.780
 ring of graphite very often unfortunately 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.360
 everything is the other way around and mostly rods 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.729
 made of cheap glass and only 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.270
 top is a thin layer of graphite 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.340
 windings 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.579
 and this rod mostly of course 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:53.259
 made of medium modular graphite 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:56.049
 and there are very few trolling glasses 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.360
 strike pro rods have powerful 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:02.229
 butt still extra gain 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.630
 the bar above the handle immediately higher 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.459
 reinforcing windings 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.030
 compact folding holder is located 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.030
 for bait 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.359
 all real trolling rods 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:18.280
 have a hollow new grip i must say 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:20.530
 that this is done with no accident 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.750
 the fact is that always trolling 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.579
 rods are designed to 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.819
 housed special holders and 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:29.680
 glasses if the handle is out of cork 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.720
 this cork will start to crumble and quickly 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.639
 will become unusable and the hollow is new 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.709
 handles in trolling fishing serves 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:38.380
 over the years 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.780
 the rod is set simple and reliable 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.019
 metal screw reel seat 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.019
 frame 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.270
 the bottom of the tube has a fungus stop 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.190
 this fungus emphasis we need in order 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.980
 so that you can fish out in time 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.470
 there was a butt spinning in front of our belly and with us 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.900
 it turns out a foothold besides this 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.900
 fungus is removable and under it is 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.050
 stubby cross is a cross is 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.060
 in order to spinning in the holder not 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.620
 rotated when we melt 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:18.280
 trolling spinning equipped with low 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:20.380
 powerful 3 paws rings these rods 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.090
 just perfect work complete with 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.880
 multiplier with any coils 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.430
 sizes besides rods are equipped 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.400
 a large number of crossing rings on 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.920
 2 legs it is very reliable powerful 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.870
 rings and they are often located therefore 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.209
 even under heavy load we have a fishing line 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.910
 won't touch the form and spinning doesn't 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.260
 will become unusable under load well in 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.390
 our country, many anglers 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.640
 prefer to use trolling 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.220
 non multiplier coils 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.320
 inertia need to say that this 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.030
 the rod fits perfectly even 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.760
 complete with large unsupervised 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.590
 coils because flow ring 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.019
 although it has a small diameter but 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.180
 significant removal has from the coil and 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.290
 during the coiling of the beating line 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.269
 virtually no problems therefore 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.430
 no to use big business 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.820
 translational coil supplied with data 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.260
 my trolling rods for today 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.390
 trolling is becoming more and more 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.010
 popular I must say that in 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.959
 most fishermen of our country 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.459
 for some reason still prefer for 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.160
 trolling to use anything 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.050
 only not special rods entrance 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.340
 go their cheap chinese glass 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.740
 telescopes and 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.510
 combined spinning and high 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.350
 modular even spinning many fishermen 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.540
 use 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.370
 there is absolutely no reason for it 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.460
 because any special tool 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.229
 always better than fit 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.120
 say that these spinning have 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.949
 pretty democratic price and 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.740
 absolutely no sense something 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:50.290
 invent and invent for trolling 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.940
 ideal is trolling 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.940
 rods should always remember this
