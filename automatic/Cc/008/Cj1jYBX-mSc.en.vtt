desk<00:03:37.500> pieces<00:03:38.010> here<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.459> normally<00:03:38.819> see<00:03:39.030> these

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
desk pieces here you normally see these

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.479 
desk pieces here you normally see these
on<00:03:39.359> the<00:03:39.449> desktops<00:03:39.930> of<00:03:40.319> desks<00:03:40.979> and<00:03:41.129> stuff<00:03:41.310> to

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
happen to fit my application here of

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.240 
happen to fit my application here of
plumbing<00:03:47.489> in<00:03:47.729> my<00:03:48.000> propane<00:03:48.449> line<00:03:48.720> let<00:03:49.439> me<00:03:49.560> zoom

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
plumbing in my propane line let me zoom

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.710 
plumbing in my propane line let me zoom
back<00:03:50.310> here<00:03:50.699> you<00:03:50.790> can<00:03:50.939> kind<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.180> see<00:03:51.359> how<00:03:51.479> I<00:03:51.509> have

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
back here you can kind of see how I have

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.030 
back here you can kind of see how I have
that<00:03:51.750> across<00:03:52.139> or<00:03:52.379> now<00:03:52.470> in<00:03:52.590> case<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:52.859> didn't

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
that across or now in case you didn't

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.749 
that across or now in case you didn't
see<00:03:53.069> it<00:03:53.189> before

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:53.759 
see it before

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:56.899 
see it before
so<00:03:54.629> that's<00:03:54.810> nice<00:03:54.989> low<00:03:55.259> profile<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:56.069> don't<00:03:56.699> trip

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
so that's nice low profile I don't trip

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.189 
so that's nice low profile I don't trip
on<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.269> it's<00:03:58.049> down<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.829> out<00:03:58.949> of<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.129> way<00:03:59.280> and

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:00.199 
on it it's down and out of the way and

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.080 
on it it's down and out of the way and
still<00:04:01.199> allows<00:04:01.470> for<00:04:01.500> this<00:04:01.889> to<00:04:02.069> cover<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.849> close

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
still allows for this to cover to close

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.479 
still allows for this to cover to close
up<00:04:03.329> so<00:04:03.629> and<00:04:03.959> then<00:04:04.500> my<00:04:04.620> heater<00:04:04.859> sits<00:04:05.220> nicely

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
up so and then my heater sits nicely

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.960 
up so and then my heater sits nicely
behind<00:04:05.939> the<00:04:06.769> passenger<00:04:07.769> seat<00:04:07.979> here<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:08.370> heats

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970
