if you add them up colors textures
synthetics<00:00:09.139> Naturals<00:00:09.530> there<00:00:09.680> have<00:00:09.920> to<00:00:10.099> be

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.220 
synthetics Naturals there have to be

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.879 
synthetics Naturals there have to be
well<00:00:10.519> over<00:00:10.880> 100<00:00:11.570> and<00:00:11.660> I<00:00:11.780> made<00:00:11.929> making<00:00:12.589> this<00:00:12.679> up

well over 100 and I made making this up

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.279 
well over 100 and I made making this up
150<00:00:13.549> types<00:00:13.940> of<00:00:14.150> dubbing<00:00:14.480> why<00:00:14.660> would<00:00:14.929> you<00:00:15.080> want

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
150 types of dubbing why would you want

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.590 
150 types of dubbing why would you want
well<00:00:15.559> because<00:00:15.919> you<00:00:16.070> want<00:00:16.309> to<00:00:16.430> do<00:00:16.610> it<00:00:16.820> it's<00:00:17.150> fun

well because you want to do it it's fun
and<00:00:18.050> you<00:00:19.010> can<00:00:19.130> get<00:00:19.340> colors<00:00:19.790> that<00:00:20.000> you<00:00:20.090> can't

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
and you can get colors that you can't

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.930 
and you can get colors that you can't
quite<00:00:20.750> get<00:00:21.020> which<00:00:21.320> you<00:00:21.350> know<00:00:21.800> will<00:00:22.400> either<00:00:22.610> a

quite get which you know will either a
the<00:00:23.780> trout<00:00:24.050> William<00:00:24.470> better<00:00:24.710> or<00:00:25.130> the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
the trout William better or the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.270 
the trout William better or the
steelhead<00:00:25.580> or<00:00:26.480> B<00:00:26.750> your<00:00:27.380> files<00:00:27.710> will<00:00:28.040> have<00:00:28.070> a

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280 
steelhead or B your files will have a

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.370 
steelhead or B your files will have a
signature<00:00:28.910> they'll<00:00:29.510> be<00:00:29.660> different<00:00:29.930> than<00:00:30.230> your

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
signature they'll be different than your

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.580 
signature they'll be different than your
buddies<00:00:30.680> so<00:00:30.920> how<00:00:31.370> do<00:00:31.430> you<00:00:31.550> do<00:00:31.670> this<00:00:31.880> well<00:00:32.870> if

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
buddies so how do you do this well if

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.560 
buddies so how do you do this well if
you<00:00:33.770> really<00:00:34.010> want<00:00:34.340> to<00:00:34.430> be<00:00:34.579> simple<00:00:35.030> you<00:00:35.059> do<00:00:35.390> it

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
you really want to be simple you do it

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.739 
you really want to be simple you do it
by<00:00:35.809> hand<00:00:38.379> you<00:00:39.379> take<00:00:39.649> about<00:00:40.570> two<00:00:41.570> or<00:00:41.600> three

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:41.749 
by hand you take about two or three

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:46.090 
by hand you take about two or three
kinds<00:00:42.379> of<00:00:42.440> dubbing<00:00:44.320> got<00:00:45.320> a<00:00:45.350> little<00:00:45.710> sandwich

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
kinds of dubbing got a little sandwich

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.259 
kinds of dubbing got a little sandwich
there<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:46.730> then<00:00:47.269> you<00:00:47.420> just<00:00:48.609> come<00:00:49.609> apart<00:00:50.769> and

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
there and then you just come apart and

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.989 
there and then you just come apart and
if<00:00:53.649> sometimes<00:00:54.649> you<00:00:54.829> can<00:00:55.069> get<00:00:55.339> this<00:00:55.519> done<00:00:55.579> in

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:55.999 
if sometimes you can get this done in

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:58.149 
if sometimes you can get this done in
three<00:00:56.210> or<00:00:56.510> four<00:00:56.569> parts<00:00:57.260> sometimes<00:00:57.649> it<00:00:57.979> takes

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
three or four parts sometimes it takes

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.930 
three or four parts sometimes it takes
longer<00:00:58.249> and<00:00:59.739> you<00:01:00.739> know<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.190> this<00:01:01.370> is<00:01:01.429> this<00:01:01.789> the

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
longer and you know so this is this the

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.770 
longer and you know so this is this the
idea<00:01:02.059> this<00:01:02.449> is<00:01:02.569> how<00:01:02.690> you<00:01:02.749> do<00:01:02.960> it<00:01:04.210> but<00:01:05.210> really

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
idea this is how you do it but really

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.780 
idea this is how you do it but really
nice<00:01:05.930> wait<00:01:06.170> it's<00:01:06.380> a<00:01:06.470> little<00:01:06.770> cheap<00:01:07.280> coffee

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
nice wait it's a little cheap coffee

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.959 
nice wait it's a little cheap coffee
grinder<00:01:09.009> so<00:01:10.009> the<00:01:10.159> first<00:01:10.430> thing<00:01:10.640> I'm<00:01:10.759> going<00:01:10.790> to

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.240 
trilobal black because that will darken
the<00:01:49.039> cast<00:01:50.079> the<00:01:51.079> cast<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.710> shade

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.980 

one<00:01:54.910> thing<00:01:55.030> you<00:01:55.150> don't<00:01:55.330> want<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.660> do<00:01:55.750> is<00:01:55.870> get

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
one thing you don't want to do is get

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.090 
one thing you don't want to do is get
too<00:01:56.320> much<00:01:56.590> fur<00:01:57.250> in<00:01:57.580> this<00:01:58.030> blender<00:01:58.840> because<00:01:59.800> it

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
too much fur in this blender because it

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.050 
too much fur in this blender because it
will<00:02:00.370> wad<00:02:00.910> up<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:02.080> if<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:02.830> use<00:02:03.070> angora<00:02:03.580> goat

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
will wad up and if you use angora goat

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.840 
will wad up and if you use angora goat
you<00:02:04.510> need<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.900> trim<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.410> fibers<00:02:05.920> because<00:02:06.700> if

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
you need to trim the fibers because if

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.460 
you need to trim the fibers because if
the<00:02:07.000> fibers<00:02:07.360> are<00:02:07.479> too<00:02:07.660> long<00:02:07.870> they'll<00:02:08.200> wrap

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
the fibers are too long they'll wrap

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.449 
the fibers are too long they'll wrap
around<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.950> post<00:02:09.160> but<00:02:09.490> here's<00:02:11.370> here's<00:02:12.370> the

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
around the post but here's here's the

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.820 
around the post but here's here's the
color<00:02:12.820> you<00:02:13.030> get<00:02:13.240> and<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:16.060> see<00:02:16.270> it's<00:02:16.660> different

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
color you get and you see it's different

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.580 
color you get and you see it's different
than<00:02:17.830> any<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.340> these<00:02:18.490> now<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:19.260> really<00:02:20.260> want<00:02:20.500> a
