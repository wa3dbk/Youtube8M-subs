believe I'm gonna have to find out

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.790 
believe I'm gonna have to find out
because<00:03:51.239> I've<00:03:51.390> seen<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.660> so<00:03:51.780> many<00:03:51.810> places<00:03:52.110> but

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
because I've seen it so many places but

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.990 
because I've seen it so many places but
I'll<00:03:52.860> put<00:03:53.010> that<00:03:53.100> on<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.280> screen<00:03:53.430> as<00:03:53.610> well<00:03:53.760> but

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
these turned out so I did this crude a

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.700 
these turned out so I did this crude a
doughnut<00:04:45.300> and<00:04:45.480> I<00:04:46.050> really<00:04:46.320> like<00:04:46.440> this<00:04:46.560> one

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
doughnut and I really like this one

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.020 
doughnut and I really like this one
cause<00:04:46.860> it's<00:04:47.010> kind<00:04:47.160> of<00:04:47.250> translucent<00:04:47.640> all<00:04:47.940> the

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
cause it's kind of translucent all the

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.250 
cause it's kind of translucent all the
other<00:04:48.150> ones<00:04:48.330> I've<00:04:48.450> done<00:04:48.630> I've<00:04:48.750> gone<00:04:48.870> opaque

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
other ones I've done I've gone opaque

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.020 
other ones I've done I've gone opaque
but<00:04:49.500> I<00:04:49.560> must<00:04:49.770> have<00:04:49.890> used<00:04:50.070> less<00:04:50.430> pigment<00:04:50.940> in

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
but I must have used less pigment in

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.490 
but I must have used less pigment in
this<00:04:51.150> one<00:04:51.300> but<00:04:51.750> I<00:04:51.780> really<00:04:51.930> like<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:52.350> way<00:04:52.440> this

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.150 
this one but I really like the way this
one<00:04:52.680> came<00:04:52.860> out<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:54.140> then<00:04:55.140> there's<00:04:55.410> this<00:04:55.710> plain

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
one came out and then there's this plain

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.060 
one came out and then there's this plain
macaron<00:04:57.020> just<00:04:58.020> this<00:04:58.200> strawberry<00:04:58.500> pink<00:04:58.860> one

and I didn't put any white paint in the

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.700 
and I didn't put any white paint in the
icing<00:05:03.420> pots<00:05:03.630> because<00:05:03.840> I've<00:05:04.020> just<00:05:04.050> you<00:05:04.560> know<00:05:04.680> I

forgot because it's why I forget that it
dries<00:05:06.630> translucent<00:05:07.200> but<00:05:07.290> I<00:05:07.350> actually<00:05:07.440> really

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
dries translucent but I actually really

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.830 
dries translucent but I actually really
like<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.920> way<00:05:07.950> it<00:05:08.100> came<00:05:08.220> out<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:08.700> so<00:05:09.630> let<00:05:09.810> me

some icing and all that good stuff and

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.920 
some icing and all that good stuff and
then<00:05:22.680> last<00:05:23.190> but<00:05:23.370> not<00:05:23.520> least<00:05:23.790> I<00:05:24.120> sort<00:05:24.750> of<00:05:24.780> like

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
then last but not least I sort of like

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.380 
then last but not least I sort of like
the<00:05:25.080> people<00:05:25.410> this<00:05:25.530> is<00:05:25.590> a<00:05:25.710> complete<00:05:26.100> fail<00:05:26.430> but

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
the people this is a complete fail but

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.390 
the people this is a complete fail but
I've<00:05:27.510> been<00:05:27.630> trying<00:05:27.870> flat<00:05:28.170> back<00:05:28.380> jeebies<00:05:28.860> or

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
I've been trying flat back jeebies or

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.660 
I've been trying flat back jeebies or
like<00:05:29.940> pendulum<00:05:30.420> kind<00:05:30.630> of<00:05:30.690> chewy<00:05:30.840> things<00:05:31.140> and

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
like pendulum kind of chewy things and

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.040 
like pendulum kind of chewy things and
it<00:05:32.670> was<00:05:32.820> my<00:05:32.970> first<00:05:33.150> time<00:05:33.360> trying<00:05:33.540> out<00:05:33.720> the<00:05:33.840> Jade

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
it was my first time trying out the Jade

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.450 
it was my first time trying out the Jade
color<00:05:34.320> of<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:34.590> new<00:05:34.740> one<00:05:34.920> but<00:05:35.070> I<00:05:35.130> don't<00:05:35.310> really

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
color of the new one but I don't really

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.980 
color of the new one but I don't really
like<00:05:35.550> it<00:05:35.880> and<00:05:36.060> I<00:05:36.180> didn't<00:05:36.450> come<00:05:36.570> out<00:05:36.660> the<00:05:36.810> color

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
like it and I didn't come out the color

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.630 
like it and I didn't come out the color
that<00:05:37.170> we<00:05:37.230> thought<00:05:37.410> it<00:05:37.590> would<00:05:37.710> so<00:05:38.310> it's<00:05:38.430> kind<00:05:38.610> of

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
that we thought it would so it's kind of

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.200 
that we thought it would so it's kind of
ruined<00:05:38.880> it

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
ruined it

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.520 
ruined it
but<00:05:39.420> the<00:05:39.510> chibi<00:05:39.750> wasn't<00:05:39.960> very<00:05:40.080> good<00:05:40.200> to<00:05:40.290> start

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
but the chibi wasn't very good to start

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.250 
but the chibi wasn't very good to start
with<00:05:40.710> it<00:05:40.980> doesn't<00:05:41.070> really<00:05:41.340> matter<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:42.260> then

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
with it doesn't really matter and then

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.720 
with it doesn't really matter and then
this<00:05:43.650> shows<00:05:43.830> you<00:05:44.010> how<00:05:44.190> fun<00:05:44.340> would<00:05:44.460> go<00:05:44.610> these

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
this shows you how fun would go these

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:45.860 
this shows you how fun would go these
charms<00:05:45.150> were<00:05:45.240> hence<00:05:45.510> why<00:05:45.600> I<00:05:45.630> can't<00:05:45.840> remember

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
charms were hence why I can't remember

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.900 
charms were hence why I can't remember
who<00:05:46.170> they're<00:05:46.320> inspired<00:05:46.680> by<00:05:46.830> and<00:05:47.490> they're<00:05:47.880> I

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
who they're inspired by and they're I

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.520 
who they're inspired by and they're I
made<00:05:48.300> this<00:05:48.420> when<00:05:48.570> we<00:05:48.690> first<00:05:48.840> saw<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.110> new<00:05:49.320> Star

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
made this when we first saw the new Star

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.900 
made this when we first saw the new Star
Trek<00:05:49.560> which<00:05:50.070> is<00:05:50.220> not<00:05:50.340> actually<00:05:50.580> new<00:05:50.730> anymore

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
Trek which is not actually new anymore

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.240 
Trek which is not actually new anymore
but<00:05:51.600> yes<00:05:51.900> just<00:05:51.930> this<00:05:52.290> spot<00:05:52.500> pendant<00:05:52.920> with<00:05:53.040> them

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
but yes just this spot pendant with them

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.340 
but yes just this spot pendant with them
stars<00:05:53.670> and<00:05:54.180> he's<00:05:54.690> got<00:05:54.870> this<00:05:54.930> really<00:05:55.080> bored

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
stars and he's got this really bored

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.010 
stars and he's got this really bored
face<00:05:55.590> and<00:05:55.980> his<00:05:56.100> little<00:05:56.250> badge<00:05:56.490> and<00:05:56.880> the<00:05:57.810> eye

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
face and his little badge and the eye

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.510 
face and his little badge and the eye
the<00:05:58.140> eyes<00:05:58.620> look<00:05:58.860> kind<00:05:59.040> of<00:05:59.070> weird<00:05:59.190> because<00:05:59.370> the

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
the eyes look kind of weird because the

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.080 
the eyes look kind of weird because the
glaze<00:05:59.730> did<00:06:00.030> something<00:06:00.470> terribly<00:06:01.470> funky<00:06:01.860> but<00:06:02.310> I

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
glaze did something terribly funky but I

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.390 
glaze did something terribly funky but I
don't<00:06:03.690> really<00:06:04.320> mind<00:06:04.620> it<00:06:04.830> I<00:06:04.920> think<00:06:05.160> it's<00:06:05.250> quite
