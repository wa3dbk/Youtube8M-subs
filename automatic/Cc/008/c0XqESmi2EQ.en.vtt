00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
sniper rifle definitely the best bold

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.350 
sniper rifle definitely the best bold
action<00:00:55.980> between<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> ballista<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.059> itself

action between the ballista and itself

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.569 
action between the ballista and itself
the<00:00:57.660> blister<00:00:58.050> does<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> quikr<00:00:58.800> bolt

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.049 
the blister does have a quikr bolt
action<00:01:00.500> but<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.800> power<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.879> gon

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
action but the power and this gon

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.910 
action but the power and this gon
definitely<00:01:03.239> contradicts<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.199> decision<00:01:04.680> on

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
definitely contradicts the decision on

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.880 
definitely contradicts the decision on
which<00:01:05.400> bold<00:01:05.700> action<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.119> better<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.890> probably

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
which bold action is better and probably

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.250 
which bold action is better and probably
in<00:01:08.220> good<00:01:08.700> hands<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> most<00:01:10.110> powerful
