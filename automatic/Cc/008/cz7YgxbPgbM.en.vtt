and<00:02:33.670> it's<00:02:34.240> also<00:02:34.390> raised<00:02:34.660> three<00:02:34.900> millimeters

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
and it's also raised three millimeters

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.050 
and it's also raised three millimeters
in<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.530> rear<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:35.980> provide<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.880> with<00:02:37.030> a

in the rear to provide you with a

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.780 
in the rear to provide you with a
tighter<00:02:37.360> turning<00:02:37.810> radius<00:02:37.960> and<00:02:38.790> that's

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
tighter turning radius and that's

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.940 
tighter turning radius and that's
obviously<00:02:40.540> going<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.750> help<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:41.110> pull<00:02:41.680> tighter

obviously going to help you pull tighter
turns<00:02:42.280> higher<00:02:42.670> speeds<00:02:43.230> basically<00:02:44.230> give<00:02:44.440> you

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
turns higher speeds basically give you

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.720 
turns higher speeds basically give you
more<00:02:44.740> control<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:47.730> high-density

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
more control and that high-density

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.180 
more control and that high-density

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.110 
great
a<00:03:44.830> lot<00:03:45.250> better<00:03:45.370> than<00:03:45.489> it<00:03:45.700> does<00:03:45.790> online

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
a lot better than it does online

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.759 
a lot better than it does online
actually<00:03:46.390> when<00:03:46.750> I<00:03:46.780> saw<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.019> in<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.260> store<00:03:47.290> I

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
actually when I saw it in the store I

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.890 
actually when I saw it in the store I
thought<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.519> was<00:03:48.640> one<00:03:49.450> of<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.600> best-looking

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
thought it was one of the best-looking

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.320 
thought it was one of the best-looking
skates<00:03:50.459> another<00:03:51.459> thing<00:03:51.670> I'm<00:03:51.820> missing<00:03:51.940> here

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
skates another thing I'm missing here

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.280 
skates another thing I'm missing here
would<00:03:52.840> be<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:54.450> right<00:03:55.450> here<00:03:55.690> this<00:03:56.050> little

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
would be the right here this little

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.190 
would be the right here this little
trigger<00:03:56.590> what<00:03:57.310> this<00:03:57.489> does<00:03:57.730> is<00:03:58.030> when<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:58.989> pull

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
trigger what this does is when you pull

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.009 
trigger what this does is when you pull
on<00:03:59.230> it<00:03:59.850> you<00:04:00.850> can<00:04:01.030> release<00:04:01.300> the<00:04:01.480> blade<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:01.959> you

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
on it you can release the blade and you

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.710 
on it you can release the blade and you
can<00:04:02.769> put<00:04:03.040> a<00:04:03.070> new<00:04:03.340> blade<00:04:03.580> and<00:04:03.880> that<00:04:04.060> works<00:04:04.300> for

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
can put a new blade and that works for

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.660 
can put a new blade and that works for
different<00:04:05.170> ice<00:04:05.500> surfaces<00:04:06.040> believe<00:04:06.370> it<00:04:06.459> or<00:04:06.519> not

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
different ice surfaces believe it or not

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.000 
different ice surfaces believe it or not
it<00:04:07.420> gets<00:04:07.570> very<00:04:07.870> picky<00:04:08.230> if<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.410> ice<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:08.769> hard

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
it gets very picky if the ice is hard

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.150 
it gets very picky if the ice is hard
soft<00:04:09.580> medium<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:11.200> can<00:04:11.350> interchange<00:04:11.620> blades

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
soft medium you can interchange blades

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.219 
soft medium you can interchange blades
the<00:04:13.120> way<00:04:13.239> you<00:04:13.299> sharpen<00:04:13.720> them<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:15.160> break<00:04:15.430> steel

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
the way you sharpen them you break steel

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.599 
the way you sharpen them you break steel
basically<00:04:17.229> any<00:04:17.500> way<00:04:17.709> you<00:04:17.769> can<00:04:17.979> possibly<00:04:18.160> screw

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
basically any way you can possibly screw

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.699 
basically any way you can possibly screw
up<00:04:18.700> your<00:04:18.850> blade<00:04:19.030> if<00:04:19.479> you're<00:04:20.200> that<00:04:20.350> person<00:04:20.530> that

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
up your blade if you're that person that

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.620 
up your blade if you're that person that
does<00:04:20.950> it<00:04:21.130> you<00:04:21.280> know<00:04:21.669> it's<00:04:21.789> totally<00:04:21.940> fine<00:04:22.300> all

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630

you<00:04:22.750> do<00:04:22.900> is<00:04:23.020> pull<00:04:23.229> the<00:04:23.260> trigger<00:04:23.350> popping<00:04:24.280> the

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
you do is pull the trigger popping the

new set of blades and you're back on the

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.180 
new set of blades and you're back on the
ice<00:04:26.500> and

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
ice and

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.010
