00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.730
 like twilight there 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.900
 between light and shadow there is in the mind 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:41.620
 an unknown area in which everything is 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.290
 possible it could be called the dimension 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.390
 of imagination a dimension 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.239
 unknown in which events are born and 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.950
 extraordinary things like those that now 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:57.040
 let's see that it is not possible everything is 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:02.100
 possible in the reign of the mind all 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.100
 it is possible in the unknown dimension 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.130
 we have always been intrigued by the 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.890
 brain to him have been attributed powers 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.770
 extraordinary and has been the protagonist 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.840
 of countless films and shows still 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.970
 leaving the fantasy of our side 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.310
 brain is by far the most 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.259
 complex that we have the most 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.180
 it's hard to understand and in which the 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.030
 science has many mysteries by 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.310
 solve is that perhaps we can analyze 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.940
 the functioning of the brain using 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.940
 another brain 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.409
 go ahead and discover how it works 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.119
 our brain and how can it help you 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.119
 that you become what he did
