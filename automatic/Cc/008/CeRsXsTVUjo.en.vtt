this<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:02.040> my<00:00:02.250> Wisconsin<00:00:03.000> Model<00:00:03.330> T<00:00:03.510> FD<00:00:03.659> engine

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
this is my Wisconsin Model T FD engine

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.839 
this is my Wisconsin Model T FD engine
right<00:00:04.470> here<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:06.919> have<00:00:07.919> built<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:08.490> current

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
right here I have built this current

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.240 
right here I have built this current
Ford<00:00:09.030> actually<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.389> built<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.750> yesterday

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
Ford actually I built it yesterday

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.499 
Ford actually I built it yesterday
because<00:00:11.250> this<00:00:11.700> engine<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.120> sitting<00:00:12.389> outside

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
because this engine is sitting outside

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.839 
because this engine is sitting outside
and<00:00:12.960> it's<00:00:13.110> quite<00:00:13.380> heavy<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.830> probably<00:00:14.670> weighs

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
and it's quite heavy and probably weighs

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.630 
and it's quite heavy and probably weighs
a<00:00:15.000> good<00:00:15.179> 200<00:00:15.599> pounds<00:00:15.990> or<00:00:16.080> more<00:00:16.490> it's<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
a good 200 pounds or more it's the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.170 
a good 200 pounds or more it's the
pretty<00:00:17.850> heavy<00:00:18.060> sucker<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:19.850> had<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.939> start

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
pretty heavy sucker and I had to start

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.330 
pretty heavy sucker and I had to start
working<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.080> could<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.920> know<00:00:23.039> get<00:00:23.220> it

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
working on so I could you know get it

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.179 
working on so I could you know get it
running<00:00:23.960> the<00:00:24.960> only<00:00:25.050> work<00:00:25.260> I've<00:00:25.439> done<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:25.920> so

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
running the only work I've done to it so

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.960 
running the only work I've done to it so
far<00:00:27.380> well<00:00:28.380> sitting<00:00:28.740> outside<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.640> I

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
far well sitting outside was that I

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.880 
far well sitting outside was that I
managed<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.599> get<00:00:30.750> all<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> shrouds<00:00:31.230> off<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.800> I

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
managed to get all the shrouds off and I

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.220 
managed to get all the shrouds off and I
access<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.820> valve<00:00:33.030> pieces<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:33.750> here

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
access the valve pieces right here

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.920 
access the valve pieces right here
there's<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.980> cover<00:00:35.160> there<00:00:35.719> and<00:00:36.719> there's<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
there's a cover there and there's a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.190 
there's a cover there and there's a
cover<00:00:37.140> back<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:39.050> freed<00:00:40.050> up<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
cover back in there and freed up the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.690 
cover back in there and freed up the
stuck<00:00:40.530> valve<00:00:40.739> which<00:00:41.070> was<00:00:41.219> stopping<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
stuck valve which was stopping the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.950 
stuck valve which was stopping the
engine<00:00:41.790> from<00:00:42.059> turning<00:00:42.329> all<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> way<00:00:42.600> over<00:00:43.550> now

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.560 

you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.110> see<00:00:51.469> it<00:00:52.469> turns<00:00:52.739> all<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.949> way<00:00:53.070> over

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
you can see it turns all the way over

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.180 
you can see it turns all the way over
and<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.989> wheel<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.350> was<00:00:55.500> turning<00:00:55.829> right<00:00:55.920> here

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and that wheel I was turning right here

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.470 
and that wheel I was turning right here
that<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.059> how<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.210> start<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.660> engine<00:00:59.270> grab<00:01:00.270> on

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
that is how you start the engine grab on

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.820 
that is how you start the engine grab on
to<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.629> wheel<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.809> turn<00:01:03.830> fairbanks-morse

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
to the wheel and turn fairbanks-morse

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.140 
to the wheel and turn fairbanks-morse
magneto<00:01:05.610> right<00:01:05.790> here

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
magneto right here

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.690 
magneto right here
and<00:01:07.020> then<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.229> spark<00:01:07.590> at<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> moment<00:01:08.130> that's

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
and then I spark at the moment that's

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.980 
and then I spark at the moment that's
okay<00:01:09.060> I'll<00:01:09.150> fix<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:11.720> our<00:01:12.720> normal

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
okay I'll fix it and our normal

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.679 
okay I'll fix it and our normal
Wisconsin<00:01:13.799> engine<00:01:14.360> right<00:01:15.360> here<00:01:15.570> would<00:01:15.630> be

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
Wisconsin engine right here would be

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.969

rate here's how you primed the fuel pump
right<00:02:43.350> here<00:02:44.150> because<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.300> fuel<00:02:45.480> tank<00:02:45.750> will<00:02:45.840> be

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
right here because the fuel tank will be

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.390 
right here because the fuel tank will be
below<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.440> engine<00:02:48.740> here's<00:02:49.740> what's<00:02:49.950> left<00:02:50.010> of
