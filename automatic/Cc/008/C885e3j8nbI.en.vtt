00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.930 
drawings I feel I can get more of the
personal<00:01:59.350> mark<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.740> I<00:01:59.830> want<00:02:00.100> in<00:02:00.670> the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
personal mark that I want in the

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.530 
personal mark that I want in the
painting<00:02:01.330> and<00:02:02.220> listen<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.460> that<00:02:03.820> inner<00:02:04.120> vision

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
painting and listen to that inner vision

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.260 
painting and listen to that inner vision
and<00:02:04.810> spirit<00:02:05.460> rather<00:02:06.460> than<00:02:06.670> referring<00:02:07.120> to<00:02:07.240> a

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
and spirit rather than referring to a

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.580 
and spirit rather than referring to a
photograph<00:02:07.720> but<00:02:07.870> everybody<00:02:08.379> works

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
photograph but everybody works

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.350 
photograph but everybody works
differently<00:02:09.069> so<00:02:09.369> regardless<00:02:09.849> of<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.179> way<00:02:10.300> you

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
differently so regardless of the way you

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.690 
differently so regardless of the way you
work<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:11.440> subject<00:02:11.860> matter<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.100> you<00:02:12.250> work<00:02:12.490> on

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
work the subject matter that you work on

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.400 
work the subject matter that you work on
these<00:02:12.910> are<00:02:13.120> some<00:02:13.300> things<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.690> think<00:02:13.900> about<00:02:13.990> so

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
these are some things to think about so

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.080 
these are some things to think about so
I'm<00:02:14.890> going<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.070> dive<00:02:15.310> in<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.700> I'm<00:02:15.790> going<00:02:15.880> to

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
I'm going to dive in and I'm going to

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.970 
I'm going to dive in and I'm going to
most<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.720> paper<00:02:16.930> I've<00:02:17.200> actually<00:02:17.620> toned

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
most of the paper I've actually toned

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.880 
most of the paper I've actually toned
the<00:02:18.280> paper<00:02:18.959> right<00:02:19.959> there<00:02:20.349> at<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.560> water's

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
the paper right there at the water's

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.920 
the paper right there at the water's
edge<00:02:21.099> with<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.489> little<00:02:21.879> Naples<00:02:22.300> yellow<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.720> kind

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.770 
edge with a little Naples yellow it kind
of<00:02:22.989> looks<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.230> little<00:02:23.319> dark<00:02:23.620> now<00:02:23.860> but<00:02:23.890> once<00:02:24.370> I

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
of looks a little dark now but once I

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.300 
of looks a little dark now but once I
put<00:02:25.780> this<00:02:25.989> color<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.349> and<00:02:26.709> get<00:02:26.830> some<00:02:27.010> value

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
put this color on and get some value

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.009 
put this color on and get some value
going<00:02:27.610> it's<00:02:27.760> going<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.060> come<00:02:28.269> to<00:02:28.420> life<00:02:28.599> and<00:02:28.930> it

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
going it's going to come to life and it

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.780 
going it's going to come to life and it
will<00:02:29.110> just<00:02:29.319> be<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.500> soft<00:02:29.920> yellow<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.640> will

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
will just be a soft yellow that will

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.660 
will just be a soft yellow that will
look<00:02:30.940> like<00:02:31.150> morning<00:02:32.110> light<00:02:32.370> bouncing<00:02:33.370> off<00:02:33.489> the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
look like morning light bouncing off the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.539 
look like morning light bouncing off the
water<00:02:33.879> so<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.599> first<00:02:34.780> thing<00:02:34.959> I'm<00:02:35.019> going<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.200> do

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
water so the first thing I'm going to do

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:41.400 
water so the first thing I'm going to do
is<00:02:36.549> just<00:02:37.390> wet<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.980> paper<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:40.330> is<00:02:40.390> 300<00:02:41.200> pound

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
is just wet this paper this is 300 pound

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.170 
is just wet this paper this is 300 pound
paper<00:02:41.709> it's<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.160> richest<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.730> premium

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180

paper<00:02:43.980> rough<00:02:45.090> 300<00:02:46.090> pound<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:47.040> I've<00:02:48.040> cut<00:02:48.340> it

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
paper rough 300 pound and I've cut it

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.000 
paper rough 300 pound and I've cut it
down<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.920> size<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:52.690> like<00:02:53.319> to<00:02:53.500> work<00:02:53.650> large

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
down to a size I like to work large

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.670 
down to a size I like to work large
normally<00:02:54.790> I'm<00:02:54.910> using<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.329> three<00:02:55.630> inch<00:02:55.780> flat

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
normally I'm using a three inch flat

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.380 
normally I'm using a three inch flat
brush<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:58.170> apply<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.500> water<00:03:00.250> right<00:03:00.790> now<00:03:01.000> so

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
brush to apply the water right now so

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.119 
brush to apply the water right now so
I'm<00:03:01.510> going<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.690> start<00:03:01.989> with<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.590> Naples

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
I'm going to start with the Naples

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.789 
I'm going to start with the Naples
yellow<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.989> little<00:03:05.019> ultramarine<00:03:05.769> violet

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
yellow and a little ultramarine violet

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.520 
yellow and a little ultramarine violet
and<00:03:06.340> that's<00:03:07.269> going<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.540> be<00:03:07.720> kind<00:03:07.989> of<00:03:08.079> a<00:03:08.230> common

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
and that's going to be kind of a common

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.009 
and that's going to be kind of a common
tone<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:10.090> will<00:03:10.299> work<00:03:10.510> with<00:03:10.840> this

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
tone that will work with this

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.240 
tone that will work with this
composition<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:13.049> we'll<00:03:14.049> kind<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.860> get<00:03:15.040> that

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
composition and we'll kind of get that

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.250 
composition and we'll kind of get that
washed<00:03:15.640> in<00:03:15.940> throughout<00:03:16.510> most<00:03:16.989> of<00:03:17.170> the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
washed in throughout most of the

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.350 
washed in throughout most of the
composition<00:03:17.920> then<00:03:18.579> I'm<00:03:18.670> going<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.000> start

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
composition then I'm going to start

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.750 
composition then I'm going to start
charging<00:03:19.720> other<00:03:20.139> color<00:03:20.440> in<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.459> I'm<00:03:21.549> going<00:03:21.700> to

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
charging other color in so I'm going to

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.699 
charging other color in so I'm going to
push<00:03:21.970> that<00:03:22.000> down<00:03:22.389> just<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:23.079> little<00:03:23.290> more<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.620> the

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
push that down just a little more to the

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.849 
push that down just a little more to the
vial<00:03:23.889> side<00:03:24.420> keeping<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.510> value<00:03:27.000> fairly<00:03:28.859> kind

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
vial side keeping the value fairly kind

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.150 
vial side keeping the value fairly kind
of<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:30.040> middle<00:03:30.400> middle<00:03:30.940> value<00:03:31.389> I<00:03:32.010> want<00:03:33.010> that

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
of a middle middle value I want that

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.210 
of a middle middle value I want that
feeling<00:03:33.400> of<00:03:33.700> kind<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.060> soft<00:03:34.359> morning<00:03:35.019> light<00:03:35.230> so

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
feeling of kind of soft morning light so

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.789 
feeling of kind of soft morning light so
we'll<00:03:36.430> just<00:03:36.609> take<00:03:36.849> that<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:37.530> get<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.560> little

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
we'll just take that and get a little

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.539 
we'll just take that and get a little
bit<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.220> that<00:03:39.370> quality<00:03:40.769> into<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.799> composition

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
bit of that quality into the composition

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.539 
bit of that quality into the composition
as<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:43.239> moves<00:03:43.450> up<00:03:43.660> towards<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.109> top<00:03:44.549> I'm

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
as it moves up towards the top I'm

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.620 
as it moves up towards the top I'm
covering<00:03:46.419> most<00:03:46.630> of<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:46.900> paper<00:03:47.139> with<00:03:48.130> this

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
covering most of the paper with this

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.449 
covering most of the paper with this
just<00:03:49.630> let<00:03:50.049> this<00:03:50.290> kind<00:03:50.620> of<00:03:50.769> happen<00:03:53.280> then<00:03:54.280> I'll

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
just let this kind of happen then I'll

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.789 
just let this kind of happen then I'll
start<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:55.019> hone<00:03:56.019> in<00:03:56.230> a<00:03:56.290> little<00:03:56.470> bit

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
start to hone in a little bit

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.530 
start to hone in a little bit
so<00:03:57.130> I'm<00:03:57.459> going<00:03:57.669> to<00:03:57.730> take<00:03:57.910> a<00:03:57.970> little<00:03:58.269> of<00:03:58.359> this

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
so I'm going to take a little of this

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.979 
so I'm going to take a little of this
Viridian<00:03:59.970> with<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:03.510> with<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.660> ultramarine

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
Viridian with the with the ultramarine

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.849 
Viridian with the with the ultramarine
violet<00:04:05.579> and<00:04:06.599> get<00:04:07.599> some<00:04:07.870> of<00:04:08.019> that<00:04:08.049> happening

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
violet and get some of that happening

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.960 
violet and get some of that happening
here<00:04:09.190> just<00:04:09.690> lay<00:04:10.690> some<00:04:10.989> of<00:04:11.019> that<00:04:11.139> down<00:04:11.970> it's

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
here just lay some of that down it's

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.699 
here just lay some of that down it's
some<00:04:13.239> of<00:04:13.329> that<00:04:13.450> going<00:04:13.750> take<00:04:14.079> a<00:04:14.109> little<00:04:14.410> of<00:04:14.560> that

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
some of that going take a little of that

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.940 
some of that going take a little of that
manganese<00:04:15.190> violet

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
manganese violet

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.569 
manganese violet
and<00:04:18.180> lay<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.209> little<00:04:19.510> of<00:04:19.750> that<00:04:19.959> in<00:04:20.019> and<00:04:20.680> we'll

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
and lay a little of that in and we'll

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.180 
and lay a little of that in and we'll
just<00:04:21.609> push<00:04:22.060> this<00:04:22.599> end<00:04:22.960> get<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.200> little<00:04:23.500> darker

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
just push this end get a little darker

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.180 
just push this end get a little darker
value<00:04:25.050> into<00:04:26.050> some<00:04:26.260> of<00:04:26.349> these<00:04:26.409> areas<00:04:26.680> but<00:04:26.950> catch

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
value into some of these areas but catch

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.399 
value into some of these areas but catch
it<00:04:27.400> while<00:04:27.550> it's<00:04:27.729> still<00:04:27.820> wet<00:04:28.270> so<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.020> can<00:04:29.229> get

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
it while it's still wet so I can get

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.920 
it while it's still wet so I can get
just<00:04:29.680> a

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
just a

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.029 
just a
kind<00:04:30.139> of<00:04:30.229> a<00:04:30.289> nice<00:04:30.530> general<00:04:33.639> shape<00:04:34.639> and<00:04:35.419> value

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
kind of a nice general shape and value

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.029 
kind of a nice general shape and value
that's<00:04:37.039> going<00:04:37.520> to<00:04:37.669> move<00:04:37.880> up<00:04:38.800> through<00:04:39.800> the

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
that's going to move up through the

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.120 
that's going to move up through the
composition<00:04:40.460> here<00:04:41.000> see<00:04:41.780> as<00:04:42.050> I'm<00:04:42.740> doing<00:04:42.919> this

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
composition here see as I'm doing this

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.129 
composition here see as I'm doing this
you<00:04:43.340> see<00:04:43.520> that<00:04:43.729> stronger<00:04:44.180> dark<00:04:44.449> it<00:04:44.690> starts<00:04:45.020> to

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
you see that stronger dark it starts to

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.930 
you see that stronger dark it starts to
make<00:04:45.289> that<00:04:45.560> pop<00:04:46.479> and<00:04:47.919> I'll<00:04:48.919> vary<00:04:49.280> this<00:04:49.550> so<00:04:49.820> it's

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
make that pop and I'll vary this so it's

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.879 
make that pop and I'll vary this so it's
not<00:04:50.120> all<00:04:50.389> the<00:04:50.419> same<00:04:50.600> color<00:04:51.169> in<00:04:51.259> the<00:04:51.440> same<00:04:51.620> dark

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
not all the same color in the same dark

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.710 
not all the same color in the same dark
coming<00:04:52.669> in<00:04:52.940> with<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:53.150> little<00:04:53.479> of<00:04:53.539> that

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
coming in with a little of that

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.980 
coming in with a little of that
manganese<00:04:54.110> violet<00:04:55.840> this<00:04:56.840> is<00:04:58.630> you<00:04:59.630> can<00:04:59.750> see

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
manganese violet this is you can see

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.230 
manganese violet this is you can see
just<00:05:00.169> through<00:05:00.410> there<00:05:00.850> starting<00:05:01.850> to<00:05:02.000> bring

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
just through there starting to bring

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.680 
just through there starting to bring
that<00:05:02.449> out<00:05:02.720> and<00:05:05.680> as<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.710> papers<00:05:07.250> dryer<00:05:07.690> you

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
that out and as the papers dryer you

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.170 
that out and as the papers dryer you
know<00:05:08.780> that's<00:05:08.990> a<00:05:09.110> good<00:05:09.259> thing<00:05:09.320> I<00:05:10.310> think<00:05:10.759> well

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
know that's a good thing I think well

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.150 
know that's a good thing I think well
that's<00:05:11.330> still<00:05:12.550> a<00:05:13.550> little<00:05:14.060> damp<00:05:14.270> up<00:05:14.539> there<00:05:15.160> I'm

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
that's still a little damp up there I'm

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.850 
that's still a little damp up there I'm
going<00:05:16.340> to<00:05:16.400> move<00:05:16.520> back<00:05:16.820> down<00:05:17.410> work<00:05:18.410> in<00:05:18.590> another

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
going to move back down work in another

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.010 
going to move back down work in another
area<00:05:20.860> checking<00:05:21.860> see<00:05:22.699> how<00:05:22.910> damp<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.479> paper<00:05:23.720> is

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
area checking see how damp the paper is

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.939 
area checking see how damp the paper is
how<00:05:24.289> dry<00:05:24.650> or<00:05:24.919> how<00:05:25.009> damp<00:05:25.310> it<00:05:25.490> is<00:05:25.610> and<00:05:26.770> the<00:05:27.770> reason

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
how dry or how damp it is and the reason

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.400 
how dry or how damp it is and the reason
for<00:05:28.340> that<00:05:28.400> is<00:05:28.789> I<00:05:28.940> want<00:05:29.210> a<00:05:29.330> stroke<00:05:29.660> or<00:05:29.870> two<00:05:30.080> that

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
for that is I want a stroke or two that

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.890 
for that is I want a stroke or two that
has<00:05:31.130> a<00:05:31.160> dryness<00:05:31.940> to<00:05:32.389> it<00:05:33.039> you<00:05:34.039> see<00:05:34.070> I<00:05:34.310> want<00:05:34.610> that

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
has a dryness to it you see I want that

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.960 
has a dryness to it you see I want that
sparkle<00:05:35.900> and<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.139> dryness<00:05:36.580> that's<00:05:37.580> coming

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
sparkle and the dryness that's coming

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.680 
sparkle and the dryness that's coming
across<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.510> composition<00:05:39.289> and<00:05:40.479> so<00:05:41.479> we'll

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
across the composition and so we'll

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.230 
across the composition and so we'll
we'll<00:05:42.080> just<00:05:42.849> make<00:05:43.849> that<00:05:44.060> happen

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
we'll just make that happen

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.020 
we'll just make that happen
and<00:05:47.240> so<00:05:47.510> you<00:05:47.570> just<00:05:47.750> kind<00:05:47.990> of<00:05:48.110> let<00:05:48.409> that<00:05:49.030> Sparkle

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
and so you just kind of let that Sparkle

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.210 
and so you just kind of let that Sparkle
happen<00:05:50.510> because<00:05:50.659> of<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:51.050> paper<00:05:51.260> I<00:05:51.620> come<00:05:52.010> down

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
happen because of the paper I come down

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.610 
happen because of the paper I come down
in<00:05:52.430> here<00:05:53.380> I'm<00:05:54.380> going<00:05:54.770> to<00:05:54.889> hit<00:05:55.190> of<00:05:56.020> a<00:05:57.020> note<00:05:57.349> or

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
in here I'm going to hit of a note or

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:05.100 
in here I'm going to hit of a note or
two<00:05:59.229> it's<00:06:00.229> going<00:06:00.470> to<00:06:02.139> be<00:06:03.139> basically<00:06:03.800> a

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
two it's going to be basically a

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:17.970 
two it's going to be basically a
reflection<00:06:06.110> of<00:06:07.270> this<00:06:10.630> of<00:06:11.630> this<00:06:13.750> treat

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.130 

just<00:06:18.980> get<00:06:19.160> a<00:06:19.190> feel<00:06:19.550> for<00:06:19.580> that<00:06:19.820> come<00:06:20.630> back<00:06:20.840> to<00:06:20.900> a

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
just get a feel for that come back to a

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:28.440 
just get a feel for that come back to a
little<00:06:21.670> deeper<00:06:23.230> green<00:06:24.230> and<00:06:24.590> pick<00:06:25.430> that<00:06:25.640> up

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.350 

down<00:06:29.450> in<00:06:29.480> through<00:06:29.870> here<00:06:30.350> and<00:06:31.060> let<00:06:32.060> some<00:06:32.330> of

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
down in through here and let some of

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.650 
down in through here and let some of
that<00:06:32.480> even<00:06:32.960> move<00:06:34.690> down<00:06:35.690> below<00:06:37.660> reflections

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
that even move down below reflections

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.690 
that even move down below reflections
can<00:06:38.900> actually<00:06:41.200> kind<00:06:42.200> of<00:06:42.320> just<00:06:42.530> pull<00:06:43.040> all<00:06:43.430> the

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
can actually kind of just pull all the

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:49.180 
can actually kind of just pull all the
way<00:06:43.730> through<00:06:44.060> there<00:06:44.270> and<00:06:46.480> so<00:06:47.480> that's<00:06:48.190> soften

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
way through there and so that's soften

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.980 
way through there and so that's soften
an<00:06:49.280> edge<00:06:49.460> or<00:06:49.640> two<00:06:49.790> and<00:06:50.060> it<00:06:50.480> gives<00:06:50.660> me<00:06:50.810> nice

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
an edge or two and it gives me nice

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.190 
an edge or two and it gives me nice
vertical<00:06:52.210> pattern<00:06:53.210> that's<00:06:53.570> going<00:06:53.720> to<00:06:53.780> repeat

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
vertical pattern that's going to repeat

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:13.320 
vertical pattern that's going to repeat
some<00:06:54.470> of<00:06:54.500> this<00:06:54.650> over<00:06:55.220> here

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.389 

you
