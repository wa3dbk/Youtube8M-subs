00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
that you're not cloning from the correct

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.600 
that you're not cloning from the correct
source<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:18.360> when<00:02:18.630> this<00:02:18.810> happens<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:20.190> simply

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
source so when this happens you simply

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.640
