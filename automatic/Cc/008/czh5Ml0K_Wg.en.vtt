00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.069
 characters 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.710
 the characters who made history 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:13.890
 of the sport told by federico buffa 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.109
 you can be alive 50 years old and 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.720
 have already achieved immortality 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.170
 no of course not unless you 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.420
 call Michael Jeffrey Jordan one 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.199
 of the three four icons of history 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.910
 of sport 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.500
 let's say of the twentieth century or if of the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.789
 modern sport seems to me to his 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.850

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.289
 of the two and for the Brazilians ayrton senna 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.499
 there is a difference between all these 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.719
 athletes and he longevity and sense 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:46.379
 of mortality that accompanies Michael has 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.299
 turned 50 years old in February 2013 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.069
 I tell you a backstory does not have it 

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:53.010
 told him and this is the most part 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:55.260
 let's say so excruciating a few days 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.089
 before his birthday his 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.549
 player because michael jordan 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.449
 currently he is the owner of one 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:02.429

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.800
 in 21 he challenged him in one against 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.580
 one at the team's training ground 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.280
 of charm 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.130
 the story told the boy not 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.370
 Michael and the boy said I didn't 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.690
 taken but not possible is not 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:27.090
 physically possible that a twenty year old 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.090
 very strong explosive and that plays the most 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.660
 high athletic level on the planet not the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.120
 never take against a man of 50 years but 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.390
 that's exactly what happened 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.580
 he dominated seems to be on his table 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.520
 historic athletic trainer in Chicago 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.730

 in the field in nba at 50 years 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.420
 how is this possible? 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.720
 nervous about what's inside that man 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.700
 everyone says it would be possible 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.840
 could play 10 minutes fifteen 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.080
 minutes on 48 but 50 years on hold from 10 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.230
 could come back 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.690
 remember that he is already back at 40 standstill 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.550
 from two bars 3 is not a man like him 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.370
 others and when it was 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.340
 glorified, we talked about his life 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.200
 and luckily a man came out 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.560
 at the age of two he risked 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.050
 die electrocuted to 17 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.400

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.080
 demonstration by cutting a grapefruit 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.240
 on the sternum and entered his body for 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.010
 a few inches we risked 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.580
 not even know who Michael was 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.460
 jordan 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.130
 the fundamental episode at seven years e 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.080

 bathroom only needs to shower for 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.820
 luckily they tell us these 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.580
 stories because otherwise you would find some 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.420
 doubt if this is a man like everyone else 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.420
 us or not
