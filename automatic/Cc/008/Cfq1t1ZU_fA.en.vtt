paste<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.459> in<00:02:31.670> there<00:02:32.050> now<00:02:33.050> make<00:02:33.440> sure<00:02:33.470> you

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
paste that in there now make sure you

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.670 
paste that in there now make sure you
have<00:02:34.040> this<00:02:34.540> HTTP<00:02:35.540> colon<00:02:35.959> forward<00:02:36.560> slash

have this HTTP colon forward slash

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.630 
have this HTTP colon forward slash
forward<00:02:37.310> slash<00:02:37.660> because<00:02:39.250> sometimes<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.430> works

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
forward slash because sometimes it works

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.670 
forward slash because sometimes it works
sometimes<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:41.239> doesn't<00:02:41.299> so<00:02:42.110> make<00:02:42.410> sure<00:02:42.440> you

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
sometimes it doesn't so make sure you

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.259 
sometimes it doesn't so make sure you
have<00:02:42.769> that<00:02:42.920> in<00:02:43.069> there<00:02:43.250> anyway<00:02:43.640> just<00:02:44.150> because

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
have that in there anyway just because

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.350 
have that in there anyway just because
sometimes<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.140> webview<00:02:45.470> overload<00:02:46.000> then<00:02:47.000> n

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
sometimes the webview overload then n

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.449 
sometimes the webview overload then n
the<00:02:47.750> coats<00:02:48.549> ends<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.760> three<00:02:51.099> square<00:02:52.099> brackets

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
the coats ends the three square brackets

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.289 
the coats ends the three square brackets
put<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.030> semicolon<00:02:53.799> save<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:55.190> we<00:02:55.940> should<00:02:56.180> be

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
put a semicolon save and we should be

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.319 
put a semicolon save and we should be
able<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.599> build<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.140> run<00:02:57.319> and<00:02:58.030> see<00:02:59.030> how<00:02:59.180> it

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
able to build and run and see how it

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.140 
able to build and run and see how it
goes<00:02:59.590> so<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.620> just<00:03:01.220> pop<00:03:01.430> over<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:02.030> thing<00:03:02.959> and

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
goes so I just pop over to the thing and

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.630 
goes so I just pop over to the thing and
my<00:03:05.150> internet<00:03:05.420> works<00:03:06.099> Google<00:03:07.099> should<00:03:07.250> load<00:03:07.430> and

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
my internet works Google should load and

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.670 
my internet works Google should load and
as<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:08.120> can<00:03:08.239> see<00:03:08.269> there's<00:03:08.630> Google<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.140> it's<00:03:09.590> a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
as you can see there's Google and it's a

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.170 
as you can see there's Google and it's a
fully<00:03:09.890> functioning<00:03:10.370> webview<00:03:10.730> it's<00:03:10.880> got<00:03:11.060> the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
fully functioning webview it's got the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.569 
fully functioning webview it's got the
scroll<00:03:11.599> and<00:03:11.630> everything<00:03:12.230> working<00:03:12.410> that<00:03:12.739> go

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
scroll and everything working that go

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.470 
scroll and everything working that go
into<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:14.390> Google<00:03:15.019> bar<00:03:15.560> here<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.190> type<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:17.329> I'm

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
into the Google bar here and type so I'm

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.069 
into the Google bar here and type so I'm
going<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.690> search<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:18.110> new<00:03:18.260> high<00:03:19.810> insert<00:03:20.810> soon

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
going to search a new high insert soon

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.180 
going to search a new high insert soon
as<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.290> can<00:03:21.410> see<00:03:21.590> we've<00:03:21.769> got<00:03:21.799> hi<00:03:22.609> there<00:03:23.590> so<00:03:24.590> yep

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
as you can see we've got hi there so yep

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.129 
as you can see we've got hi there so yep
the<00:03:25.760> reason<00:03:26.090> why<00:03:26.180> we<00:03:26.299> didn't<00:03:26.510> need<00:03:26.600> a<00:03:26.660> button

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
the reason why we didn't need a button

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.840 
the reason why we didn't need a button
for<00:03:27.319> this<00:03:27.470> is<00:03:27.709> because<00:03:27.739> we<00:03:28.160> use<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.459> view<00:03:28.700> did

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
for this is because we use the view did

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.080 
for this is because we use the view did
load<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:30.739> view<00:03:31.280> did<00:03:31.430> load<00:03:31.840> allows<00:03:32.840> us<00:03:33.109> to

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
load and the view did load allows us to

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.580 
load and the view did load allows us to
basically<00:03:35.090> what<00:03:35.569> it<00:03:35.630> is<00:03:35.780> as<00:03:35.900> soon<00:03:36.139> as<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.319> few

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
basically what it is as soon as a few

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.220 
basically what it is as soon as a few
loads<00:03:36.829> he<00:03:37.160> should<00:03:37.400> do<00:03:37.579> this<00:03:37.790> code<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:38.930> we<00:03:38.959> don't

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
loads he should do this code so we don't

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.030 
loads he should do this code so we don't
need<00:03:39.380> any<00:03:39.530> button<00:03:40.010> for<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.420> so<00:03:41.470> in<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.769> next

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
need any button for it so in the next

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.920 
need any button for it so in the next
tutorial<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.940> more<00:03:44.120> advanced<00:03:44.540> on<00:03:44.660> i'll<00:03:44.810> be

tutorial the more advanced on i'll be
going<00:03:45.200> over<00:03:45.290> how<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.530> can<00:03:45.889> implement<00:03:46.160> back

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
going over how you can implement back

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.059 
going over how you can implement back
buttons<00:03:47.060> forward<00:03:47.630> buttons<00:03:47.959> refresh<00:03:48.680> buttons

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
buttons forward buttons refresh buttons

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.000
