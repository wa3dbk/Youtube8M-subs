00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
soon I'll be using this platform to lift

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.120 
soon I'll be using this platform to lift
and<00:05:01.120> drop<00:05:01.270> various<00:05:01.750> things<00:05:02.020> and<00:05:02.320> also<00:05:02.950> put

and drop various things and also put

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.070 
and drop various things and also put
skis<00:05:03.400> on<00:05:03.610> it<00:05:03.730> in<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:03.940> winter<00:05:04.060> so<00:05:04.600> stay<00:05:04.810> tuned

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
skis on it in the winter so stay tuned

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.610
