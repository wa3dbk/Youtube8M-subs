00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.890
 we are at montÃ©limar at Monsieur's 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.730
 carrez and madame pellegrin who had a 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:21.070
 little problem in isere count mistral 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.260
 north side when the north wall all the 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.690
 drawers the kitchen items was 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.190
 iced because the cold penetrate 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.990
 directly in the hands 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.640
 Mr. Carrez has made contact with 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.650
 edf to find solutions 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.930
 this is where the gentleman comes 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.540
 advisor edf have made a visit 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.180
 physical where we really look at all 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.130
 elements the joineries insulation and 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.170
 of course the heating the ventilation on 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.660
 was working is to improve at the level 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.890
 isolation at their level of course 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.200
 their comfort that she and you proposed 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.290
 as a solution then what I have 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.630
 advocated it was the insulation of the walls 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.780
 from the outside as we are on the north side 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.360
 and a sums in the Rhone Valley 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.140
 an insulation of the roof a 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.590
 breakdown and the system of 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.990
 heating 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.610
 the goal is to amortize and to have 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.830
 comfort its what for me it's 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.290
 priority and of course give the 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.640
 value to his good but I could 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.249
 inspect the entire house 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.700
 he drew up his report which he transmitted 

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:24.609
 the ars UDF blue sky in Lyon who we are 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.009
 wants to return the goal too much 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.240
 followed the letter 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.950
 it is thinking of you that edf has 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.679
 selected its network of partners 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.850
 sky blue 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:38.289
 entrepreneurs came to see us 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.200
 that they phoned entrepreneurs 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.939
 came to see us and we chose 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.579
 the one we wanted so we chose our 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.810
 companies were quickly done and the 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.450
 works were executed 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.579
 the idea if you want is to become 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.139
 belt and the house and you are 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.560
 completely a big part of the bridges 

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:55.090
 thermal 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.299
 that is to say that we come surrounded 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.439
 completely and the cold or the show does 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.999
 to be born much less well in the 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.799
 House 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:04.780
 we received keys from the wadding 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.840
 cellulose cellulose wadding comes 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.759
 recycled newspapers themselves come 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.890
 of wood so we have a natural product that 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.720
 cost very low in gray energy from 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.420
 transformation and an excellent duration 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.740
 of life 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.200
 forty to fifty years old we have 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.060
 installed a vein tigers to metrics 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.190
 in order to reduce the air flow in 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.709
 hygrometry function in the house 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.750
 of the radiator has heat-transfer way 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.250
 to have better inertia for the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.620
 heating time companies 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.000
 were well organized and knew very well 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.830
 well what to do he was 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.300
 accustomed to this kind of work does not get 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.190
 could see a little during 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.350
 works and the high walls see at the end 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.209
 works he found that it was very 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.580
 well done what's the point of being 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.170
 blue sky partner of edf then 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.489
 the interest for us to be a partner 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.069
 blue sky first everyone 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.970
 knows blue sky this is a reference of 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.920
 quality also 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.380
 which also allows us to 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.940
 position ourselves as a partner 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.540
 seriously this work is to change what 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.150
 I February last year to February his 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.489
 tour there are 50% of two months of 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.640
 energy consumption to me I am 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.680
 delighted delighted because at first he was 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.810
 a very good job they have with all 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.970
 were very kind 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.950
 it was a big champion it's a big 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.720
 construction site 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.720
 we are considering taking something else ourselves not 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.739
 if we had not had this dvd in brussels 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.739
 these insulation works would have thought
