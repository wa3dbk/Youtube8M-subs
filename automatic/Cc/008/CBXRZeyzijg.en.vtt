00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.720
 so my friends welcome to one 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.130
 another episode 1 pokémon soul rap 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.830
 Battles and today I have again 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.000
 a small and a small battle of 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.000
 double top is tournee and I have very 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 to forget about it 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.420
 that's how it should fit or that's exactly what it is 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.310
 is good 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.869
 and some have asked me why 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.550
 that is not my capture 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.960
 card begged this way and that 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.590
 problem and I'll give you a closer look 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.500
 describe 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.390
 So I have the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.490
 leipheim battles i still on mine 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.570
 old fight camera but 88 are now 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.580
 in total of 188 and this i can 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.040
 then every case is somehow not up 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.360
 my synonymous with my 3ds capture 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.610
 card then transfer it correctly 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.320
 of course, to play these competitions 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.090
 can and then via capture card in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.350
 a better quality with you 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.590
 I can unfortunately record that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.760
 do not do what is a pity 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.160
 and there is a possibility though 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.630
 this extremely awkward and because they are one 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.940
 very spontaneous human being and today 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.040
 For example, do not have time 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.369
 to exclude the let's play for you 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.960
 Six times I thought to myself 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.410
 simply re-fight a spontaneous cheer 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.050
 high this time we have against young su 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.770
 played pants and a look and be 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.539
 team has shown me that with my 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.570
 mariana this time instead of covenants 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.680
 even have relatively good chances 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.580
 and as always my opponent has of course 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.850
 clark and megageil so megaphone pine 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.500
 and this battle was really cool like me 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.540
 find 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.180
 One of the most fun is tournament because of me 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.470
 this mainz gain step would have to 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.560
 amparo i should say 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.770
 mister apa from exactly with mega it extreme 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.590
 cool, at least I start with 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.350
 my two standard once ran usa 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.509
 and one 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.030
 omega and my opponent starts with his 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.369
 lotto king and his wife kika because 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.799
 Which he also in his 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.990
 ego of brings who thought as if 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.799
 you alone would be strong enough 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.720
 actually not but no matter meant 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.650
 pleiß trödler on means uta mega and 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.319
 youtube is a very crass alfi because 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.209
 the thing that is because I think it's great 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:24.150
 mega mega slow which I also one 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.019
 trick extreme europe power and it has 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.120
 an extremely good bank with omega and 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.959
 then also as tame and because 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.870
 user then sleeps the megaphone keeper 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.130
 my opponent uses 1 and my opponent 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.989
 but unfortunately with his lashing 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.650
 thunder lightning then went on my 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:48.799
 depot at 100 which is pretty stupid because 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.799
 now it is possible for me 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.710
 a certain percentage parallax chance 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.320
 make sure that now a pokémon in the train 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.480
 can attack additional users 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.850
 your left boiling water around mine 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.360
 title mega then the garaus to do what 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.700
 thank god he does not succeed I am 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.180
 of course with focus bump the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.730
 megaphone of my opponent's jaw 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.740
 Pull about half of the gap up 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.930
 in the following train there with a 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.490
 second poco then push my opponent 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.010
 completely defeated 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:27.220
 how the coincidence is then but so will 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:29.600
 me then of course with the 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.310
 second book bumping animal just one 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.450
 50 percent chance to hit 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.890
 that is why not always the 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.470
 most reliable attack but I am still 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.680
 pretty cool 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.950
 and yes my tattoo mega also has 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.970
 the live walk and live walk allows 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.490
 Thanks to it in my speed omega 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.410
 combination with his glasses ti which 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.970
 the beautiful name 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:02.950
 i believe magic coat wears without 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.120
 recoil attack what pretty horny 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.580
 my opponent or my opponent 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.570
 users persist with his mobile and 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:14.150
 to keep up with it 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.400
 protect thought shield and yourself 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.520
 so now and the third 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.280
 subsequent thrust in succession then 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.430
 no sense men what relative 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.830
 useless is so and in the following 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:32.900
 Unfortunately my train will pass by 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.490
 tricks which forces me to do this with mine 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.950
 mother star with powder the 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.870
 attention of 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.240
 against opposing dolls to yourself 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.770
 pull and in addition I'm still in 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.990
 the situation that deeply shock the 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.150
 actually more than obvious 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.920
 relatively long is always used around 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:55.490
 to be on the safe side with it 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:56.990
 One hundred percent freaky you have with it 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.210
 I then stop without truth in the 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:04.310
 able to escape this depression and 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.260
 then the attention of the 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.480
 to provoke words of anger provoked 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.590
 the two pokémon figuratively 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.000
 or just tell the attention 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.790
 by the two against thereby a pokémon 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.710
 to themselves and then both grab 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.720
 do not look at anything but both 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.990
 action goals then meet your own 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.710
 book what has been used with powder 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:26.710
 In addition, then stop my one 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.710
 beautiful 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:33.059
 mega what in the round before that or the 

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:35.759
 trick to you out in the waiting 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:38.639
 round on it then with a thrust the 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:41.639
 days mother to make the garaus what I am 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.529
 even then made something will 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.739
 So still left my opponent still has 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:45.739
 his 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:52.700
 which unfortunately not yet in the mega form 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.410
 Is it much easier ? 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.820
 but actually came no closer 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.400
 I really believe it here soon 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.620
 and even in the last round of the 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.770
 game and my opponent then has one 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.360
 good idea lured him instead 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.360
 to attack with apple and thus 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:12.140
 Maybe he will give his beard from loki 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:15.800
 was to withdraw the hp and more 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.690
 maybe after a close combat 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.380
 not really one hundred percent 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:23.330
 he does not have safe earthquakes 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.060
 the cars and that has me very much 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.890
 played in the cards because that's a car 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.720
 lured me helped me 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.910
 then in the following round not 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.800
 right in my in the mega form of a 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.930
 change the beginning because I still have the 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.820
 additional kite type my suppose 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.550
 and so I had that too 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:46.190
 hope that I then as a mono electro 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:47.930
 pokémon get less harm because of me 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.720
 because the other one is naturally neutral 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.400
 and not very effective than in the mega 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.090
 form and that was just then 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.500
 in the end that's what made me happy 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.660
 music has indeed been yes 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:03.620
 that I could have been so smart 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.880
 to change into the mega form but he 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.320
 Of course I could have done that too 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.090
 will I also believe in any case 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.610
 a ko been but already stopped 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.230
 really the chance to do that 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.940
 the enemy is still in the focus 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.890
 has worn so I pointing to 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.480
 wanted to go on the safe number one calls 

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.220
 May I now imagine that I am in 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.240
 the mega change of form with a kite 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:25.400
 Puls already gave all kpn pull 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.860
 Suddenly , of course, the focus of the 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.020
 active because then it is not ko is 

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.010
 but I am then my have mega form 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.210
 you already accepted the throat types 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:36.620
 and then trade is on 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:38.150
 one hundred percent one hit yes that would be 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.610
 then the whole procedure like that 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.900
 but it would be over in the end everything 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.970
 gone well was a very exciting one 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.620
 fight last two dolls on mine 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.290
 side have until then at the end among themselves 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.270
 Mine and many temptations mean 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:53.020
 make friends out of three it stays chilly 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.020
 and tchoyi
