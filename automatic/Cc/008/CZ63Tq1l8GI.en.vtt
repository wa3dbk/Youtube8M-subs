00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.030 
hanes which is the other types of church
because<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.210> hear<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.600> these<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.380> little

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
because I hear that these have a little

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.010 
because I hear that these have a little
bit<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.250> shrink<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.790> go<00:02:02.969> on<00:02:03.149> after<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.780> wash

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
bit of shrink that go on after you wash

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.200 
bit of shrink that go on after you wash
it<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:05.219> know<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.340> went<00:02:05.579> with<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.850> medium

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
it so you know I went with the medium

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.999 
it so you know I went with the medium
because<00:02:06.930> i<00:02:07.020> was<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.259> borderline<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:07.950> if

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
because i was on the borderline but if

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.529 
because i was on the borderline but if
you're<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:08.399> you're<00:02:08.550> normally<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> medium<00:02:09.450> i

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
you're if you're normally a medium i

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.660 
you're if you're normally a medium i
think<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> medium<00:02:10.110> would<00:02:10.229> probably<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:11.430> you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
think a medium would probably do you

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.309 
think a medium would probably do you
well<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.720> there's<00:02:13.050> a

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
well so that there's a

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.020 
well so that there's a
very<00:02:13.439> limited<00:02:13.859> number<00:02:14.099> of<00:02:14.129> those<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.519> for<00:02:14.939> you

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
very limited number of those and for you

wanted these and the reason I don't sell
these<00:02:48.359> separately<00:02:48.659> is<00:02:49.049> because<00:02:49.500> they<00:02:49.590> would

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
these separately is because they would

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.530 
these separately is because they would
cost<00:02:49.889> too<00:02:50.189> much<00:02:50.219> to<00:02:50.400> ship<00:02:50.669> they'd<00:02:51.060> cost<00:02:51.239> more

to ship than this actual unit here i'd

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.159 
to ship than this actual unit here i'd
probably<00:02:53.939> sell<00:02:54.269> this<00:02:54.329> thing<00:02:54.569> for<00:02:54.629> three<00:02:55.019> bucks
