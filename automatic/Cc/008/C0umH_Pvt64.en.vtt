00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
using my strategy you'll definitely see

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.409 
using my strategy you'll definitely see
while<00:03:52.799> I'm<00:03:52.980> doing<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.819> I<00:03:54.120> will

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
while I'm doing this that I will

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.569 
while I'm doing this that I will
probably<00:03:54.569> not<00:03:54.870> get<00:03:55.169> a<00:03:55.230> key<00:03:55.469> this<00:03:55.650> time<00:03:55.709> because

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
probably not get a key this time because

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:57.879 
probably not get a key this time because
I<00:03:56.700> got<00:03:56.879> one<00:03:57.090> about<00:03:57.209> three<00:03:57.510> or<00:03:57.689> four<00:03:57.840> times

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
I got one about three or four times

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.149 
I got one about three or four times
earlier<00:04:00.290> normally<00:04:01.290> when<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:01.560> do<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:01.859> I<00:04:02.010> like

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
earlier normally when I do this I like

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.800 
earlier normally when I do this I like
to<00:04:02.419> shoot<00:04:03.419> both<00:04:03.769> and<00:04:04.769> then<00:04:05.459> for<00:04:06.209> these<00:04:06.299> guys<00:04:06.569> I

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
to shoot both and then for these guys I

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.740 
to shoot both and then for these guys I
keep<00:04:06.989> them<00:04:07.079> up<00:04:07.230> here<00:04:07.409> I<00:04:07.439> try<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.739> keep<00:04:07.889> the

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
keep them up here I try and keep the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.309 
keep them up here I try and keep the
three<00:04:09.750> shooters<00:04:10.489> near<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.609> back<00:04:12.019> so<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.109> rest

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
three shooters near the back so the rest

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.770 
three shooters near the back so the rest
of<00:04:13.409> these<00:04:13.470> guys<00:04:13.680> will<00:04:13.919> go<00:04:14.010> up<00:04:14.129> here<00:04:14.780> and

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
of these guys will go up here and

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.689 
of these guys will go up here and
they'll<00:04:16.139> do<00:04:16.289> a<00:04:16.320> pretty<00:04:16.979> good<00:04:17.070> job<00:04:17.190> at<00:04:17.579> this

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
they'll do a pretty good job at this

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.390 
they'll do a pretty good job at this
point<00:04:18.199> they're<00:04:19.199> not<00:04:19.320> really<00:04:19.590> doing<00:04:19.739> much<00:04:20.010> I

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
point they're not really doing much I

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.110 
point they're not really doing much I
mean<00:04:21.209> they're<00:04:21.810> doing<00:04:22.019> a<00:04:22.380> little<00:04:22.620> bit<00:04:22.860> but<00:04:23.159> you

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
down below but for me this has been this

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.770 
down below but for me this has been this
has<00:04:52.280> been<00:04:52.340> a<00:04:52.520> breeze<00:04:52.849> I<00:04:52.880> mean<00:04:53.270> I<00:04:53.360> can

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
has been a breeze I mean I can

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.589 
has been a breeze I mean I can
I<00:04:54.370> was<00:04:55.370> literally<00:04:55.639> playing<00:04:56.000> this<00:04:56.180> when<00:04:56.419> I<00:04:56.449> was

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
I was literally playing this when I was

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.700 
I was literally playing this when I was
walking<00:04:56.840> to<00:04:57.289> Subway<00:04:58.250> for<00:04:58.310> lunch<00:04:58.729> and<00:04:59.710> just

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
walking to Subway for lunch and just

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.010 
walking to Subway for lunch and just
walk<00:05:01.250> because<00:05:01.490> I<00:05:01.580> do<00:05:01.820> walk<00:05:02.240> to<00:05:02.419> subway<00:05:02.630> it's

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
walk because I do walk to subway it's

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.629 
walk because I do walk to subway it's
just<00:05:03.169> something<00:05:03.470> really<00:05:03.710> simple<00:05:03.979> that<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.280> can

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
just something really simple that I can

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.939 
just something really simple that I can
I<00:05:05.120> don't<00:05:05.750> even<00:05:05.840> need<00:05:05.990> to<00:05:06.110> pay<00:05:06.259> attention<00:05:06.800> when

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
I don't even need to pay attention when

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.170 
I don't even need to pay attention when
I<00:05:07.009> play<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:08.169> so<00:05:09.310> what<00:05:10.310> I<00:05:10.370> like<00:05:10.490> to<00:05:10.610> do<00:05:10.729> again

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
I play it so what I like to do again

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.390 
I play it so what I like to do again
shoot<00:05:11.780> both<00:05:11.990> of<00:05:12.169> those<00:05:12.320> takes<00:05:12.770> out<00:05:12.949> everyone

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
shoot both of those takes out everyone

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.490 
shoot both of those takes out everyone
in<00:05:13.490> the<00:05:13.580> lane<00:05:13.820> it<00:05:14.330> also<00:05:14.509> makes<00:05:14.930> this<00:05:15.110> go<00:05:15.320> by<00:05:15.470> a

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
in the lane it also makes this go by a

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.870 
in the lane it also makes this go by a
lot<00:05:15.740> quicker<00:05:15.979> like<00:05:16.310> there<00:05:16.490> you<00:05:16.550> go

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
lot quicker like there you go

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.140 
lot quicker like there you go
already<00:05:17.330> done<00:05:18.070> and<00:05:19.070> again<00:05:19.370> I<00:05:19.550> didn't<00:05:19.880> get<00:05:20.000> it

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
already done and again I didn't get it

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.570 
already done and again I didn't get it
and<00:05:20.360> I<00:05:20.479> don't<00:05:20.509> expect<00:05:20.990> to<00:05:21.080> get<00:05:21.169> it<00:05:21.289> every<00:05:21.380> time

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
and I don't expect to get it every time

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.760 
and I don't expect to get it every time
but<00:05:22.580> it's<00:05:22.789> a<00:05:22.880> really<00:05:23.060> quick<00:05:23.360> way<00:05:23.630> to<00:05:23.659> get<00:05:24.320> keys

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
but it's a really quick way to get keys

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.800 
but it's a really quick way to get keys
to<00:05:25.190> get<00:05:25.310> these<00:05:25.490> pirate<00:05:25.849> keys<00:05:26.060> I<00:05:26.300> have<00:05:26.479> six

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
to get these pirate keys I have six

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.570 
to get these pirate keys I have six
right<00:05:27.050> now<00:05:27.229> I'm<00:05:27.740> gonna<00:05:28.069> be<00:05:28.250> getting

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
right now I'm gonna be getting

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.100 
right now I'm gonna be getting
definitely<00:05:29.120> a<00:05:29.150> couple<00:05:29.300> more<00:05:29.569> before<00:05:29.690> I<00:05:29.930> get

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
definitely a couple more before I get

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.110 
definitely a couple more before I get
farther<00:05:30.440> into<00:05:30.830> this<00:05:30.979> but<00:05:31.400> it's<00:05:31.909> something

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
farther into this but it's something

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.089 
farther into this but it's something
that<00:05:32.240> you<00:05:32.479> can<00:05:32.720> keep<00:05:32.900> on<00:05:33.110> playing<00:05:33.440> it's<00:05:33.710> it's

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
that you can keep on playing it's it's

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.730 
that you can keep on playing it's it's
fairly<00:05:34.370> quick<00:05:34.759> and<00:05:35.180> with<00:05:35.930> that<00:05:36.080> strategy<00:05:36.440> you

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
fairly quick and with that strategy you

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.689 
fairly quick and with that strategy you
should<00:05:36.919> be<00:05:37.009> able<00:05:37.099> to<00:05:37.220> get<00:05:37.340> through<00:05:37.550> this

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
should be able to get through this

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.010 
should be able to get through this
within<00:05:38.659> you<00:05:39.259> know<00:05:40.180> like<00:05:41.180> five<00:05:41.479> minutes<00:05:41.840> you

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
within you know like five minutes you
