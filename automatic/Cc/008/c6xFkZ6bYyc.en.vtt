00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.809
 I have not tried life 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.030
 then try it and dear friends 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:41.460
 tell you whether to buy it and 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.460
 generally try and so drove 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.190
 every time I wanted to shoot 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.830
 the next release is the transfer driven by food 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.820
 the store was looking for a product that I never 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.619
 didn't try i always paid attention to 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.810
 one product that I really really wanted 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.830
 try but each something not 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.090
 did it either 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.380
 I found something cooler and now 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.820
 it's that time when it's worth it 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.640
 try and so it is such a thing 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.160
 called Turkish sweetness 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.280
 Mina Pacal tastes but July did not try 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.460
 I am very , very interesting so we will 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.460
 sample 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:28.370
 so my advice to you but this one for a period 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:32.310
 shelf life for children in 2014 until April 1 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.190
 dozens of joke and so please dear 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.270
 friends always check the expiration date 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.020
 products that you buy because 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.690
 what happens so the store see not 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.090
 managed to either specifically left to 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.370
 own product bought leaves it 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.750
 overdue there once I bought and 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.310
 poisoned so always check 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:08.690
 expiration date so I think we will try 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:17.930
 I begin to strengthen our I think we need it 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:17.930
 cut we take the scissors we cut off 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:43.489
 so here we have such a thing I think we will 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:45.799
 Try to hope it will cut the leg 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.319
 same you cross it is not cool the same as 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:52.940
 twitter who ate sherbet hope you understand 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:56.540
 and so we will try and about the smell 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:02.000
 she still has a very pleasant smell 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:07.060
 sugary delicious like raspberries without 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.060
 pomegranate plus some more up 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.650
 elemental and now about taste 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.980
 but 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.849
 at the beginning when only a piece bite me 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:32.610
 It turned out that I kozinaki but then how 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:34.020
 marmalade - kozinaki miracle taste despite 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.789
 the fact that she is tasteful 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.210
 pomegranate pomegranate stark itself not 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.210
 feels 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:51.780
 yes but tasty came up with the Turks 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.970
 gaming 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.040
 judging and reading the composition here 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.560
 written sugar water what if starch 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.150
 citric acid pistachio pomegranate 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.680
 syrup 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:07.980
 but of all these ingredients i 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:12.300
 I will feel only grenades of what 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:15.790
 pistachio sugar and cornstarch. 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.340
 even grenade syrup is much more likely 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:23.530
 it is not even pistachio that is felt but as if 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:27.790
 casino 11 all jelly stores condemn a 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.370
 of course, she is beyond value and therefore 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.220
 what is this thing 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:37.300
 such somewhere centimeters 10 by 2 i 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:40.840
 sporti 145 rubles in this see of course 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.840
 she's delicious and so very nice think 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.620
 even it is not harmful and more useful than any 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.300
 candy but judging by its cost 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.450
 compare them with the cost of candy then 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.450
 Of course, this thing does not buy no 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.820
 profitable but I think if you will be in Turkey 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.920
 rest let things will cost and 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.860
 real penny so if you are in 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.480
 Turkey sure buy buy me 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.450
 you won't regret the stick too 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.660
 So let's summarize this issue today. 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:13.060
 I have tasted Turkish sweetness with taste 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.220
 pomegranate and pistachios from the firm stone she 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.070
 I really, really liked very very 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.200
 tasty to the most important healthy if you 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.880
 want it I feel sorry for 145 rubles per 100 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.870
 gram 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.060

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.920
 try and genie comments 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.970
 did you like it or not but if 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.700
 to judge and compare prices usually 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.170
 sweets it is much more expensive too 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.320
