00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
know a good one for the Fonz but since

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.110 
know a good one for the Fonz but since
quake<00:03:59.680> doesn't<00:04:00.010> want<00:04:00.130> this<00:04:00.220> what's<00:04:00.880> gonna

insane but you know fingers crossed

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.690 
insane but you know fingers crossed
that's<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.060> one<00:04:22.180> that<00:04:22.300> comes<00:04:22.510> off<00:04:23.280> but<00:04:24.280> you

that's the one that comes off but you

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.300 
that's the one that comes off but you
know<00:04:24.730> I'm<00:04:24.880> pretty<00:04:25.180> confident<00:04:25.840> that<00:04:26.080> our<00:04:26.620> team

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
know I'm pretty confident that our team

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.590 
know I'm pretty confident that our team
can<00:04:27.340> make<00:04:27.670> it<00:04:27.790> because<00:04:27.910> we<00:04:28.120> want<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.420> faith

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
but before that approximate clusky bill

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.260 
but before that approximate clusky bill
and<00:05:29.830> it<00:05:29.920> wasn't<00:05:30.040> about<00:05:30.490> six<00:05:30.760> days<00:05:30.970> and<00:05:31.180> the
