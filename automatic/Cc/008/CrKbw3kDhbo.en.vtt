 Talking people who owns tech mobile 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.870
 we are here with a little pilot who 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.510
 in samsung tap is a pin that usually 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.180
 have happened then bug tartÃ¡ is yet 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.220
 much in various vaart headphones from samsung 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.119
 At least I've only seen so far not from 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.179
 Samsung is here updating data from 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.940
 yes, it 's probably what happens 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.670
 when you put your your 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.320
 and the machine does not read 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.290
 correctly this chip 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.110
 it stays here and it is with this message of 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.680
 error this bug is because neither does it 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.120
 made the necessary settings or not 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.030
 complete the required 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.670
 chip and so it gets that much 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.680
 analyze the data of the 5 within all ta 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.559
 It has an I'll give a tip for you 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.690
 maybe how to solve this okay can be 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.059
 that your problem may be no longer 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.790
 in our case here you will see that it goes 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.600
 solve here is good you will open 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.869
 then configure later 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.119
 you will stay here on mobile networks in 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.630
 then have some options you 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.060
 will stay in real estate 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.409
 then you will click here for points of 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.780
 access here 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.450
 then you click here look at this option here 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:34.500
 on top restore pattern and click ok 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:38.840
 now it's restoring ready now you 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.840
 will stay here in network settings 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.430
 wait for the moment until 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.430
 location of operators 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.420
 then you will now select your 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.460
 the local carrier from which you select the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.700
 clear operator 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.410
 Ready now, I'll do it. 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.850
 the reuse of the system 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.850
 let's wait for it to restart 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.830
 ready the message she was gone okay could be 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.170
 so that this procedure solves 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.930

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.629

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.980
 you do 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.340
 you go to the network does not provide information 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.530
 for clothing and then you have to 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.870
 reset the time zone also by dropping 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.220
 automatic if it does not solve for you 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.209
 say that this procedure does not 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.379

 take out the chip first you turn it off 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:12.750
 the device off the device to remove the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.390
 chip connects the device without the chip ok then 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:31.049
 the device without the chip 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:54.389
 you will delete real estate will delete 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:57.359
 here, you turn on the power and 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.669
 it 's time for him to do the 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:03.299
 your carrier settings again
