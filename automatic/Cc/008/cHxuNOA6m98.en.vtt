00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.990
 Good day to everyone, I want to tell you briefly 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.769
 about such a thing as removable toning 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.719
 which now speaks the entire internet 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.179
 after the Russian government 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.740
 adopted amendments that the penalty will be 500 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.760
 rubles and administrative arrest up to 15 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.050
 day so-called removable toning 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.529
 be made in different ways in 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.019
 Basically this is a material called 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.520
 polyester this material served 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.739
 Template is so cut 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.340
 This material is sold in any 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.430
 outdoor advertising agency 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.800
 material is completely transparent transparent 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.239
 probably even VAZ glass with two 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.829
 the sides has a protective film removed 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.860
 and immediately paste over to your taste and color 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.219
 as they say someone does from org 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.620
 glass someone makes flexible pvc but 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.449
 flexibly poluha there is one flaw heat 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.969
 40 degrees in the sun 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.600
 loves your tonirovochka can swim this 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.409
 the material is quite flexible 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.720
 Strong is sold by a sheet which is enough 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.930
 about 6 front windows here 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.259
 car of this brand 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:23.220
 we have nine 9 10 this generation 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.340
 AvtoVAZ so let's say the material needs to be taken 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.710
 not less than one millimeter thick 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.810
 to have a carpenter say easy 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.420
 peel off peel off for the same 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.070
 technology as usual glass that is 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.369
 nothing extra all natural 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.290
 not required here to be installed on 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.649
 cars in many ways someone 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.240
 puts the glass closing completely and you don't 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.070
 you can not open anything that is 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.560
 you will always say so 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.710
 workout specifically for this car 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.700
 all secured in using two-way 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.790
 scotch tape 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.180
 which principle at a glance is not particularly not 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.420
 which are noticeable 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.840
 the glass goes down rises no 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.580
 no problems arise if desired 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.319
 if you saw a DPS employee il 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.310
 come any checkpoint 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:21.120
 easy to get out to hook a finger 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.610
 the whole car is closed no longer 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.680
 we tint any problems principle with 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.650
 DPS inspectors should not arise 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.190
 I will say of course that I have three sets already 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:36.780
 I gave such employees to the traffic police in my 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.630
 nonsense installation is similar 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.340
 in a way 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.260
 uncomfortable a little bit I take off with one hand 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.959
 that is, we set literally flies 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:53.000
 Barsik he takes uncomfortable just 1 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:55.769
 close became scandi 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.930
 the car is also toning all over again 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.420
 falls and rises alone here 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.549
 lack of this workout so 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.620
 called mirroring you can see 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.290
 that the glass is a little different in color 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.220
 it more mirrors it accordingly 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.900
 no that it was not you can with 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.310
 the reverse side paste over the lightest 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.380
 the film is just practically invisible 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.420
 temper you won't have if you don't 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.070
 want to raise and lower the glass you 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.100
 You can put that is a film in general 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.299
 there are no mirrors outside 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.640
 stop right away 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:33.480
 that is, it does it like this 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.079
 no problem no difficulty 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.079
 no principle
