Mars Venus is not happy venus is
actually<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.939> position<00:01:15.240> right<00:01:15.450> now<00:01:15.659> where

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
actually in a position right now where

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.160 
actually in a position right now where
the<00:01:16.710> energy<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.549> tense<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.180> she's<00:01:18.930> having

the energy is so tense that she's having

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.810 
the energy is so tense that she's having

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
a hard time expressing and I think

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.609 
a hard time expressing and I think
you're<00:01:20.970> right<00:01:21.150> ultimately<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.140> makes<00:01:22.500> it

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
you're right ultimately that makes it

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.070 
you're right ultimately that makes it
makes<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.280> easier<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:24.000> us<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.270> jump<00:01:24.810> off<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
makes it easier for us to jump off to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.469 
makes it easier for us to jump off to
nerdville<00:01:25.830> because<00:01:26.610> there<00:01:26.939> we<00:01:27.090> don't<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.390> to

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
nerdville because there we don't have to

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
nerdville because there we don't have to
worry<00:01:27.689> about<00:01:27.930> taking<00:01:28.259> care<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.680> our<00:01:28.860> field

worry about taking care of our field
right<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.579> interesting<00:01:30.150> question<00:01:30.299> is

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
right and the interesting question is

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.830 
right and the interesting question is
whether<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.220> use<00:01:32.369> our<00:01:32.790> intelligence<00:01:33.479> today

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
whether we use our intelligence today

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.050 
whether we use our intelligence today

or<00:01:41.460> philosophy<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.780> question<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.350> whether<00:01:43.560> we
