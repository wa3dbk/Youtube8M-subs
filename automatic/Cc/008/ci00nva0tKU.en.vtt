by<00:00:44.829> urban<00:00:45.159> decay<00:00:45.190> in<00:00:45.640> perversion<00:00:45.940> and<00:00:47.280> don't

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
by urban decay in perversion and don't

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.189 
by urban decay in perversion and don't
know<00:00:48.489> if<00:00:48.699> mines<00:00:48.909> dried<00:00:49.420> up<00:00:49.600> because<00:00:49.809> it's

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
know if mines dried up because it's

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.369 
know if mines dried up because it's
really<00:00:50.499> hard<00:00:50.769> to<00:00:50.859> smudge<00:00:51.100> on<00:00:51.280> top<00:00:51.489> of<00:00:51.609> my<00:00:51.729> lid

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
really hard to smudge on top of my lid

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.430 
really hard to smudge on top of my lid
but<00:00:53.379> I<00:00:53.769> guess<00:00:54.399> that's<00:00:54.579> okay<00:00:54.729> because<00:00:55.440> we're

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
but I guess that's okay because we're

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.899 
but I guess that's okay because we're
just<00:00:56.469> gonna<00:00:56.739> put<00:00:56.949> some<00:00:56.979> eyeshadow<00:00:57.460> on<00:00:57.640> top<00:00:57.670> of

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
just gonna put some eyeshadow on top of

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:59.869 
just gonna put some eyeshadow on top of
that<00:00:57.999> so<00:00:58.420> it<00:00:58.479> doesn't<00:00:58.690> have<00:00:58.780> to<00:00:58.899> be<00:00:58.989> perfect

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
that so it doesn't have to be perfect

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.729 
that so it doesn't have to be perfect
but<00:01:00.879> really<00:01:01.210> I<00:01:01.239> wish<00:01:01.479> I<00:01:01.629> used<00:01:01.870> another<00:01:02.170> eye

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739
