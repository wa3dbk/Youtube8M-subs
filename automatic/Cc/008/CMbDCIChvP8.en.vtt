00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.190
 hello good people it was hard to find one 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.000
 place to record then if you have any 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.600
 noise here forgive me 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.320
 Well I've separated some ideas from 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.320
 organization 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:34.960
 good idea of super organization 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:50.890
 fast with home mary is because the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:55.270
 fourth biggest mess and ignoring this 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.339
 introduction can see that my room is 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.180
 Really a chapa mess. 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:03.580
 makeup dryer and I leave everything there in 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.909
 clothes and it gets very messy for 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:10.630
 To organize this I separated all my 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:14.470
 electric and electronic hair and 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:19.150
 I got this Friday that I bought for 4 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.610
 99 and put them all in with a 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.960
 rolled wire 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.180
 Look, I can say that this 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.790
 made it much easier 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.400
 no longer is the one area all 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.620
 spread and chap liss baby a lot 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.310
 then it really was very 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.310
 useful 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.620
 tip number two is to keep the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.270
 Sleigh-house, more organized, I can 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.700
 see which is the largest area 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.160
 I took a box and put the 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.680
 clips and this cute little 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.360
 cupcakes and put some jewelry and 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.170
 The things that I always shot leave me in the 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:00.220
 table 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:02.710
 so they do not get scattered and 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.920
 I put the things I usually use 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.540
 which are mirror books and beautiful things that 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.540
 usually I leave my servant world 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:23.489
 and it was much more tidy but as neither 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:28.719
 everything is a thousand flowers to my drawer 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:32.019
 It really is very very messy and for 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:39.639
 This I got a box of trinkets 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:42.010
 old that I have not used for centuries and I 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.870
 I enjoyed that I had painted the 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.060
 little bedside table on a 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:51.010
 bit of ink and I got this 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.900
 and I painted with a 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.000
 agreement created mute but you can skip 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.719
 this step or you can paint in white 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.169
 the color you want 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:08.049
 so I just painted I waited ck and 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:10.469
 It really was of great use 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.469
 partition 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.209
 after drying I put it inside the 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:28.150
 drawer and separated the things that 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:33.519
 and I left everything tidy and 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:39.009
 really lately I leave everything fine 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:41.879
 organized anyway and it was well 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:41.879
 best 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.540
 tip number 3 is makeup 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.020
 This I think it's not just me and you. 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.570
 also leave the larger area and I do not 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.950
 I managed to find absolutely nothing 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.800
 when I was late 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.630
 That's why I met a photo mural that 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.760
 I had photos that I did not update 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:09.170
 centuries and finally I took it all and got it 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.510
 these magnets 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:19.750
 I put some hot glue there 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:24.620
 and pasted on the products I use and more 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:28.670
 I loved this one for sure. 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.430
 My two days later, favorites because 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.540
 this was very useful and looks good 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.970
 cool, everyone who goes there 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.850
 Our question but how did you do it? 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.700
 make this picture and how the makeup 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.780
 they are stuck there then it really is good 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.180
 cool 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.190
 and then I put it that I use it the most 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.590
 I got that cup 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:55.510
 I put several brothers in order to 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:55.510
 hold and put the brushes 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.350
 I can not put on too much weight because 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.610
 If you do not fall into the bigger 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.140
 better put more than a fourth magnet 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.240
 tip are enamel 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:12.560
 To start I took this fabric that is 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.960
 tricoline I cut this strip and I'm going to do it 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.750
 type a sheath with hot glue to give 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.340
 a better finish so I'll fold 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.590
 I cut this strip the size of 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.960
 side of my box that box of 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:32.210
 trinkets I took from the beginning know 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:34.280
 and then the lap this modinha in the box 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.750
 if you want too because the step is 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.330
 You know you can do this. 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.800
 also with an incapacitated shoe box and 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.800
 Then I separated all my brothers. 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.050
 enamels and organized by brand is well 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.190
 easier to find things and there 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:53.270
 I put some big tubes is some 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:57.060
 acetone nail stickers one pot I 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:01.290
 I took this box and put on cotton 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.389
 and then I also put sandpaper and toothpick 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:06.900
 finally it was much easier whenever I 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:09.810
 I want to do the fingernail, I just want to get the 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.639
 box that 's all I need and 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.010
 Before I had to keep hunting 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:17.430
 things one in each place and now it's 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:22.100
 everything there in this box and it's much more 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.100
 easy and much more organized 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.340
 I hope you have enjoyed forgetting 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:34.889
 I like to sign up for 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.889
 canal kiss and see you next Christmas
