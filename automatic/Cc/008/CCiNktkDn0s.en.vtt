00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.479 

where<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.780> airfields<00:00:58.500> will<00:00:58.649> actually<00:00:59.100> switch

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
where the airfields will actually switch

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.819 
where the airfields will actually switch
between<00:01:00.120> being<00:01:00.690> open<00:01:01.110> and<00:01:01.199> closed<00:01:01.530> depending

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
between being open and closed depending

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.350 
between being open and closed depending
on<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:03.300> weather<00:01:03.480> here<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.940> there's<00:01:05.940> some

snow<00:01:06.630> as<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.350> see<00:01:07.590> falling<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.580> snow

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
snow as you can see falling and the snow

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.570 
snow as you can see falling and the snow
changes<00:01:10.110> direction<00:01:10.710> there<00:01:10.890> as<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.280> can<00:01:11.400> see

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
changes direction there as you can see

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.420 
changes direction there as you can see
this<00:01:11.790> track<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.810> hear<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.440> inside<00:01:13.830> pink<00:01:14.130> track

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
this track I hear the inside pink track

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.320 
this track I hear the inside pink track
closed<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.320> did<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> yellow<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.369> you

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
closed and so did the yellow one if you

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.999 
closed and so did the yellow one if you
already<00:01:18.479> had<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> plane<00:01:19.080> landing<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.860> then

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
already had a plane landing on it then

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.730 
already had a plane landing on it then
you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.280> still<00:01:20.659> land<00:01:21.659> there<00:01:22.049> no<00:01:22.229> matter<00:01:22.380> what

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
you can still land there no matter what

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.420 
you can still land there no matter what
but<00:01:23.780> any<00:01:24.780> future<00:01:25.170> planes<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.009> land<00:01:26.220> on

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
but any future planes have to land on

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.060 
but any future planes have to land on
the<00:01:26.580> new<00:01:26.759> track<00:01:27.149> here<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.740> game<00:01:28.920> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the new track here the game is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.510 
the new track here the game is
controlled<00:01:29.490> by<00:01:29.550> just<00:01:29.850> dragging<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.890> plane<00:01:31.890> from

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
controlled by just dragging a plane from

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.570 
controlled by just dragging a plane from
your<00:01:32.729> finger<00:01:33.149> to<00:01:34.020> one<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.289> the<00:01:34.380> tracks<00:01:34.679> and

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
your finger to one of the tracks and

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.859 
your finger to one of the tracks and
it's<00:01:36.210> actually<00:01:36.360> really<00:01:37.020> accurate<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:38.869> thought

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
it's actually really accurate I thought

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.510 
it's actually really accurate I thought
it'd<00:01:40.020> kind<00:01:40.289> of<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.409> tough<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.920> control<00:01:41.100> at

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
it'd kind of be tough to control at

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.100 
it'd kind of be tough to control at
first<00:01:41.840> but<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.990> wasn't<00:01:44.690> what<00:01:45.690> you<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:45.929> to<00:01:46.050> be

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
first but it wasn't what you have to be

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.230 
first but it wasn't what you have to be
careful<00:01:46.319> of<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:47.270> planes<00:01:48.270> crashing<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
careful of is planes crashing so if you

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.480 
careful of is planes crashing so if you
fly<00:01:51.659> two<00:01:51.720> planes<00:01:52.350> directly<00:01:52.979> at<00:01:53.100> each<00:01:53.250> other

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
fly two planes directly at each other

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.320 
fly two planes directly at each other
and<00:01:54.080> aren't<00:01:55.080> good<00:01:55.289> at<00:01:55.440> creating<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.950> path

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
and aren't good at creating a path

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:04.940 
and aren't good at creating a path
they'll<00:01:57.330> crash<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:02.899> once<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.110> crash<00:02:04.410> you

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
they'll crash and once you crash you

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.580 
they'll crash and once you crash you
lose<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.550> game<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.879> you<00:02:05.940> have<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.149> retry<00:02:06.590> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
lose the game and you have to retry the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.010 
lose the game and you have to retry the
whole<00:02:07.739> point<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.129> game<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.520> get<00:02:08.729> your

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
whole point of the game is to get your

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.290 
whole point of the game is to get your
highest<00:02:10.020> score<00:02:10.379> which<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.800> just<00:02:11.060> landing<00:02:12.060> a

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
highest score which is just landing a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.780 
highest score which is just landing a
certain<00:02:12.810> number<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.110> an<00:02:13.230> airplanes<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:15.440> as

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
certain number of an airplanes and as

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.030 
certain number of an airplanes and as
you<00:02:17.790> progress<00:02:18.030> through<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.599> levels<00:02:19.020> well<00:02:19.770> as

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
you progress through the levels well as

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.150 
you progress through the levels well as
you<00:02:20.790> just<00:02:21.209> like<00:02:21.450> progress<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.200> time<00:02:22.440> it

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
you just like progress in time it

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.410 
you just like progress in time it
doesn't<00:02:23.400> really<00:02:23.700> seem<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.239> get<00:02:24.390> any<00:02:24.599> tougher<00:02:24.870> I

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
doesn't really seem to get any tougher I

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.150 
doesn't really seem to get any tougher I
didn't<00:02:27.420> think<00:02:27.629> it<00:02:27.900> got<00:02:28.050> any<00:02:28.349> tougher<00:02:28.830> really

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
didn't think it got any tougher really

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.780 
didn't think it got any tougher really
it's<00:02:29.430> just<00:02:30.050> you<00:02:31.050> have<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.290> be<00:02:31.470> always<00:02:31.980> on<00:02:32.550> top

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
it's just you have to be always on top

of it and managing what's going on in
order<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:36.150> win<00:02:37.910> well<00:02:38.910> there<00:02:39.209> is<00:02:39.300> no<00:02:39.450> really

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
order to win well there is no really

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.900 
order to win well there is no really
winning<00:02:39.989> it's<00:02:40.319> just<00:02:40.530> like<00:02:40.680> winning<00:02:41.519> your<00:02:41.819> own

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.100 
winning it's just like winning your own
personal<00:02:42.510> score<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.959> know<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:45.420> visuals<00:02:45.900> are

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
personal score you know the visuals are

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.680 
personal score you know the visuals are
really<00:02:46.769> simple<00:02:47.310> there<00:02:48.300> nothing<00:02:48.660> that

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
really simple there nothing that

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.490 
really simple there nothing that
impressive<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.310> sounds<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.750> has<00:02:52.260> that

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
impressive and the sounds it has that

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.280 
impressive and the sounds it has that
little<00:02:53.330> soundtrack<00:02:54.330> at<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.659> beginning<00:02:55.050> of

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
little soundtrack at the beginning of

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.320 
little soundtrack at the beginning of
the<00:02:55.379> game<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.370> only<00:02:56.519> lasts<00:02:56.940> like<00:02:56.970> 30

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
the game but that only lasts like 30

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.380 
the game but that only lasts like 30
seconds<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.930> then<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.170> completely<00:02:58.950> goes<00:02:58.980> away

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
seconds and then it completely goes away

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.759 
seconds and then it completely goes away
so<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.420> don't<00:03:00.629> know<00:03:00.750> what<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.110> use<00:03:01.379> of<00:03:01.409> having

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
so I don't know what the use of having

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.230 
so I don't know what the use of having
that<00:03:01.950> music<00:03:02.580> there<00:03:02.819> is<00:03:04.310> they<00:03:05.310> have<00:03:05.490> sounds<00:03:06.030> for

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
that music there is they have sounds for

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.090 
that music there is they have sounds for
every<00:03:06.540> time<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.900> like<00:03:07.050> drag<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.710> to<00:03:07.950> an

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
every time you like drag on to an

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.380 
every time you like drag on to an
airport<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.730> everything

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
airport and everything

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.630 
airport and everything
so<00:03:10.390> those<00:03:10.600> help<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.140> game<00:03:11.320> some<00:03:11.740> and<00:03:11.980> they<00:03:12.400> of

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
so those help the game some and they of

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.370 
so those help the game some and they of
course<00:03:12.700> have<00:03:13.030> sounds<00:03:13.570> for<00:03:13.780> when<00:03:13.930> your<00:03:14.050> plane

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
course have sounds for when your plane

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.070 
course have sounds for when your plane
is<00:03:14.560> going<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.770> collide<00:03:15.240> which<00:03:16.240> really<00:03:16.600> helps

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
is going to collide which really helps

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.170 
is going to collide which really helps
you<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.500> all<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.460> planes<00:03:18.730> will<00:03:18.910> give<00:03:19.060> you

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
you and all the planes will give you

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.650 
you and all the planes will give you
visual<00:03:19.420> clues<00:03:19.900> as<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.700> what<00:03:21.700> track<00:03:22.240> they<00:03:22.480> need

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
visual clues as to what track they need

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.990 
visual clues as to what track they need
to<00:03:22.750> land<00:03:22.960> on<00:03:23.200> as<00:03:23.470> you<00:03:24.130> see<00:03:24.340> they<00:03:24.520> show<00:03:24.760> their

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
to land on as you see they show their

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.430 
to land on as you see they show their
color<00:03:25.330> there<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:27.210> they<00:03:28.210> give<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:28.630> clues<00:03:29.020> as

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
color there and they give you clues as

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.690 
color there and they give you clues as
to<00:03:29.470> if<00:03:30.270> they<00:03:31.270> have<00:03:31.660> already<00:03:32.560> gotten<00:03:33.070> a<00:03:33.370> track

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
to if they have already gotten a track

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.410 
to if they have already gotten a track
by<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.090> or<00:03:34.510> not<00:03:35.490> if<00:03:36.490> you<00:03:36.670> haven't<00:03:36.850> drawn<00:03:37.210> them

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
by you or not if you haven't drawn them

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.690 
by you or not if you haven't drawn them
a<00:03:37.450> path<00:03:37.780> then<00:03:38.290> they'll<00:03:38.680> show<00:03:38.920> up<00:03:39.100> as<00:03:39.310> pink

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
a path then they'll show up as pink

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:47.620 
a path then they'll show up as pink
there<00:03:40.030> and

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.780 

so<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:48.440> can<00:03:48.650> play<00:03:48.920> through<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.310> different

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
so you can play through the different

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.720 
so you can play through the different
stages<00:03:50.110> there<00:03:51.110> to<00:03:51.290> get<00:03:51.440> some<00:03:51.770> variation<00:03:52.610> in

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
stages there to get some variation in

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.320 
stages there to get some variation in
your<00:03:52.850> gameplay<00:03:53.560> but<00:03:55.030> personally<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.060> don't

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
your gameplay but personally I don't

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.160 
your gameplay but personally I don't
think<00:03:56.660> this<00:03:56.780> game<00:03:57.020> last<00:03:57.380> that<00:03:57.560> long<00:03:59.080> some<00:04:00.080> of

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
think this game last that long some of

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.620 
think this game last that long some of
them<00:04:00.260> do<00:04:00.500> add<00:04:00.680> some<00:04:00.950> nice<00:04:01.100> different

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
them do add some nice different

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.260 
them do add some nice different
challenges<00:04:02.630> but<00:04:02.990> I<00:04:03.880> don't<00:04:04.880> know<00:04:04.970> there's<00:04:05.150> not

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
challenges but I don't know there's not

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.860 
challenges but I don't know there's not
not<00:04:05.420> much<00:04:05.630> to<00:04:05.810> do<00:04:05.960> in<00:04:05.990> the<00:04:06.200> game<00:04:06.440> I<00:04:07.720> guess<00:04:08.720> you

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
not much to do in the game I guess you

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.790 
not much to do in the game I guess you
could<00:04:08.900> work<00:04:09.500> through<00:04:09.770> those<00:04:09.920> achievements

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
could work through those achievements

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:20.020 
could work through those achievements
but<00:04:12.800> I<00:04:16.060> don't<00:04:17.060> know<00:04:18.430> it's<00:04:19.430> kind<00:04:19.760> of<00:04:19.790> fun<00:04:20.000> to

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
but I don't know it's kind of fun to

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.180 
but I don't know it's kind of fun to
play

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.490 

it<00:04:26.190> definitely<00:04:26.580> is<00:04:26.729> challenging<00:04:27.630> like<00:04:28.229> you

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
it definitely is challenging like you

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.309 
it definitely is challenging like you
have<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:29.449> think<00:04:30.449> a<00:04:30.599> lot<00:04:30.780> about<00:04:30.930> what<00:04:31.199> you're

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
have to think a lot about what you're

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:35.719 
have to think a lot about what you're
doing<00:04:31.639> so<00:04:32.639> flight<00:04:33.030> control<00:04:33.509> is<00:04:33.690> a<00:04:34.729> decent

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
doing so flight control is a decent

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.370 
doing so flight control is a decent
little<00:04:35.880> puzzle<00:04:36.419> game<00:04:36.630> it's<00:04:36.840> definitely

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
little puzzle game it's definitely

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.469 
little puzzle game it's definitely
really<00:04:37.560> relaxing<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.430> nice<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.880> play<00:04:39.120> if<00:04:39.449> you

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
really relaxing and nice to play if you

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.230 
really relaxing and nice to play if you
just<00:04:39.919> got<00:04:40.919> some<00:04:41.130> spare<00:04:41.430> time<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.000> want<00:04:42.150> to

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
just got some spare time and you want to

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.020 
just got some spare time and you want to
sit<00:04:42.449> around<00:04:42.569> and<00:04:43.069> work<00:04:44.069> at<00:04:44.280> a<00:04:44.310> little<00:04:44.669> kind<00:04:44.940> of

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
sit around and work at a little kind of

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.930 
sit around and work at a little kind of
logic<00:04:45.509> puzzle<00:04:46.400> but<00:04:47.400> it<00:04:47.520> doesn't<00:04:47.789> have<00:04:47.910> that

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
logic puzzle but it doesn't have that

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.129 
logic puzzle but it doesn't have that
much<00:04:48.330> of<00:04:48.539> a<00:04:48.630> lasting<00:04:49.110> value<00:04:49.940> if<00:04:50.940> you<00:04:51.690> are<00:04:51.840> a<00:04:51.870> fan

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
much of a lasting value if you are a fan

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.920 
much of a lasting value if you are a fan
of<00:04:52.199> flight<00:04:53.130> control<00:04:53.550> games<00:04:53.789> this<00:04:54.330> is<00:04:54.509> a<00:04:54.539> really

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
of flight control games this is a really

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.320 
of flight control games this is a really
good<00:04:55.159> version<00:04:56.159> of<00:04:56.280> flight<00:04:56.520> control<00:04:57.000> for<00:04:57.300> a

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
good version of flight control for a

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.809 
good version of flight control for a
phone<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:58.069> you<00:04:59.069> can<00:04:59.220> pick<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.520> up<00:04:59.610> in<00:04:59.729> the
