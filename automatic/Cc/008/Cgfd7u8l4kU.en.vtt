all your options because you're

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.799

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
different from case to case it really

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.349

depends<00:00:58.739> if<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> really<00:00:59.640> slight<00:01:00.000> case

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
depends if you have a really slight case

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.450 
depends if you have a really slight case
of<00:01:00.600> crooked<00:01:01.079> teeth<00:01:01.260> or<00:01:01.559> if<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.920> extreme

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
of crooked teeth or if you have extreme

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.210 
of crooked teeth or if you have extreme
it<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:03.180> really<00:01:03.359> jack<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> price<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.589> with

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
it can really jack up the price so with

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.399 
it can really jack up the price so with
traditional<00:01:05.760> metal<00:01:05.939> braces<00:01:06.180> they<00:01:06.869> kind<00:01:07.290> of

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
traditional metal braces they kind of

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.539 
traditional metal braces they kind of
start<00:01:07.770> around

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
start around

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.910 
start around
I<00:01:08.700> thought<00:01:09.450> cheapest<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.049> found<00:01:10.409> at<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> time

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
I thought cheapest I found at the time

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.030 
I thought cheapest I found at the time
was<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.430> between<00:01:12.030> three<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.290> four<00:01:13.530> thousand

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
was like between three to four thousand

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.490 
was like between three to four thousand
dollars<00:01:14.400> another<00:01:15.270> option<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.290> is

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
dollars another option that you have is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.980 
dollars another option that you have is
also<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.400> traditional<00:01:17.880> clear<00:01:18.210> braces<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
also the traditional clear braces and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.260 
also the traditional clear braces and
that's<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.470> clear<00:01:20.220> brackets<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.090> then

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
that's with the clear brackets but then

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.090 
that's with the clear brackets but then
they<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> metal<00:01:22.020> wires<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.799> they're<00:01:22.950> not

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
they have the metal wires so they're not

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.010 
they have the metal wires so they're not
completely<00:01:23.610> clear<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.030> they're<00:01:24.509> better<00:01:24.720> than

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
completely clear but they're better than

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.590 
completely clear but they're better than
your<00:01:25.380> regular<00:01:25.799> metal<00:01:26.340> braces<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.030> those<00:01:27.450> are

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
your regular metal braces and those are

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.420 
your regular metal braces and those are
a<00:01:27.659> little<00:01:27.810> bit<00:01:27.960> more<00:01:28.110> about<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.860> thousand

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
a little bit more about a thousand

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.670 
a little bit more about a thousand
dollars<00:01:29.640> more<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.329> think<00:01:30.450> they're<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.560> know

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
dollars more so I think they're you know

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.260 
dollars more so I think they're you know
between<00:01:31.860> four<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.280> five<00:01:32.430> thousand<00:01:32.939> dollars

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
between four and five thousand dollars

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.960 
between four and five thousand dollars
for<00:01:33.540> those<00:01:33.659> Oh<00:01:33.990> another<00:01:34.740> option<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.640> found

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
for those Oh another option that I found

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.550 
for those Oh another option that I found

want<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.829> say<00:01:49.979> Miley<00:01:50.369> Cyrus<00:01:50.790> had<00:01:51.060> these<00:01:51.299> braces

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
want to say Miley Cyrus had these braces

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.380 
want to say Miley Cyrus had these braces
they<00:01:53.040> make<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.369> talk<00:01:53.610> funny<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
they make you talk funny because the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.389 
they make you talk funny because the
braces<00:01:54.720> are<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> inside<00:01:55.409> they're<00:01:56.009> also

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
braces are on the inside they're also

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.060 
braces are on the inside they're also
extremely<00:01:57.210> expensive<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:58.380> start<00:01:58.710> at<00:01:58.890> like

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
extremely expensive they start at like

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.770 
extremely expensive they start at like
eight<00:01:59.250> thousand<00:01:59.850> dollars<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.600> is

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
eight thousand dollars and this is

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.630 
eight thousand dollars and this is
because<00:02:01.170> they're<00:02:01.409> made<00:02:01.619> out<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.770> gold<00:02:02.250> I

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
because they're made out of gold I

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.910 
because they're made out of gold I
almost<00:02:03.149> did<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.750> option<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.439> then<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> found

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
almost did this option and then I found

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.920 
almost did this option and then I found
out<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.369> had<00:02:05.610> her<00:02:05.700> too<00:02:06.060> small<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.719> mouth

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
out that I had her too small of a mouth

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.960 
out that I had her too small of a mouth
to<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:07.860> that's<00:02:08.099> one<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.789> cons<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
to this so that's one of the cons to the

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.990 
to this so that's one of the cons to the
braces<00:02:10.420> is<00:02:10.660> only<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:11.560> very<00:02:12.040> select<00:02:12.370> amount<00:02:12.820> of

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
braces is only a very select amount of

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.230 
braces is only a very select amount of
people<00:02:13.120> can<00:02:13.390> actually<00:02:13.720> get<00:02:13.900> these<00:02:14.050> braces<00:02:14.590> I

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
people can actually get these braces I

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.140

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.930 
looking
it<00:03:47.440> was<00:03:47.560> completely<00:03:47.950> horizontal<00:03:48.220> in<00:03:48.580> my<00:03:48.700> face

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
it was completely horizontal in my face

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.289 
it was completely horizontal in my face
so<00:03:49.269> that<00:03:49.299> caused<00:03:50.640> another<00:03:51.640> tooth<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.180> get

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
so that caused another tooth to get

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.150 
so that caused another tooth to get
pushed<00:03:52.570> out<00:03:52.840> because<00:03:53.320> it<00:03:53.470> had<00:03:53.620> nowhere<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:53.980> go

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
pushed out because it had nowhere to go

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.150 
pushed out because it had nowhere to go
and<00:03:54.580> so<00:03:55.450> I<00:03:55.480> had<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.959> tooth<00:03:56.200> that<00:03:56.230> stuck<00:03:56.650> out<00:03:56.769> here

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
and so I had a tooth that stuck out here

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.250 
and so I had a tooth that stuck out here
and<00:03:57.459> then<00:03:57.700> I<00:03:57.910> had<00:03:58.060> crowding<00:03:58.450> on<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.630> bottom<00:03:58.959> so

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
and then I had crowding on the bottom so

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.160 
and then I had crowding on the bottom so
that<00:03:59.290> was<00:03:59.590> my<00:03:59.799> specific<00:04:00.130> case<00:04:00.640> it<00:04:00.970> wasn't<00:04:01.660> too

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
that was my specific case it wasn't too

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.410 
that was my specific case it wasn't too
extreme<00:04:02.620> but<00:04:02.680> almost<00:04:03.519> it<00:04:03.820> was<00:04:03.880> almost<00:04:04.180> too

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
extreme but almost it was almost too

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.240 
extreme but almost it was almost too
extreme<00:04:04.720> for<00:04:04.780> Invisalign<00:04:05.380> they<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.890> lot<00:04:06.100> of

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
extreme for Invisalign they a lot of

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.820 
extreme for Invisalign they a lot of
dentists<00:04:06.610> told<00:04:06.850> me<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.209> I<00:04:07.620> could<00:04:08.620> not

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
dentists told me that I could not

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.490 
dentists told me that I could not
achieve<00:04:09.040> straight<00:04:09.730> teeth<00:04:09.970> with<00:04:10.269> Invisalign

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
achieve straight teeth with Invisalign

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.289 
achieve straight teeth with Invisalign
but<00:04:11.500> I<00:04:11.530> did<00:04:11.799> find<00:04:12.100> a<00:04:12.340> really<00:04:12.730> really<00:04:13.030> good

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
but I did find a really really good

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.930 
but I did find a really really good
orthodontist<00:04:14.230> that<00:04:14.470> specialized<00:04:15.220> he<00:04:15.700> was<00:04:15.820> one

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
orthodontist that specialized he was one

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.599 
orthodontist that specialized he was one
of<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.120> top<00:04:16.359> Invisalign<00:04:17.489> orthodontists<00:04:18.489> in

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
of the top Invisalign orthodontists in

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.969 
of the top Invisalign orthodontists in
my<00:04:18.789> area<00:04:19.120> so<00:04:19.720> that's<00:04:19.900> why<00:04:20.109> I<00:04:20.140> chose<00:04:20.380> him<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:20.830> he

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
my area so that's why I chose him and he

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:21.840 
my area so that's why I chose him and he
said<00:04:21.220> that

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
said that

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.640 
said that
of<00:04:21.880> course<00:04:22.180> I<00:04:22.420> could<00:04:22.660> do<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.110> and<00:04:23.290> that<00:04:23.380> he

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
of course I could do it and that he

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.580 
of course I could do it and that he
could<00:04:23.830> do<00:04:23.920> it<00:04:23.950> and<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:25.000> is<00:04:25.270> why<00:04:25.600> I<00:04:26.140> have<00:04:26.470> to

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
could do it and that is why I have to

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.380 
could do it and that is why I have to
wear<00:04:26.710> my<00:04:26.740> retainers<00:04:27.220> for<00:04:27.490> so<00:04:27.640> long<00:04:27.850> you<00:04:28.360> know

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
wear my retainers for so long you know

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.970 
wear my retainers for so long you know
like<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:28.900> said<00:04:28.990> earlier<00:04:29.410> I<00:04:29.500> have<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.740> wear<00:04:29.860> them

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
like I said earlier I have to wear them

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.180 
like I said earlier I have to wear them
for<00:04:30.040> at<00:04:30.370> least<00:04:30.430> 18<00:04:31.000> hours<00:04:31.120> a<00:04:31.300> day<00:04:31.680> until<00:04:32.680> I<00:04:32.920> can

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
for at least 18 hours a day until I can

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.950 
for at least 18 hours a day until I can
get<00:04:33.340> that<00:04:33.520> tooth<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:34.030> baby<00:04:34.210> tooth<00:04:34.420> removed<00:04:34.780> in

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
get that tooth the baby tooth removed in

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.440 
get that tooth the baby tooth removed in
an<00:04:35.080> implant<00:04:35.470> that's<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:36.040> right<00:04:36.340> size<00:04:36.880> put

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
an implant that's the right size put

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.690 
an implant that's the right size put
there<00:04:37.660> so<00:04:38.530> if<00:04:38.620> you're<00:04:38.740> wondering<00:04:38.920> why<00:04:39.220> I<00:04:39.250> have

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
there so if you're wondering why I have

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.220 
there so if you're wondering why I have
to<00:04:39.790> wear<00:04:39.910> them<00:04:40.060> for<00:04:40.300> an<00:04:40.510> obscene<00:04:40.870> amount<00:04:41.170> of

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
to wear them for an obscene amount of

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.100 
to wear them for an obscene amount of
time<00:04:41.500> still<00:04:42.010> that's<00:04:42.580> why<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.450> whole<00:04:43.810> process

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
time still that's why the whole process

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.940 
time still that's why the whole process
I<00:04:44.680> would<00:04:44.740> say<00:04:45.070> took<00:04:45.610> about<00:04:46.260> almost<00:04:47.260> two<00:04:47.590> years

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
I would say took about almost two years

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.360 
I would say took about almost two years
from<00:04:48.490> start<00:04:48.850> to<00:04:48.970> finish<00:04:49.620> what<00:04:50.620> they<00:04:50.770> first<00:04:51.100> do

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
from start to finish what they first do

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.520 
from start to finish what they first do
is<00:04:51.640> they<00:04:51.790> go<00:04:52.000> in<00:04:52.240> after<00:04:52.840> you've<00:04:52.990> been<00:04:53.140> approved

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
is they go in after you've been approved

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.190 
is they go in after you've been approved
to<00:04:54.010> do<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.550> Invisalign<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.450> go<00:04:55.660> in<00:04:55.870> and<00:04:56.110> you

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
to do the Invisalign you go in and you

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.560 
to do the Invisalign you go in and you
get<00:04:56.350> your<00:04:56.530> impressions<00:04:57.070> taken<00:04:57.340> and<00:04:57.790> then<00:04:58.420> they

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
get your impressions taken and then they

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.170 
get your impressions taken and then they
send<00:04:58.870> those<00:04:59.080> impressions<00:04:59.890> and<00:05:00.220> molds<00:05:00.580> off<00:05:00.760> to

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
send those impressions and molds off to

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.090 
send those impressions and molds off to
a<00:05:03.000> lab<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.420> this<00:05:04.720> lab<00:05:05.020> takes<00:05:05.410> it<00:05:05.620> puts<00:05:05.920> these

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
a lab and this lab takes it puts these

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.340 
a lab and this lab takes it puts these
molds<00:05:06.460> into<00:05:06.730> the<00:05:06.850> computer<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:07.630> they<00:05:07.900> kind<00:05:08.260> of

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
molds into the computer and they kind of

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.370 
molds into the computer and they kind of
plot<00:05:08.800> and<00:05:09.130> map<00:05:09.160> out<00:05:09.790> your<00:05:10.090> process<00:05:10.960> and<00:05:11.260> your

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
plot and map out your process and your

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.770 
plot and map out your process and your
journey<00:05:11.710> that<00:05:12.400> your<00:05:12.550> tooth<00:05:12.790> is<00:05:13.000> going<00:05:13.180> to<00:05:13.510> take

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
journey that your tooth is going to take

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.890 
journey that your tooth is going to take
in<00:05:14.050> two<00:05:14.740> straight<00:05:15.190> vil<00:05:15.520> when<00:05:16.420> they're<00:05:16.600> moving

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
in two straight vil when they're moving

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.780 
in two straight vil when they're moving
your<00:05:17.020> teeth<00:05:17.200> around<00:05:17.560> if<00:05:17.830> you<00:05:17.950> have<00:05:17.980> a<00:05:18.400> tooth

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
your teeth around if you have a tooth

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.120 
your teeth around if you have a tooth
like<00:05:19.060> mine<00:05:19.420> that's<00:05:19.720> stuck<00:05:20.110> out<00:05:20.320> they<00:05:20.680> put<00:05:20.920> what

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
like mine that's stuck out they put what

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.840 
like mine that's stuck out they put what
is<00:05:21.400> called<00:05:21.700> a<00:05:21.970> button<00:05:22.420> on<00:05:22.630> that<00:05:22.870> tooth<00:05:23.140> and

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
is called a button on that tooth and

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.280 
is called a button on that tooth and
they<00:05:24.850> don't<00:05:25.030> show<00:05:25.090> this<00:05:25.390> in<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.780> commercial

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
they don't show this in the commercial

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.540 
they don't show this in the commercial
so<00:05:26.500> you're<00:05:26.650> thinking<00:05:27.010> that<00:05:27.160> they're<00:05:27.310> just

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
so you're thinking that they're just

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.400 
so you're thinking that they're just
clear<00:05:27.820> trays<00:05:28.090> but<00:05:28.420> they're<00:05:28.570> actually<00:05:28.750> not<00:05:29.020> you

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
clear trays but they're actually not you

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.350 
clear trays but they're actually not you
get<00:05:29.590> these<00:05:29.740> buttons<00:05:30.160> put<00:05:30.370> on<00:05:30.490> your<00:05:30.610> teeth<00:05:30.850> or<00:05:31.090> I

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
get these buttons put on your teeth or I

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.240 
get these buttons put on your teeth or I
want<00:05:31.660> to<00:05:31.750> they're<00:05:32.170> not<00:05:32.290> ceramic<00:05:32.890> or<00:05:33.040> maybe

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250
