00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
play online but it's still pretty fun

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.640 
play online but it's still pretty fun
it's<00:02:39.310> basically<00:02:39.760> just<00:02:39.880> like<00:02:40.600> parts<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.530> the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
it's basically just like parts of the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.390 
it's basically just like parts of the
storyline<00:02:42.130> but<00:02:42.959> laid<00:02:43.959> out<00:02:44.170> differently<00:02:44.680> for

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
your go-to right here to solve the most

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.140 
your go-to right here to solve the most
hardware<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.830> guess<00:03:37.070> um<00:03:38.200> change<00:03:39.430> your<00:03:40.430> soldiers

layout<00:03:41.990> I<00:03:42.020> think<00:03:42.320> there's<00:03:42.470> like<00:03:42.560> eight<00:03:43.280> or

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
layout I think there's like eight or

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.480 
layout I think there's like eight or
nine<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:44.000> all<00:03:44.150> of<00:03:44.420> this<00:03:44.750> pretty<00:03:45.530> cool<00:03:45.770> you<00:03:46.340> got

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
nine and all of this pretty cool you got

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.430 
nine and all of this pretty cool you got
jungle<00:03:46.760> pattern<00:03:47.300> stuff<00:03:47.780> like<00:03:47.960> that<00:03:47.990> the

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
jungle pattern stuff like that the

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.880 
jungle pattern stuff like that the
desert<00:03:48.860> urban<00:03:50.530> veteran<00:03:51.530> then<00:03:51.680> you<00:03:51.740> got

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
desert urban veteran then you got

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.230 
desert urban veteran then you got
special<00:03:52.460> ops<00:03:52.610> which<00:03:52.910> looks<00:03:53.150> pretty<00:03:53.210> cool<00:03:53.570> I

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
special ops which looks pretty cool I

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.530 
special ops which looks pretty cool I
think<00:03:56.240> definitely<00:03:56.570> one<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:56.960> the<00:03:57.080> best<00:03:57.260> ones

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
think definitely one of the best ones

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
new games another one I have like this

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.810 
new games another one I have like this
is<00:05:36.270> a<00:05:36.830> assassin's<00:05:37.830> creed<00:05:38.010> brotherhood<00:05:38.190> it's

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
is a assassin's creed brotherhood it's

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.270 
is a assassin's creed brotherhood it's
got<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.030> mandolin<00:05:39.450> the<00:05:39.510> game<00:05:40.040> so<00:05:41.040> you<00:05:41.100> don't

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
got the mandolin the game so you don't

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.710 
got the mandolin the game so you don't
have<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.490> fiddle<00:05:42.060> through<00:05:42.330> the<00:05:42.420> fucking

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
have to fiddle through the fucking

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.450 
have to fiddle through the fucking
manual<00:05:42.900> but<00:05:43.290> another<00:05:43.590> downside<00:05:43.920> to<00:05:44.310> that<00:05:44.340> is

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
manual but another downside to that is

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.180 
manual but another downside to that is
you<00:05:44.670> have<00:05:44.850> to<00:05:44.970> go<00:05:45.090> like<00:05:45.240> to<00:05:45.420> the<00:05:45.450> main<00:05:45.750> menu

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
you have to go like to the main menu

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.740 
you have to go like to the main menu
actually<00:05:47.190> you<00:05:47.520> might<00:05:47.670> be<00:05:47.820> able<00:05:47.910> to<00:05:48.090> go<00:05:48.510> through

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
actually you might be able to go through

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.320 
actually you might be able to go through
out<00:05:49.020> in<00:05:49.260> Game<00:05:49.680> haven't<00:05:50.490> tried<00:05:50.640> that<00:05:50.670> yet<00:05:50.850> but

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
out in Game haven't tried that yet but

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.570 
out in Game haven't tried that yet but
yeah<00:05:52.640> it's<00:05:53.640> pretty<00:05:53.850> good<00:05:54.060> option<00:05:54.900> to<00:05:55.050> have<00:05:55.580> but

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
yeah it's pretty good option to have but

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.630 
yeah it's pretty good option to have but
then<00:05:56.730> it<00:05:57.570> would<00:05:57.750> be<00:05:57.810> nice<00:05:57.960> to<00:05:58.110> have<00:05:58.170> both

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640 
then it would be nice to have both

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.740 
then it would be nice to have both
because<00:05:59.640> the<00:05:59.730> manuals<00:06:00.120> is<00:06:00.300> now<00:06:00.480> like<00:06:00.720> a

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
because the manuals is now like a

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.150 
because the manuals is now like a
three-page<00:06:01.380> piece<00:06:02.010> of<00:06:02.160> shit<00:06:02.370> fold<00:06:02.670> out<00:06:03.080> and

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
three-page piece of shit fold out and

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.490 
three-page piece of shit fold out and
that's<00:06:05.160> the<00:06:05.520> load<00:06:05.910> out<00:06:06.030> of<00:06:06.180> the<00:06:06.300> menu<00:06:07.230> I<00:06:07.290> guess

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
that's the load out of the menu I guess

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.020 
that's the load out of the menu I guess
I'll<00:06:08.040> be<00:06:08.190> coming<00:06:08.340> up<00:06:08.430> with<00:06:08.580> some<00:06:08.700> gameplay

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
I'll be coming up with some gameplay

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.180 
I'll be coming up with some gameplay
later<00:06:09.240> on<00:06:09.470> didn't<00:06:10.470> really<00:06:10.560> want<00:06:10.770> to<00:06:10.830> do<00:06:10.890> a<00:06:10.920> long

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
later on didn't really want to do a long

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.700 
later on didn't really want to do a long
