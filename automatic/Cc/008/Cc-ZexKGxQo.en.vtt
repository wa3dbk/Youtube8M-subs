00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.869
 game sonic riders

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.130

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:45.090
 several ways like the las vegas made a 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:48.630
 heap around the park a park 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.090
 during his author episodes of liberty 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.610
 city ​​we are good are the kids that 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.030
 They are in the two stories one 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.930
 it's called luis and the other one I do not put on 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.570
 call but this game is very good 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.120
 this deadly kombat as against the 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.440
 Superheros 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:13.540
 mortal kombat against those of times those of 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:16.370

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.510
 important comets

 has three for one this game already has 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.580
 a lot that came out almost when I had left 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.340
 the game is very good the truth is that 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.240
 I bring some graphs you can address a 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.900
 public and many games and there are contents 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.170
 Clear 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.770
 This is like some warm but like 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:47.090
 requires a not too good excess he is a 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.090
 guy that uses makes fights lost 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.270
 and such a turn three rock legends this 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.350
 it is very good the truth there are many 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.090
 characters many guitars many 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.130

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.520
 motion this in real life 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.680
 This is like a first spot but it brings more 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.680
 minimum if the truth is very real 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.030

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.230
