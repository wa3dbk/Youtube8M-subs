Zekrom on my bench as there we go zekrom

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.049 
Zekrom on my bench as there we go zekrom
is<00:00:46.469> going<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.710> go<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.829> my<00:00:47.070> bench<00:00:47.309> now<00:00:47.520> i'm<00:00:47.910> going

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059

to see how much HP has see if i can hit

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.540 
to see how much HP has see if i can hit
with<00:00:50.940> patchy<00:00:51.420> or<00:00:51.809> not<00:00:52.020> patchy<00:00:52.559> only<00:00:52.980> does<00:00:53.160> 50

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
with patchy or not patchy only does 50

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.049 
with patchy or not patchy only does 50
so<00:00:53.789> no<00:00:54.300> I'm<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> send<00:00:55.680> out<00:00:55.860> Patchi<00:00:56.100> uses

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
so no I'm going to send out Patchi uses

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.939 
so no I'm going to send out Patchi uses
ability<00:00:57.510> attach<00:00:57.930> those<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> electric

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
ability attach those to electric

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.290 
ability attach those to electric
energies<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.520> them<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:01.170> then<00:01:02.160> we're<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:03.030> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
energies to them and then we're going to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.649 
energies to them and then we're going to
play<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.350> Shaymin<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.270> that's<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> let

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
play the Shaymin and that's going to let

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.539 
play the Shaymin and that's going to let
us<00:01:06.750> move<00:01:07.020> those<00:01:07.260> electric<00:01:07.710> energies<00:01:08.100> over<00:01:08.430> to

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
us move those electric energies over to

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.560 
us move those electric energies over to
Zekrom<00:01:09.979> so<00:01:10.979> we<00:01:11.400> will<00:01:11.549> do<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:13.909> then<00:01:14.909> after

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
Zekrom so we will do that and then after

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.820 
Zekrom so we will do that and then after
that<00:01:15.689> we're<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.020> attach<00:01:16.140> one<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.740> those

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that we're going to attach one of those

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.210 
that we're going to attach one of those
rescue<00:01:17.130> energies<00:01:17.689> over<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.810> Zekrom<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:20.040> now

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
rescue energies over to Zekrom and now

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.090 
rescue energies over to Zekrom and now
