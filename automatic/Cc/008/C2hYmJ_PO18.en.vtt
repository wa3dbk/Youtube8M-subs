00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 very good guys that so welcome to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.850
 a new video for the advance warfare 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.290
 sexes zombies have returned and with them the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.599
 trailer of this game mode the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.309
 second dlc up on dance before 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.469
 begin I have to tell you that it is a 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.120
 very nice trailer they have been very 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.980
 very cool and that of course we are going to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.539
 enjoy the channel right now but 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.119
 this time with a little bit less 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.340
 analysis since we know it practically 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.260
 everything except for that of something 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.510
 that I will comment now and we are going to 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.369
 enjoy a little more calm and 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.779
 that without further delay we go there for sure 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.610
 that there are many people among them who 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.920
 they wondered how the characters 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.260
 they had been able to move the previous map 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.510
 outbreak to a hamburger burger 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.950
 town because here we show guys 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.840
 as I tell you we are going to enjoy the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.820
 tranquis trailer we see here the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.379
 characters that are therefore the previous 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.850
 map of a break map tell us 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.950
 that he and liszt is for a weapon by 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.140
 first time and as after is a bit 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.600
 up to iker's ass they tell us 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.469
 they also showed enthusiasm 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.969
 exaggerated as it flew the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.039
 situation where the killing was 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.260
 zombies and fucking up the ass and 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.210
 they say they should have died in 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.630
 that situation and when it seems that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.170
 everything is lost come the reinforcements 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.390
 of atlas and exo part 2 begins 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.430
 zombies take them recover them 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.930
 they give medical attention me what not 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.509
 I understand is why they are taken to a 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.820
 hamburgueserÃ­a you know that it is my project 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.619
 but hey it's there they're shit all 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.840
 and they take them yes yes to the burger is or 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.640
 attention of this doll of salt of the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.649
 then that's baby and it's going to be very 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.420
 important in the interest and they already begin 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.069
 the typical kinematics of everything is going to 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.350
 fuck to burger town and fight 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.549
 against the exosomes as I tell you guys 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.470
 is that there is practically nothing that 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.659
 we can analyze because we already 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.520
 we imagine everything and we know it is equipped 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.380
 with the exo in the exo station and 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.390
 come fight against the zombie sexes 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.099
 this is the way of saving civilians 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.959
 s war see how much I was surprised 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:50.310
 previous trailer is the one that comes to 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.840
 save two civilians had to be a 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.490
 separate game mode because one thing 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.189
 is to raise rounds and another little thing very 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.689
 different is to save civilians and here already 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.509
 they begin to show us the little things 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.770
 new the new weapon the nw axis that like 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.899
 you see is a weapon of overheating 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.520
 It works just like the laser weapon and let's go 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.829
 that turns the zombies into popcorn 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.479
 and I bust them I hope it's a weapon 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.180
 very useful to climb quite rounds 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.500
 new traps like the crocodile and 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.090
 is that not 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.980
 shown the sniper tower and a 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.990
 ray that electrifies the zombies and the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.490
 they burst new zombies like the zombie 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.590
 but acid that tells us that we have 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.880
 very careful with the puddles 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.520
 skeleton zombies and this is very 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.900
 interesting new allies like this 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.550
 vehicle that comes here below 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.980
 it's not a guard is another little thing more 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.870
 powerful that I can help us a little bit 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.450
 the characters john malkovich bill 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.770
 paxton ross mccowan and of course I in 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.959
 see such that it's a bit gone from the 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.760
 head but that pretty cool the new 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.680
 arms over there and I'm telling you no 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.480
 we know practically everyone wonder 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.070
 Why is everything so says walking 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.080
 always takes care of sending everything to the 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.000
 shit and here we have the star of 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.680
 this map the zombie and goliat that already 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.650
 I'm looking forward to face him 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.489

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.620
