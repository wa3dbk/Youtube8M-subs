00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.340 
and to make it look neat and then I cut
a<00:02:45.990> piece<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.260> white<00:02:46.770> regular<00:02:47.580> printer<00:02:48.000> paper

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.890 
a piece of white regular printer paper
the<00:02:49.350> same<00:02:49.820> size<00:02:50.820> of<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.360> box

the same size of the box

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.230 
the same size of the box
do<00:02:52.020> not<00:02:52.200> make<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.530> bigger<00:02:52.740> so<00:02:53.580> it'll<00:02:53.970> be<00:02:54.090> able

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
do not make it bigger so it'll be able

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.070 
do not make it bigger so it'll be able
to<00:02:54.450> fit<00:02:54.810> between<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:55.920> then<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:56.970> use<00:02:57.330> squares

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
to fit between it and then I use squares

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.980 
to fit between it and then I use squares
of<00:02:58.470> paper<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.370> glued<00:02:59.880> it<00:02:59.910> on<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.450> make<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.810> look
