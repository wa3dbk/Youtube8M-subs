00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.450
 Socrates is the one that Kim is also 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.070
 serginho that show how I did then 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.110
 in the case of my 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.890
 the suspension tower she stays here 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.520
 in that in the body of the car that does not 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.810
 I have a separate monoblock chance 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.480
 then the per capita cost of this piece 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.770
 this is due this surface and 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.480
 hanging tower 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.480
 I do not know who was there that cuba 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.809
 You can see this piece from here to there. 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.210
 on 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.090
 It's what I said so it's two 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.910
 inches pushing the tower over to 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.150
 low in relation to the bodywork 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.010
 this only makes the entire tower 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.870
 further away from the lapa 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.579
 so it's no problem, it's the end of the problem. 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.630
 of course on the buffer like most 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.829
 I was speaking 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.829
 already at the rear 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.530
 I just touched the ball by touching the ball. 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.910
 shock absorber stays a little more stretched 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.149
 a little less than five centimeters 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.369
 because the walker is right angle 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:17.090
 but then I missed course type of 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:21.350
 bumper about four centimeters I know 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.970
 there of extension courses but not type 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.330
 I had no problem even cheering. 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:32.289
 all aa good suspension and that's it 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.289
 It turned out cool 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.560
 the rest my biotype to have everything 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.100
 original 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.140
 I did not have to change anything one thing that I 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.020
 I do not know how yours is how it is 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.580
 it's the kinetic album up front is because I 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.830
 I do not know if it 's a balan 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.890
 I mean, it's scales but I do not know 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.229
 how is the differential output 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.049
 thriving shaft tip 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:10.140
 In the case of mine, you can see that the 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:15.209
 ynet girls who stayed more is at the angle 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.880
 more inclined and this if you get up 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.750
 many think he ends up pushing too hard 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.569
 exciting 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.239
 this way you're kind of soft in a 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.190
 alestra a little bit like strong 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.770
 little more 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.180
 but I have not had any problems so far 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.010
 I'm using 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.400
 sometimes doing something more pauleira 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:40.290
 so I'm using four by four 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.780
 almost every day on this trip to 61 66 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.650
 67 days I'm traveling 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.640
 I use it to taste almost every day 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.620
 we usually miss out on more 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.170
 light but also doing some other 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:58.020
 more rays things a little and so far 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:00.390
 in good faith that it is the experience that I 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.300
 I have a limit on my car case. 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.870
 I replaced the springs I put the 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.420
 larger ball is the diameter is the same in the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.700
 sometimes there are the size of the stones at 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.120
 even it 's just that she's a little 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.090
 and longer in the front to fabri 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.270
 This car is just me or the other thing I 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.710
 I also did was that the bar the bar 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.990
 stabilizer 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.150
 that's how she was going to lean me 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.560
 I put the pants here 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.560
 but at the end of the day I ended up 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.720
 discovering that nothing changes with chaos 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.570
 in chaos so I left for now despite 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.230
 of it being an extra business for 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.930
 shave underneath 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.850
 I left it for convenience just because I had 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.750
 but does not change anything in the 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.750
 stability of the car 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.660
 that's it
