a pound you can upgrade to get rid of
that<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.189> probably<00:01:41.460> get<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> few<00:01:41.790> extras<00:01:42.180> as

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299

well like more destinations to choose

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.609 
well like more destinations to choose
from<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:45.720> another<00:01:45.899> thing<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.350> about<00:01:46.380> it

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
from but another thing I like about it

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.109 
from but another thing I like about it
is<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.070> when<00:01:47.340> you're<00:01:47.520> going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.759> bed<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.060> you

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
is that when you're going to bed and you

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.120 
is that when you're going to bed and you
want<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.329> keep<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.840> simply<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.320> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
want to keep it on you simply just I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.130 
want to keep it on you simply just I
think<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.490> swipe<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.909> or<00:01:51.030> down<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.869> swipe

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
think it's swipe up or down you swipe

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.870 
think it's swipe up or down you swipe
down<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.649> will<00:01:52.710> dim<00:01:52.979> your<00:01:53.340> actual<00:01:53.640> phone

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
down and it will dim your actual phone

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.639 
down and it will dim your actual phone
so<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.180> simply<00:01:54.390> put<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.200> your<00:01:55.350> docking

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
so you can simply put it on your docking
