for<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> little<00:00:48.360> bit<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.860> cannot<00:00:49.860> get<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.370> steel

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
of the blade and this seems to kind of

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.539 
of the blade and this seems to kind of
have<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.829> which<00:01:50.009> doesn't<00:01:50.430> lend

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
have that on it which doesn't lend

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.639 
have that on it which doesn't lend
itself<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.909> being<00:01:51.119> sharpened<00:01:51.540> very<00:01:51.780> well<00:01:52.020> with

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
itself to being sharpened very well with

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.810 
itself to being sharpened very well with
the<00:01:52.770> type<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.950> sharpening<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.460> I'm<00:01:53.640> doing

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the type of sharpening that I'm doing

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.880 
the type of sharpening that I'm doing
with<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.270> because<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.079> sharpen<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:55.799> I

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
with it because I sharpen it just like I

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.609 
with it because I sharpen it just like I
do<00:01:55.950> all<00:01:56.130> my<00:01:56.159> other<00:01:56.399> blades<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.439> while<00:01:58.439> you're

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
do all my other blades so while you're

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.200 
do all my other blades so while you're
hitting<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> sharpener<00:01:59.549> you<00:02:00.060> know

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
hitting it on the sharpener you know

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.080 
hitting it on the sharpener you know
with<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:01.799> two<00:02:01.950> little<00:02:02.130> ceramic<00:02:02.729> rod

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
with the two little ceramic rod

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.569 
with the two little ceramic rod
sharpeners<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.869> like<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.590> do<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.130> far<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:05.369> I

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
sharpeners I like to do that as far as I

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.160 
sharpeners I like to do that as far as I
just<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:05.880> quick<00:02:06.060> sharpening<00:02:06.479> jobs<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.960> stuff

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
just for quick sharpening jobs and stuff

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.320 
just for quick sharpening jobs and stuff
like<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.590> or<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.489> ceramic<00:02:08.849> rod<00:02:09.000> one

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
like that and or on the ceramic rod one

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.630 
like that and or on the ceramic rod one
and<00:02:09.569> with<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.530> you're<00:02:10.920> kind<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.190> sharpening

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and with that you're kind of sharpening

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.460 
and with that you're kind of sharpening
more<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.300> outside<00:02:12.720> edges<00:02:12.930> where<00:02:13.200> mine

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
more of the outside edges where mine

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.380 
more of the outside edges where mine
uncle's<00:02:13.680> would<00:02:13.800> be<00:02:13.860> versus<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.760> tip<00:02:15.060> because

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
uncle's would be versus that tip because

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.840 
uncle's would be versus that tip because
the<00:02:15.840> angle<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.440> great<00:02:16.710> so<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.640> makes

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
the angle is so great so if that makes

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.360 
the angle is so great so if that makes
sense<00:02:18.060> if<00:02:18.360> not<00:02:18.660> not<00:02:19.050> apologize<00:02:19.590> just<00:02:19.710> skip<00:02:20.010> you

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
sense if not not apologize just skip you

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.190 
sense if not not apologize just skip you
know<00:02:20.490> whatever<00:02:22.340> overall<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.610> like<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.690> blade<00:02:24.960> i

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
know whatever overall I like the blade i

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.030 
know whatever overall I like the blade i
will<00:02:25.890> say<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.430> on<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.900> back<00:02:28.200> spring<00:02:28.530> tension

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
will say that on the back spring tension

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.430 
will say that on the back spring tension
for<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.760> smaller<00:02:30.060> blade<00:02:30.390> i<00:02:30.660> wish<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.320> was<00:02:31.350> a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
for the smaller blade i wish it was a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.680 
for the smaller blade i wish it was a
little<00:02:31.500> bit<00:02:31.800> stronger<00:02:32.160> actually<00:02:32.910> heard<00:02:33.510> these

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
little bit stronger actually heard these

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.390 
little bit stronger actually heard these
were<00:02:33.810> nail<00:02:34.020> breakers<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.680> didn't<00:02:35.010> actually<00:02:35.100> get

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
were nail breakers I didn't actually get

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.950 
were nail breakers I didn't actually get
that<00:02:35.610> out<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:35.940> blade<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.270> don't<00:02:36.600> know<00:02:36.720> that

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
that out of this blade I don't know that

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.320 
that out of this blade I don't know that
maybe<00:02:37.680> somebody<00:02:38.070> was<00:02:38.190> not<00:02:38.340> referring<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:39.030> this

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
maybe somebody was not referring to this

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.080 
maybe somebody was not referring to this
particular<00:02:39.600> GDC<00:02:40.440> or<00:02:40.710> all<00:02:40.920> gec<00:02:41.460> knives<00:02:41.730> maybe

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
particular GDC or all gec knives maybe

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.210 
particular GDC or all gec knives maybe
just<00:02:42.300> one<00:02:42.450> particular<00:02:42.900> model<00:02:43.320> but<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:43.920> don't

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
just one particular model but I don't

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.500 
just one particular model but I don't
really<00:02:44.310> get<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.550> out<00:02:44.820> of<00:02:44.850> this<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.330> wish

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
really get that out of this and I wish

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.760 
really get that out of this and I wish
that<00:02:45.720> on<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.900> smaller<00:02:46.170> blade<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.620> back

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
that on the smaller blade the back

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.850 
that on the smaller blade the back
spring<00:02:47.100> was<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> little<00:02:47.910> bit<00:02:48.000> stronger<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.860> on

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
spring was a little bit stronger and on

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.510 
spring was a little bit stronger and on
the<00:02:50.610> top<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.880> this<00:02:51.360> coping<00:02:51.870> blade<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.380> wish<00:02:53.220> that

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
the top of this coping blade I wish that

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.820 
the top of this coping blade I wish that
this<00:02:53.700> angle<00:02:53.970> right<00:02:54.300> here<00:02:54.360> wasn't<00:02:54.900> here<00:02:55.290> that

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
this angle right here wasn't here that

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.699 
this angle right here wasn't here that
angle<00:02:56.100> is<00:02:56.160> extremely<00:02:56.730> sharp<00:02:57.110> on<00:02:58.110> your<00:02:58.350> finger

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
angle is extremely sharp on your finger

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.410 
angle is extremely sharp on your finger
sign<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.430> like<00:02:59.730> what<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.060> your<00:03:00.090> finger

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
sign of it like what is your finger

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.610 
sign of it like what is your finger
doing<00:03:00.510> all<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.810> way<00:03:00.900> up<00:03:00.990> here<00:03:01.170> well<00:03:01.470> it

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
doing all the way up here well it

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.320 
doing all the way up here well it
happens<00:03:01.980> when<00:03:02.160> it's<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.370> your<00:03:02.459> pocket

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.280 

actually<00:03:06.330> not<00:03:06.510> when<00:03:06.660> it's<00:03:06.780> in<00:03:06.840> your<00:03:06.930> pocket<00:03:07.050> I

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
actually not when it's in your pocket I

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.230 
actually not when it's in your pocket I
guess<00:03:07.410> this<00:03:07.530> one<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:07.800> open<00:03:08.070> when<00:03:08.820> it's<00:03:08.940> open

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
guess this one is open when it's open

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.190 
guess this one is open when it's open
you<00:03:09.390> can<00:03:09.540> feel<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:10.050> portion<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:10.860> your<00:03:11.130> hand

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
you can feel that portion in your hand

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.930 
you can feel that portion in your hand
when<00:03:13.200> you're<00:03:13.350> holding<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.650> blade<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.820> it

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
when you're holding the blade so it

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.820 
when you're holding the blade so it
makes<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.360> little<00:03:15.540> bit<00:03:15.720> uncomfortable<00:03:15.840> it's

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
makes it a little bit uncomfortable it's

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.530 
makes it a little bit uncomfortable it's
not<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.980> sharp<00:03:17.280> edge<00:03:17.459> but<00:03:17.850> it's<00:03:17.970> enough<00:03:18.330> there

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
not a sharp edge but it's enough there

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.479 
not a sharp edge but it's enough there
to<00:03:18.570> where<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:18.840> notice<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.980> really

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
to where you notice it and I really

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.830 
to where you notice it and I really
don't<00:03:20.670> like<00:03:20.850> that<00:03:20.910> i<00:03:21.150> don't<00:03:21.450> like<00:03:21.570> that<00:03:21.630> the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
don't like that i don't like that the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.259 
don't like that i don't like that the
edge<00:03:21.989> of<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.530> blades<00:03:22.769> here<00:03:23.100> are<00:03:23.700> not<00:03:24.060> really

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
edge of the blades here are not really

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.330 
edge of the blades here are not really
rounded<00:03:24.810> they're<00:03:25.230> just<00:03:25.410> more<00:03:25.560> like<00:03:25.769> rough<00:03:26.070> cut

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
rounded they're just more like rough cut

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.250 
rounded they're just more like rough cut
and<00:03:26.550> that's<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.269> they<00:03:27.900> leave<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.110> little

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
and that's it and they leave a little

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.590 
and that's it and they leave a little
bit<00:03:28.440> sharpness<00:03:28.980> on<00:03:29.220> them<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.209> goes<00:03:30.390> for

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
bit sharpness on them and that goes for

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.300 
bit sharpness on them and that goes for
both<00:03:30.630> sides<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.230> special<00:03:31.620> on<00:03:31.709> your<00:03:31.890> main<00:03:32.010> clip

mind it necessarily you just seemed a

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.280 
mind it necessarily you just seemed a
little<00:04:50.640> bit<00:04:50.820> cracker<00:04:51.330> I<00:04:51.510> take<00:04:51.780> that<00:04:51.900> back<00:04:51.960> I<00:04:52.230> do

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
mind it but it just seemed a little bit

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.470 
mind it but it just seemed a little bit
faster<00:04:55.050> than<00:04:55.200> when<00:04:55.290> I<00:04:55.320> was<00:04:55.440> used<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.770> so<00:04:56.190> that
