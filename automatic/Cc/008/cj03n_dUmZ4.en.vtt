00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.710
 psychotic for all I am core of 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.360
 in need and this is minecraft we are 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.630
 to Thursday and we are a seed day 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.309
 middle class and I'll bring you because I think 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.460
 that this seed is possible that had 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.300
 brought from the past agreed but it was 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.250
 each version I do not know if 1.4 1.5 is worth no 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.570
 I remember exactly and it is that the other 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.300
 day I was going to try 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.560
 on a map and well this seed I said the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.990
 prey seed I want to buy some 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.130
 cosillas and embellishing has changed 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.750
 said 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.570
 what is this what is this and is that the 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.100
 seed literally change in agreement 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.890
 where before a temple there is no 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.230
 temple where there used to be four backs 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.239
 to the law none fine changes both the 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.620
 seed that I say I 'm going to update the 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.780
 seed in some way because if 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.379
 you enter 1.6 if you put a 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.960
 finish is to say with dress you are a 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.550
 fraud here or anything but good as 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.900
 You see I'm going to leave them in miapuesta and 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.860
 perfect so 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.860
 seed 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.760
 in creative we put on and the seed 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.010
 next is going to be there is there to see that 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:14.580
 could wrong to generate a space to 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:17.880
 see none is less 6 7 12 5 8 039 ok 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.800
 and we all generate great and we give 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.470
 nobody trusted us that you already know that yes 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.240
 we can some chest add something new 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.490
 to seed the seed as it changes 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.410
 a little bit of agreement as if you put 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.470
 extra large biomes outside you're 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.159
 enlarging the seeds will change or 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.530
 we do not want in the world 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.420
 and let's see where we left to remember 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.620
 we left a kind of jungle one 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.730
 little bit worth 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.730
 nothing special 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.420
 and let's start with the light like 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.980
 today is the jungle 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.960
 you see the desert 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.420
 good important nothing get out of law 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.930
 we have lava this is great because there 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.420
 water there is lava there are cows there are cubes 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.130
 in general you already have obsidian and you 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.120
 you can go read perfectly without 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.369
 no type of inconvenience according 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.460
 we saw them a little bit more a little more 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.280
 topics a little bit more a little bit more 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.740
 we come to the pyramid 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.840
 remind you that in the seed this was 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.720
 pyramid and town here there was a 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.610
 answer remember here there was another there 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.860
 there was another and a little bit further there was 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.200
 another then there was another town more for 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.060
 it's worth it now there's nothing like that just 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.580
 there are those two things and also the chests 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.350
 all changed according to which 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.650
 we will find them in this first 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.650
 chest 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.069
 fuck 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:49.200

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:51.880
 five gold emerald the flesh 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.010
 bones in the flesh 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:59.010
 more gold more bones and more meat 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.410
 more meat could be more gold more 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.930
 bones 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.330
 and three emeralds of the box and have 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.220
 shown the hand 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.010
 when they surpass the is very well 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.810
 is brutally good that is, is that 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.319

 It has to be populated with the joy of 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.770
 agreement 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.770
 it is wonderful 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.400
 and then you have then that more bread a 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.190
 gold saddle that comes very well 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.980
 more just a few blocks because you already have 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.330
 your golden apples with the gold incised 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.990

 that there are not many, I already tell you 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.080
 little ones but the little ones there are 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.250
 all the points are worth because before 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.459
 start to start the tee we are 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.209
 in the coordinates 13 17 67 the second 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:18.000
 be less 367 worth and we're going 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:24.870
 to go to minus 276 that is to say here next 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.870
 42 42 343 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.030
 and here we have our chest and there 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.150
 we have a responds to the things of 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.150
 agreement 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.289
 and in the chest we have what we wanted 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.289
 just what we look for in these chests 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.789
 the filtration and we keep it here is 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.009
 imperfect of the unjust we like the 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.639
 Strict fresh are melon seeds 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:54.389
 and each bar that we have also 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:57.540
 how great is a super full chest 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:05.610
 be worth what you need and basically 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:09.030
 and then there's minus 2 7 466 267 sorry and 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.620
 we have an answer is I'm going to 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.540
 have is true and is I think next 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.190
 from the town by the look there is the 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.870
 pyramid plan there is the town worth 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.100
 you do not go to the best but I now 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.960
 I will approach and good is in situation there 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.180
 22 of sand and what does it mean that there 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.070
 chest and how and not up here wants 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.140
 say the backup for 2 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.850
 that is skeletons for me the best 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.780
 he replies the skeleton exists as well 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:36.220
 that property that is something very 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:38.140
 discrete is little ok or is it easier 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.289
 let one of zombies or one of the year 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.379
 estimated discovers all 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:46.559
 so wonderful we found the 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:49.409
 backing the country to that spiders here 

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:52.009

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:56.689
 of infinities and here you have 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:06:00.210
 bones bows arrows and armors 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:02.409
 infinite or better impossible 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.650
 and what this chest looks like 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:10.960
 let's tackle first in the trash 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:12.460
 and we'll make gold and silver diamond like that but 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.490
 well that he does not want the thing 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:20.139
 as silly as I woke up the morning 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:23.219
