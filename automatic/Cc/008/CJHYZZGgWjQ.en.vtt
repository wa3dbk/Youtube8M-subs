before<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:42.989> boils<00:00:43.200> over<00:00:43.940> we<00:00:44.940> pour<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> brittle

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
before it boils over we pour the brittle

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.720 
before it boils over we pour the brittle
onto<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> marble<00:00:46.230> table<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.100> then<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.370> scrape

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
onto the marble table and then we scrape

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.580 
onto the marble table and then we scrape
the<00:00:47.879> kettle<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:48.270> really<00:00:48.570> well<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:49.260> don't<00:00:49.410> want

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
the kettle out really well we don't want

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.319 
the kettle out really well we don't want
to<00:00:49.680> waste<00:00:49.829> any<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.550> delicious<00:00:50.940> peanut

case<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:54.930> wondering

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
case you are wondering

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.780 
case you are wondering
we<00:00:56.570> then<00:00:57.140> spread<00:00:57.680> this<00:00:57.950> incredibly<00:00:58.550> hot

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
we then spread this incredibly hot

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.300 
we then spread this incredibly hot
mixture<00:00:59.180> out<00:00:59.510> over<00:00:59.840> the<00:00:59.930> entire<00:01:00.050> marble<00:01:00.920> table

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
mixture out over the entire marble table

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.550 
mixture out over the entire marble table
this<00:01:01.970> helps<00:01:02.300> to<00:01:02.420> cool<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:02.870> brittle<00:01:03.200> and<00:01:03.380> keep

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
this helps to cool the brittle and keep

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.010 
this helps to cool the brittle and keep
it<00:01:03.710> from<00:01:03.830> cooking<00:01:04.100> further<00:01:04.580> there's<00:01:05.390> also<00:01:05.630> the

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
it from cooking further there's also the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.110 
it from cooking further there's also the
first<00:01:06.320> step<00:01:06.590> in<00:01:06.830> making<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.280> griddle<00:01:07.760> thin

first step in making the griddle thin
the<00:01:08.810> way<00:01:08.930> people<00:01:09.260> like<00:01:09.440> it<00:01:09.650> after<00:01:10.550> it<00:01:10.640> is

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
the way people like it after it is

the way people like it after it is
cooled<00:01:11.060> we<00:01:11.840> will<00:01:12.020> loosen<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.500> griddle<00:01:12.860> with<00:01:13.070> a

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
cooled we will loosen the griddle with a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.859 
cooled we will loosen the griddle with a
long<00:01:13.400> metal<00:01:13.760> spatula

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869

look<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.679> all<00:01:16.799> those<00:01:16.979> peanuts<00:01:19.759> now<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:20.820> have

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
look at all those peanuts now we have

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.959 
look at all those peanuts now we have
those<00:01:21.210> meat<00:01:21.450> or<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.659> long<00:01:21.929> spatula<00:01:22.969> otherwise

those meat or the long spatula otherwise

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.590 
those meat or the long spatula otherwise
it<00:01:24.210> will<00:01:24.299> stick<00:01:24.569> to<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.780> table<00:01:26.179> we<00:01:27.179> then<00:01:27.359> cut

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
it will stick to the table we then cut

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.169 
it will stick to the table we then cut
it<00:01:27.719> into<00:01:27.840> three<00:01:28.289> pieces<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.069> flip<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.880> over

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
it into three pieces and flip it over

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.449 
it into three pieces and flip it over
onto<00:01:30.569> the<00:01:30.840> stainless<00:01:31.380> steel<00:01:31.649> counter<00:01:32.219> for<00:01:32.429> the

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:32.459 
onto the stainless steel counter for the

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.690 
onto the stainless steel counter for the
final<00:01:32.939> stretch<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.709> the<00:01:34.860> last<00:01:35.069> step<00:01:35.399> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
final stretch this is the last step you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.850 
final stretch this is the last step you
stretch<00:01:36.209> the<00:01:36.420> pintle<00:01:36.959> out<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.530> it's<00:01:37.619> nice

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
stretch the pintle out so that it's nice

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.639 
stretch the pintle out so that it's nice
and<00:01:38.189> thin<00:01:38.459> we<00:01:39.209> have<00:01:39.420> about<00:01:39.659> five<00:01:39.990> minutes<00:01:40.259> to

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
and thin we have about five minutes to

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.709 
and thin we have about five minutes to
do<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.920> stretching<00:01:41.520> before<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.329> gets<00:01:42.479> too

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
do the stretching before it gets too

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.539 
do the stretching before it gets too
difficult<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.409> stretch<00:01:43.709> so<00:01:44.039> it's<00:01:44.189> really<00:01:44.369> not

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
difficult to stretch so it's really not

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.690 
difficult to stretch so it's really not
a<00:01:44.609> panic<00:01:45.090> situation<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.890> secret<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
a panic situation the secret to the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
a panic situation the secret to the
stretching<00:01:48.179> is<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.599> the<00:01:48.720> edges<00:01:49.140> first<00:01:49.409> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
stretching is to do the edges first and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.710 
stretching is to do the edges first and
save<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.159> center<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:50.939> last<00:01:51.119> because<00:01:51.599> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
save the center for last because the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.709 
save the center for last because the
center<00:01:52.079> will<00:01:52.229> stay<00:01:52.530> hot<00:01:52.739> longer

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
center will stay hot longer

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:56.089 
center will stay hot longer

00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:56.099 
sometimes this counter just presses in
