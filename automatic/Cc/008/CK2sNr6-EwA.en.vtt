a pro a rudder runs through a trunk it
has<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:31.030> very<00:02:32.030> simple<00:02:33.459> scheme<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:34.730> keep<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.030> from

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
has a very simple scheme to keep it from

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.789 
has a very simple scheme to keep it from
sliding<00:02:35.690> up<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.049> down<00:02:36.140> when<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.470> don't<00:02:36.590> want

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
sliding up and down when you don't want

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.500 
sliding up and down when you don't want
it<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.489> just<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.820> bungee<00:02:38.239> cord

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
it to and that is just this bungee cord

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.140 
it to and that is just this bungee cord
that<00:02:39.350> runs<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.280> end<00:02:40.430> just<00:02:40.579> like<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:40.880> laser

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
that runs to the end just like a laser

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.440 
that runs to the end just like a laser
dagger<00:02:41.540> board<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.160> kind<00:02:43.820> of<00:02:43.880> cams<00:02:44.180> it

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
dagger board so that kind of cams it

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.349 
dagger board so that kind of cams it
into<00:02:44.750> its<00:02:44.930> slot<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.280> only<00:02:46.880> moves<00:02:47.180> when

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
into its slot so that it only moves when

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.990 
into its slot so that it only moves when
I<00:02:47.390> want<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.930> play<00:02:48.739> live<00:02:48.980> pick<00:02:49.430> up<00:02:49.579> them<00:02:49.760> down

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
I want it to play live pick up them down

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.990 
I want it to play live pick up them down
and<00:02:50.269> it<00:02:50.390> moves<00:02:50.780> very<00:02:50.959> easily<00:02:51.519> there<00:02:52.519> is<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.670> hold

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
and it moves very easily there is a hold

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.620 
and it moves very easily there is a hold
down<00:02:53.209> tackle<00:02:54.519> right<00:02:55.519> here<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:58.420> that's<00:02:59.420> what

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
down tackle right here so that's what

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.599 
down tackle right here so that's what
holds<00:02:59.840> it<00:02:59.930> down<00:02:59.959> just<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.739> simple<00:03:01.070> jam<00:03:01.310> cleat
