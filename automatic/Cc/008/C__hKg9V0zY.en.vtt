00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720

it's<00:00:53.160> pretty<00:00:53.309> much<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:53.789> would<00:00:54.149> sit<00:00:54.360> one

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
it's pretty much like would sit one

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.910 
it's pretty much like would sit one
portion<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.110> then<00:00:55.230> everybody<00:00:55.590> else<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
portion and then everybody else with a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.740 
portion and then everybody else with a
different<00:00:56.250> skin<00:00:56.309> color<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.940> would<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.239> say<00:00:57.449> so

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
different skin color it would not say so

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.479 
different skin color it would not say so
it<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.440> proves<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.070> get<00:00:59.190> your<00:00:59.250> box

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
it just proves that if you get your box

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.040 
it just proves that if you get your box
every<00:00:59.789> month<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.300> will<00:01:00.539> literally<00:01:00.899> love

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
every month you will literally love

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.540 
every month you will literally love
everything<00:01:01.590> because<00:01:01.890> they're<00:01:02.010> basically<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
everything because they're basically the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.950 
everything because they're basically the
products<00:01:02.940> you've<00:01:03.120> chosen<00:01:03.359> yourself<00:01:03.539> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
products you've chosen yourself and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.990 
products you've chosen yourself and
usually<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> Box<00:01:04.559> cost<00:01:04.860> tampons<00:01:05.460> each<00:01:05.700> month

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
usually the Box cost tampons each month

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.310 
usually the Box cost tampons each month
but<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.210> actually<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> discount<00:01:07.080> code

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
but I actually have a discount code

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.570 
but I actually have a discount code
which<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.650> will<00:01:07.770> leave<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> screen<00:01:08.430> right

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
which I will leave on the screen right

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.920 
which I will leave on the screen right
here<00:01:08.790> which<00:01:09.000> means<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.330> get<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> box<00:01:09.750> for

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
here which means you get the box for

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.570 
here which means you get the box for
five<00:01:10.140> points<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.799> discount<00:01:11.130> code<00:01:11.340> it's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
five points so the discount code it's

five points so the discount code it's
Chloe<00:01:11.850> 50<00:01:12.299> which<00:01:12.420> means<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.780> get<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.080> Box

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.330 
each month for five pounds which is so
good<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.720> con<00:01:15.930> code<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.409> Chloe<00:01:16.740> 50<00:01:17.189> which
