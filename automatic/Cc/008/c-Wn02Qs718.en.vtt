00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.449
 Hi everyone, we are here today to present 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.199
 the rules of the new tournament of 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:18.359
 peaceful mont st youtube and tariff a3 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.910
 I wanted to say royal with an accent 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.279
 Japanese the base will be structured on 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.169
 normal periicious regulation of smog that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.939
 will be explained in detail and 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.289
 in detail from the others 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.929
 participants 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.350
 to you the word my dear thanks a lot 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.570
 alfred for your intro here is for you 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.820
 samir along with all other members 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.309
 of the battle royale except scatter does 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.780
 which unfortunately could not join the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.460
 explanation of the rules then the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.059
 let us make a warm greeting 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.649
 so let's go and dive headlong 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.019
 within the regulation here for us 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.500
 tell me that he goes to explain us all 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.960
 details 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.089
 then as alfred il has already said 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.109
 regulation is mainly based on 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.449
 smog rules on 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.629
 and now let's go over them before 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.810
 all the evasion cloud or the rule 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.740
 which provides for the non possibility of 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.659
 use moves such as a double team 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.530
 minimized and also server skills 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.380
 which I think is sand veil and snow clock 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.149
 which I think is snow lover so these 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.600
 skills and these moves are not allowed 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.869
 in the game 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.180
 then we have lamu of close or the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.670
 clause prohibiting the use of pokemon 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.890
 with skill swing then I set myself 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.469
 killer baby bottles etcetera 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.200
 then we have the famous one hit that 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.810
 you close or the rule that prevents 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.899
 pokemon to have the moves you now have 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.200
 I will say abyss guillotine for pur 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.759
 pure frost frost horn was not there as well as well 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.979
 frost in museums 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.229
 therefore it is not possible to use these 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.509
 moves then there is the sleep claude this 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.180
 I think the other let everyone that 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.119
 rule that prevents a player from 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.700
 put to sleep more than a pokémon 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.649
 opponent at a time during the game e 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.659
 pokemon are not considered that 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.910
 use a rest 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.110
 finally there is the huber klaus or the 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.120
 rule that prevents you from using 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.040
 pokémon planned in the fyr hoover 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.420
 thanks to her this was the base let's say 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.010
 to make it more fun 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.349
 original however we decided to 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.290
 introduce some of our restrictions and 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.209
 bon for example we have introduced the item 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.739
 closer unofficial smog rule 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.230
 also however it will allow to avoid 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.280
 boring struggles of 6 leftovers or any 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.500
 other similar thing 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.840
 then taking the list into consideration 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.760
 of the former age of March we are working from 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.829
 quite a lot in this project and then 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.659
 we have a little old but a list 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.640
 end does not change anything because anyway 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.920
 we decided to dance the top 20 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.930
 of the sig and then remove the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.940
 possibility of using pokémon like 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.459
 aegis the shoulder a flame and the rota 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.739
 mouche that in the end were in top a 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.780
 March and still are still also always 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.640
 based on that list we decided 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.010
 to allow a maximum of the two overuses 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.569
 This will result in the team and beats 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.269
 limbs having to use as remaining 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:07.209
 four pokémon under used team slots 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.430
 the early usl and never used as we said 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.500
 first the list is a bit old not 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.239
 worry if you see chancy land use 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.430
 the galvan turnover josé because a 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.319
 February precisely the respective pokémon 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.780
 they were in different pierre like you have 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.090
 both tongues and he felt he joined us 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.030
 dark devil and then let's see 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.560
 specifically some of the details 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.169
 on the battle royale 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.480
 how you can follow the tournament then 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:34.389
 all the various struggles will not come 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.430
 published on all six channels but for 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.139
 follow our event in the best possible way 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.750
 should be enrolled at all six 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:43.930
 channels because why the struggles between the 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.849
 competitor up at random the competitor b 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.639
 will be published and then 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.160
 subsequently by the competitor c for 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.859
 give an example of the first struggle in the 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.049
 against daredevil will be published on 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.120
 jam channel prizes example at random 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.010
 just to make you understand then if you 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.680
 you are registered on all six channels 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.299
 you can follow all the struggles 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.220
 be careful because not all of them 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.669
 fights will be published in fact 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.069
 the first six fights will be published 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:14.980
 following this method the following 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.919
 then struggles from the semifinal about in 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.150
 then we will go to see the struggles on all and 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.430
 six channels published by all 6 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.470
 youtube and individually commented by 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.290
 everyone therefore if your commentator 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.040
 favorite is toms alfred camboni sanders 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.720
 oscar 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.910
 you can follow your youtuber 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.800
 favorite and see the same match 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.110
 rather on all six channels 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.180
 in short, as we prefer while 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.550
 regarding the final surprise 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.930
 you still don't know anything about it 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.509
 concerns the final that will be precisely 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.639
 the apex event of our tournament 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:50.130
 then davey will explain something to us 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.960
 more on the bracket structure for 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.789
 better follow the whole you will find the 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.800
 tournament board an indiscretion e 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.930
 you will also notice that it will not make a return to 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.760
 single elimination but rather for power 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.729
 be officially eliminated every 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.470
 player will have to lose 2 fights this 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.419
 it will therefore be a double tournament 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.669
 elimination also hangs up at the 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.530
 speech that made samir where 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.190
 we will publish more lots in fact 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:17.099
 so as to seem strange the fact that 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.889
 extremely loaded with more than four lots 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:22.639
 each because there is also this double 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.810
 elimination 4 the head means that 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.139
 everyone will upload his version 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.599
 according to his point of view and nothing 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.430
 ok then we explained everything 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:35.430
 concerning the regulation it seems to me that 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.620
 there is nothing else to say there is only 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.090
 to host this was the video 0 in the 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.590
 battle royale and with all the regulations 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.590
 and then to the next
