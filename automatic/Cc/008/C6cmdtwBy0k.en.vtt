00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.140
 do not 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.529
 Well, here it has already happened like 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:24.230
 10 minutes and this has kept us 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:27.570
 enough let's add the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:32.240
 vegetable the peas 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.240
 and the bean 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.650
 remember that this peas and snap bean 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.390
 they have been previously cooked 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.260
 how do you think it is going 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.920
 leaving this delicious true that if 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.870
 is very rich let's try a 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.610
 taste to see how it is jumping 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.120
 because even though we have not added 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.480
 Salt 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.150
 but remember that the concentrated broth 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.839
 it brings so much we must look to see what 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.839
 so much missing 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.630
 We are going to put ethical salt and 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.630
 Pepper 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:40.660
 while at this time when already 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:45.690
 we have it like that we are going to place the broth 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.690
 in which we have cooked peace 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:54.650
 not without first writing down 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:57.200
 that the leg is hard, very hard 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.090
 that is the one we had in today under pressure more or 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.090
 less for 40 minutes 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.429
 the point to know when it is already 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.730
 turn in or the straw is when she 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.150
 alone as it is not clear 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.520
 bone that does not cost us good work 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.670
 here we have this and the last thing 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.840
 we are going to place on the leg that we 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.400
 we have bitten it 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.300
 well in pieces of this also then 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.470
 let's put it 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.950
 I had pieces like this for example 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.230
 let them leave the little bone in order to 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.810
 which is that there are people that we 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.090
 love to see those little eggs 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.550
 of some 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:55.100
 from cgt to point successes 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:03:00.120
 this is already what we have left to do 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.820
 raise the fire return to leave others 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.150
 five minutes for this to keep us 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:12.620
 I've seen how is this for chicken nando 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:15.130
 delicious our potato stew with 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.920
 vegetables and chickpeas 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.920
 we are going to pay and we are going to do well 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:36.160
 or that they endow and lick their fingers or 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:40.349
 say that this is time to eat with tea 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.260
 it's good today, nothing more 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:48.010
 tell them that any concern is not 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.299
