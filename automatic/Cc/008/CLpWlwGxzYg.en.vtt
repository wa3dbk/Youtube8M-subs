exceeds the difficulty of the card it
was<00:03:51.030> successful<00:03:51.720> so<00:03:52.379> in<00:03:52.500> this<00:03:52.620> case<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.129> have

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
was successful so in this case I have

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.369 
was successful so in this case I have
control<00:03:53.730> check<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.030> 6<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:55.260> was<00:03:55.349> a

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
control check to 6 and it was a

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:56.960 
control check to 6 and it was a
difficulty<00:03:55.830> of<00:03:55.860> 3<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:56.489> passes<00:03:56.700> by<00:03:56.940> a

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
difficulty of 3 so it passes by a

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
progressive difficulty yep just like in

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.650 
progressive difficulty yep just like in
a<00:04:08.129> real<00:04:08.340> fight<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.940> more<00:04:09.120> moves<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.510> make

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
a real fight the more moves you make

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.330 
a real fight the more moves you make
some<00:04:09.810> more<00:04:09.930> tired<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.440> get<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.920> it<00:04:11.069> becomes

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
some more tired you get and it becomes

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.520

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
harder to make your next move so for

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.720 
harder to make your next move so for
every<00:04:13.769> card<00:04:13.980> for<00:04:14.160> sitting<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.459> one<00:04:14.610> I<00:04:14.640> just

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
every card for sitting the one I just

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.750 
every card for sitting the one I just
played<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:15.599> must<00:04:16.049> add<00:04:16.200> +1<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.130> difficulty

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
played and must add +1 to the difficulty

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.840 
played and must add +1 to the difficulty
so<00:04:18.299> now<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.510> 3<00:04:18.870> becomes<00:04:19.229> a<00:04:19.380> 4<00:04:19.940> on<00:04:20.940> 4<00:04:21.150> it<00:04:21.720> passes

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
so now the 3 becomes a 4 on 4 it passes

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.190 
so now the 3 becomes a 4 on 4 it passes
