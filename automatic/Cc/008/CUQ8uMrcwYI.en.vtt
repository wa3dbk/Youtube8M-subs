00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.120
 hello my team but in french a video 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.000
 comment if the game need for speed most 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.830
 wanted running here on iphone 5 is that 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.199
 game that is paid time is available 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.270
 also there on android this is one of the games 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.189
 that I really missed having the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.869
 windows phone and luckily here now 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.400
 with the iphone may be playing it 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.130
 is playing with the touch on the screen with 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.779
 this level the steering wheel here but it is not the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.699
 The way I normally play I 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.800
 I usually play with the motion sensor 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.120
 I think it's much better to play in that 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.770
 game has these two options for you 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.390
 play with this little cue ball 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.550
 here or with a motion sensor that 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.890
 works great and is a gameplay 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.350
 very fluent I really liked the reality 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.200
 of the game and managed to adapt well only 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.239
 if you prefer to play here with controls 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.460
 on the screen it only offers this option here 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.320
 which is not at all comfortable using a 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.730
 video really does not disturb the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.860
 vision for you guys will keep stirring 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.350
 I would lose focus here 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.210
 camera on video 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.640
 this game does not have to speak ill of him is 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.680
 very good very good even the best 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.140
 graphics have already seen a game to 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.150
 smartphone tablet is a maybe the best 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.040
 racing game with garden smartphone 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.390
 team together with the sources 80 of 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.670
 best racing games I played 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.680
 smartphone game soundtrack 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.600
 dude it's the best I 've seen until today is 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.850
 very well chosen songs as already 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.140
 Happens on Perfect Console Teeth 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.479
 also we always have songs 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.030
 very good and this one also has a 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.549
 good music after another in quality 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.229
 of graphics is almost console level is 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.990
 very good even in cars 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.420
 of the scenery but this is priceless 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.890
 the game is not so cheap it costs less 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.470
 $ 45 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.350
 but the more the price you have to pay 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.500
 is your storage and occupy and 1.8 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.899
 gigabytes installed here in the west 8.3 is 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.149
 plenty of room for a person who has the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.329
 to tell if a 16 gigabyte smartphone 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.700
 as I here is not with 5 s is 16 giga 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.340
 man this is a lot of space we have there 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.619
 free when bought iphone 12 tips 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.380
 to use is already used in good part 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.969
 only with this game here but if 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.770
 You are a very racing game. 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.800
 likes sports bid is one thing that 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.940
 it's worth you're spending space 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.290
 Let's choose another race that you 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.890
 you can see that you have a map that 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.780
 racing 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.900
 has many events or practically 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.400
 finishing the game is only the last 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.780
 It shows an antenna that would be there to the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.620
 list of the most wanted we have 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.170
 here on the side 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.790
 only he looks loose in seconds and I 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.590
 I do not know if I'll finish the last one there. 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.970
 because I'm intending to uninstall 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.520
 the game because I need it easier 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.290
 on the device but if you did not need 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.060
 easier to maintain this game with 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.420
 installed sure but he played very 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.920
 It's already time and hours in it. It's very show. 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.760
 it's worth picking another race here 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.310
 to play 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.450
 one thing I 've already done back in 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.060
 factory 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.489
 Let's pick up the car here, look at this one. 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.230
 let's go then mercedes benz 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.300
 We can customize only the color of the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.260
 vehicle and put some donkeys too. 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.390
 You know you can choose some 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.010
 improvements there that serve 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.330
 only for the gameplay as per 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.310
 example you become more resistant to 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.620
 some thorns that the police put on the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.019
 track you get faster gets a 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.790
 little more speed and acceleration and has 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.430
 police as they were able to repair before 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.230
 He has police and it's very showy. 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.269
 police persecution in most of 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.310
 Time the police are half stupid, she's going 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.200
 try to attack all button cost in 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.600
 course without any strategy much more 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.440
 elaborate and she will always focus on you 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.230
 sometimes and will look at others 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.940
 there are good runners and the police only 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.120
 over you wanting to destroy your 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.530
 vehicle but now more towards the end of the game 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.400
 but training him has some things that 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.610
 yes the police detonated the others 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.590
 opponents 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.750
 so have a certain time when the 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.340
 police is a little more sensible you 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.040
 can see that the download of the game is very 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.750
 and you think it 's one of the points 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.390
 negative of it that I think could 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.310
 talking to you is or typing the iphone 5 s is 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.860
 a great smartphone as you know 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.450
 runs the most diverse games very games 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.970
 heavy and always clear too 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.519
 well I had no problem with a 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.220
 trading the minimum leg nothing knows the game 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.870
 It turned smooth but it takes quite a while to 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.700
 load several times it gets a 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.630
 little faster defending the phase and 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.480
 now that you are seeing here 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.430
 celebrating a lot and this happens 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.989
 sometimes this game is one of those 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.450
 games that worth you use headset 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.100
 Listen, I sometimes do not like it very much. 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.289
 well be wearing a headphone thinks 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.209
 uncomfortable but this game here dude 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.520
 deserves most of the time I played 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.260
 He was going to pick up a phone and stay there. 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.130
 listening to the songs and tals is very 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.200
 time of the long time 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.820
 heart you hear the soundtrack of that 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.050
 game here and the sound effects too 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.720
 they are very good 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.230
 There the car engine the beats is everything 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.630
 very well treated ball show 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.460
 here the game environment lets you download 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.440
 volume you here because it will handle one 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.210
 copyright because of these songs have 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.310
 well- known music even has music 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.420
 here the writer who knows the music 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.400
 electronics 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.170
 so there are several others now also 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.090
 I remember some to mention but it has 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.780
 enough music you must recognize 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.950
 As they were coming 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.870
 Look at the police and the police. 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.010
 police barrier also has some 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.840
 police with the car a little more 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.120
 strong some change is that they will try 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.680
 Had not eliminated the race you can 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.750
 eliminate others also beating 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.820
 enough on it you can lose running 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.470
 if you hit too hard your vehicle has 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.240
 there is a certain limit that he can 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.710
 damage as you hit a lot 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.160
 a bar of damage appears on the screen 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.600
 for you also have several types of 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.460
 race also has some against the 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.200
 time there are some who have to go through 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.030
 a certain speed radar is fine 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.160
 varied the races you have in the game 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.530
 for this game it's worth buying it 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.330
 Render hours of gameplay just for you. 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.070
 finish the normal campaign know he has 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.530
 a business in that most generating cars 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.910
 vans weekly have the car of the week 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.310
 in the sport-pe that developers 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.750
 customize car and put it there for you 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.180
 buy usually they are carts 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.190
 half carlos but they are only cars then 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.110
 the game always has new content because it is 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.910
 some cars there customized by 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.500
 developers 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.930
 the races are very fast like you 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.490
 can see does not last long what is 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.570
 appropriate since this is playing a 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.510
 smartphone you do not want to compromise 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.160
 as long as the game as well galley 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.510
 I'm going to show you here what? 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.550
 I had to talk to him if we were to 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.380
 ask it is very good, I recommend you 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.350
 buy it it is not so cheap but 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.910
 It is very worth to 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.770
