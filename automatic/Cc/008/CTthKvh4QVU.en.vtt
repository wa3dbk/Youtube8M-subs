00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:05.230
 the on 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.040
 the 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.919
 had been healthy she plays the two to five players 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.919
 and was designed by leo koole fini i could listen 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.750
 it has been issued in the netherlands by to my games carcassonne overseas 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.529
 major similarities with the well-known carcassonne game 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.539
 however, it is not your own opinion but a game to be played independently in the box 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.120
 has an overview card for each player and five wooden figures 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.600
 the tiles are shuffled and laid face down 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.950
 on the tiles of three types of landscapes 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.950
 with them and sydney 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.420
 if you put it down, you can put a figure here 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.430
 taking back a figure nine points 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.520
 number of points depends on the type of landscape 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.390
 on the landscape 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.030
 and more than two also exist on time 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.480
 explained in September on the overview map 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.350
 the city is put down and for each player the fire gets on the score 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.490
 sport placed 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.970
 ger 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.280
 to play against in his third match 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.200
 and apply it appropriately 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.020
 The player can choose whether he plays figure on the correctly placed leg 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.020
 or values ​​already placed figures 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.050
 placing bread figure on the mountain 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.030
 now it's green 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.119
 he places a tile and places a figure on the land 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.400
 many put his figure in the sea 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.620
 every 1st have been rounded many do not yet appreciate this figure 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.060
 that must be done in the next turn 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.060
 suddenly figure placed on the land 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.540
 he makes a number of green 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.990
 and instead of putting down a permit, he opts for his earlier 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.070
 placed figure 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.210
 he takes the figure back to stock and counts his points 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.740
 because the land is completed he receives two points stamp 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.430
 he puts his figure on the scores for ach places ahead 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.840
 it is not allowed to place the affected area on which of the figures 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.249
 is present 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:13.699
 it is possible that two areas grow together in the course of the game 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.369
 filed as dorothy and against with a delegation 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:20.549
 separately yellow or red figure ended up in the same mountain range 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:25.049
 but really other against down by the stand is to remain separate 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.709
 but also two kids to the previously placed figure on the land he 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.549
 receives only one point against this 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.709
 the cities on the land do not play an additional role against us 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.609
 the game continues 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.560
 unlike carcassonne which their rating did not look at 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:43.209
 the majority in the area 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.110
 learned a lot from own cultivation 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.110
 gets the same number of points 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.029
 ger 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.879
 gillet this is one consisting of two tiles 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.209
 he receives a point for each other on the street 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.629
 in this case two points 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.119
 red white has a rounded mountain range 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.959
 Because the mountain goat has more than two tiles, it receives two points per 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.379
 city ​​in the mountains and two points per city in an adjacent building 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.069
 in this case between 8 points 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.480
 vroemen times are rounded and soap consist of more than two tiles 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.339
 the sea also counts 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:25.649
 he receives a point picks up at a point when she steps 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.229
 that makes seven points together 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.229
 five for the water and two for the stitches 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:35.899
 This is another abyss country that is picking up two points that makes up together 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:38.899
 with six points of yellow 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:43.089
 this is a bar of soap that has not been completed 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:46.979
 that yields one point per port city, in this case two points 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.709
 then a rounded mountain for four points 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.759
 as long as it is possible to place extra in the neighboring country 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:57.569
 gradually earn more points 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.610
 even if the mountains were completed, we will add more points 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.229
 if they are installed in those cities in the country 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:06.229
 land rover sea will never be worth points again 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.139
 then red shirts counts for the completed work 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.319
 this yields a point on as that both in the mountains and in the neighboring country 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:27.279
 the mullet 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:31.710
 Pine tree 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.389
 on 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:33.659
 the
