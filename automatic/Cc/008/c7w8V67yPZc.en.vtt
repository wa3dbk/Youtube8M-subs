00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.319
 there are very good youtube here I am and 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.469
 commenting and I bring you as you see the 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.809
 title knockout against 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.260
 rebels you look for tri on appointment was not yet the 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.400
 second map another day is in the first 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.500
 because I wanted to vary a little bit because 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.230
 I would seek to destroy and vicens the map of 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.119
 if it's still I'm playing in the air and 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.759
 I'm going to use a position that more than 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.519
 nothing is to cover that added up 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.060
 difficult to attack then let's go 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.159
 slowly 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.570
 You see that I'm not going so far as a 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.100
 public because obviously this is not 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.230
 a public one, not the rivals are mancos 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.270
 like some of the public ones then 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.370
 you have to be very careful 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.449
 I knew there was one there because my 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.640
 good fellow had told me 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.100
 then he was very very attentive to see and 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.570
 there chance just comes out and I get between 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.560
 we have a vignette so good what 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.330
 we killed 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.830
 we thought that this we did quite 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.160
 well you see is the first round won 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.070
 I think it's river in the back and there 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.570
 I had strained by see and well let's go 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.820
 varying the from time to time we go to 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.340
 I sack every now and then we wait I do not know 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.800
 depends how the challenge goes, not first 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.880
 place you see that we have been two good and 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.250
 I have been watching the part of 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.510
 the left then I was I think it was 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.820
 the thymus looking at the middle part 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.350
 helping right a little bit as we 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.460
 me and then I tell you then help the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.430
 back I saw that I position myself in the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.869
 boxes that I told you in the map guide and 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.790
 the part of the medium is controlled very well 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.130
 I could not around here I will not let it pass 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.290
 nobody sees that he has again sneaked 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.720
 drew that tail from his back the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.970
 time is on my right waiting for 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.790
 we turn around there kill ryu ken 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.830
 is good there and there is only one not 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.650
 I live from them I have to concentrate 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.180
 in giving for this area only and so will 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.100
 be in all rounds that are worth 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.460
 there you see that it kills bonus that remains 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.670
 and good mean while you see the 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.659
 gameplay tell you about the sponsorship that 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.100
 we have that that's why you see that actually 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.110
 we do not call ourselves jaime let's go to ideas high 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.600
 because we are in a club that we 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.979
 sponsor you have the link in the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.200
 description is valid when you want it 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.569
 visit the page and that and nothing 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.980
 Well, hey, it 's a pretty good sponsorship 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.510
 because since he pays us the inscriptions 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.380
 and such is not less than a reference 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.230
 not here 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.989
 and not without more 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.900
 good in reference to this to this 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.650
 party not the challenge of searching in general 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.400
 in reference this game because we won 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:35.599
 3-0 this search we won 1 4 1 and was 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.980
 the challenge quite was not so so victory 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.440
 overwhelming as in the first ones that 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.299
 we played against the forums is that I uploaded the 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.220
 another day was a little more tight 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.799
 the search theme we are pretty good 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.409
 so we do not usually suffer much in 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.549
 look for us because we arrived as 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.739
 know and we play search and 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.299
 destroy end then more or less 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.890
 the positions resembles is not the same 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.870
 same but the positions resemble 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.459
 quite not then well you see it one 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.239
 against one of river that leaves you very much 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.120
 it does not kill it and well there it is going to go I think that 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.500
 It was I hope I'm wrong 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.580
 good yes there is 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.150
 Well, we go to 30 and decided 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.650
 apart from the ones playing with their 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.480
 I will do then not this afternoon at a 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.430
 Five o'clock I've already told you that you're 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.690
 on my twitter and it came from the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.830
 five still inviting us to put the 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.480
 lower house from five 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.130
 still do not put it on me because it's the same 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.020
 they lose me with the mentions because every 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.120
 time someone has twitter and gives me 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.459
 I like the video because a lot of 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.630
 mentions of likes and favorites and such 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.940
 then I still have some 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.890
 then to be fixed fixed that is imite 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.840
 the first 17 may 18 in the private 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.720
 I will invite you the ones that make me another 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.489
 mark then you have to walk a 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.040
 poquillo to the parrot because you will be 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.430
 inviting voucher I plan to play by 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.560
 example as I told you a 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.170
 an infectologist we join some infected 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.510
 some sniper game we can 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.870
 make a duel for a duel against all 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.450
 with 99 as a warm up not 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.120
 for the acdp 99 trail so you can see 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.569
 which is the gun shit that is axis and 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.280
 do not look at yourself now it 's double that 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.389
 I almost make myself triple if I 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.829
 I say to see that it was coming for me 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:18.109
 I also carried it to the left but I did not 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.910
 is going to kill me from the back so good 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.910
 only round of the map that we lost 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.340
 what is saying I also have 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.990
 thought to make for example a knife 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.250
 a knife particle what I said 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.470
 sniper other 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.639
 efe CTAs because I do not know if you stop me from doing 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.130
 the private but I think we can also 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.840
 make a weapon game some map then 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.270
 also of maps especially we will play in 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.800
 dominated that it moves small and fast and 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.270
 I will be playing as a shore hour and 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.130
 peak because then I have to warm up 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.570
 for the tournament and I have to study 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.610
 also so I'll be playing a 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.900
 Shore shore and peak is worth I think 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.639
 quite the same arrived at 2 hours and 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.260
 all without the reason 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.169
 so good I'll be waiting here 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.280
 I leave with the last round of the search for 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.540
 story that you see that I'm more attentive 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.569
 now for that area since it has not gone up 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.369
 before 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.409
 and again as they kill the river by 

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:06.240
 right we're all three here looking 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.099
 so that we do not sneak in this part 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.419
 I'm going to look at that area a bit so that 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.639
 do not strain through us and time 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.379
 I was looking to the back in case 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.619
 maybe you see that it goes up 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.619
 I charge it 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.400
 and good to say that the 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.340
 matches of the open cup 2 we 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.440
 play at 10 o'clock at night against 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.230
 those about the clan that we lost the other 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.060
 day in the lucenses bracket this time 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.980
 we're the headline roster so that's what 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.330
 we're going to make it a lot harder because 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.760
 very defensive that we play that is what 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.860
 we are going to put very very difficult and I think 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.050
 what are we going to do if we play well like this 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.460
 Good thing they do not do streaming 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.960
 streaming and other games of course 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.030
 more interesting to see how far 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.680
 we arrived not because I think that if we passed 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.720
 against this we would touch elite command and 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.890
 command elites are very players 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.290
 very good 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.969
 then I guess we will pass it with 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:59.239
 command though you can try hey 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:03.079
 - we gave a stone 

00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:04.789
 so 41 here you see that just the time 

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:07.219
 I had seen him at the same time and we are 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:08.779
 shooting poor thing we had there to 

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:10.369
 way to search that so good I hope 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:13.369
 that you liked gameplay that is not 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:15.849
 Vote like favorites and subscribe 

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:15.849
