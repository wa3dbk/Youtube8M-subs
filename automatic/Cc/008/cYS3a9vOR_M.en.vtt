has been a learning curve I have to be

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.550 
has been a learning curve I have to be
honest<00:00:29.000> but<00:00:29.330> all<00:00:29.509> in<00:00:29.689> all<00:00:29.779> I<00:00:29.839> couldn't<00:00:30.169> be<00:00:30.349> more

honest but all in all I couldn't be more
pleased<00:00:30.919> I<00:00:31.249> think<00:00:32.060> that<00:00:32.210> one<00:00:32.360> of<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:32.480> biggest

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
pleased I think that one of the biggest

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.130 
pleased I think that one of the biggest
issues<00:00:33.380> in<00:00:34.070> choosing<00:00:34.399> this<00:00:34.820> was<00:00:35.450> to<00:00:35.809> really

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
issues in choosing this was to really

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.410 
issues in choosing this was to really
figure<00:00:36.320> out<00:00:36.590> for<00:00:36.920> me<00:00:37.129> if<00:00:37.640> I<00:00:37.850> could<00:00:37.910> live<00:00:38.210> with<00:00:38.390> a

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
figure out for me if I could live with a

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.560 
figure out for me if I could live with a
13-inch<00:00:38.960> screen<00:00:39.200> size<00:00:39.800> as<00:00:40.730> I've<00:00:40.940> gotten<00:00:41.149> older

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
13-inch screen size as I've gotten older

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.569 
13-inch screen size as I've gotten older
I've<00:00:41.719> needed<00:00:41.930> reading<00:00:42.350> glasses<00:00:42.590> and<00:00:43.160> I<00:00:43.460> was

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
I've needed reading glasses and I was

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.459 
I've needed reading glasses and I was
very<00:00:43.760> concerned<00:00:44.239> that<00:00:44.420> that<00:00:45.140> it<00:00:45.260> would<00:00:45.320> just

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
very concerned that that it would just

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.830 
very concerned that that it would just
be<00:00:45.590> too<00:00:45.860> small<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:46.699> 15-inch<00:00:47.149> seemed<00:00:47.600> to<00:00:47.750> be

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
be too small the 15-inch seemed to be

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.979 
be too small the 15-inch seemed to be
about<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.199> ideal<00:00:48.530> size<00:00:48.890> but<00:00:49.760> I<00:00:49.789> know<00:00:50.030> that<00:00:50.960> I

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
about the ideal size but I know that I

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.049 
about the ideal size but I know that I
have<00:00:51.410> a<00:00:51.440> budget<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:52.070> a<00:00:52.370> lot<00:00:52.579> of<00:00:52.609> people<00:00:52.940> out

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
have a budget and a lot of people out

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.970 
have a budget and a lot of people out
there<00:00:53.239> have<00:00:53.359> a<00:00:53.420> budget<00:00:53.840> too<00:00:54.019> and<00:00:54.289> putting

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
there have a budget too and putting

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.150 
there have a budget too and putting
1,300<00:00:55.789> down<00:00:56.000> for<00:00:56.359> a<00:00:56.390> laptop<00:00:56.750> for<00:00:57.320> 13<00:00:57.739> inches

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
1,300 down for a laptop for 13 inches

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.330 
1,300 down for a laptop for 13 inches
was<00:00:58.879> was<00:00:59.480> a<00:00:59.510> pretty<00:00:59.809> tough<00:00:59.989> decision<00:01:00.340> the

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
was was a pretty tough decision the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.459 
was was a pretty tough decision the
13-inch<00:01:01.940> seems<00:01:02.359> small<00:01:02.719> to<00:01:02.899> me<00:01:03.019> when<00:01:03.199> I<00:01:03.230> looked

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
13-inch seems small to me when I looked

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.290 
13-inch seems small to me when I looked
at<00:01:03.620> it<00:01:03.739> in<00:01:03.859> the<00:01:04.040> Apple<00:01:04.370> store<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:05.059> I've<00:01:05.180> been

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
at it in the Apple store and I've been

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.030 
at it in the Apple store and I've been
thinking<00:01:05.449> about<00:01:05.750> this<00:01:06.110> because<00:01:06.799> now<00:01:06.979> that

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
thinking about this because now that

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.380 
thinking about this because now that
I've<00:01:07.220> been<00:01:07.369> using<00:01:07.580> it<00:01:07.820> it's<00:01:07.970> really<00:01:08.210> not<00:01:08.330> that

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
I've been using it it's really not that

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.109 
I've been using it it's really not that
small<00:01:08.840> at<00:01:08.990> all<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.439> I<00:01:10.100> guess<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.490> problem<00:01:10.729> is

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
small at all and I guess the problem is

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.210 
small at all and I guess the problem is
that<00:01:11.540> in<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:11.780> Apple<00:01:12.170> store<00:01:12.439> it's<00:01:12.740> a<00:01:12.890> really

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
that in the Apple store it's a really

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.370 
that in the Apple store it's a really
large<00:01:13.490> environment<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.600> ceilings<00:01:15.049> are<00:01:15.140> very

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
large environment the ceilings are very

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.219 
large environment the ceilings are very
high<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:16.220> tables<00:01:16.640> are<00:01:16.759> very<00:01:17.000> large<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:18.079> when

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
high the tables are very large and when

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.499 
high the tables are very large and when
you<00:01:18.320> put<00:01:18.470> a<00:01:18.500> 13-inch<00:01:19.009> laptop<00:01:19.280> in<00:01:19.939> this<00:01:20.119> space

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
you put a 13-inch laptop in this space

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.630 
you put a 13-inch laptop in this space
it<00:01:21.020> just<00:01:21.259> seems<00:01:21.500> smaller<00:01:21.890> than<00:01:22.130> it<00:01:22.250> really<00:01:22.369> is

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
it just seems smaller than it really is

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.999 
it just seems smaller than it really is
as<00:01:23.509> far<00:01:23.840> as<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.020> functionality<00:01:24.530> of<00:01:24.829> the

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
as far as the functionality of the

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.190 
as far as the functionality of the
programs<00:01:25.520> got<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.390> be<00:01:26.479> honest<00:01:26.810> there's<00:01:26.990> been<00:01:27.170> a

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
programs got to be honest there's been a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.609 
programs got to be honest there's been a
learning<00:01:27.409> curve<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.430> far<00:01:28.670> is<00:01:28.850> pretty<00:01:29.119> good<00:01:29.619> I'm

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
learning curve so far is pretty good I'm

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.260 
learning curve so far is pretty good I'm
not<00:01:30.829> sure<00:01:30.979> if<00:01:31.040> I<00:01:31.130> like<00:01:31.159> Google<00:01:31.700> Chrome<00:01:31.970> or

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
not sure if I like Google Chrome or

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.359 
not sure if I like Google Chrome or
Internet<00:01:32.360> Explorer<00:01:33.140> better<00:01:33.470> but<00:01:34.040> I'm<00:01:34.130> getting

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
Internet Explorer better but I'm getting

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.490 
Internet Explorer better but I'm getting
used<00:01:34.490> to<00:01:34.579> Safari<00:01:35.060> iMovie<00:01:35.810> compared<00:01:36.350> to

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
used to Safari iMovie compared to

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.499 
used to Safari iMovie compared to
Windows<00:01:37.040> Movie<00:01:37.220> Maker<00:01:37.399> it's<00:01:38.060> been<00:01:38.270> tough<00:01:38.479> for

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
Windows Movie Maker it's been tough for

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.120 
Windows Movie Maker it's been tough for
me<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.930> really<00:01:39.079> choose<00:01:39.439> between<00:01:39.649> the<00:01:39.950> two

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
me to really choose between the two

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.859 
me to really choose between the two
because<00:01:40.759> I<00:01:40.820> never<00:01:41.119> really<00:01:41.390> got<00:01:41.509> to<00:01:41.689> use

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
because I never really got to use

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.929 
because I never really got to use
Windows<00:01:42.320> Movie<00:01:42.560> Maker<00:01:42.740> without<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:43.399> crashing
