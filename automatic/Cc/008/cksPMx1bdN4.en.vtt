you're just dropping the note down here

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.849 
you're just dropping the note down here
one<00:01:31.179> thing<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.539> really<00:01:31.960> keep<00:01:32.170> in<00:01:32.289> mind<00:01:32.560> is<00:01:32.799> that

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859 
one thing to really keep in mind is that

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.059 
one thing to really keep in mind is that
your<00:01:33.670> hand<00:01:34.060> has<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.689> stay<00:01:34.929> the<00:01:35.109> same<00:01:35.409> distance

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
your hand has to stay the same distance

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.249 
your hand has to stay the same distance
apart<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.640> whole<00:01:36.819> time<00:01:37.090> so<00:01:37.630> what<00:01:37.929> I<00:01:37.960> would<00:01:38.140> do

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
apart the whole time so what I would do

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.520 
apart the whole time so what I would do
is<00:01:38.409> watch<00:01:38.649> your<00:01:38.859> thumb<00:01:39.219> move<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:41.380> you

is watch your thumb move because you

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.109 
is watch your thumb move because you
know<00:01:41.740> what<00:01:42.009> notes<00:01:42.219> are<00:01:42.399> moving<00:01:42.490> too<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:42.759> just

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
know what notes are moving too and just

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.059 
know what notes are moving too and just
keep<00:01:43.750> practice<00:01:44.380> keeping<00:01:44.649> your<00:01:44.770> hand<00:01:44.950> in<00:01:45.009> the

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
keep practice keeping your hand in the

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.699 
keep practice keeping your hand in the
same<00:01:45.310> distance<00:01:45.729> apart<00:01:45.850> and<00:01:46.270> just<00:01:47.049> trust<00:01:47.439> your

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
remember how we learn here's the octave

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.460

okay<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:42.140> then<00:02:42.440> for<00:02:42.680> turning<00:02:43.069> and<00:02:43.220> returning

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
okay so then for turning and returning

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.540 
okay so then for turning and returning
you're<00:02:44.030> going<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.270> do<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.930> minor<00:02:45.890> seven<00:02:48.550> okay

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550

you're going to do a minor seven okay
and<00:02:49.970> we're<00:02:50.150> going<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.300> go<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.480> C<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:52.060> then

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
and we're going to go to C and then

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.370 
and we're going to go to C and then
inside<00:02:53.569> you're<00:02:53.810> gonna<00:02:53.870> go<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.170> D<00:02:56.319> all<00:02:57.319> right

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380
