00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
design nothing really internally

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.369 
design nothing really internally
different<00:00:14.429> but<00:00:15.150> obviously<00:00:15.750> like<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.020> said

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
different but obviously like I said

different but obviously like I said
externally<00:00:17.220> different<00:00:17.720> alright<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:18.869> let's

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
externally different alright so let's

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.529 
externally different alright so let's
get<00:00:19.230> into<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.740> design<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.640> console<00:00:21.330> as

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
get into the design of this console as

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.080 
get into the design of this console as
you<00:00:22.410> can<00:00:22.529> see<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.980> front<00:00:23.250> here<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.939> is

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
you can see in the front here this is

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.080 
you can see in the front here this is
all<00:00:24.330> touch<00:00:24.570> sensitive<00:00:25.080> buttons<00:00:25.849> the<00:00:26.849> jet

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
all touch sensitive buttons the jet

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.120 
all touch sensitive buttons the jet
button<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.599> power<00:00:27.779> button<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.230> all<00:00:28.500> sensitive

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
button the power button is all sensitive

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.370 
button the power button is all sensitive
touch<00:00:29.580> sensitive<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.330> basically<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.170> doesn't

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
touch sensitive and basically it doesn't

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.470 
touch sensitive and basically it doesn't
have<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> natural<00:00:32.099> physical<00:00:32.309> button<00:00:32.910> all<00:00:33.149> over

have a natural physical button all over

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.170 
have a natural physical button all over
this<00:00:33.630> console<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.399> know<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.940> said

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
this console so you know like I said

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.290 
this console so you know like I said
it's<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.480> completely<00:00:36.899> new<00:00:37.200> design<00:00:38.000> below<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
it's a completely new design below the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.330 
it's a completely new design below the
power<00:00:39.840> button<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.829> see<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.160> there

power button here you can see that there

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.779 
power button here you can see that there
are<00:00:41.370> two<00:00:41.640> USB<00:00:42.000> ports<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.540> convenience<00:00:43.079> of

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
are two USB ports for convenience of

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.240 
are two USB ports for convenience of
plugging<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.090> ipod<00:00:45.469> you<00:00:46.469> know<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.950> listen

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
plugging in the ipod you know to listen

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
to music as you can see there's a lot of

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.760 
to music as you can see there's a lot of
events<00:00:49.739> all<00:00:50.190> over<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.579> console<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.620> this<00:00:52.620> is

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
events all over this console and this is

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.029 
events all over this console and this is
basically<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.430> keep<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:54.690> cold<00:00:55.110> console<00:00:55.710> very

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
basically to keep the cold console very

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.910 
basically to keep the cold console very
very<00:00:56.280> cool<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.850> apparently<00:00:57.809> from<00:00:58.440> Microsoft

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
very cool and apparently from Microsoft

than the previous 360s and trust me I've

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.149 
than the previous 360s and trust me I've
actually<00:01:05.640> held<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.780> after<00:01:07.530> running<00:01:07.770> for

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
actually held this up after running for

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.460 
actually held this up after running for
a<00:01:08.189> few<00:01:08.460> hours<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.299> not<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:10.110> hot

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
i'm pretty sure that there's going to be

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.310 
i'm pretty sure that there's going to be
a<00:02:47.850> two-hundred-dollar<00:02:48.450> version<00:02:48.840> that's

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
a two-hundred-dollar version that's

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.050 
a two-hundred-dollar version that's
we're<00:02:49.530> gonna<00:02:50.010> replace<00:02:50.310> our<00:02:50.520> arcade<00:02:50.850> with

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
we're gonna replace our arcade with

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.990 
we're gonna replace our arcade with
probably<00:02:51.840> no<00:02:51.870> hard<00:02:52.230> drive<00:02:52.380> or<00:02:52.500> less<00:02:52.850> space<00:02:53.850> on

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
probably no hard drive or less space on

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.380 
probably no hard drive or less space on
it<00:02:54.180> but<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.709> know<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:56.130> has<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> very<00:02:56.880> very

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
it but you know it has a very very

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.710 
it but you know it has a very very
different<00:02:57.630> hard<00:02:58.200> drive<00:02:59.300> it's<00:03:00.300> completely

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
different hard drive it's completely

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.420 
different hard drive it's completely
different<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.290> can't<00:03:01.620> really<00:03:01.709> take<00:03:02.250> this

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
different so you can't really take this

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.110 
different so you can't really take this
around<00:03:02.820> unless<00:03:03.800> your<00:03:04.800> friend<00:03:04.980> also<00:03:05.400> has<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.880> new

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
around unless your friend also has a new

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.720 
around unless your friend also has a new
33<00:03:07.050> 67<00:03:07.650> then<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:07.860> can<00:03:07.980> probably<00:03:08.190> replace<00:03:08.580> the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
33 67 then you can probably replace the

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.630 
33 67 then you can probably replace the
hard<00:03:08.880> drive<00:03:09.000> play<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.019> off<00:03:10.110> of<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.410> but<00:03:11.070> you
