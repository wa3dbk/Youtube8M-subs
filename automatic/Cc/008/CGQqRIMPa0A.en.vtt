00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.850
 hello hello first hello 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.170
 obviously all the wishes and has 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.970
 well started the year quietly 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.310
 thank you but we also want to you 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.529
 also benefits one to jump from a good 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.900
 year and our best wishes to our 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.029
 supporters who continues this continues to 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.579
 support us well anyway we are 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.960
 very proud of them and they are 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.450
 outstanding that continues like that 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.370
 proulx for the players it started a 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.829
 shortly before the 31st it was not necessarily 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.690
 planned is it difficult like 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.070
 it 's to say here is December 30 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.800
 did some did training 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.010
 and then we have to be careful 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.140
 during past holidays true that the 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.449
 holidays were short and good I think 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.949
 that's enough to recharge 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.579
 battery 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:00.649
 I think it was normal no I 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.400
 I found it logical to 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.430
 resume immediately following our 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.320
 first game of championship 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.930
 insufficient good the good news that's 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.460
 that little by little the infirmary is empty 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.520
 there are two players who will arrive 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.869
 definitely one or two 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.460
 it feels good to see again 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.500
 everyone in training and that 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.630
 which is more effect more manpower 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.850
 present at quite I come back from a 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.009
 month on awakening I hope I 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.990
 wish us all the cases all my 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.069
 teammates precisely to have less 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.569
 of injuries that everyone is 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:34.759
 operational so we can count 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.649
 on everyone to advance to the monte 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.479
 quickly fast in the rankings and it's true 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.450
 than now to review everyone 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.289
 at rational pace it feels good and serves 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.719
 it's good for the group because there's 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.100
 more competition and training 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:46.939
 everyone gives the maximum what is 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.950
 also happening now we know we 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.579
 enters the second half of the season 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.289
 even if it is that last match go 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.789
 what is it that something has 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.280
 changed in attitude or kehl where is this 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.579
 that it is bad luck that has been quality 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.289
 present how do you see that a bit 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.750
 can see in different ways 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.959
 now I think if we are at 7 if 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.849
 it is in this place there is we did 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.709
 not doing the right things 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.069
 now I think in this cycle 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.129
 go we learned now about the 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.290
 cyclo on the return cycle we will avoid 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.950
 to take two steps and not to do 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.800
 same mistakes and 2 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.980
 to play with our values ie 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.330
 the generosity of generosity on a plane 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.769
 staff so you went back to Strasbourg 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.900
 where a few months ago 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.120
 has the adaptation been 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.010
 difficult is what you got 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.709
 at one point a pressure with respect to 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.150
 people compared to auffay that you came 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.769
 also of colmar of the competing club 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.030
 it's true that when we arrive in a 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.860
 new club and lots of things 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.290
 depend on criteria that come into account 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.549
 so down the coach's tactics get put 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.730
 under put in good conditions I 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.250
 mean there are valley teammates too 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.590
 know their strengths and their 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.420
 weak points on what I ask 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.890
 to adapt to the best 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.680
 to be efficient so here it is necessary 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.470
 I needed this time 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.280
 of adaptation and that's it's done 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.620
 now I feel better and better 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.220
 in this club what was scoring 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.799
 during the end of 2013 is that 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.049
 go home it's been pretty good 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.610
 even if they make small mistakes and to 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.580
 outside it was pretty bad 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.989
 all that is what will have to be corrected 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.720
 yes I think finally I'll go 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.400
 remember the last game we did at 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.220
 Dunkirk 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.519
 I found very interesting level 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.989
 collective after saved that we were missing 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.900
 these two small points in addition I think 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.650
 that it will be necessary to keep it that's the same 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.980
 mentality and 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.780
 I think that afterwards we will reap 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.629
 more points outside 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.459
 this aggression in the good sense of the 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.489
 term obviously you had all this 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.930
 part of fighting and going to conquer 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.430
 the balloons that's what can do the 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.069
 difference and national is complicated 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:15.509
 yeah it's true that we find 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:17.829
 teams very much in place defensively so 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:20.680
 So here we must do the same 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.190
 in this championship it is necessary it is 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.780
 true that of a medium of individualities 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.660
 but I think the basis of everything is 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.370
 to defend well in team and attacked 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.970
 in a team so it's true we have 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.979
 demonstrated to dunkirk to defend well 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.169
 now we still have to bring this 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.810
 little more offensively trying to 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.949
 realize our opportunities and I think 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.650
 that it will pay later 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.810
 in any case I am very confident and I 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.820
 think we have the capabilities to for 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.500
 evolve to do better for this 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.880
 new year so jeremy there is a 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.880
 first game looming at this 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.080
 Friday against against colomiers it's 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.389
 what the state of mind of the team or 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.460
 face this team that's fine 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.169
 is still the best attack 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.639
 of the championship with two other teams 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.590
 so it would have to be done 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.300
 attention behind so marked but also 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.770
 be careful though 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.800
 will have to be strong defensively but 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.810
 in any case we can not wait to find 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.350
 the lands the meinau leone to the public 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.900
 so 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.440
 we are impatient and as I said 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.110
 before we have two 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.690
 to start with this new year 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.960
 with the win with three points for 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.150
 start the year 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.420
 quite jeremy even if you're not 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.130
 front center even if you first of all a 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.630
 protector of the guillaume cage 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.370
 Gauclin 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.920
 we would like to mark a small 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.900
 goal maybe on corner we do not know you 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.910
 know you come to colmar altogether 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.980
 like a polecat is marked in colmar in 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.850
 common granny three or four year 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.550
 last yes 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:58.190
 so it's true that this world is also 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:06:00.560
 to mark this new year jérémy 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.970
