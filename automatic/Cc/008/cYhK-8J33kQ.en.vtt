00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.510
 here who speaks to you on each of with a video showing the dismissal process 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.610
 of colors 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.269
 the first step is to create color pallets 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.269
 will be used 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.140
 and then I get this is what I call that normal 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.769
 because it is observed in the duct only with the delegate 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.909
 without any other filter or some other kind of thing 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:30.179
 at 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.179
 I only hear it with a comparsa who 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.510
 in 100% 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.360
 varying only the pressure 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.410
 use the kicks 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.660
 now let's start the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.420
 the process I call bocage and colors 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.800
 would organize the colors 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.850
 pure 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 first, we commited, commented, commented 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.490
 then add color would shadow 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.230
 choose to greet 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.790
 in case the rock is already here the light the light will be Maria 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.970
 list 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.010
 would be the four of them masks 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.990
 note that the complementary color and muscle is a solid I'm going to use 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.990
 just the tone formed on the position of the sony corp 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.740
 now begins the process of brent owens blending 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.090
 at 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.780
 and if this painting all 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.930
 pick up color 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.750
 but above the other 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.020
 made with contributions in puc pontifical 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.660
 who graduated 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.680
 space again 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.680
 I heard 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.090
 hence softening the color transition 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.880
 blocked 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.300
 continue 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.300
 now let's take a quick one because the process is the same 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.090
 since the floor is still chaos the same without change 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.670
 turan thorn would be more or less like this 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.230
 in skin tone the inter mourinho 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.809
 and how the skin 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.909
 I like using a eraldo soft brush 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.099
 inspect 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.199
 improve in turn even more tension 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.469
 the texture with doses will observe 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:30.389
 now with increase ed decrease then the amount of mud ends 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:35.629
 it's simply points this would be a pores so to speak 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:38.609
 also the delegate 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.609
 binho continuous process 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.159
 pass castle chamber 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.919
 counting others 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.929
 ended up quoting other 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:50.639
 and so on 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.519
 now an interesting detail 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.479
 is that it's always good to leave the palette 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:59.749
 in a corner or a separate layer because you feel you can turn to it and that 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:02.749
 what this process is intended to do is to 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.569
 obfuscated opaque 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.109
 hence the theme pure color 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.149
 from the soul of matter 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:15.419
 Good, I'm going to stay here and hope you have helped 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:16.409
 big hug to all
