00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
because a lot of apps in my opinion I

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.259 
because a lot of apps in my opinion I
don't<00:00:24.420> think<00:00:25.130> you<00:00:26.130> should<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.580> purchasing<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
don't think you should be purchasing the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.730 
don't think you should be purchasing the
paid<00:00:27.480> version<00:00:27.510> just<00:00:28.080> because<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> free

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
paid version just because the free

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.099 
paid version just because the free
version<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.519> fine<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.090> um<00:00:30.300> but<00:00:30.750> then

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
version is just fine so um but then

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.170 
version is just fine so um but then
again<00:00:31.230> there<00:00:31.529> are<00:00:31.740> certain<00:00:32.520> applications

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
again there are certain applications

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.270 
again there are certain applications
that<00:00:33.450> i<00:00:33.690> think<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.469> paid<00:00:34.710> versions<00:00:35.160> are

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
that i think the paid versions are

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.490 
that i think the paid versions are
definitely<00:00:35.730> justifiable<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.719> that's<00:00:37.290> what

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500
