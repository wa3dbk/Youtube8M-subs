00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
this is the tricky part with getting

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.819 
this is the tricky part with getting

this getting an o-ring to seal luckily

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.240 
this getting an o-ring to seal luckily
there's<00:01:16.040> a<00:01:17.140> there's<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.259> little<00:01:18.740> edge<00:01:18.890> right<00:01:19.100> in

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
there's a there's a little edge right in

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.770 
there's a there's a little edge right in
there<00:01:19.460> yeah<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:21.710> o-ring<00:01:22.070> seals<00:01:22.430> to<00:01:22.640> that<00:01:22.820> what

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
there yeah the o-ring seals to that what

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.590 
there yeah the o-ring seals to that what
I<00:01:23.840> did<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:24.259> I<00:01:24.500> took<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:24.710> piece<00:01:24.979> of<00:01:25.189> the<00:01:25.450> piece<00:01:26.450> of

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
I did is I took a piece of the piece of

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.749 
I did is I took a piece of the piece of
st.<00:01:26.750> sewer<00:01:26.960> pipe<00:01:27.170> I<00:01:27.320> had<00:01:27.680> meant<00:01:27.979> just<00:01:28.610> a

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
st. sewer pipe I had meant just a

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.010 
st. sewer pipe I had meant just a
smaller<00:01:29.060> diameter<00:01:29.329> than<00:01:29.689> this

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
smaller diameter than this

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.490 
smaller diameter than this
I<00:01:30.049> cut<00:01:30.710> it<00:01:30.860> right<00:01:31.850> there<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:33.109> just<00:01:33.289> kind<00:01:33.439> of

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
I cut it right there and just kind of

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.080 
I cut it right there and just kind of
squeeze<00:01:33.770> it<00:01:33.920> together<00:01:34.039> to<00:01:34.310> get<00:01:34.399> it<00:01:34.520> circle<00:01:34.969> in

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
squeeze it together to get it circle in

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.109 
squeeze it together to get it circle in
there<00:01:35.180> cut<00:01:35.810> a<00:01:35.840> smaller<00:01:36.430> piece<00:01:37.430> that's

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
there cut a smaller piece that's

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.690 
there cut a smaller piece that's
actually<00:01:38.840> right<00:01:39.049> down<00:01:39.079> in<00:01:39.530> there<00:01:39.740> I<00:01:40.039> put<00:01:40.520> that

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
actually right down in there I put that

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.690 
actually right down in there I put that
put<00:01:41.539> this<00:01:41.689> in<00:01:41.899> put<00:01:42.140> that<00:01:42.320> in<00:01:42.500> then<00:01:43.159> this<00:01:43.520> is<00:01:43.640> a

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
put this in put that in then this is a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.370 
put this in put that in then this is a
piece<00:01:43.820> of<00:01:43.969> plexiglass<00:01:44.479> right<00:01:44.689> here<00:01:44.960> I<00:01:45.170> just

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
piece of plexiglass right here I just

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.380 
piece of plexiglass right here I just
put<00:01:45.560> in<00:01:45.829> to<00:01:46.009> fit<00:01:46.280> against<00:01:46.820> that<00:01:46.969> and<00:01:47.119> what<00:01:47.210> that

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
put in to fit against that and what that

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.179 
put in to fit against that and what that
does<00:01:47.600> since<00:01:48.229> this<00:01:48.350> is<00:01:48.469> a<00:01:48.500> little<00:01:48.679> bit<00:01:48.770> fluted

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
does since this is a little bit fluted

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.039 
does since this is a little bit fluted
out<00:01:49.399> here<00:01:49.729> this<00:01:49.969> the<00:01:50.299> wall<00:01:50.509> inside<00:01:50.840> here

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
out here this the wall inside here

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.219 
out here this the wall inside here
doesn't<00:01:51.289> come<00:01:51.380> straight<00:01:51.560> out<00:01:52.840> this<00:01:53.840> keeps

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
doesn't come straight out this keeps

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.060 
doesn't come straight out this keeps
pressure<00:01:54.700> all<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.759> way<00:01:56.030> evenly<00:01:56.829> around<00:01:57.829> there

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
pressure all the way evenly around there

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.310 
pressure all the way evenly around there
so<00:01:58.490> that<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:58.969> guess<00:01:59.390> so<00:01:59.749> if<00:01:59.810> there's<00:01:59.960> no<00:02:00.049> gaps

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
so that I guess so if there's no gaps

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.560 
so that I guess so if there's no gaps
and<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:01.219> seals<00:02:01.520> around<00:02:01.700> there<00:02:01.969> nice

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.219 

going<00:02:06.409> on<00:02:06.530> there<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:06.800> got<00:02:07.040> a<00:02:07.070> little<00:02:07.810> magic<00:02:08.810> lube

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
going on there I got a little magic lube

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.410 
going on there I got a little magic lube
or<00:02:09.470> whatever<00:02:09.740> it<00:02:09.890> is<00:02:09.950> some<00:02:10.190> kind<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.520> teflon

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
or whatever it is some kind of teflon

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.720 
or whatever it is some kind of teflon
grease<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:12.140> just<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.190> lube<00:02:13.370> up<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.520> o-ring<00:02:15.730> and

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
grease to just to lube up the o-ring and

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.880 
grease to just to lube up the o-ring and
then<00:02:16.940> go<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:19.910> fits<00:02:20.150> in<00:02:20.330> there<00:02:20.890> camera

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
then go so that fits in there camera

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.130 
then go so that fits in there camera
goes<00:02:22.040> into<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.340> camera<00:02:22.700> I'm<00:02:22.820> using<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:23.660> guess

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
goes into the camera I'm using I guess

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.390 
goes into the camera I'm using I guess
like<00:02:24.290> I'm<00:02:24.410> sure<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.680> got<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:24.890> mirror<00:02:25.160> here<00:02:26.170> is

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
like I'm sure you got a mirror here is

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.790 
like I'm sure you got a mirror here is
