be<00:02:21.260> done<00:02:21.410> for<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.650> cover-up<00:02:22.070> I<00:02:22.370> do<00:02:22.700> draw<00:02:23.239> up<00:02:23.420> a

be done for a cover-up I do draw up a

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.020 
be done for a cover-up I do draw up a
lot<00:02:23.750> of<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.020> cover-ups<00:02:24.440> ahead<00:02:24.739> of<00:02:24.860> time<00:02:25.040> to

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
lot of the cover-ups ahead of time to

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.479 
lot of the cover-ups ahead of time to
plan<00:02:26.300> out<00:02:26.540> what<00:02:26.720> can<00:02:26.959> cover<00:02:27.200> what<00:02:27.680> what<00:02:28.370> is

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
plan out what can cover what what is

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.940 
plan out what can cover what what is
possible<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.350> mainly<00:02:30.350> just<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.620> get<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.830> most

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
possible and mainly just to get the most

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.270 
possible and mainly just to get the most
effective<00:02:31.209> composition<00:02:33.100> it's<00:02:34.100> a<00:02:34.130> lot

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
effective composition it's a lot

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.340 
effective composition it's a lot
different<00:02:34.430> than<00:02:34.730> just<00:02:35.690> approaching<00:02:35.959> fresh

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
different than just approaching fresh

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.590 
different than just approaching fresh
skin<00:02:36.739> sometimes<00:02:37.280> when<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.700> do<00:02:37.760> fresh<00:02:38.120> skin<00:02:38.420> it's

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
skin sometimes when I do fresh skin it's

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.270 
skin sometimes when I do fresh skin it's
just<00:02:38.780> drawing<00:02:39.050> on<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.470> skin<00:02:39.709> there<00:02:40.040> it's<00:02:40.220> a

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
just drawing on the skin there it's a

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.940 
just drawing on the skin there it's a
little<00:02:40.580> bit<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.790> stencil<00:02:41.680> sometimes<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.769> little

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
little bit of stencil sometimes a little

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.340 
little bit of stencil sometimes a little
bit<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.220> both<00:02:43.630> but<00:02:44.630> with<00:02:44.750> cover-ups<00:02:45.230> you

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
bit of both but with cover-ups you

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.410 
bit of both but with cover-ups you
really<00:02:45.620> have<00:02:45.799> to<00:02:45.980> go<00:02:46.070> in<00:02:46.220> with<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> game<00:02:46.640> plan<00:02:46.700> I

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
really have to go in with a game plan I

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.930 
really have to go in with a game plan I
know<00:02:48.019> it<00:02:48.230> takes<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.560> some<00:02:49.010> clients<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.610> little

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
know it takes a some clients a little

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.400 
know it takes a some clients a little
bit<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.150> get<00:02:50.269> used<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.810> fact<00:02:50.989> that<00:02:51.170> we're

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
bit to get used to the fact that we're

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.380 
bit to get used to the fact that we're
doing<00:02:51.440> large<00:02:51.890> cover-ups<00:02:52.400> because<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.180> have

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
doing large cover-ups because you have

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.470 
doing large cover-ups because you have
to<00:02:53.540> take<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:53.720> leap<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:54.080> faith<00:02:54.290> with<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:56.090> artist

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
to take a leap of faith with that artist

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.840 
to take a leap of faith with that artist
because<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:57.830> know<00:02:57.920> they<00:02:58.070> can<00:02:58.220> see<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.549> vision

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
because you know they can see the vision

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.770 
because you know they can see the vision
in<00:02:58.970> their<00:02:59.060> head<00:02:59.120> but<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.720> might<00:02:59.959> not<00:02:59.989> always

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
in their head but it might not always

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.960 
in their head but it might not always
and<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.890> first<00:03:02.130> couple<00:03:02.280> sessions<00:03:02.610> at<00:03:02.940> the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
and the first couple sessions at the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.300 
and the first couple sessions at the
tattoo<00:03:03.420> but<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:04.110> going<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.590> cover<00:03:04.770> up<00:03:04.920> or

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
tattoo but is this going to cover up or

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.180 
tattoo but is this going to cover up or
is<00:03:05.520> this<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:06.690> know<00:03:06.720> am<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.620> going<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.950> see<00:03:08.100> this

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
is this you know am I going to see this

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.559 
is this you know am I going to see this
ever<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.550> that's<00:03:08.610> really<00:03:08.880> important

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
ever and that's really important

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.690 
ever and that's really important
being<00:03:09.750> able<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.959> fix<00:03:10.230> things<00:03:10.500> for<00:03:10.890> people<00:03:11.010> as

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
being able to fix things for people as

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.910 
being able to fix things for people as
much<00:03:11.940> as<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.209> is<00:03:12.330> it's<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.630> challenge<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.410> think

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
much as it is it's a challenge I think

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.680 
much as it is it's a challenge I think
that<00:03:14.310> sometimes<00:03:14.550> that<00:03:14.940> does<00:03:15.150> more<00:03:15.360> for<00:03:15.390> a

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
that sometimes that does more for a

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.250 
that sometimes that does more for a
person<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.980> their<00:03:17.160> body<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.870> then<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.900> brand

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
person and their body and then a brand

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.030 
person and their body and then a brand
new<00:03:19.470> fresh

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
new fresh

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.800 
new fresh
thank<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.370> tattoo<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:20.910> approached<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:21.390> like<00:03:21.660> an

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
thank you tattoo I approached it like an

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.330 
thank you tattoo I approached it like an
under<00:03:22.110> painting<00:03:22.319> I<00:03:22.530> guess<00:03:22.739> I<00:03:22.950> think<00:03:23.040> that's

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
under painting I guess I think that's

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.850 
under painting I guess I think that's
where<00:03:23.520> about<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:24.090> mica<00:03:24.360> debris<00:03:25.050> comes<00:03:25.560> in<00:03:25.739> the

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
where about the mica debris comes in the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.590 
where about the mica debris comes in the
turns

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
turns

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.020 
turns
why<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.650> take<00:03:28.650> on<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.250> cover-ups<00:03:29.730> that<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:29.970> do

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
why I take on the cover-ups that I do

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.770 
why I take on the cover-ups that I do
and<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:31.230> think<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:32.040> idea<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.550> creation<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:33.480> art

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
and I think the idea of creation and art

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.290 
and I think the idea of creation and art
is<00:03:34.590> one<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.250> most<00:03:35.459> sacred<00:03:35.610> things<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.120> can

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
is one of the most sacred things you can

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.420 
is one of the most sacred things you can
do<00:03:36.510> because<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.230> really<00:03:37.560> does<00:03:37.769> change<00:03:38.130> the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
do because it really does change the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.630 
do because it really does change the
world<00:03:38.640> in<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.030> significant<00:03:39.600> way
