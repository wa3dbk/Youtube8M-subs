students who's going to be tossing the
ball<00:01:44.819> to<00:01:45.060> me<00:01:45.209> and<00:01:45.380> hopefully<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.649> going<00:01:46.740> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
ball to me and hopefully it's going to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:02:02.980 
ball to me and hopefully it's going to
help<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.039> with<00:01:47.159> your<00:01:47.249> inside-out<00:01:47.759> forehand

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.359 

so<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.080> can<00:02:04.229> see<00:02:04.440> from<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.650> demonstrate

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
so you can see from that demonstrate

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.340 
so you can see from that demonstrate
that<00:02:05.640> was<00:02:06.000> fast-paced<00:02:06.690> action<00:02:06.960> right<00:02:07.320> there

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
that was fast-paced action right there

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.650 
that was fast-paced action right there
you<00:02:07.619> can<00:02:07.770> do<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:07.950> at<00:02:08.130> a<00:02:08.190> slower<00:02:08.490> pace<00:02:08.660> to

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
you can do it at a slower pace to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.150 
you can do it at a slower pace to
generate<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.200> rhythm<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.740> need<00:02:10.950> but

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
generate the rhythm that you need but

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.100 
generate the rhythm that you need but
the<00:02:11.250> key<00:02:11.490> is<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.820> get<00:02:12.000> around<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.870> cone

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the key is to get around the cone

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.710 
the key is to get around the cone
quickly<00:02:13.620> get<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.700> outside<00:02:14.910> foot<00:02:15.390> push

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
quickly get on that outside foot push

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.360 
quickly get on that outside foot push
off<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:15.959> it<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.350> use<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.800> ground<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.280> get

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
off of it and use the ground to get

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.699 
off of it and use the ground to get
power<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.970> your<00:02:18.450> inside<00:02:18.840> out<00:02:18.870> forehand<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.650> you

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
power on your inside out forehand so you

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.990 
power on your inside out forehand so you
can<00:02:19.950> take<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.310> drill<00:02:20.610> with<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.910> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
can take that drill with you to the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.500 
can take that drill with you to the
courts

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
courts

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.330 
courts
