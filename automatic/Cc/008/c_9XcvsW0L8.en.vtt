00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
sometimes but I don't think it's it

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.090 
sometimes but I don't think it's it
doesn't<00:00:33.870> ever<00:00:34.079> wake<00:00:34.290> anybody<00:00:34.530> up<00:00:34.739> or<00:00:34.950> anything

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
doesn't ever wake anybody up or anything

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.979

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
so when he drank it was Jacoby but now I

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.600 
so when he drank it was Jacoby but now I

the<00:00:47.399> whole<00:00:47.610> thing<00:00:47.879> just<00:00:48.090> gets<00:00:48.390> rocked<00:00:48.870> out<00:00:49.140> I

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the whole thing just gets rocked out I

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:58.790 
the whole thing just gets rocked out I
snore<00:00:54.739> it's<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.860> toss-up<00:00:56.280> between<00:00:57.559> Tony<00:00:58.559> and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
snore it's a toss-up between Tony and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.849 
snore it's a toss-up between Tony and
Jacoby<00:00:59.250> but<00:00:59.879> then<00:01:00.090> everyone<00:01:00.719> sort<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> expects

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
Jacoby but then everyone sort of expects

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.690 
Jacoby but then everyone sort of expects
that<00:01:01.980> from<00:01:02.250> Jacoby<00:01:03.019> being<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> way<00:01:04.229> he<00:01:04.379> is

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
that from Jacoby being the way he is

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.820 
that from Jacoby being the way he is
so<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.820> would<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:05.970> Jacoby<00:01:06.510> he<00:01:07.470> doesn't<00:01:07.740> have

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
so that would be Jacoby he doesn't have

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.910 
so that would be Jacoby he doesn't have
a<00:01:07.860> filter<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.900> yeah<00:01:09.900> sometimes<00:01:10.200> he'll<00:01:10.650> he'll

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
a filter and yeah sometimes he'll he'll

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.160 
a filter and yeah sometimes he'll he'll
uh<00:01:11.060> he'll<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.119> some<00:01:12.450> pretty<00:01:12.600> wacky<00:01:12.810> like

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
uh he'll have some pretty wacky like

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.380 
uh he'll have some pretty wacky like
segways<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.830> between<00:01:14.130> songs<00:01:14.430> like<00:01:14.760> oh<00:01:14.909> man<00:01:15.270> I
