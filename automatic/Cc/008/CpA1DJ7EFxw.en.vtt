00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello everyone with you zhdanov Ivan given 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.750
 video tutorial we will look at both how 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.080
 how to hold the rackets properly 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:15.389
 efficiently and optimally for you 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.350
 such a lesson for beginners and thought to be 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.289
 useful times for already playing an athlete 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.130
 This is what the content of the racket 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.359
 table tennis 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:31.260
 we hold the racket so we paid a finger 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.980
 we had along the bottom of the lining and 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.020
 the thumb she could put them 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.790
 parallel to the bottom of the lining 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.010
 sometimes the first error occurs when 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.379
 put your thumb here so 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:53.160
 already climbing directly to the left 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.739
 brain racket part to find out when playing with 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.690
 left to do so that the ball was 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.829
 more convenient to push but the same position 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.629
 finger but ultimately leads to what 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.820
 hard to play left right that is already 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.280
 when I'm more difficult draw 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.080
 left right then finger starts walking 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.509
 racket though it starts more 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.330
 hang out in your hand and so what else mistakes 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.330
 there are guys using athletes 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.780
 when they hold the racket first they 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.290
 happen to climb up very much either 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.820
 forefinger 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.820
 and where is one finger 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.740
 I finger is so even holding part 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.070
 the bribe area was given a little eager 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.260
 we keep pretty so modest for 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.850
 edge of 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.250
 What are the features of the racket? 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.670
 only and how do they affect the rackets and we 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.400
 see that pretty big so 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.509
 the edge is only on we take it from us this 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:55.560
 parts she is about close and she 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.710
 so we get a call 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.729
 rackets with large edges like this can 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.300
 take a little farther bones even 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:10.470
 moving away from the edge of the racket if bright has 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:15.000
 pretty kim small edge small then 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.709
 You can take a dense straight specifically as 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.610
 can be closer to the very lukas racket 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:26.010
 this increases control with the racket and 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.420
 the game is just in on the table over 100 times 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.850
 convenient to play when we keep on 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.760
 racket yes we increase the length 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.400
 take and we have increased power we 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.440
 we can take further that is it already 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.850
 brother-in-law game technique therefore 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.420
 experiment try differently 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.830
 brothers racket to play it will be 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:54.870
 let you grow your skills faster 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:58.390
 The second type of racket support is a pen. 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.770
 when well come and come easier from 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.700
 China is usually Chinese 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.810
 athletes play and this style 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.820
 holding itself like that 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.790
 hold the pen with two fingers 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.830
 grasp the racket and the rest 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.500
 clenched into fists either the world could be 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.750
 even promoted so what idea at all 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.430
 pen games 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.190
 the first racket to play the pen she does not 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.070
 this form is not specialized 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:32.320
 handle that pain is comfortable to keep her so 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:36.510
 Grip and taking the pen than interesting 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:41.290
 that we can almost change only 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.880
 taking the sword already take at all points 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.720
 cancel on the right 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.450
 centralizer 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.300
 on the left if we play European grip 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.910
 That's the way that we are taught that 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.640
 on the right we take on the left we take 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.800
 and here we can say about our 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.280
 right shoulder arises so dead 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.850
 zone that on complexity alone left the sun 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.590
 on right 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:09.350
 such a perk to tell him when playing this 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.100
 grip and rum flu difficulty 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.630
 arise and yes we play left because 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.810
 it is quite necessary to the ball and 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.780
 close prescription style pen nip he 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.680
 implies playing more attacker and 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.190
 style more aggressive environment 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.520
 supports 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.490
 children's athletes 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.810
 in this video lesson 7 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.810
 attention was important
