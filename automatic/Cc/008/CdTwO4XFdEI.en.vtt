00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.059
 and corn circles one of the 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.580
 mysteries that maybe more calls the 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.160
 attention are the mysterious circles in 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.259
 the crop fields the skeptics 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.419
 they say it's a fraud but for others 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:21.880
 it is not of human origin and therefore a 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.640
 unsolved mystery that are these 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.439
 circles the circles in the grass 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.079
 circles in the crops also 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.910
 called crop circle is in English they are 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:34.149
 drawings that appear in fields of 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.829
 corn wheat cultivation and so on many 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.590
 link these circles with the 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.650
 UFO phenomena in this phenomenon was based 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.390
 the film signals acted by mel gibson 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.490
 the oldest harvest circle 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.950
 registered is represented in a 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.290
 17th century engraving called the devil 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.390
 of mowing the image represents a 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.520
 strange creature that creates a design 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.890
 to circulate in a wheatfield said image 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.930
 contained in a pamphlet appeared in 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.820
 states in which the farmer expressed 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.100
 his preference for having the devil himself 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.170
 the harvest coming before paying the 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.570
 salary that your harvester demanded for his 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.899
 work but the phenomenon is known and 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.620
 has media coverage since 1976 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.660
 when 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.780
 in the first circles in winchester 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.520
 United Kingdom- these were simple 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.590
 just nine or ten meters in diameter 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.290
 but over the years it 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.200
 they came back more complex and numerous already 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.970
 in the 1980s the phenomenon 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.660
 moves to other countries such as Germany 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.640
 new zealand etcetera in 1991 doug 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.110
 chorley community are awarded the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.270
 authorship of the first circles 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.690
 appeared during the middle of the decade 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.540
 of 1970 showing how to perform them to the 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.520
 press from that moment the appeal 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.100
 over circles falls but soon 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.110
 more circles appear and more complex what 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.180
 which suggests sympathizers 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.370
 the paranormal that not all circles 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.630
 they were made by bower and chorley and 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.570
 that could have an origin 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.700
 extraterrestrial or unknown skeptics 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.040
 and the bowery chorley themselves think that 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.170
 the new appearance of circles is due to 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.240
 the creation of new creative groups 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.760
 of these figures one of the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.860
 characteristics of these circles is of 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.960
 which they are increasingly more complex 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.730
 many of them so perfect that I would 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.310
 doubt anyone who their provenance 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.950
 be human there are several theories about your 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.050
 provenance the one agricultural hypothesis 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.030
 researchers in favor of this 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.040
 theory think that the formation of the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.140
 circles is due to abuse and use 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.440
 improper chemical fertilizers in 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.690
 cereal crops two rings 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.640
 fairies like this is called a phenomenon 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.739
 produced by the mysterium annular fungus 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.930
 and that can rarely cause certain 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.910
 geometric shapes in various types of 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.540
 pasture or food plantations 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.940
 animals 3 animals who proposed this 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.070
 theory argued that in time of heat 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.320
 the males of moles and hedgehogs 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.680
 dancing around the females created 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.019
 these circular shapes 4 meteorological 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.030
 some cases can be solved with 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.519
 this theory although the forms created 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.290
 by the wind they do not have perfection 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.280
 geometry of most drawings 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.260
 analyzed 5 helicopters it was thought that 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.239
 the helicopters were the culprits of 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.459
 the formation of the figures due to the 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.530
 rotation of the blades of these although to the 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.170
 As in the weather scenario 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.930
 these shapes are irregular 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.209
 and artistic is the theory with more followers 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.950
 because some advanced Englishmen 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.260
 age they recognized having done 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.030
 some circles although not all and that 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.209
 they charged a dollar for entering their 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.040
 ground to be able to see the seven UFOs 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.989
 during the guards and later 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.150
 follow-ups have been detected the 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.709
 presence of strange and small 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.840
 plasma spheres that run 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.330
 quietly by the surface of the 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.580
 fields of cereals are numerous 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.410
 witnesses who have seen and filmed these 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.390
 whitish balls prowling the 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.150
 crop fields as it happens by 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.760
 other parts of the world on the page the 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.620
 mystic dot com.ar details us a 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.230
 series of characteristics that they possess 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.299
 these circles these drawings found in 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.130
 the wheat fields have a series of 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.890
 characteristics which are 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.780
 detailed below to people 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.850
 that enter the drawings perceive 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.799
 medium frequency sounds if they approach 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.290
 the ears to the surface where it was 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:20.079
 captured the trace these as whistles 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.210
 They have been recorded and analyzed see 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.610
 within the footprints have been presented 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.229
 different types of substances 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.090
 gelatinous some of them say of 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.000
 nonexistent constitution in our 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.340
 planet if the approaching individuals 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.620
 these areas report feeling sick 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.050
 have nausea headaches and 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.270
 stomach the dogs are pretty 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.919
 sensitive to this type of effects and 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.260
 some of them spend time 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.600
 barking as if some entity or person 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.690
 I was there even though nobody really 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.970
 he sees it and unusual objects are reported 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.680
 materialize ides materialize in 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.630
 those places 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.030
 some researchers claim to have 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.160
 had lost times that is to say no 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.720
 they remember nothing during their stay in 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.760
 the pictograms 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.590
 efe at night they declare to see 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.360
 reflections accompanied by lights 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.610
 electrostatic and type sounds 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.410
 metallic occurring even when the 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.020
 witnesses are present in days 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.000
 cloudy that the analysis of the 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.539
 vegetation found in and 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.539
 around
