 founder of 13 fine dot com and that is 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.969
 A blog about it is just not ideal 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.809
 and you only wear it over it 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.230
 beauty ideal or about other things 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.250
 yes it's just the idea a lot 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.180
 common ground within fashion within media 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.580
 within sports and all those interfaces 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.780
 developments that are colder there 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.210
 I write about that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.070
 ok and then I have to think like me 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.280
 think of the beauty ideals you 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.680

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.450
 say but now I can post it 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.920
 often when someone thinks you have a clean tibia 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.450
 I okay out of people's way 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.259
 blogs in english 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.939

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.920

 festival season i just got the bock 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.390

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.920
 nice to have accessories in my hair 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.140
 or in my braids 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.300
 to pimp it up a bit more before 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.530
 the when I go to festival to a party 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.959
 go outdoors 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.620
 so this is a diy for a bit of one 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.010
 Bohemian style and yes let's be fast 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.000
 to start 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.690
 this is all you need 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 vere choose the most beautiful beautiful the most 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.000
 colorful your favorite feathers 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.810
 buy order the decoration wire 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.690
 scissors or one 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.660
 no thank you as you see I have 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.850
 actually made a selection of feathers 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:35.370
 fit nicely together again 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:38.550
 I 'm going to do this also they just choose 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.620
 what I like a bit together 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.560
 I like something like that together 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.430
 well grab buy wire and I want 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.580
 this will be the front so I put it there 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.580
 across 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.520
 I 'd get over it and then the back 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.400
 which by the way should also be neat what 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.750
 a natural mega train is running 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.670
 around it 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:08.780
 that it is a bit tight and so and so 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.780
 then it wraps around it 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.920
 I wanted to do as neatly as possible I wanted 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.080
 this becomes the front and you have to 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.560
 ensure the back you are tidy to the 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.120
 runs pretty well of course and I go 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.400
 as neat as possible 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.230
 twist the wire around it so that you go to 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.840
 just the accents of the copper wire 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.130
 very difficult to see it colors up 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.610
 nice weather the feathers 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.470
 I think it's good now and then 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.970
 I am going to finish him now as a whole 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.840
 easy 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.760
 snipped it and so just gave you one 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.740
 bit like many others 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:52.740
 to attach to your book below me 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:54.810
 wrote or you say that's a name 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.570
 this is they become as I said 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.220
 it's super easy and does not 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.900
 super neat 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.440
 it is not a bit of a chicken siebelink 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.020
 city that shield is always nice though 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.990
 or not should i now show you how 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.020
 you can confirm its'm buying 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.320
 that you braid 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:19.919
 you thread the copper wire through your braid 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.360
 and I would have such a little straighter 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:26.419
 I'll put it through 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.419
 in and then 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.479
 am actually the soda and prefer 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.039
 I just want them to stay a bit 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.560
 you can really hang them sort of 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.810
 There wrap around 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.819
 but I personally feel beautiful 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:46.860
 as you see and do there just hook 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:49.669
 and then it stays that way 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.669
 judge in hanger 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.720
 very nice I am in fashion myself 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.840
