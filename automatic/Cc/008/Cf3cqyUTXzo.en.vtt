00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.330
 there is humidity here 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.040
 luckily for me, I have this 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.040
 will have to using 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:18.640
 gilliam's revenge what you mean 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.540
 have our unit go now 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.459
 general loose logos was deposed 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.440
 seems to have no alternative of six 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.250
 already saved once do not waste the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.840
 your life there is nothing to save 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.020
 from that day my friend lost 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.020
 meaning 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.760
 I lost everything I had 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:48.210
 but now it's time for revenge yes 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.210
 but your injuries are not a problem 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.710
 because now I ca n't hear anything anymore 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.740
 still change your mind 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.450
 not even dreamers of shadows 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.130
 they have to pay for it 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.370
 I guarantee that Zola will regret 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.320
 bitterly for what he did and now 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.080
 tap your eyes on me 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.120
 annoys you will need help not 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:19.470
 I need nothing but you would have me 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.470
 arm I was not talking about but him 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.120
 and what they are 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.930
 new models I had to work a lot 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.840
 to get them 6 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.910
 now take the really thank you a 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.920
 nice gesture but I don't trust any more 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.540
 machines these are not simple 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.750
 machines are works of art 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.750
 but 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.570
 in short, I repeat this is the 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.590
 wrong direction my ruins are 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.480
 on that side 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.010
 you stop yelling in my ears a ho 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.320
 need concentration 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.330
 certainly now I understand your game there 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.340
 you want to bring to your ruins and if 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.410
 even it would be more logical considering that 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.420
 they are closer and you think so 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.250
 how tough those two think 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.350
 how they will become when they are more 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.900
 powerful then yes there will be to have 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.430
 fear and you too have reached yours 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.430
 rovigo and this is alarming 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.110
 there are only four texts of the extras 7 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.840
 the third chapter what but rumaro 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.130
 has misinterpreted the fourth who speaks 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.950
 of a field of snow and ice 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.460
 the fifth that deals with regeneration e 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.080
 finally the seventh chapter with this 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.510
 strange list of numbers are four 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.670
 texts each represents 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.470
 an opportunity each hides the 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.540
 key to strengthen the male power 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.090
 and from there but even if we could 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.860
 deciphering them all remains a mystery to 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.570
 to solve 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.300
 and in this regard area still has to 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.130
 provide an explanation 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.270
 I believe the time to face the 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.669
 question will arrive soon for the last 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.070
 time to my ruins that we must 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.780
 go to maybe I see something 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:12.070
 stop talking to you now with this 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:14.970
 you know you understand look at that 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.970
 rainbow 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.950
 [Music] 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.020
 wow is really beautiful ever seen 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.510
 one so big doesn't make you want to 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.100
 be at peace with everyone 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.460

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.800

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.890
 my turn 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.390
 it is useless for those who do not want to insist 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.910
 understand that the ruins of which are too much 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.920
 distant that it matters to us after all 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.960
 we have already been to yours is there you have 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.950
 had the necklace revenues yes but not 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.070
 it has nothing to do with it 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.900
 now I understand then I have to think you do 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.690
 so why put his girlfriend with his 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.730

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.160
 nonsense that I say but hear 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.800
 flying an airplane no longer makes you 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.430

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:16.450
