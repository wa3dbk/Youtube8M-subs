00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 friends hello past video with 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.950
 at least a comic strip review during 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.040
 Adventure 10 release pretty good 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.799
 was met by scoring a good amount 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.910
 likes I decided to shoot 2 videos 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.760
 yes it will be devoted to release number 12 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.960
 since 11 I don't have any plans yet 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.960
 to get it 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:34.540
 every comic how many noticed say 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:38.350
 comic different artist so 12 issue 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.420
 as 10 was common in four different 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.970
 versions of the cover I have here such 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.670
 colorful and now show what else there is 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.500
 three more content they all have 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:54.520
 same price only differ 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:59.440
 the cover in the comic goes two story first 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:02.910
 the plot is a continuation of the plot which 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.710
 started in issue 11 of which 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.140
 Of course I will later do it 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.530
 also video and begins the fact that the Finn and 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.220
 jake and marseline play smoke and behind them 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.390
 watches the pimple then winter happens 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.420
 some kind of glitch 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.530
 guys start looking for ways to heal 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.030
 smoke from the virus guys need to find 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.640
 wizard by name 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.500
 and forehead really liked the moment when 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.960
 Jack 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.690
 turned into bed and also moment 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.470
 when the pin depicts how it is built with 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.470
 princesses 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.690
 the plot of the first comic he is not 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.690
 ends in this edition the mind will 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.680
 continued in issue 13 in which about 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.750
 which i am he too 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.490
 tell the future the second plot of the comic 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.310
 called the snow king and his 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.100
 magic math mini comics 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.720
 the snow king drew his comics and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.380
 walks through the lands about spreading it 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.050
 among residents 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.190
 But why does he do it in order to 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.370
 while everyone is passionate about comics about his life 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.530
 at this moment he 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.930
 so he can steal the princesses like 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.780
 in fact, he usually does because 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.000
 apparently the old man has nothing to do it 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.790
 constantly doing something like this 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.770
 Here is the activity and bad 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.590

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.640
 heroes finn and jake and they decide to make 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.770
