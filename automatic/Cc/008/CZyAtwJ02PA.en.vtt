00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
learning my human design has brought me

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.330 
learning my human design has brought me
just<00:00:15.870> such<00:00:16.049> an<00:00:16.199> incredible<00:00:16.680> sense<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.039> peace

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
geometry and you start to ride your

everything<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.279> perfect<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:29.970> everything's

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
everything is perfect and everything's

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.999 
everything is perfect and everything's
not<00:00:30.630> perfect<00:00:30.769> everything's<00:00:31.769> still

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
not perfect everything's still

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.990 
not perfect everything's still
everything<00:00:32.520> but<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.989> become<00:00:34.620> at<00:00:34.980> peace<00:00:35.460> you

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
everything but you become at peace you

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.660 
everything but you become at peace you
become<00:00:36.510> aligned<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.170> then<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.160> questions

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
become aligned and then the questions

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.660 
become aligned and then the questions
drop<00:00:38.910> away<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:40.079> mines<00:00:40.320> desire<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.460> drive

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
drop away and the mines desire to drive

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.490 
drop away and the mines desire to drive
the<00:00:41.850> vehicle<00:00:42.059> even<00:00:42.600> starts<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.110> subside

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the vehicle even starts to subside

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.139 
the vehicle even starts to subside
because<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.129> vehicle<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.670> see<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.059> it

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
because the vehicle can see that it

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.139 
because the vehicle can see that it
operates<00:00:45.270> better<00:00:45.809> from<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> mechanic<00:00:47.149> so

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
operates better from the mechanic so

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.479 
operates better from the mechanic so
from<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> bottom<00:00:49.200> up<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.559> time<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.340> know

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
from the bottom up this time you know

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.430 
from the bottom up this time you know
remember<00:00:50.700> if<00:00:51.059> your<00:00:51.180> reflector<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.930> begin<00:00:52.260> this

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
remember if your reflector to begin this

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.150 
remember if your reflector to begin this
experiment<00:00:53.160> are<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> right<00:00:54.360> place

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
experiment are you in the right place

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.290 
experiment are you in the right place
become<00:00:56.160> aware<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.460> how<00:00:56.760> you're<00:00:56.940> sampling

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
become aware of how you're sampling

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.170 
become aware of how you're sampling
everything<00:00:57.870> become<00:00:58.620> aware<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.699> Moon<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
everything become aware of the Moon and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.910 
everything become aware of the Moon and
what<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.510> doing<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> transits

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
what it's doing to you in the transits

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.210 
what it's doing to you in the transits
and<00:01:02.570> really<00:01:03.570> really<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.500> know<00:01:04.589> take<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.979> easy

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
and really really you know take it easy

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.520 
and really really you know take it easy
on<00:01:05.369> yourself<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:06.119> know<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.270> wait<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> month<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
on yourself you know to wait a month to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.740 
on yourself you know to wait a month to
make<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> decision<00:01:07.979> takes<00:01:08.970> real<00:01:09.210> discipline

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
make a decision takes real discipline

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.500 
make a decision takes real discipline
but<00:01:10.500> at<00:01:10.740> first<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.490> may<00:01:11.640> feel<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:11.880> discipline

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
but at first it may feel like discipline

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.480 
but at first it may feel like discipline
but<00:01:12.689> if<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.200> give<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> experiment<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.220> trance

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
but if you give the experiment of trance

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.999 
but if you give the experiment of trance
it'll<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.150> feel<00:01:15.540> natural<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.740> because

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
it'll just feel natural to you because

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.679 
it'll just feel natural to you because
that's<00:01:17.130> how<00:01:17.310> your<00:01:17.490> designs<00:01:17.850> you'll<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.390> moving

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
that's how your designs you'll be moving

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.780 
that's how your designs you'll be moving
with<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> earth<00:01:19.439> with<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.009> with<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.520> moon

the most disturbed creatures in the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.120 
the most disturbed creatures in the
beginning<00:01:31.079> because<00:01:31.200> we've<00:01:31.530> been<00:01:31.560> taking<00:01:31.860> in

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
beginning because we've been taking in

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.039 
beginning because we've been taking in
so<00:01:32.369> much<00:01:32.640> from<00:01:32.939> everywhere<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.570> we've

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
misunderstood we can see what it looks

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.940 
misunderstood we can see what it looks
like<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.869> work<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.290> go<00:01:37.320> try<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.740> do

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
like it's going to work we go try to do

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.289 
like it's going to work we go try to do
it<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.159> doesn't<00:01:38.369> work<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.640> way<00:01:38.939> for<00:01:39.180> us

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
it it doesn't work that way for us

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.859 
it it doesn't work that way for us
people<00:01:39.990> come<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.530> us<00:01:40.560> or<00:01:41.240> more<00:01:42.240> importantly<00:01:42.630> we

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
people come to us or more importantly we

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.319 
people come to us or more importantly we
see<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.350> other<00:01:43.500> people<00:01:43.829> could<00:01:44.180> could<00:01:45.180> use

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
see that other people could could use

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.600 
see that other people could could use

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
our help we want a guy then we meet with

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.210 
our help we want a guy then we meet with
resistance<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:48.270> mean<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.869> joke<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:50.040> a
