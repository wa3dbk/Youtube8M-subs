00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello everybody talks about 891 and in my 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.629
 first video of the call of duty goes 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.849
 to my first departure lópez this 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.380
 hyperactive also pretty lost 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.210
 but above all everything hyperactive that we 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.769
 He served as much for even one minute 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.350
 half after I had not calmed down and 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.760
 everything kill my first enemy finally and 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.470
 it was miraculously you see that it hides between 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.699
 the particle is going to come out I kill it after 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.109
 of a bullet fail is tremendous but 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.029
 Well I start the game with my foot 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.849
 right then if they kill me but that does not 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.789
 taught the vibrio the game was full 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.309
 of great moments my first camper 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.590
 always in my heart uncle up to a year 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.210
 whole in my heart and also others 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.680
 best first moments I do not get to 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.420
 my first puppy also the first 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.280
 I already started a bit to play better 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.690
 and I start to know this giant map a 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.390
 little more I got the giant of the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.920
 giant and here I take my dog ​​and also 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.270
 well half an interesting streak for 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.219
 here that good being the first game 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.719
 it was not bad day I was motivated I said okay 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.699
 like the game I like I like 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.559
 true battle one is a tower these 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.760
 we want what it's full of people 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.079
 you say that tower there is a 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.510
 safe country always a sniper 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.760
 but a game you put it in charge and it goes 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.949
 say back no but it's already infinitive das 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.450
 but to see here I already kill one last and 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.159
 completed the streak and is what I teach you 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.380
 of the first game then now 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.759
 we went to the worst I'm not going to start 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.290
 talking about the worst of the game for 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.000
 end with the best and the worst are the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.170
 backs I'm sorry it seems that 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.240
 I always say the same thing but it is that I 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.920
 I hallucinate or see how a 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.720
 starting I just started the game 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.970
 I start in front of him here you go to another 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.530
 Curious respawn I know we are spend 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.240
 a few is difficult to make them but 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.729
 it's crazy to be very careful there 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.680
 have at least five eyes and a 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.670
 times instead of being born next to an enemy 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.679
 is born they leave 15 back I do not know which is worse and 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.319
 if the two things that I die with 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.259
 a c4 and born next to dowry two 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.000
 Uncles, besides, I swear to you, every time, ryad and 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.880
 If I wanted to kill you twice I 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.069
 I 'm sorry, but it scratched me a little and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.869
 well let's go to another important topic 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.039
 kill a bullet that does not mean that 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.209
 be neither good nor bad but you have to 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.459
 keep it in mind fix here I've 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:02:00.360
 killed very fast and look with a 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:02.130
 go down to 200 meters with this ship weapon 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.229
 and it is worth little but it is killed before 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.220
 a bullet this is going to be scandalous 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.360
 I'm going to make a death chamber of a 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.360
 bullet through the wall 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.240
 obviously but I'm saying it kills from a 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.910
 bullet that is painting very little I 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.680
 I recommend using hunter and especially 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.540
 hunter that allows you to move aiming 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.660
 by areas where there are enemies and it is not 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.580
 paint too much and good we go with my 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.170
 favorite streaks to wreck I have 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.060
 the combination of just kicked the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.460
 missile launcher is the dog that I carry and 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.220
 what I get here the combat hide 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.080
 I like to destroy those three because 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.700
 good you control them and notice that 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.140
 save two jumped is another thing that you 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.140
 I want to comment in this game too 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.030
 jumping seems to me a very good way to 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.590
 dodge bullets here is going to see that I'm going 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.880
 to do another point kill at the end that 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.400
 is going to catch me is painting here 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.800
 he sprinted and I get to kill him for jumping 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.970
 surely I tell you , no, there is no 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.710
 jumping all the time but yes that you 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.010
 they can fight like all this news 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.260
 previous and another very important thing of 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.030
 the ones against ones is that you hear 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.830
 an outrage even in the challenges 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.100
 although I silently deadly in the 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.990
 challenges listen to you and listen 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.240
 you have to go duck and here I go 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.680
 get a low for that is how to 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.920
 go with helmets you have an advantage 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.440
 huge and look here the low that I do 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.270
 hear it often turn between I sell 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.010
 my mother is an absolute barbarity 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.510
 but hey he left me a streak without a doubt 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.830
 amazing that not only carry because it is 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.140
 a pain in the ass to wait for the package and not 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.820
 I want nothing but this time I pass it 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.110
 great when I get it is the bread already 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.850
 that is with a triple knife if 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.780
 you combine with the dog you are god you are 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.780
 God 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:46.500
 and there's the second one and that's almost 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.940
 indestructible because those that you 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.770
 they try to kill you are not able to 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.440
 reach is the Basque dog 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.760
 like monet manet and here a house comes in and 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.030
 I just cleaned it to make a 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.980
 long streak the first one else plus the 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.060
 second he has learned and the third he 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.400
 here he also finds out they are learning 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.440
 all all at times but not not 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.170
 It gives time and here I think it was completed 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.460
 with a last one that gives me his package 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.200
 help for killing 67 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.510
 another thing I wanted to comment is that 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.280
 as always as always 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.480
 specialist as there was already in the modern 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.040
 warfare 3 here I get all the 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.560
 bonuses is not only exactly 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.540
 same as before but if you combine it with 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.310
 the initial five streak of a math 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.370
 bullet I promise you a bullet account 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.050
 made of 12 practically and well a 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.190
 interesting novelty is the butt mode 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.080
 that makes people go crazy 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.310
 As you already know, it explodes if you do not kill 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.830
 in 30 seconds and here I bring you one 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.420
 brutal streak that although it was explode 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.160
 in five seconds almost there was no 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.740
 exploded because I was here killing and 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.810
 I get the gein I think the theft streak of 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.700
 11 with the man since in just 30 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.140
 fixed seconds that asked the answer to the 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.790
 my classmates are back 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.830
 they are doing everyone in front but 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.110
 everyone and he's already here today putting the 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.850
 hallucinating boots and I do not move well 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.100
 so I'm here in wood and tania 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.420
 although still they not brought me and Look 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.010
 that good here is already hallucinated I have 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.080
 a little bit good 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.040
 this miracle waits for the other and finished off 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.870
 streak of 11 nothing 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.220
 and good now we are going to the end to 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.290
 fun situations I love what's 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.150
 sliding is that you miss the 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.340
 filter I love I do not love that I 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.040
 kill in corners and this position is very 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.390
 jacket and I tell you is the position is 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.770
 disgusting whenever you pass by and 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.750
 is to watch him inform him bandages 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.460
 and good one interesting thing is that a 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.259
 moment I had power I shot and the 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.940
 enemies came out I wanted to god me 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.349
 crickets by that time so far 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.449
 same I will see what an enemy shoots 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:34.270
 down there and I say I'm my god in this 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.240
 moment I am god came in and rac like me 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.199
 love to center the corners 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.750
 slipping away then I also saw people who 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.270
 I wanted him to have powers but they could not 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.770
 fly 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.840
 although to be fair and I was also 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.759
 very lost in the first days and here 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.990
 is that I laughed a lot five seconds 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.180
 then I'm not here pointing to the 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.220
 noventera nothing nothing I fall 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.919
 suddenly where it offers a dimension 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.669
 different I hope you liked it and 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.669
 until another
