00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.460
 my channel I am classic in 68 and 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.830
 welcome to this new video 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.380
 then guys get ready because this 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.080
 it is a bombshell in practice there is the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.530
 possibility to raise too much network in 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.360
 any 100 percent mission 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.640
 there is once these steps followed 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.800
 that I will list you guys should be 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.870
 You can find anything you 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.390
 at least want the exhibitions on creams or le 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.350
 moved 100 percent from this 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.210
 commission 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.980
 but let's start immediately with an explanation of what 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.760
 then make the basic requirements 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.700
 there are two the first is to own the deal yes 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.700
 3d dragon ball csen overs the second is 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.620
 to have as ex kyu shin teacher with 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.079
 which coming out the high once done 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.420
 that you must go and talk to ex caio 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.120
 sheen and to be sure that you are 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.820
 you must follow the steps correctly 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.670
 wait for ex kyu shin to tell you that 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.899
 boredom certainly peace a beautiful thing but it is 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.880
 of a deadly boredom 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.160
 let me tell you the future for 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.409
 pass the time this is a power that 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:21.090
 obtained thanks to the old one 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.909
 well what are you waiting sit down I see a 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.909
 huge tree and then I see a fruit 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.070
 golden you have a lot of luck you can't have any 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.420
 more than that because you don't face any 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.250
 parallel mission 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.409
 here are guys when he tells you this is 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.930
 that you have much luck is that you ca n't 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.600
 having more than that means that you have 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.670
 the one hundred percent drop so go 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.320
 immediately to do a parallel mission e 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.540
 see what you should find in the center 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.130
 percent what you are looking for 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.200
 obviously separated a pillow and not there 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.090
 will say this sentence just go to the counter 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.130
 of offline battles enter the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.380
 character selection exit e 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.090
 try to talk the same thing if 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.220
 a green question mark will succeed in 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.619
 head down that you go back to the desk 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.869
 Offline battles are successful entries 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.150
 and try to talk again so do guys 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.409
 until he just tells you that sentence 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.959
 see then has that phrase go 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.549
 immediately in the parallel mission and go 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.090
 to drop what you want there 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.670
 worry 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.140
 this method should be safe to 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.850
 hundred percent 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.440
 so guys I hope this video 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.810

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.420
