00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.670
 the fighters of the world council of 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.859
 wrestling meet tablecloths 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.380
 long since they have ten years to form 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.940
 part of the council and 80 from the first 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.740
 female duel in mexico no 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.770
 we miss the opportunity that we 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.630
 gave Mr. Paco Alonso to give these 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.359
 great battles inside the arena 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.880
 Mexico, I think we left the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.490
 soul in each in each battle we have 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.449
 strived the truth for keeping us 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.490
 in that place 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.859
 marcela is one of the best fighters 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.140
 Mexico techniques and has been the winner of 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.180
 important women's championships is what 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.120
 that has led her to commit to 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.940
 one hundred percent with this sport gives us 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.149
 the opportunity in the world council and 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.270
 a tournament is made to take the champion 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.239
 world female and good in this tournament 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.379
 managed to come out victorious along with giving 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.360
 angel and he took me in a heads up 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.469
 it is precisely in September it appears 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.469
 on September 16 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.170
 it's a very very interesting fight very 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.350
 important in my life and therefore achievement 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.420
 be crowned champion in that in that 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.590
 fight I really like wrestling and 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.840
 I love wrestling I dedicated more I've 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.470
 dedicated more time more to the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.470
 wrestling 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:30.090
 I have changed all my stages have been 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.090
 different I have changed as physically 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.900
 in my equipment models are different 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.810
 I have given and good apart in wrestling 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.230
 I have given the best I have traveled to 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.390
 many countries and I think that marcela 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.310
 matured a lot in this in this decade 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.560
 marcela show the whole experience 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.720
 that the years and the constant work 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.730
 have left then asserts that you have all 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.160
 the desire to continue preparing for 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.820
 give the best in the ring I've taken 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.430
 Many battles with young people and I feel 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.920
 that the experience that I have is that 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.440
 It has taken me forward, I go with 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.729
 everything and that's how my compañeras are 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.040
 tribal 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.349
 I always for myself always 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.230
 Rough techniques are always going to be rival 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.959
 I want to take that triumph to me 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.689
 house and good to show that marcela is still 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.390
 standing up and still there and then prove that 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:31.140
 I still have quality with information from 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.140
