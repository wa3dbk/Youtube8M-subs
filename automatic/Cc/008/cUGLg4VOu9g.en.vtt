there<00:00:55.320> how<00:00:55.980> these<00:00:56.129> are<00:00:56.370> done<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.820> use<00:00:57.210> my<00:00:57.390> bone

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
there how these are done I use my bone

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.319 
there how these are done I use my bone
folder<00:00:57.989> rather<00:00:58.410> than<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.800> pair<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.039> scissors

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
folder rather than a pair of scissors

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.429 
folder rather than a pair of scissors
because<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.899> actually<00:01:01.140> helps<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.899> not<00:01:03.899> cut

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
because it actually helps you to not cut

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.660 
because it actually helps you to not cut
your<00:01:05.180> petals<00:01:06.180> there<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.560> back<00:01:07.770> part<00:01:08.159> was

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
your petals there so the back part was

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.410 
your petals there so the back part was
all<00:01:09.470> formed<00:01:10.470> down<00:01:11.130> by<00:01:11.490> curling<00:01:11.939> them<00:01:12.150> down

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
all formed down by curling them down

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.660 
all formed down by curling them down
like<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> top<00:01:14.310> portion

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
like this and then the top portion

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.929 
like this and then the top portion
because<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.240> cut<00:01:15.450> two<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.750> them<00:01:15.990> was<00:01:16.950> twisted

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
because we cut two of them was twisted

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.770 
because we cut two of them was twisted
to<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.240> right<00:01:19.250> pulled<00:01:20.250> up<00:01:20.580> twisted<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
to the right pulled up twisted to the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.350 
to the right pulled up twisted to the
left<00:01:22.140> those<00:01:22.979> kinds<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.490> things<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.030> made<00:01:24.180> it

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
left those kinds of things so it made it

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.399 
left those kinds of things so it made it
kind<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.920> kind<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.070> naturally<00:01:26.640> why

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
kind of kind of a naturally why

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.280 
kind of kind of a naturally why
wild-looking<00:01:28.409> Daisy<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.909> little<00:01:30.210> one<00:01:30.420> which

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
wild-looking Daisy the little one which

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.859 
wild-looking Daisy the little one which
we<00:01:31.500> use<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> center<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.670> smaller<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.240> we

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
we use for the center the smaller one we

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.219 
we use for the center the smaller one we
just<00:01:34.170> curved<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.759> around<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.540> then

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
just curved up like this around and then

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.109 
just curved up like this around and then
even<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.740> held<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.280> your<00:01:38.340> hand<00:01:38.460> and

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
even if you held it in your hand and

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.749 
even if you held it in your hand and
then<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.840> did<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.799> center<00:01:41.070> portion<00:01:41.430> like

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
then just did the center portion like

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.639 
then just did the center portion like
this<00:01:41.820> you'll<00:01:42.210> find<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.810> curls<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.409> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
this you'll find that it curls up and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.660 
this you'll find that it curls up and
then<00:01:44.610> what<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.180> did<00:01:45.479> once<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:46.590> attach<00:01:47.009> them<00:01:47.399> is

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
then what we did once we attach them is

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.010 
then what we did once we attach them is
we<00:01:48.570> put<00:01:48.869> little<00:01:49.409> bling<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.490> center

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
we put little bling in the center

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.960 
we put little bling in the center
alrighty<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.920> back<00:01:53.189> portion<00:01:53.490> how<00:01:53.820> is

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
alrighty so this back portion how is

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.270 
alrighty so this back portion how is
this<00:01:54.149> made<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:55.020> card<00:01:55.290> itself<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.829> actually<00:01:56.009> a

sections to it it kind of just goes like

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.300 
sections to it it kind of just goes like
this<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.690> then<00:02:19.840> goes<00:02:19.960> down<00:02:19.990> around<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.710> loops

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
this and then goes down around and loops

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.150 
this and then goes down around and loops
up<00:02:21.580> down<00:02:22.120> around<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.690> loops<00:02:22.960> up<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:24.130> I

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
up down around and loops up and so I

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.610 
up down around and loops up and so I
took<00:02:24.460> at<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.610> part<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.150> came<00:02:25.390> down<00:02:26.230> in<00:02:26.590> the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
took at the part that came down in the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.850 
took at the part that came down in the
loose<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.760> furthest<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:29.170> cut<00:02:29.410> them<00:02:29.590> as<00:02:29.800> a

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
loose the furthest and I cut them as a

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.640 
loose the furthest and I cut them as a
ribbon<00:02:30.490> cut<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.270> it's<00:02:31.480> flush<00:02:31.780> across<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.410> top

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
ribbon cut so it's flush across the top

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.490 
ribbon cut so it's flush across the top
but<00:02:32.890> yet<00:02:33.490> has<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.790> ribbon<00:02:34.150> type<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.170> edge

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
but yet has a ribbon type of the edge

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.250 
but yet has a ribbon type of the edge
here<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.910> scrolling<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.750> just<00:02:37.990> kind<00:02:38.170> of

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
here and the scrolling I just kind of

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.170 
here and the scrolling I just kind of
centered<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.740> so<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.100> heart<00:02:39.340> was<00:02:39.610> in<00:02:39.940> the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
centered it so the heart was in the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.270 
centered it so the heart was in the
different<00:02:40.510> parts<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.930> scrolling<00:02:41.410> at<00:02:41.980> the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
end of each one of the ribbon but not at

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.060

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
between I found that if you do the two

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.790 
between I found that if you do the two
outer<00:03:37.209> edges<00:03:37.480> sorry<00:03:38.140> again<00:03:38.320> I'm<00:03:38.650> out<00:03:38.770> of

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
outer edges sorry again I'm out of

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.850 
outer edges sorry again I'm out of
camera<00:03:39.310> two<00:03:40.090> outer<00:03:40.390> edges<00:03:40.690> first<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.560> then

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
camera two outer edges first and then

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.009 
camera two outer edges first and then
centered<00:03:42.400> your<00:03:42.610> your<00:03:43.030> middle<00:03:43.239> one<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.720> just

centered your your middle one it just
makes<00:03:44.560> your<00:03:44.739> spacing<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.400> lot<00:03:45.580> easier<00:03:46.030> than

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
makes your spacing a lot easier than

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.590 
makes your spacing a lot easier than
trying<00:03:46.300> to<00:03:46.780> do<00:03:46.930> one<00:03:47.170> two<00:03:47.410> three<00:03:47.800> so<00:03:48.489> do<00:03:49.480> the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
trying to do one two three so do the

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.330 
trying to do one two three so do the
outside<00:03:49.959> edge<00:03:50.110> and<00:03:50.140> your<00:03:50.560> Center<00:03:50.890> ones<00:03:51.070> will

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
outside edge and your Center ones will

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.940 
outside edge and your Center ones will
space<00:03:51.610> for<00:03:52.269> you<00:03:52.420> just<00:03:52.690> kind<00:03:52.989> of<00:03:53.080> you<00:03:53.769> can

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
space for you just kind of you can

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.890 
space for you just kind of you can
eyeball<00:03:54.070> it<00:03:54.370> or<00:03:54.730> if<00:03:54.880> you<00:03:55.000> want<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.239> be<00:03:55.420> a<00:03:55.690> little

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
eyeball it or if you want to be a little

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.620 
eyeball it or if you want to be a little
bit<00:03:56.080> more<00:03:56.380> precise<00:03:57.280> than<00:03:57.610> just<00:03:57.880> use<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.090> ruler

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
bit more precise than just use a ruler

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.500 
bit more precise than just use a ruler
and<00:03:58.870> just<00:03:59.560> look<00:04:00.100> at<00:04:00.220> how<00:04:00.400> many<00:04:00.459> centimeters<00:04:01.180> or

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
and just look at how many centimeters or

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.530 
and just look at how many centimeters or
inches<00:04:01.540> would<00:04:02.200> be<00:04:02.350> between<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.800> two<00:04:03.540> that's

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
inches would be between the two that's

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.350 
inches would be between the two that's
it<00:04:04.720> for<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.019> card<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.769> I<00:04:06.580> thought<00:04:07.180> it<00:04:07.269> was

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
it for that card and I thought it was

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.479 
it for that card and I thought it was
very<00:04:07.390> nice<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:08.080> lot<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:08.709> times<00:04:08.920> you<00:04:09.070> see<00:04:09.250> white

and<00:04:09.519> white<00:04:09.820> for<00:04:10.090> weddings<00:04:10.420> why<00:04:10.989> not<00:04:11.230> use<00:04:11.470> white

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
and white for weddings why not use white

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.460 
and white for weddings why not use white
on<00:04:12.010> white<00:04:12.280> for<00:04:12.730> anniversaries<00:04:13.660> or<00:04:13.900> even<00:04:14.380> a
