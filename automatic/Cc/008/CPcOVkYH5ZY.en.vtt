new<00:00:41.219> mic<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.610> let<00:00:41.760> me<00:00:41.879> know<00:00:42.030> how<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.450> works<00:00:43.010> I'm

thinking<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.789> might<00:00:45.050> be<00:00:46.050> better<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:46.590> not<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
thinking it might be better if not it

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.220 
thinking it might be better if not it
was<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> waste<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.090> money<00:00:48.149> but<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:49.020> seems

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
was a waste of money but it it seems

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.660 
was a waste of money but it it seems
like<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.410> might<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.590> better<00:00:49.860> let<00:00:50.399> me<00:00:50.430> know<00:00:50.520> in

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
like it might be better let me know in

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.299 
like it might be better let me know in
the<00:00:50.730> comments<00:00:51.120> about<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:53.129> this

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.549 
the comments about that but for this
commentary<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.390> want<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.660> talk<00:00:54.809> about<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.289> lag

about why the game started to lag
magically<00:03:25.890> out<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.160> nowhere<00:03:26.340> there<00:03:26.730> wasn't

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
magically out of nowhere there wasn't

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.090 
magically out of nowhere there wasn't
any<00:03:27.120> patch<00:03:27.390> updates<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.050> changed<00:03:28.470> it<00:03:28.650> they

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
any patch updates that changed it they

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.370 
any patch updates that changed it they
didn't<00:03:29.370> try<00:03:29.550> and<00:03:29.670> fix<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.060> lag<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.630> then<00:03:30.900> they

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
didn't try and fix the lag and then they

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.979 
didn't try and fix the lag and then they
magically<00:03:31.950> just<00:03:32.220> started<00:03:32.580> going<00:03:32.790> bad<00:03:33.060> it's

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
magically just started going bad it's

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.680 
magically just started going bad it's

so<00:05:47.910> that's<00:05:48.910> the<00:05:49.180> problem<00:05:49.450> now<00:05:49.870> people<00:05:50.620> with

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
so that's the problem now people with

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.880 
so that's the problem now people with
normal<00:05:50.980> connections<00:05:51.670> are<00:05:51.850> searching<00:05:52.860> to<00:05:53.860> find

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
normal connections are searching to find

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.590 
normal connections are searching to find
games<00:05:54.550> with<00:05:54.790> people<00:05:55.120> with<00:05:55.210> the<00:05:55.330> best

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
games with people with the best

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.130 
games with people with the best
connection<00:05:56.550> so<00:05:57.550> people<00:05:57.850> like<00:05:58.030> woody<00:05:58.870> who

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
connection so people like woody who

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.810 
connection so people like woody who
probably<00:05:59.410> pays<00:05:59.740> a<00:05:59.770> lot<00:06:00.160> for<00:06:00.400> his<00:06:00.490> internet

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
probably pays a lot for his internet

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.090 
probably pays a lot for his internet
probably<00:06:01.180> has<00:06:01.270> fiber<00:06:01.540> optic<00:06:02.020> or<00:06:02.320> cable<00:06:02.980> with

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
probably has fiber optic or cable with

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.740 
probably has fiber optic or cable with
the<00:06:03.130> high<00:06:03.370> upload<00:06:03.760> speed<00:06:04.000> so<00:06:04.090> it<00:06:04.150> can<00:06:04.300> upload

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
the high upload speed so it can upload

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.680 
the high upload speed so it can upload
his<00:06:04.900> videos<00:06:05.290> route<00:06:05.530> really<00:06:06.190> quick<00:06:06.460> or<00:06:06.940> getting

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
his videos route really quick or getting

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.860 
his videos route really quick or getting
lag<00:06:08.190> compensated<00:06:09.190> you<00:06:09.520> can<00:06:09.700> say<00:06:09.970> but<00:06:10.720> it's

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
lag compensated you can say but it's

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.480 
lag compensated you can say but it's
really<00:06:11.080> people<00:06:11.620> with<00:06:11.710> the<00:06:11.800> other<00:06:11.980> connection

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
really people with the other connection

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.610 
really people with the other connection
now<00:06:12.640> bring<00:06:12.910> them<00:06:13.090> down<00:06:13.300> a<00:06:13.330> little<00:06:13.600> bit<00:06:13.780> so<00:06:14.380> like

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
now bring them down a little bit so like

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.430 
now bring them down a little bit so like
me<00:06:14.830> I<00:06:15.010> have<00:06:15.400> a<00:06:15.700> five<00:06:16.060> or<00:06:16.090> six<00:06:16.510> upload<00:06:16.900> speed<00:06:17.230> and

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
me I have a five or six upload speed and

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.830 
me I have a five or six upload speed and
cable<00:06:17.890> internet<00:06:18.130> so<00:06:18.850> that<00:06:18.880> would<00:06:19.240> that

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
cable internet so that would that

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.530 
cable internet so that would that
qualifies<00:06:20.680> me<00:06:20.710> for<00:06:20.920> like<00:06:21.280> the<00:06:21.520> top<00:06:21.760> 10%<00:06:22.060> of<00:06:22.420> the

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
qualifies me for like the top 10% of the

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.880 
qualifies me for like the top 10% of the
United<00:06:22.900> States<00:06:22.930> of<00:06:23.700> internet<00:06:24.700> speed<00:06:25.650> so<00:06:26.650> it

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
United States of internet speed so it

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.160 
United States of internet speed so it
would<00:06:27.520> make<00:06:27.550> sense<00:06:27.730> for<00:06:28.060> me<00:06:28.300> to<00:06:28.330> become<00:06:28.720> you

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.170 
would make sense for me to become you

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.130

the difference in the speeds which is

making it so hard for people to enjoy

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.140 
making it so hard for people to enjoy
the<00:07:23.200> game<00:07:23.380> because<00:07:23.740> it's<00:07:23.890> lagging<00:07:24.190> it's<00:07:24.610> it's

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.150 
the game because it's lagging it's it's

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.910 
the game because it's lagging it's it's
not<00:07:25.390> the<00:07:25.570> same<00:07:25.810> connection<00:07:26.410> do<00:07:26.560> you<00:07:26.650> want<00:07:26.830> to

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:26.920 
not the same connection do you want to

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.970 
not the same connection do you want to
be<00:07:27.040> in<00:07:27.130> the<00:07:27.250> same<00:07:27.460> connection<00:07:28.090> type<00:07:28.300> and

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:28.980 
be in the same connection type and

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.390 
be in the same connection type and
that's<00:07:29.980> why<00:07:30.960> there<00:07:31.960> has<00:07:32.170> been<00:07:32.200> that<00:07:32.800> lag<00:07:33.100> and

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 
that's why there has been that lag and

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.580 
that's why there has been that lag and
