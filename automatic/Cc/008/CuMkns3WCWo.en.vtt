and to discuss as I'm going
through<00:02:10.439> the<00:02:11.340> video

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.460 

at<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.220> point<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.760> getting<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.840> elastics

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
at the point of getting the elastics

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.580 
at the point of getting the elastics
actually<00:02:17.070> put<00:02:17.340> on<00:02:17.550> they<00:02:17.850> normally<00:02:18.380> do<00:02:19.380> it

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
actually put on they normally do it

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.160 
actually put on they normally do it
towards<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.580> end<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:21.060> your<00:02:21.150> treatment<00:02:21.420> so

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
towards the end of your treatment so

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.620 
towards the end of your treatment so
when<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:22.980> get<00:02:23.190> these<00:02:23.340> elastic<00:02:23.940> bands<00:02:24.210> you

when you get these elastic bands you

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.850 
when you get these elastic bands you
will<00:02:24.810> know<00:02:25.490> when<00:02:26.490> your<00:02:27.300> braces<00:02:28.170> should<00:02:28.710> be

will know when your braces should be

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.340 
will know when your braces should be
coming<00:02:29.220> off<00:02:29.370> which<00:02:29.640> would<00:02:29.820> be<00:02:30.060> very<00:02:30.480> very<00:02:30.990> soon

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
coming off which would be very very soon

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.860 
coming off which would be very very soon
basically<00:02:34.350> what<00:02:34.590> they<00:02:34.890> are<00:02:34.920> for<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:36.000> they

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
basically what they are for is that they

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.300 
basically what they are for is that they
help<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.800> with<00:02:38.070> any<00:02:39.050> open<00:02:40.050> bytes<00:02:40.590> or<00:02:40.860> if<00:02:41.010> your

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
jaw is slightly crossed or something

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.920 
jaw is slightly crossed or something
like<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.250> just<00:02:44.610> fixes<00:02:45.180> your<00:02:45.390> overall

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930

putting<00:02:49.400> them<00:02:49.550> in<00:02:49.760> is<00:02:50.390> pretty

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
putting them in is pretty

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.010 
putting them in is pretty
straightforward<00:02:51.560> but<00:02:52.520> if<00:02:52.820> you<00:02:53.390> first<00:02:53.780> get

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
straightforward but if you first get

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.070 
straightforward but if you first get
them<00:02:54.260> on<00:02:54.470> is<00:02:54.680> pretty<00:02:55.070> difficult<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:56.090> what

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
them on is pretty difficult and what

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.490

put them in when I go to bed put them in

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.310

any time where I'm not being social and

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.750 
any time where I'm not being social and
if<00:04:38.320> I'm<00:04:38.530> talking<00:04:38.800> they're<00:04:39.250> more<00:04:39.430> likely<00:04:39.610> to

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
if I'm talking they're more likely to

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.240 
if I'm talking they're more likely to
snap<00:04:40.210> I've<00:04:40.630> had<00:04:40.870> numerous<00:04:41.350> occasions<00:04:41.919> where

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
snap I've had numerous occasions where

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.300 
snap I've had numerous occasions where
they<00:04:42.370> have<00:04:42.550> snapped<00:04:42.970> so<00:04:43.960> just<00:04:44.350> be<00:04:44.470> careful<00:04:44.650> but

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
they have snapped so just be careful but

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.610 
they have snapped so just be careful but
you<00:04:45.340> often<00:04:45.580> Dante<00:04:46.030> should<00:04:46.330> tell<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:46.870> when<00:04:47.320> and

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
you often Dante should tell you when and

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.120 
you often Dante should tell you when and
how<00:04:48.010> and<00:04:48.400> what<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:50.020> need<00:04:50.169> to<00:04:50.320> do<00:04:50.470> with<00:04:50.860> your

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
how and what you need to do with your

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.780 
how and what you need to do with your
elastic

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.580 

obviously<00:04:54.790> it's<00:04:55.030> completely<00:04:55.690> up<00:04:55.900> to<00:04:55.930> your

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
obviously it's completely up to your

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.280 
obviously it's completely up to your
orthodontist<00:04:57.370> how<00:04:57.940> long<00:04:58.180> you<00:04:58.840> have<00:04:59.050> to<00:04:59.080> wear

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
orthodontist how long you have to wear

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.040 
orthodontist how long you have to wear
them<00:04:59.500> for<00:04:59.530> and<00:05:00.070> as<00:05:00.310> I<00:05:00.430> said<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:01.330> orthodontist

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
them for and as I said the orthodontist

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.740 
them for and as I said the orthodontist
likely<00:05:02.470> gives<00:05:02.680> you<00:05:02.830> them<00:05:03.070> just<00:05:03.820> before<00:05:04.480> you

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
likely gives you them just before you

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.240 
likely gives you them just before you
have<00:05:04.900> your<00:05:04.930> braces<00:05:05.440> taken<00:05:05.620> off

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
have your braces taken off

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.680 
have your braces taken off
you<00:05:06.370> should<00:05:06.550> be<00:05:06.670> happy<00:05:06.970> when<00:05:07.240> you<00:05:07.390> get<00:05:07.480> yeah

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
you should be happy when you get yeah

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.110 
you should be happy when you get yeah
two<00:05:07.780> elastics<00:05:08.620> that<00:05:09.040> you're<00:05:09.820> going<00:05:09.970> to<00:05:10.000> have

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
two elastics that you're going to have

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.330 
two elastics that you're going to have
your<00:05:10.330> braces<00:05:10.750> off<00:05:10.900> pretty<00:05:11.200> soon<00:05:11.350> I've

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
your braces off pretty soon I've

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.640 
your braces off pretty soon I've
basically<00:05:12.790> had<00:05:13.240> lying<00:05:13.540> on<00:05:13.780> for<00:05:14.140> a<00:05:14.170> couple<00:05:14.380> of

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
basically had lying on for a couple of

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.560 
basically had lying on for a couple of
years<00:05:14.830> now<00:05:14.950> so<00:05:15.430> I'm<00:05:15.520> pretty<00:05:15.760> excited<00:05:16.240> about

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
years now so I'm pretty excited about

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.830 
years now so I'm pretty excited about
that<00:05:17.550> there's<00:05:18.550> really<00:05:18.790> nothing<00:05:19.420> you<00:05:19.630> can

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
that there's really nothing you can

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.170 
that there's really nothing you can
really<00:05:19.870> do<00:05:20.530> about<00:05:21.250> the<00:05:21.400> pain<00:05:22.140> honestly<00:05:23.140> I

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
really do about the pain honestly I

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.280 
really do about the pain honestly I
suggest<00:05:25.180> if<00:05:25.540> you're<00:05:25.720> not<00:05:25.870> really<00:05:26.050> good<00:05:26.140> for

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.590 
suggest if you're not really good for
pain<00:05:26.740> but<00:05:27.010> you<00:05:27.130> probably<00:05:27.610> should<00:05:28.000> be<00:05:28.180> so<00:05:28.480> the

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
pain but you probably should be so the

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.540 
pain but you probably should be so the
pain<00:05:28.810> now<00:05:29.050> if<00:05:29.230> you've<00:05:29.380> had<00:05:29.590> braces<00:05:29.830> for<00:05:30.160> Zula

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
pain now if you've had braces for Zula

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.680

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
and just take Parsi amal if they really

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.230 
and just take Parsi amal if they really
get<00:05:34.900> really<00:05:35.470> really<00:05:35.890> painful<00:05:36.280> then<00:05:36.940> i'll<00:05:37.180> just

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
get really really painful then i'll just

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.030 
get really really painful then i'll just
suggest<00:05:37.870> take<00:05:38.050> them<00:05:38.230> out<00:05:38.440> for<00:05:38.650> a<00:05:38.710> couple<00:05:38.980> of

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
again and obviously because if they're

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.140 
again and obviously because if they're
giving<00:05:44.920> you<00:05:45.040> pain<00:05:45.310> you<00:05:45.610> don't<00:05:45.790> want<00:05:45.970> to<00:05:46.030> be

not<00:06:06.280> likely<00:06:06.490> to<00:06:06.790> snap<00:06:07.060> because<00:06:07.390> you're<00:06:07.660> not

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
not likely to snap because you're not

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.750 
not likely to snap because you're not
putting<00:06:07.990> that<00:06:08.110> much<00:06:08.470> tension<00:06:08.800> on<00:06:09.070> them<00:06:09.340> but<00:06:09.580> if

to get in the way pretty quickly and

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.700 
to get in the way pretty quickly and
