00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
riff is fairly straightforward in terms

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.490 
riff is fairly straightforward in terms
of<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.640> rhythm<00:00:48.570> once<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.079> get<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> rhythm

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500

the palm mute to that if you want to get

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.890 
the palm mute to that if you want to get
some<00:02:51.920> songs<00:02:52.430> you've<00:02:52.700> got

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.910 

there<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.319> go<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:59.730> you<00:03:00.299> play<00:03:00.599> that<00:03:01.019> twice<00:03:01.500> so

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
there you go so you play that twice so

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:12.500 
there you go so you play that twice so
you've<00:03:02.129> got<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:11.069> experts<00:03:11.400> slightly<00:03:11.939> trickier

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
you've got the experts slightly trickier

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.759 
you've got the experts slightly trickier
so<00:03:12.900> you're<00:03:13.019> going<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.170> have<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.409> get<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.620> hang

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
so you're going to have to get the hang

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.339 
so you're going to have to get the hang
of<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.579> basically<00:03:14.760> exactly<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.989> same<00:03:16.200> as

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
of it it's basically exactly the same as

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.380 
of it it's basically exactly the same as
you<00:03:16.439> did<00:03:16.560> before<00:03:16.939> except<00:03:17.939> instead<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.209> playing

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
you did before except instead of playing

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.449 
you did before except instead of playing
an<00:03:18.540> open<00:03:18.959> string<00:03:19.170> for<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:19.980> second<00:03:20.250> string

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
an open string for the second string

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.300 
an open string for the second string

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
you're going to play the ninth fret now

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.990 
you're going to play the ninth fret now
I've<00:03:23.670> seen<00:03:24.359> how<00:03:25.290> it's<00:03:25.799> done<00:03:26.040> I've<00:03:26.400> seen<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.700> live

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
I've seen how it's done I've seen a live

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.160 
I've seen how it's done I've seen a live
lounge<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.510> videos<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.109> he<00:03:29.099> basically<00:03:29.340> just

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
lounge of videos and he basically just

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.690 
lounge of videos and he basically just
keep<00:03:31.170> switching<00:03:31.560> his<00:03:31.829> fingers<00:03:32.220> back<00:03:32.489> onto

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
this night fret and I found this

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.309 
this night fret and I found this
whatever<00:03:35.040> finger<00:03:35.639> is<00:03:36.239> easiest<00:03:36.659> for<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.049> so<00:03:37.260> at

easiest to start with so so you playing
this<00:03:41.819> knife<00:03:43.310> one<00:03:44.310> second<00:03:44.670> string<00:03:44.909> so<00:03:45.150> first

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
this knife one second string so first

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.770 
this knife one second string so first
time<00:03:45.870> first<00:03:46.319> you've<00:03:46.530> time<00:03:46.739> through<00:03:46.950> its<00:03:47.099> open

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
time first you've time through its open

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.640 
time first you've time through its open
in<00:03:48.780> Psych<00:03:49.079> film<00:03:49.409> a<00:03:49.620> third<00:03:49.829> time<00:03:50.040> through<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:51.650> so

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
in Psych film a third time through is so

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:04.430 
in Psych film a third time through is so
you<00:03:52.769> got<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:55.010> knife<00:03:56.010> again<00:04:03.019> so<00:04:04.019> you<00:04:04.079> can<00:04:04.169> see<00:04:04.319> the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
you got a knife again so you can see the

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.140 
you got a knife again so you can see the
third<00:04:04.650> string<00:04:04.919> the<00:04:05.190> pattern<00:04:05.519> is<00:04:05.639> exactly<00:04:06.000> the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
third string the pattern is exactly the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.270 
third string the pattern is exactly the
same<00:04:06.359> now<00:04:06.959> things<00:04:07.290> exactly<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.739> same<00:04:08.010> in

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
same now things exactly the same in

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.409 
same now things exactly the same in
terms<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:09.209> how<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.840> melody<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.769> going<00:04:11.419> but

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
terms of how the melody is going but

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.629 
terms of how the melody is going but
you're<00:04:12.720> just<00:04:13.109> playing<00:04:13.620> this<00:04:13.799> night<00:04:14.040> fret<00:04:14.400> so

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
you're just playing this night fret so

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.539 
you're just playing this night fret so
you've<00:04:14.790> got<00:04:14.819> and<00:04:15.449> this<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:16.079> found<00:04:17.039> it's<00:04:17.310> easier

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
you've got and this I found it's easier

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.279 
you've got and this I found it's easier
to<00:04:17.699> start<00:04:18.060> practicing<00:04:18.209> slowly<00:04:18.780> for<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:19.139> one

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
to start practicing slowly for that one

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.779 
to start practicing slowly for that one
because<00:04:19.500> it's<00:04:19.709> quite<00:04:19.889> tricky<00:04:20.039> figuring<00:04:20.729> out

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
because it's quite tricky figuring out

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.399 
because it's quite tricky figuring out
what<00:04:20.940> fingers<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.479> use<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.870> play<00:04:22.019> this<00:04:22.199> note

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
what fingers to use to play this note

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:31.379 
what fingers to use to play this note
frets

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.459 

just<00:04:32.389> keep<00:04:32.599> playing<00:04:32.810> that<00:04:32.960> over<00:04:33.319> and<00:04:33.439> over

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:33.469 
just keep playing that over and over

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:40.929 
just keep playing that over and over
until<00:04:33.680> you<00:04:33.889> get<00:04:38.889> so<00:04:39.889> so<00:04:40.189> far<00:04:40.430> you've<00:04:40.580> got<00:04:40.789> this

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:40.939 
until you get so so far you've got this

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:51.909 
until you get so so far you've got this
run-through<00:04:45.819> then<00:04:46.819> again<00:04:50.439> so<00:04:51.439> that's<00:04:51.620> I<00:04:51.710> open
