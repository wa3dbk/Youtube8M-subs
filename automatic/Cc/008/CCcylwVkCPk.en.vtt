 the staff only when they are doing tests in the sea 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.820
 I have many 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.400
 german passat 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.210
 to 99 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.210
 He ended up feeling good. 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:28.069
 and I have noticed that the changes 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.839
 Let's think that this 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.720
 in river experience 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.440
 to perceive 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.190
 in one of them 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.860
 remains the same 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.860
 but sometimes without realizing it 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.720
 you expect a much faster response in nothing else 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.720
 the gear shift 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.880
 a vote 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.680
 consume faster 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.230
 contacted by the pellet 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.409
 finally the slow quotation 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.409
 however the same thing 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.260
 according to Ana Miranda 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
 in 2010 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.010
 perhaps because the small 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.180
 it's sacred 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.620
 remembering that the function justified 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.630
 it is not what was the module that sends us a new signal 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.830
 How everything will improve 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.830
 calm people enjoyment modality 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.990
 aiming at the improvement of the steering system 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.530
 changes a little time said saints generating a saving of 12 15% that went into 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.400
 force 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.390
 the performance of the cigarette engine plus opportunity 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.070
 it already passes shows a car performance in the points and try a point the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.190
 two months, even listening, I do not want this car anymore if I'm going to make a 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.170
 test 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.170
 it may even be that the experiment was approved at the beginning 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.790
 It's about emotion, anything like that. 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.790
 here comes our advancement site or phones
