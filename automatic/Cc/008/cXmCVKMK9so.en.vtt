the<00:04:39.560> console<00:04:40.009> gauges<00:04:40.220> which<00:04:40.550> I<00:04:40.699> love<00:04:40.940> and<00:04:41.240> we

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
the console gauges which I love and we

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330 
the console gauges which I love and we
do<00:04:41.449> have<00:04:41.570> an<00:04:41.690> original<00:04:41.840> style<00:04:42.199> am/fm<00:04:42.830> radio<00:04:43.130> or

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
AM radio that I would typically put in a

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.399

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:50.350 
dash this is a replica of that radio an
upgraded<00:04:48.949> unit<00:04:49.280> but<00:04:49.669> I<00:04:49.729> would<00:04:49.909> probably<00:04:50.000> do<00:04:50.240> is

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
upgraded unit but I would probably do is

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.909

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
just put the stock radio in the dash and

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.409 
just put the stock radio in the dash and

then move that to the glove box this way

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.409 
then move that to the glove box this way
the<00:04:53.539> interior<00:04:53.930> look<00:04:54.440> totally<00:04:54.680> stock<00:04:55.099> got<00:04:55.880> 120
