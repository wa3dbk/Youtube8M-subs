this<00:00:00.210> particular<00:00:00.599> radar<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.410> from<00:00:01.560> the

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
this particular radar the from the

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.120 
this particular radar the from the
danger<00:00:02.100> area<00:00:02.220> it's<00:00:02.580> running<00:00:02.939> that<00:00:03.090> far<00:00:03.419> away

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.130 
danger area it's running that far away

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.340 
danger area it's running that far away
they<00:00:05.130> still<00:00:05.430> recommend<00:00:06.089> that<00:00:06.870> you<00:00:07.080> don't

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
they still recommend that you don't

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.180 
they still recommend that you don't
stare<00:00:08.189> at<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.460> when<00:00:08.790> it's<00:00:08.910> on<00:00:09.059> yep

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
stare at it when it's on yep

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.330 
stare at it when it's on yep
put<00:00:11.190> your<00:00:11.370> eyes<00:00:11.750> arrival<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:14.099> don't

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
put your eyes arrival and it you don't

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.580 
put your eyes arrival and it you don't
have<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.759> operating<00:00:15.269> if<00:00:15.990> anyone<00:00:16.440> is

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
have it operating if anyone is

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.519 
have it operating if anyone is
particularly<00:00:16.980> close<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:18.050> we're<00:00:19.050> happy<00:00:19.410> as

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
particularly close to we're happy as

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.070 
particularly close to we're happy as
long<00:00:19.680> as<00:00:19.800> our<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.100> six<00:00:20.539> okay<00:00:21.539> we're<00:00:21.750> happy

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
long as our in the six okay we're happy

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.920 
long as our in the six okay we're happy
if<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:22.680> standing<00:00:23.039> up<00:00:23.160> let's<00:00:23.609> go<00:00:23.850> no<00:00:24.660> one<00:00:24.840> on

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
if it's standing up let's go no one on

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.370 
if it's standing up let's go no one on
the<00:00:25.019> engine<00:00:25.289> cover<00:00:26.090> so<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.869> radar<00:00:28.230> on

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
the engine cover so with the radar on

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.250 
the engine cover so with the radar on
this<00:00:28.500> particular<00:00:28.830> hope<00:00:29.220> with<00:00:29.490> heading<00:00:30.260> we're

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
this particular hope with heading we're

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260 
this particular hope with heading we're
pointing<00:00:31.619> roughing<00:00:32.099> each<00:00:32.309> time<00:00:32.610> yeah<00:00:32.910> exactly

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
pointing roughing each time yeah exactly

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.030 
pointing roughing each time yeah exactly
this<00:00:33.690> doesn't<00:00:34.050> happens<00:00:34.440> turn<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.489> radar<00:00:35.910> on

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
this doesn't happens turn the radar on

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.040 
this doesn't happens turn the radar on
hit<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.129> power<00:00:38.309> button<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.300> start<00:00:39.629> radar

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
hit the power button and you start radar

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.630 
hit the power button and you start radar
TX<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.680> stands<00:00:40.980> for<00:00:41.250> transmit<00:00:43.280> hey<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.460> guys

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
TX that stands for transmit hey you guys

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.639 
TX that stands for transmit hey you guys
either<00:00:44.820> stand<00:00:45.149> by<00:00:45.329> first<00:00:45.629> because<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.469> like

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
either stand by first because it's like

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.090 
either stand by first because it's like
a<00:00:47.100> radio<00:00:48.140> transmitter<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.379> needs<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.710> warm<00:00:49.920> up

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
a radio transmitter it needs to warm up

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.610 
a radio transmitter it needs to warm up
a<00:00:50.250> little<00:00:50.370> bit<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.420> then<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:52.199> will<00:00:52.350> start

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
a little bit and then it will start

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.590 
a little bit and then it will start
working<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.250> started<00:00:53.610> doing<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.329> on

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
working we can started doing that and on

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.240 
working we can started doing that and on
this<00:00:54.719> particular<00:00:55.079> one<00:00:55.379> here<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:55.739> we've<00:00:55.890> got

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
this particular one here what we've got

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.849 
this particular one here what we've got
is<00:00:56.399> we've<00:00:56.430> got<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.789> set<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.379> radar

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
is we've got it set up so that the radar

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.130 
is we've got it set up so that the radar
plot<00:00:59.070> overlays<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> chart<00:01:00.510> yeah<00:01:01.020> it's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
plot overlays on the chart yeah it's

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.389 
plot overlays on the chart yeah it's
just<00:01:01.199> quite<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> useful<00:01:01.680> way<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:01.980> explaining

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
just quite a useful way of explaining

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.399 
just quite a useful way of explaining
how<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.730> works<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.149> what<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.390> for<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> radar

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
how it works so what this for the radar

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.800 
how it works so what this for the radar
is<00:01:04.500> doing<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.189> actually<00:01:05.280> picking<00:01:05.700> up<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
is doing is it's actually picking up the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.390 
is doing is it's actually picking up the
coastal<00:01:08.119> there<00:01:09.799> what's<00:01:10.799> what<00:01:11.010> well<00:01:11.189> because

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
coastal there what's what well because

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.539 
coastal there what's what well because
it's<00:01:11.549> flat<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.060> hard<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:13.400> just<00:01:14.400> like

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
it's flat and it's hard and just like

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.160 
it's flat and it's hard and just like
light<00:01:14.729> reflects<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.330> bit<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> radio<00:01:15.900> waves

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
light reflects a bit the radio waves

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.210 
light reflects a bit the radio waves
reflect<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:17.240> what<00:01:18.240> radar<00:01:18.960> isn't<00:01:19.229> very<00:01:19.770> good<00:01:20.040> at

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
reflect on what radar isn't very good at

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.789 
reflect on what radar isn't very good at
is<00:01:20.820> reflecting<00:01:21.390> off<00:01:21.509> curved<00:01:21.840> surfaces<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
is reflecting off curved surfaces so you

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.140 
is reflecting off curved surfaces so you
take<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.549> fault

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
take the fault

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.860 
take the fault
ahead<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> us<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.890> zoom<00:01:26.159> out

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.990 

where<00:01:30.500> we<00:01:30.620> can<00:01:30.770> see<00:01:31.010> where<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.550> land<00:01:31.760> is

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.080 

and<00:01:36.160> we're<00:01:37.160> not<00:01:37.280> doing<00:01:37.580> particularly<00:01:37.970> well

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
and we're not doing particularly well

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.030 
and we're not doing particularly well
with<00:01:38.300> where<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.840> fort<00:01:39.110> is<00:01:41.500> we<00:01:42.500> are<00:01:42.620> picking<00:01:42.920> up

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
with where the fort is we are picking up

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.550 
with where the fort is we are picking up
law<00:01:43.340> Sturbridge<00:01:43.850> there's<00:01:44.480> a<00:01:44.600> radar<00:01:45.020> reflector

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
law Sturbridge there's a radar reflector

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.290 
law Sturbridge there's a radar reflector
on<00:01:45.650> that<00:01:45.830> we're<00:01:46.010> picking<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:46.340> up<00:01:46.400> okay<00:01:46.910> and

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
on that we're picking that up okay and

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.350 
on that we're picking that up okay and
that's<00:01:47.870> what<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.170> little<00:01:48.940> little<00:01:49.940> of<00:01:50.030> lobbies

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
that's what the little little of lobbies

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.660 
that's what the little little of lobbies
needs<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.780> be<00:01:50.870> there<00:01:51.080> so<00:01:51.500> it's<00:01:51.890> it's<00:01:52.460> quite

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
needs to be there so it's it's quite

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.220 
needs to be there so it's it's quite
intuitive<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.570> if<00:01:53.810> you've<00:01:53.990> got<00:01:54.140> it

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
intuitive to you if you've got it

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.870 
intuitive to you if you've got it
combined<00:01:54.620> with<00:01:54.650> the<00:01:54.830> chart<00:01:55.100> but<00:01:55.280> yours<00:01:55.520> isn't

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
combined with the chart but yours isn't

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.420 
combined with the chart but yours isn't
is<00:01:56.030> it<00:01:56.180> now<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:57.530> let's<00:01:57.740> change<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.160> view<00:01:58.190> and

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
is it now so let's change the view and

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.140 
is it now so let's change the view and
make<00:01:58.550> it<00:01:58.730> look<00:01:58.820> like<00:01:58.970> you're<00:01:59.150> one<00:02:02.530> up

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
make it look like you're one up

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.050 
make it look like you're one up
but<00:02:05.690> yours<00:02:05.900> looks<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.260> bit<00:02:06.290> like<00:02:06.440> that<00:02:06.770> yeah<00:02:07.640> now

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
but yours looks a bit like that yeah now

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.670 
but yours looks a bit like that yeah now
that's<00:02:08.210> not<00:02:08.630> stir<00:02:08.869> bridge<00:02:09.140> which<00:02:09.320> are<00:02:09.440> marked

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
that's not stir bridge which are marked

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.390 
that's not stir bridge which are marked
on<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.010> plotter

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
on the plotter

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.090 
on the plotter
yeah<00:02:10.760> and<00:02:11.240> that's<00:02:11.360> its<00:02:11.660> position<00:02:12.560> on<00:02:12.770> the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
yeah and that's its position on the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.130 
yeah and that's its position on the
radar<00:02:13.490> yes<00:02:13.880> this<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.530> range<00:02:16.060> here<00:02:17.140> and

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
radar yes this is the range here and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.560 
radar yes this is the range here and
I've<00:02:18.710> got<00:02:18.920> it<00:02:19.010> set<00:02:19.220> up<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.460> quarter<00:02:20.360> mile

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
I've got it set up in quarter mile

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.010 
I've got it set up in quarter mile
increments<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.530> from<00:02:21.770> there<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.970> there<00:02:23.120> is<00:02:23.960> a

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
increments so from there to there is a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.940 
increments so from there to there is a
mile<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:24.860> we<00:02:24.980> know<00:02:25.130> that<00:02:25.160> exactly

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
mile so we know that exactly

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.930 
mile so we know that exactly
three-quarters<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.070> mile<00:02:28.250> away<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.700> nor

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
three-quarters of a mile away is nor

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.080 
three-quarters of a mile away is nor
Sturbridge<00:02:29.330> yet<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:31.310> we<00:02:31.460> can<00:02:31.610> actually<00:02:31.730> use<00:02:32.060> it

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
Sturbridge yet so we can actually use it

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.440 
Sturbridge yet so we can actually use it
to<00:02:32.240> find<00:02:32.600> boys<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.380> navigate<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:34.520> can<00:02:35.300> also

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
to find boys and to navigate I can also

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.030 
to find boys and to navigate I can also
use<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.230> take<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.430> fix<00:02:38.230> so<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:39.590> Gil

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
use it to take a a fix so this is Gil

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.030 
use it to take a a fix so this is Gil
kicker<00:02:40.540> if<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.720> do<00:02:42.320> that<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.800> press<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.340> button

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
kicker if I do that and press the button

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.970 
kicker if I do that and press the button
it'll<00:02:45.700> tell<00:02:45.909> me<00:02:46.060> how<00:02:46.750> far<00:02:47.080> away<00:02:47.349> it<00:02:47.530> is<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.860> on

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
it'll tell me how far away it is and on

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.720 
it'll tell me how far away it is and on
what<00:02:48.129> bearing

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
what bearing

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:58.860 
what bearing
yes<00:02:49.019> 0.45<00:02:50.019> six<00:02:50.379> of<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.590> mile<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:57.269> take<00:02:58.269> a<00:02:58.299> fix<00:02:58.659> yet

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
yes 0.45 six of a mile to take a fix yet

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.110 
yes 0.45 six of a mile to take a fix yet
to<00:02:59.290> fix<00:02:59.500> my<00:02:59.739> position<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.340> go<00:03:00.489> back<00:03:00.730> onto<00:03:00.939> the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
to fix my position and go back onto the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.660 
to fix my position and go back onto the
chart<00:03:01.390> I<00:03:01.720> get<00:03:02.110> my<00:03:02.260> plotter<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.950> take<00:03:03.579> the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
chart I get my plotter I take the

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.899 
chart I get my plotter I take the
reciprocal<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.329> that<00:03:04.769> so<00:03:05.769> subtract<00:03:06.220> 180<00:03:06.700> from

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
reciprocal of that so subtract 180 from

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.530 
reciprocal of that so subtract 180 from
it<00:03:07.239> draw<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.049> line<00:03:08.670> get<00:03:09.670> my<00:03:09.819> plotters<00:03:10.209> my

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
it draw a line get my plotters my

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.380 
it draw a line get my plotters my
dividers<00:03:11.109> out<00:03:11.340> measure<00:03:12.340> four<00:03:12.879> point<00:03:13.150> five

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390

nautical miles at the side straight back

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.410 
nautical miles at the side straight back
on<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.480> chart<00:03:16.720> so<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:16.959> can<00:03:17.109> use<00:03:17.319> that<00:03:18.090> if<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.269> was

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
on the chart so I can use that if it was

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.259 
on the chart so I can use that if it was
foggy<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:21.220> wanted<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.579> come<00:03:21.790> back<00:03:22.030> into

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
foggy and I wanted to come back into

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.250 
foggy and I wanted to come back into
port<00:03:22.540> some<00:03:22.690> Carver

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
port some Carver

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.879 
port some Carver
yeah<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.599> wanted<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:25.959> be<00:03:26.079> in<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:26.620> channel

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
yeah and I wanted to be in the channel

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.830 
yeah and I wanted to be in the channel
remember<00:03:27.849> we<00:03:27.940> looked<00:03:28.060> at<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.269> chart<00:03:28.569> where

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
remember we looked at the chart where

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.660 
remember we looked at the chart where
that<00:03:28.930> transit<00:03:29.349> is<00:03:29.500> yeah<00:03:29.769> I<00:03:29.799> couldn't<00:03:30.280> see<00:03:30.519> it

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
that transit is yeah I couldn't see it

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.470 
that transit is yeah I couldn't see it
we<00:03:31.450> knew<00:03:31.750> we<00:03:32.680> had<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:33.099> stay<00:03:34.139> point<00:03:35.139> seven<00:03:36.299> of<00:03:37.299> a

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
we knew we had to stay point seven of a

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.449 
we knew we had to stay point seven of a
mile<00:03:37.720> away<00:03:37.930> from<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.379> shore<00:03:38.620> yeah<00:03:38.859> so<00:03:39.310> if<00:03:39.430> you

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
mile away from the shore yeah so if you

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.129 
mile away from the shore yeah so if you
drive<00:03:39.879> in<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.420> keep<00:03:40.629> this<00:03:40.840> shoreline<00:03:41.200> here

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
drive in you keep this shoreline here

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.589 
drive in you keep this shoreline here
0.73<00:03:44.139> rings<00:03:44.470> out<00:03:44.769> so<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:45.790> keep<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.150> shoreline

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
0.73 rings out so you keep the shoreline

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.030 
0.73 rings out so you keep the shoreline
along<00:03:46.810> here<00:03:48.510> yes<00:03:49.510> but<00:03:49.840> you'd<00:03:50.260> know<00:03:50.530> you'd<00:03:50.829> be

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
along here yes but you'd know you'd be

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.580 
along here yes but you'd know you'd be
in<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.669> channel<00:03:51.910> yeah<00:03:52.299> yeah<00:03:53.019> because<00:03:53.260> we<00:03:53.440> look

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
in the channel yeah yeah because we look

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.680 
in the channel yeah yeah because we look
to<00:03:53.709> that<00:03:53.799> on<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.069> thing<00:03:54.250> see<00:03:54.760> suddenly<00:03:55.299> this

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
to that on the thing see suddenly this

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.210 
to that on the thing see suddenly this
thing<00:03:55.900> isn't<00:03:56.049> just<00:03:56.230> for<00:03:56.530> not<00:03:56.680> bumping<00:03:57.040> into

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
thing isn't just for not bumping into

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.689 
thing isn't just for not bumping into
things

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
things

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.119 
things
it's<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.480> can<00:03:58.660> fix<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:59.049> fix<00:03:59.470> your<00:03:59.680> position

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
it's you can fix you fix your position

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.180 
it's you can fix you fix your position
yeah<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:01.150> can<00:04:01.359> use<00:04:01.660> it<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:01.989> keep<00:04:02.169> her<00:04:02.349> clear<00:04:03.010> in

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
yeah you can use it to keep her clear in

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.629 
yeah you can use it to keep her clear in
line<00:04:03.400> or<00:04:04.329> a<00:04:04.359> clearing<00:04:04.930> distance<00:04:05.379> you<00:04:06.340> can<00:04:06.489> use

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
line or a clearing distance you can use

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.640 
line or a clearing distance you can use
it<00:04:06.790> to<00:04:06.910> stay<00:04:07.359> in<00:04:07.389> transit<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:08.049> you<00:04:08.169> can't<00:04:08.379> see

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
it to stay in transit that you can't see

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.849 
it to stay in transit that you can't see
yeah<00:04:09.639> see<00:04:10.000> that<00:04:10.180> ship<00:04:10.419> over<00:04:10.569> there<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.680> ship

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
yeah see that ship over there the ship

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.809 
yeah see that ship over there the ship
coming<00:04:12.069> out

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
coming out

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.939 
coming out
might<00:04:14.540> get<00:04:14.689> a<00:04:14.749> bit<00:04:14.900> of<00:04:14.989> clutter<00:04:15.200> from<00:04:15.409> the<00:04:15.530> land

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.840 

that's<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.549> little<00:04:18.759> bit

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
that's a little bit

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.060 
that's a little bit
return<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.840> knob<00:04:21.990> the<00:04:22.110> right<00:04:22.260> way

that's the four yep that's the

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.980 
that's the four yep that's the
if<00:04:32.160> we<00:04:32.400> go<00:04:32.580> back<00:04:32.880> onto<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:35.570> back<00:04:36.570> onto<00:04:36.810> the

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
if we go back onto the back onto the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.970 
if we go back onto the back onto the
chart<00:04:37.290> we<00:04:37.710> should<00:04:37.950> see<00:04:38.130> on<00:04:38.340> a<00:04:38.430> is<00:04:39.590> it<00:04:40.590> Sassoon

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
chart we should see on a is it Sassoon

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.080 
chart we should see on a is it Sassoon
that<00:04:41.130> little<00:04:42.710> two<00:04:43.710> vessels<00:04:43.980> in<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.460> in<00:04:44.970> the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
that little two vessels in the in the

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.960 
that little two vessels in the in the
channel<00:04:45.419> coming<00:04:45.750> out<00:04:45.870> yes<00:04:46.490> of<00:04:47.490> course<00:04:47.700> we<00:04:47.850> put

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
channel coming out yes of course we put

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.300 
channel coming out yes of course we put
the<00:04:48.060> pilot<00:04:48.270> BIOS<00:04:48.660> behind<00:04:49.110> on<00:04:49.350> this<00:04:49.590> here<00:04:49.830> yeah

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
the pilot BIOS behind on this here yeah

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.629 
the pilot BIOS behind on this here yeah
it's<00:04:50.520> enough<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:50.880> touch<00:04:51.090> that<00:04:52.400> that<00:04:53.400> should<00:04:53.610> be

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
it's enough to touch that that should be

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.620 
it's enough to touch that that should be
the<00:04:53.730> pilot<00:04:54.000> light

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.020 

we<00:04:58.110> go<00:04:58.500> MMSI<00:04:59.720> of<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:00.990> vessel<00:05:01.800> course<00:05:02.760> either

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
we go MMSI of the vessel course either

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.670 
we go MMSI of the vessel course either
ground<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:03.630> its<00:05:03.750> speed<00:05:05.990> so<00:05:06.990> that's<00:05:07.410> that's

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
ground and its speed so that's that's

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.860 
ground and its speed so that's that's
the<00:05:07.950> actual<00:05:08.550> position<00:05:08.700> it's<00:05:09.090> broadcasting

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
the actual position it's broadcasting

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.900 
the actual position it's broadcasting
that's<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.740> position<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.220> radars<00:05:11.670> picking

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
that's the position the radars picking

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.640 
that's the position the radars picking
up<00:05:12.240> and<00:05:12.420> it's<00:05:12.510> thinking<00:05:12.990> about<00:05:13.080> a<00:05:13.260> big<00:05:13.530> event

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
up and it's thinking about a big event

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.120 
up and it's thinking about a big event
because<00:05:13.920> it's<00:05:14.540> it's<00:05:15.540> not<00:05:15.780> not<00:05:16.440> as<00:05:16.560> accurate<00:05:16.740> as

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
because it's it's not not as accurate as

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.700 
because it's it's not not as accurate as
a<00:05:17.310> vessel<00:05:17.490> broadcast<00:05:18.120> in<00:05:18.330> its<00:05:18.450> position<00:05:18.750> I'm

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
a vessel broadcast in its position I'm

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.950 
a vessel broadcast in its position I'm
not<00:05:19.740> entirely<00:05:20.220> sure<00:05:20.430> if<00:05:20.790> I<00:05:20.940> can<00:05:21.000> drag<00:05:21.750> into

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
not entirely sure if I can drag into

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:32.000 
not entirely sure if I can drag into
this<00:05:29.360> so<00:05:30.360> there<00:05:30.540> we<00:05:30.660> go<00:05:30.690> that's<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.800> pilot

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
this so there we go that's the pilot

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.140 
this so there we go that's the pilot
vessel<00:05:32.540> that's<00:05:33.540> the<00:05:35.070> that<00:05:35.340> was<00:05:35.760> carrying

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
vessel that's the that was carrying

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.910 
vessel that's the that was carrying
bananas<00:05:36.660> that<00:05:36.810> we<00:05:36.930> saw<00:05:37.080> coming<00:05:37.440> last<00:05:37.620> night

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
bananas that we saw coming last night

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:45.360 
bananas that we saw coming last night
and<00:05:38.550> that's<00:05:38.670> it's<00:05:38.970> right

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.670
