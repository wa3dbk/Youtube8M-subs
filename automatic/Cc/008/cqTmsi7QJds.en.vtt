00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.330
 hi friends today we are with the triumph 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.730
 speed triple r is the highest model of 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.169
 the triumph range and of course we can 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.410
 sentence that is the jewel in the crown 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.410
 english 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.800
 the strong point of the pr species is its 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.790
 part cycle have been spared at the time of 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.129
 improve it 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.690
 for example suspension or lynch both 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.820
 front as back above all behind one 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.770
 moto worth tx is the best thing that the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.230
 Swedish brand brakes brembo a monoblock 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.869
 it's the best thing that has the time and then 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.369
 some forged aluminum pvm rims that 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.740
 lightens the weight of the 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.509
 normal tire regardless of that then they go 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.030
 all is well decorative pieces 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.920
 carbon and its chassis in red and can be 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.920
 choose in two colors the white or black 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.810
 in terms of behavior this motorcycle 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.060
 basically it will not be enough is in the 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.310
 curves for the precision that the 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.750
 suspension is amazing until you 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.910
 tests a fork of this caliber and 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.590
 a shock absorber so how can 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.020
 get to trace because it does not move or 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.240
 a non-invasive millimeter let's go how 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.210
 wait on rails outside the 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.670
 brakes with a finger or two and if so 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.170
 block is not having any problem and 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.630
 otherwise the engine remains a 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.750
 tricylindrical stretches very well down and in 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.600
 media responds super fast and little a 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.630
 little to object not perhaps in this unit 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.770
 I have noticed good change the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.710
 drive the change is a little bit 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.380
 hard but otherwise since it is a 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.890
 motorcycle to have fun but let's go up 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.890
 you drop 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.820
 with friends then the speed pr of course 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.500
 we loved an amazing bike 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.630
 little more than 15 thousand euros 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.180
 what good for me is what it costs 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.680
 the civic part that you have and the truth is 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.960
 that you can do many bad things and 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.200
 have a great time so we'll see each other 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.200
 the Web
