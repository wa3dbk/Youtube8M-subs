00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:10.769
 today michel come examined two 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.120
 young eagles injured paws they 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.959
 were three in the nest that was 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.780
 carried away by the wind 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:18.930
 one died in his fall and the two 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.430
 others have a broken leg and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.750
 fracture is one of the injuries 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.750
 the most serious for these birds of 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.160
 prey the complete healing are very 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.660
 rare three are the wii 2 here and one in 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.010
 this corner be careful when catching them 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.050
 these young people do not look strong and do not 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.910
 weighs only a few kilos but serves them 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.930
 can break the back of a small square 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.820
 last I hope the radios will show 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.520
 that their fractures are fairly consolidated 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.989
 to be released soon his eyes 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.000
 you are sure he has a broken paw 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.280
 it's because they fly very well 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.290
 it is this one is said ok with the invoice 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.729
 it's bald eagle are 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.799
 still brown but at 4 5 years their head 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.120
 will become white to even besides 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.840
 if they look bigger they did not 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.270
 that 3 - we recover a lot of birds 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.460
 seriously injured by cars by 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.470
 the fall of their nest by attacks 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.060
 other animals sometimes it takes 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.540
 euthanize especially eagles 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.790
 victims of fractures 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.170
 ok let's do the radios and but he 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.400
 is very rare that a raptors heal 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.049
 such a serious fracture 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.030
 but I hope we will be lucky 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.030
 let's start with that one okay 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:43.170
 see what it gives you hold it there 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:48.990
 pits him on his chest 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.760
 head in that direction like that fall 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.380
 is already there and these young pigs of 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.880
 have to migrate quickly to the coasts 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.380
 from alaska with adults 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.420
 otherwise they will stay trapped here and that's 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.130
 very difficult because we know we can 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.320
 to heal them and that they will keep their 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.020
 wings or their paws 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.399
 we will not be able to release them because 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.910
 that they are unable to hunt for 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.350
 feed everyone outside 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.760
 if their paws are not healed they 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.000
 will spend the rest of their lives 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.000
 captivity 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.530
 this may be 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.800
 I do not see any lesions it's great 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.660
 it was sad that united destroyed this young 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.510
 who was dead and the other two with 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.680
 fractures but this story ends 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.700
 well and we gave him a chance and 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.700
 even the life of you to play
