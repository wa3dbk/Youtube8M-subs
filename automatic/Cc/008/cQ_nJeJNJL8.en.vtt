00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
couple months that doesn't necessarily

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.520 
couple months that doesn't necessarily
mean<00:04:24.400> that<00:04:24.460> they're<00:04:24.789> rx8<00:04:25.270> good<00:04:25.419> mods<00:04:25.660> i<00:04:25.960> just

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530

managed to get a couple mods just so

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.190 
managed to get a couple mods just so
that<00:04:29.889> way<00:04:30.130> you<00:04:30.190> can<00:04:30.520> see<00:04:30.810> where<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:31.900> is<00:04:32.020> is

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
that way you can see where it is is

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.740 
that way you can see where it is is
pretty<00:04:32.470> bare<00:04:32.830> essential<00:04:33.520> so<00:04:34.270> it<00:04:34.330> really<00:04:34.510> comes

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
pretty bare essential so it really comes

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.879 
pretty bare essential so it really comes
down<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:35.020> skill<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.830> lot<00:04:36.820> of<00:04:36.940> it<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.740> joined<00:04:38.740> them
