my opinion see it's very pretty you can
also<00:02:59.150> set<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.750> like<00:03:00.100> walk<00:03:01.100> in<00:03:01.250> say<00:03:01.480> 160<00:03:02.480> or

especially<00:03:09.049> in<00:03:09.110> PvP<00:03:09.470> I<00:03:09.680> think<00:03:10.100> that<00:03:10.190> makes<00:03:10.340> us

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
especially in PvP I think that makes us

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.729 
especially in PvP I think that makes us
like<00:03:10.610> 190<00:03:11.420> or<00:03:11.690> whatever<00:03:11.989> then<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:12.470> just<00:03:12.590> won't

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
like 190 or whatever then it just won't

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.979 
like 190 or whatever then it just won't
brand<00:03:13.010> anything<00:03:13.370> however<00:03:13.549> it<00:03:14.420> is<00:03:14.600> cheating<00:03:14.780> in

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
brand anything however it is cheating in

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.330 
brand anything however it is cheating in
my<00:03:15.080> opinion<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:15.530> can<00:03:15.590> also<00:03:15.769> turn<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.100> down<00:03:16.160> to

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
my opinion you can also turn it down to

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.810 
my opinion you can also turn it down to
20<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:18.200> get<00:03:18.320> some<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:18.769> don't<00:03:19.070> know<00:03:19.160> crude

places<00:03:25.010> but<00:03:25.850> useless<00:03:26.660> use<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.590> beginningless

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
places but useless use the beginningless

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.660 
places but useless use the beginningless
of<00:03:28.459> course<00:03:28.700> if<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.209> want<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.420> play<00:03:29.660> probably

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
of course if you want to play probably

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
the next one is the camera max distance

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.440 
the next one is the camera max distance
command<00:03:33.859> which<00:03:34.220> is<00:03:34.400> pretty<00:03:34.700> obvious<00:03:34.970> what<00:03:35.359> it

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
command which is pretty obvious what it

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.240 
command which is pretty obvious what it
does<00:03:35.630> as<00:03:36.260> you<00:03:36.380> can<00:03:36.500> see<00:03:36.590> it<00:03:36.709> if<00:03:36.829> you<00:03:36.920> sit<00:03:37.100> it's

set in the override file I would explain

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.690 
set in the override file I would explain
better

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
better

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.960 
better
assuming<00:03:56.690> I'm<00:03:57.190> zooming<00:03:58.190> out<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.400> lot<00:03:58.579> you<00:03:58.819> could

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
assuming I'm zooming out a lot you could

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.670 
assuming I'm zooming out a lot you could
be<00:03:59.090> notice<00:03:59.420> that<00:03:59.510> there<00:03:59.690> are<00:03:59.780> camera<00:04:00.290> bounced

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
be notice that there are camera bounced

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.920 
be notice that there are camera bounced
around<00:04:00.799> and<00:04:01.190> stuff<00:04:01.430> which<00:04:01.850> kind<00:04:02.390> of<00:04:02.450> leads<00:04:02.600> to

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
around and stuff which kind of leads to

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.720 
around and stuff which kind of leads to
the<00:04:03.260> next<00:04:03.380> command<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:03.769> want<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:03.980> show<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.220> the

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
the next command I want to show you the

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.780 
the next command I want to show you the
stick<00:04:04.970> hammer<00:04:05.329> a<00:04:05.420> piercing<00:04:05.840> command<00:04:06.519> it<00:04:07.519> means

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
stick hammer a piercing command it means

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.750 
stick hammer a piercing command it means
that<00:04:08.060> walls<00:04:08.299> etc<00:04:08.959> won't<00:04:09.799> bounce<00:04:10.130> your<00:04:10.400> camera

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
that walls etc won't bounce your camera

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.479 
that walls etc won't bounce your camera
so<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.090> can<00:04:11.230> zoom<00:04:12.230> far<00:04:12.500> out<00:04:12.739> with<00:04:12.980> no<00:04:13.130> problem

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
so you can zoom far out with no problem
