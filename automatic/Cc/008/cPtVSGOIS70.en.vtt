00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.360
This recipe for tuna noodle casserole is a
made-from-scratch version of the classic tuna

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.500
noodle recipe.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.810
Using fresh ingredients and topped with Panko
bread crumbs, it updates the timeless family

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.230
dinner idea.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.210
Start by pre-heating the oven to 375 degrees.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.250
Then, grease a 1-1/2 quart casserole dish.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.050
To make the sauce, melt a quarter cup of butter
in a medium sauce pan over medium heat.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.710
Add one cup of chopped celery, three quarters
of a cup of chopped sweet red pepper, and

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.830
one quarter of a cup of chopped onion.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.800
Cook the vegetables until they're tender,
about 8 to10 minutes.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.090
The red pepper adds a nice flavor and color
to the dish.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:57.830
Next, you'll stir in a quarter cup of all-purpose
flour.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.100
One to two tablespoons of Dijon mustard--
depending on your taste-- a half a teaspoon

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.939
of salt, and a quarter of a teaspoon of ground
black pepper.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.510
Stir it altogether, and then add two and a
quarter cups of milk.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.460
Cook the sauce, whisking it constantly to
remove any lumps until it's slightly thickened

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.460
and bubbly.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.540
Now, we can add three cups of wide noodles
that you cooked according to the package directions.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.850
That's about 5 ounces of dried noodles.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.530
Then, add a 12-ounce can of chunked white
water-packed tuna that's been drained and

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.330
broken into chunks.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.450
Gently stir the sauce and tuna with the noodles,
being careful not to break up the tuna too

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.710
much.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.010
Transfer the mixture to the casserole dish.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.869
Now, we'll prepare a topping.

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.330
To one half cup of Panko bread crumbs, add
a quarter cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.159
one tablespoon of snipped fresh parsley, and
one tablespoon of melted butter or margarine.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.420
Stir the topping until it's combined.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.200
Sprinkle it evenly over the noodle mixture.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.939
Bake the casserole uncovered until it's heated
through, about 25 to 30 minutes.

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.239
Let it stand for five minutes, and it's ready
to serve.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.739
Tuna noodle casserole, delicious proof that
sometimes, the classics are a classic for

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:26.199
a reason.
