cool so this is what we call one of our
cinematic<00:01:58.259> cameras

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
cinematic cameras

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.860 
cinematic cameras
which<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.640> kind<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.910> just<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.270> link<00:02:00.660> to<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
which is kind of just the link to the

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.430 
which is kind of just the link to the
Hollywood<00:02:01.230> movie<00:02:01.500> theme<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:03.930> if<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.080> by<00:02:04.200> using

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
Hollywood movie theme so if you by using

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.320 
Hollywood movie theme so if you by using
the<00:02:04.620> melee<00:02:04.800> combat<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.610> almost<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:06.120> having

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
the melee combat it's almost like having

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.690 
the melee combat it's almost like having
the<00:02:06.630> mechanics<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.410> a<00:02:07.500> fighting<00:02:07.740> game<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.640> if

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the mechanics of a fighting game so if

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.100 
the mechanics of a fighting game so if
you<00:02:08.760> imagine<00:02:08.820> it<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:09.210> being<00:02:09.360> like<00:02:09.510> a<00:02:09.570> Mortal

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
you imagine it as being like a Mortal

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.200 
you imagine it as being like a Mortal
Kombat<00:02:10.560> style<00:02:10.860> punch<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.880> literally

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
Kombat style punch you can literally

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.670 
Kombat style punch you can literally
just<00:02:12.240> like<00:02:12.510> punch<00:02:12.780> these<00:02:12.990> cars<00:02:13.290> out<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.530> your

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
just like punch these cars out of your

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.010 
just like punch these cars out of your
way<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:14.460> can<00:02:14.610> also<00:02:14.730> build<00:02:14.970> up<00:02:15.180> combos<00:02:15.570> as<00:02:15.840> well

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
way you can also build up combos as well

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.020 
way you can also build up combos as well
so<00:02:16.320> by<00:02:16.500> going<00:02:16.980> left<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.430> right<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.880> actually

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
so by going left and right and actually

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.330 
so by going left and right and actually
having<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:19.020> further<00:02:19.230> distance<00:02:19.560> between<00:02:20.100> them

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
having a further distance between them

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.160 
having a further distance between them
or<00:02:20.490> ramming<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.390> guy<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.660> then<00:02:21.750> ramming<00:02:22.050> him

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
or ramming the guy and then ramming him

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.050 
or ramming the guy and then ramming him
again<00:02:22.440> that's<00:02:22.920> like<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.070> combo<00:02:23.490> move<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:23.910> you'll

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
again that's like a combo move so you'll

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.480 
again that's like a combo move so you'll
see<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.300> engine<00:02:24.630> catches<00:02:25.050> fire<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:26.100> can<00:02:26.250> send

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
see the engine catches fire you can send

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.120 
see the engine catches fire you can send
him<00:02:26.580> flying<00:02:26.850> off<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.150> screen<00:02:28.130> so

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
him flying off the screen so

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.500 
him flying off the screen so
particularly<00:02:29.550> these<00:02:29.670> tunnels<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.360> can

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
particularly these tunnels you can

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.700 
particularly these tunnels you can
actually<00:02:30.630> track<00:02:31.050> people<00:02:31.230> up<00:02:31.410> against<00:02:31.620> the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
actually track people up against the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.070 
actually track people up against the
wall<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.010> grind<00:02:32.340> them<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:33.150> then<00:02:33.270> when<00:02:33.570> you've

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
wall and grind them and then when you've

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.080 
wall and grind them and then when you've
got<00:02:34.230> them<00:02:34.380> up<00:02:35.010> against<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.460> wall<00:02:35.640> like<00:02:36.060> that

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
got them up against the wall like that

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.690 
got them up against the wall like that
you<00:02:36.690> get<00:02:36.840> an<00:02:36.960> environmental<00:02:37.650> attack<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.550> it's

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
you get an environmental attack so it's

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.060 
you get an environmental attack so it's
like<00:02:38.820> if<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.390> grind<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.200> car<00:02:40.440> up<00:02:40.590> against<00:02:40.860> the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
like if you grind a car up against the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.830 
like if you grind a car up against the
side<00:02:41.250> wall<00:02:41.310> till<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.270> get<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.540> pillar

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
side wall till you get to a pillar

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.750 
side wall till you get to a pillar
they'll<00:02:43.440> hit<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.770> pillow<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.160> go<00:02:44.280> flying<00:02:44.550> off

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
they'll hit the pillow and go flying off

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.590 
they'll hit the pillow and go flying off
into<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.090> air<00:02:46.520> we've<00:02:47.520> also<00:02:47.670> got<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> full

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
into the air we've also got a full

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.630 
into the air we've also got a full
vehicle<00:02:49.170> damage<00:02:49.470> system<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.250> can<00:02:50.280> see<00:02:50.520> all

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
vehicle damage system so you can see all

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.699 
vehicle damage system so you can see all
the<00:02:50.670> doors<00:02:50.970> panels<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:52.170> cars<00:02:52.410> can<00:02:52.680> be

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
the doors panels the cars can be

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.980 
the doors panels the cars can be
completely<00:02:53.130> smashed<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.730> pieces<00:02:53.880> into<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.360> you

completely smashed to pieces into a you

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.650 
completely smashed to pieces into a you
know<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.110> tiny<00:02:55.560> crumpled<00:02:56.100> ball<00:02:56.270> as<00:02:57.270> you<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.450> see

pretty<00:02:57.810> much<00:02:57.959> everything<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
pretty much everything in the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.410 
pretty much everything in the
environment<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.030> breakable

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
environment is like is a breakable

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.900 
environment is like is a breakable
object<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.380> unless<00:03:01.890> it's<00:03:02.070> like<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.220> big<00:03:02.459> tree<00:03:02.760> or

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
object so unless it's like a big tree or

object so unless it's like a big tree or
a<00:03:02.940> building<00:03:03.180> or<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.570> wall<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:04.260> can<00:03:04.410> pretty<00:03:04.530> much

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
a building or a wall you can pretty much

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.810 
a building or a wall you can pretty much
just<00:03:04.830> smash<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.130> out<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.459> way<00:03:05.580> with<00:03:05.730> the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
just smash it out of the way with the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.449 
just smash it out of the way with the
car<00:03:09.170> now<00:03:10.170> most<00:03:10.470> missions<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:11.010> could<00:03:11.160> get<00:03:11.340> out

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
car now most missions you could get out

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.830 
car now most missions you could get out
of<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.700> car<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.180> if<00:03:12.300> you<00:03:12.390> wanted<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.720> you

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
of the car and if you wanted to you

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.900 
of the car and if you wanted to you
could<00:03:12.959> start<00:03:13.230> having<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.650> big<00:03:13.980> gunfight<00:03:14.519> with

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
could start having a big gunfight with

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.090 
could start having a big gunfight with
the<00:03:15.000> cops<00:03:15.320> but<00:03:16.320> in<00:03:16.440> this<00:03:16.530> particular<00:03:16.680> mission

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
the cops but in this particular mission

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.500 
the cops but in this particular mission
we<00:03:17.280> haven't<00:03:17.550> introduced<00:03:17.970> weapons<00:03:18.360> yet

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
we haven't introduced weapons yet

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.240 
we haven't introduced weapons yet
because<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:18.989> tutorial<00:03:19.260> mission<00:03:19.860> to

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
because this is a tutorial mission to

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.949 
because this is a tutorial mission to
introduce<00:03:20.700> driving<00:03:21.150> first<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:21.660> that's<00:03:21.810> our

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959
