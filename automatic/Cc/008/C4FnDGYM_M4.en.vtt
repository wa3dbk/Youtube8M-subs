00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.309
 yesterday he returned leomessi and how he came back 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.340
 spectacular 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.260
 in just half an hour he scored two goals 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.050
 true there are people who can say can 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.150
 be an advantageist and say that he came in with a 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.910
 already favorable score of 2-0 for the 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.890
 barcelona this is true but you have to 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.660
 say that the getafe let alone 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.190
 delivered neither the party nor the 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.740
 eliminatory getafe changes 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.949
 they were totally offensive taking out 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.780
 pedro léon to the appointment and adrián colunga in 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.360
 look for at least one goal that gave 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.950
 options for the second leg at 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.810
 Getafe 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.510
 but it's that messi when he takes the ball 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.940
 yesterday he was also seen to have that 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.250
 spark that spark we saw that this 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.550
 year was missing a little 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.410
 perhaps ballasted by injuries 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.140
 Messi has returned with that spark Messi has 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.110
 returned with desire month and yesterday 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.040
 I repeat he made two goals over all the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.470
 second in a play 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.940
 typical per month and keep it in 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.010
 right starts the diagonal diagonal 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.170
 diagonal diagonal and when it goes into 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.490
 the area puts us aside the goal 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.490
 it is impossible to stop him 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.540
 this reappearance of messi eclipsed the 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.480
 great match played by two players 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.230
 yesterday in particular pedrito again and 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.900
 Cesc Fábregas good thing of Cesc is already 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.630
 tackling a limit 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.690
 incredible not yesterday we see that two ago 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.240
 goals one of them penalty and that is 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.580
 the real boss not yesterday was chosen in 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.180
 the real boss there in the field to 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.180
 the Barcelona 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.700
 pedrito on his part gave assistance 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.000
 of the first goal of fabregas and caused the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.220
 penalty with which you factor scored the 2-0 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.060
 so good a great match 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.600
 our two players 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.280
 eclipsed by the return of leo messi 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.280
 two goals in half an hour
