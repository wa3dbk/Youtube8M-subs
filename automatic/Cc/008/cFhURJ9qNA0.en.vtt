00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:14.209 
debating on getting a smarty jr a smarty
or<00:06:10.529> a<00:06:11.719> edge<00:06:12.719> juice<00:06:13.110> with<00:06:13.289> attitude<00:06:13.439> we<00:06:14.129> don't

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219 
or a edge juice with attitude we don't

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:16.339 
or a edge juice with attitude we don't
know<00:06:14.369> yet<00:06:14.899> we're<00:06:15.899> still<00:06:16.019> trying<00:06:16.079> to<00:06:16.289> figure

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
know yet we're still trying to figure

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:20.899 
know yet we're still trying to figure
that<00:06:16.529> out<00:06:18.919> but<00:06:19.919> we<00:06:20.039> still<00:06:20.249> have<00:06:20.369> taught<00:06:20.669> online

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
that out but we still have taught online

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:22.819 
that out but we still have taught online
and<00:06:21.239> he<00:06:21.299> thought<00:06:21.539> oh<00:06:21.599> we<00:06:21.839> have<00:06:21.959> such<00:06:22.379> chance<00:06:22.649> to

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:22.829 
and he thought oh we have such chance to

00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:24.199 
and he thought oh we have such chance to
put<00:06:23.039> the<00:06:23.159> Delete<00:06:23.399> pipe<00:06:23.610> there<00:06:23.849> but<00:06:23.969> we<00:06:24.029> got<00:06:24.149> to

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:24.209 
put the Delete pipe there but we got to

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:27.109 
put the Delete pipe there but we got to
do<00:06:24.269> that<00:06:24.419> first<00:06:24.689> before<00:06:25.619> we<00:06:26.009> put<00:06:26.610> your<00:06:26.849> planet

00:06:27.109 --> 00:06:27.119 
do that first before we put your planet

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:28.339 
do that first before we put your planet
but<00:06:27.300> we're<00:06:27.539> thinking<00:06:27.779> running<00:06:27.989> at<00:06:28.139> the<00:06:28.259> edge

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
but we're thinking running at the edge

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:29.989 
but we're thinking running at the edge
juice<00:06:28.679> because<00:06:28.889> it<00:06:29.129> has<00:06:29.249> the<00:06:29.399> gauge<00:06:29.579> is<00:06:29.610> all

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:29.999 
juice because it has the gauge is all

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:32.409 
juice because it has the gauge is all
built<00:06:30.269> into<00:06:30.599> it<00:06:30.719> but<00:06:30.869> the<00:06:30.959> cat<00:06:31.169> still<00:06:31.469> there

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
built into it but the cat still there

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.809 
built into it but the cat still there
rest<00:06:33.419> of<00:06:33.539> the<00:06:33.629> exhaust<00:06:33.869> just<00:06:34.800> an<00:06:35.009> ERP<00:06:35.489> muffler

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:35.819 
rest of the exhaust just an ERP muffler

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:41.619 
rest of the exhaust just an ERP muffler
