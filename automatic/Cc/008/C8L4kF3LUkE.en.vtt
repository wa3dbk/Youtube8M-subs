a physical or whatever who cares anyway

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.630 
a physical or whatever who cares anyway
I<00:02:35.900> enclose<00:02:36.290> them<00:02:36.620> across<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.190> it's<00:02:37.400> not<00:02:37.520> gonna

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
I enclose them across and it's not gonna

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.120 
I enclose them across and it's not gonna
be<00:02:37.730> able<00:02:37.820> to<00:02:38.030> finish<00:02:38.240> off<00:02:38.570> my<00:02:39.020> hair<00:02:39.950> across

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
be able to finish off my hair across

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.699 
be able to finish off my hair across
there<00:02:40.970> are<00:02:41.090> periods<00:02:41.300> attack<00:02:41.720> i<00:02:41.870> mean<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.320> i'm

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
there are periods attack i mean and i'm

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.710 
there are periods attack i mean and i'm
just<00:02:42.830> gonna<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.220> kill<00:02:43.250> with<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.970> close<00:02:44.360> comet

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
just gonna to kill with the close comet

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.710 
just gonna to kill with the close comet
which<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:44.959> great<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:46.090> see<00:02:47.090> what<00:02:47.209> else<00:02:47.330> happens

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
which is great and see what else happens

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.910 
which is great and see what else happens
i<00:02:47.780> think<00:02:47.990> he<00:02:48.110> doesn't<00:02:48.350> have<00:02:48.440> anything<00:02:48.650> else

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
i think he doesn't have anything else

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.280 
i think he doesn't have anything else
for<00:02:48.980> have<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.220> closer<00:02:49.490> tyranitar<00:02:50.390> nothing<00:02:51.020> able

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
for have a closer tyranitar nothing able

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.020 
for have a closer tyranitar nothing able
to<00:02:51.410> take<00:02:51.620> anything<00:02:51.950> should<00:02:52.640> have<00:02:52.730> both<00:02:52.850> that

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
to take anything should have both that

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.270 
to take anything should have both that
in<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.300> first<00:02:53.540> place<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:53.930> guess<00:02:53.990> I<00:02:54.410> mean<00:02:54.650> hey<00:02:54.950> I

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
in the first place I guess I mean hey I

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.740 
in the first place I guess I mean hey I
have<00:02:55.520> a<00:02:55.550> whole<00:02:55.760> bunch<00:02:55.850> of<00:02:56.000> physical<00:02:56.360> attackers

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
have a whole bunch of physical attackers

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.100 
have a whole bunch of physical attackers
then<00:02:56.990> so<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:57.560> guess<00:02:57.980> does<00:02:58.250> it's<00:02:59.090> no<00:02:59.300> consequence

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
then so I guess does it's no consequence

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.360 
then so I guess does it's no consequence
or<00:03:00.350> there's<00:03:00.950> no<00:03:01.040> point<00:03:01.400> on<00:03:01.670> his<00:03:01.850> behalf<00:03:02.150> but<00:03:03.050> um

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
or there's no point on his behalf but um

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.590 
or there's no point on his behalf but um
it's<00:03:04.370> quite<00:03:04.580> unfortunate<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:05.270> he<00:03:05.450> would

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
it's quite unfortunate that he would

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.199 
it's quite unfortunate that he would
bring<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.990> type<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:06.530> uh<00:03:06.590> he<00:03:07.459> has<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:08.000> weakness

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
bring a type that uh he has a weakness

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.000 
bring a type that uh he has a weakness
to<00:03:08.510> against<00:03:08.840> me<00:03:08.959> it<00:03:09.050> doesn't<00:03:09.320> necessarily<00:03:09.380> you

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
to against me it doesn't necessarily you

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.430 
to against me it doesn't necessarily you
know<00:03:10.040> give<00:03:10.790> them<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:11.030> lot<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.269> options<00:03:11.720> because

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
know give them a lot of options because

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.290 
know give them a lot of options because
the<00:03:12.590> tracking<00:03:13.100> I'm<00:03:13.190> not<00:03:13.370> scarf<00:03:13.760> nothing

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
the tracking I'm not scarf nothing

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.270 
the tracking I'm not scarf nothing
choice<00:03:14.810> being<00:03:15.050> a<00:03:15.170> quick<00:03:15.350> attack<00:03:15.680> nothing<00:03:16.160> else

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
choice being a quick attack nothing else

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.729 
choice being a quick attack nothing else
I'm<00:03:16.580> thinking<00:03:17.030> like<00:03:17.060> okay<00:03:17.360> quick<00:03:17.840> attack<00:03:18.170> but

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
I'm thinking like okay quick attack but

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.620 
I'm thinking like okay quick attack but
you<00:03:18.830> know<00:03:18.980> whatever<00:03:19.580> you'll<00:03:20.000> just<00:03:20.300> let<00:03:20.480> him
