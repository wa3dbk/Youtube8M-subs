00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
and I sewed it right up at the top where

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.700 
and I sewed it right up at the top where
I<00:01:33.960> had<00:01:34.320> taken<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.950> section<00:01:35.579> out<00:01:35.820> okay<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.350> it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
I had taken that section out okay so it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.830 
I had taken that section out okay so it
already<00:01:37.920> has<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.700> top<00:01:38.970> part<00:01:39.210> already<00:01:39.570> has

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
that ombre tip type look and I could

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.539 
that ombre tip type look and I could
pull<00:01:44.549> my<00:01:44.759> hair<00:01:45.000> through<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.950> blend<00:01:46.950> my<00:01:47.130> hair

with no problem at the top because it
already<00:01:51.390> looks<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:53.070> know<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.729> has

dark roots so then I took the weaving
hair<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.570> course<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.020> sold<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.680> into<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
I put a little more weight to it not too

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.150 
I put a little more weight to it not too
much<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:24.540> then<00:02:24.810> what<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.080> did<00:02:25.200> was<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.560> made<00:02:25.680> sure

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
much and then what I did was I made sure

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.260 
much and then what I did was I made sure
that<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.670> cut<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.330> top<00:02:27.660> part<00:02:27.959> out<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:29.240> put<00:02:30.240> a

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
that I cut that top part out and I put a

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.840 
that I cut that top part out and I put a
wig<00:02:30.600> or<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:30.900> made<00:02:31.260> an<00:02:31.410> apparatus<00:02:31.920> or<00:02:32.370> an

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
wig or I made an apparatus or an

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.960 
wig or I made an apparatus or an
invisible<00:02:33.480> part<00:02:33.780> wig<00:02:34.080> without<00:02:34.890> buying<00:02:35.280> one<00:02:35.760> I

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
invisible part wig without buying one I

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.560 
invisible part wig without buying one I
just<00:02:36.330> turned<00:02:36.690> one<00:02:36.990> of<00:02:37.020> my<00:02:37.290> synthetic<00:02:37.650> wigs

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
just turned one of my synthetic wigs

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.870 
just turned one of my synthetic wigs
into<00:02:39.570> an<00:02:39.840> invisible<00:02:40.170> part<00:02:40.709> wig<00:02:41.070> because<00:02:41.670> I

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
into an invisible part wig because I

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.870 
into an invisible part wig because I
just<00:02:42.120> did<00:02:42.420> not<00:02:42.450> want<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.020> part<00:02:43.290> with<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.590> color

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
just did not want to part with the color

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.720 
just did not want to part with the color
so<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:45.239> was<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.720> much<00:02:46.080> happier<00:02:46.320> camper<00:02:47.130> after<00:02:47.610> the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
so I was a much happier camper after the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.360 
so I was a much happier camper after the
fact<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:48.570> I<00:02:48.600> took<00:02:48.900> more<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.260> those<00:02:49.650> tracks<00:02:50.070> and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
fact so I took more of those tracks and

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.690 
fact so I took more of those tracks and
I<00:02:50.489> had<00:02:50.700> begun<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.540> sew<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.320> into<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.709> wig<00:02:53.040> now

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
I had begun to sew it into the wig now

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.699 
I had begun to sew it into the wig now
you<00:02:53.760> don't<00:02:54.150> have<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.540> necessarily<00:02:54.660> sew<00:02:55.500> them

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
you don't have to necessarily sew them

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.790 
you don't have to necessarily sew them
you<00:02:55.920> can<00:02:56.160> put<00:02:57.030> combs<00:02:57.390> on<00:02:57.780> them<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.350> then<00:02:58.620> make

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
you can put combs on them and then make

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.729 
you can put combs on them and then make
them<00:02:59.010> clips<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:00.209> then<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:00.540> can<00:03:00.690> actually<00:03:00.900> clip

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
them clips so then you can actually clip

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.530 
them clips so then you can actually clip
the<00:03:02.010> hair<00:03:02.250> onto<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.790> way<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.330> way<00:03:03.480> you

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
the hair onto the way in that way you

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.780 
the hair onto the way in that way you
could<00:03:03.810> take<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.140> out<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.530> put<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.130> on<00:03:05.310> as<00:03:05.580> you

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
could take it out and put it on as you

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.449 
could take it out and put it on as you
would<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.989> basically<00:03:07.530> when<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.340> put

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
would like so basically when you put

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.699 
would like so basically when you put
that<00:03:08.940> wig<00:03:09.150> together<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.690> assemble<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.380> it

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
that wig together you assemble it and it

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.400 
that wig together you assemble it and it
takes<00:03:11.010> no<00:03:11.610> time<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.180> sew<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.540> stuff<00:03:12.840> onto<00:03:13.290> the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
takes no time to sew that stuff onto the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.740 
takes no time to sew that stuff onto the
front<00:03:13.620> it's<00:03:14.250> gonna<00:03:14.459> look<00:03:14.700> exactly<00:03:14.940> like<00:03:15.390> the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
on top and that's exactly what you would

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.940 
on top and that's exactly what you would
do<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.060> this<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.420> just<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.870> unique<00:03:43.230> option<00:03:43.799> to

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
do so this is just a unique option to

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.520 
do so this is just a unique option to
use<00:03:44.160> with<00:03:44.370> pose<00:03:44.579> 5<00:03:44.910> if<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.690> have<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.900> wig<00:03:46.200> you

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
use with pose 5 if you have a wig you

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.500 
use with pose 5 if you have a wig you
don't<00:03:46.680> necessarily<00:03:46.829> like<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.519> lace<00:03:47.730> there

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
don't necessarily like the lace there

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.490 
don't necessarily like the lace there
you<00:03:48.720> go<00:03:48.989> so<00:03:49.890> I<00:03:50.370> showed<00:03:51.299> you<00:03:51.480> pose<00:03:51.690> five<00:03:52.019> pose

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
you go so I showed you pose five pose
