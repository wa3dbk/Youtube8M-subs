00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hi there how nice that you are back and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.250
 today i have a very short video of 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.660
 you 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.150
 I am going to show how I am 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.860
 dilate makeup before shower 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.540
 I still have my sermon on this I leave 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.150
 just put on a special for this video 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.710
 the seesaw in a simple regret and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.420
 it often immediately that my divorce 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.340
 crooked but that doesn't matter 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.029
 after all, it's about removing my mine 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.490
 makeup 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.490
 my hair is in a state so i'm going now 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.240
 wash my hands before i touch my 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.220
 eyes 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.640
 sit down and I was used to for months 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.260
 soap simple tip this soap is like this 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.480
 cute but good i wash my hands 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.700
 because I'm afraid I dirt than 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.610
 my hands are seated and those names have eyes 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.219
 bring me to bed and believe me 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.530
 pricking that is really terrible discos 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.910
 autism hands before I all eyes 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.140
 sit down 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.079
 then i continue with it 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.360
 remove my eyelashes and these 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.039
 eyelashes are stuck with simple but 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.079
 yet it was special 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.079
 lash line and removal I do 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.049
 very careful because my own 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.760
 I still need natural lashes 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:09.420
 for the days i have no fake eyelashes 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.520
 want but still want to get a roll of mascara 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.310
 I then remove the line of leftovers 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.770
 to the lashes so that I have these lashes 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.290
 just can use several times and 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.049
 after I have properly removed the glue 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.720
 I place them in the original packaging 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.080
 and services stash the crown in my drawer 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.600
 with me on the other lashes 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.909
 these are my everyday lists , by the way 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.040
 but fid lashes if i want them to 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.530
 remaining scraps of eye makeup at my eyes 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.439
 I use this to delete 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.880
 oil-based eye make-up remover 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.340
 this is just a small bottle of the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.890
 hematite I use it every day 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.540
 act i have a small bottle i do that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.210
 I write very well to write something 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.990
 lie to me and then I wipe 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.969
 it very carefully and like you now 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.159
 can see it really gets a few times too 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.280
 very scary but for me it is the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.899
 best method and it just really helps 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.460
 by a large part of my eye makeup 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.970
 I will soon have less to remove 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.920
 meat was needed in the shower so it 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.810
 is actually preparatory work 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.270
 and I find the oil on my eyes whole 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.330
 lovely i think this is really ideal 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.980
 for sensitive skin to the rest of 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.710
 remove my face makeup 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.900
 such as foundation concealer 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.340
 eyebrow powder eyebrow pencil et 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.790
 cetera et cetera 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.370
 I use these facial cleansing wipes 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.600
 either eye makeup or face makeup 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.570
 cleaners wipes and I use this to 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.480
 very carefully over my face 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.900
 and as you can see it grabs 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.380
 quite a lot of face makeup 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.140
 and yes I think I use 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.510
 in total usually tea towels very occasionally 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.120
 three but often i can t wipes 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.520
 enough 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.100
 well this video is almost over 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.990
 you can't wait until my end 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.000
 next video if it is right you see 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.340
 a preview of this will be added later 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.760
 I would say come subscribe to my 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.500
 channel 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.790
 hopefully you have enough going beyond this 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.260
 movie 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.660
