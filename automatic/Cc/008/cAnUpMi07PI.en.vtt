00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.139
 history of the famous caricature 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.990

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.279
 diaper adventures do not exist and they are 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.080
 product of the imagination of angelica 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.630
 because his mother ignores her and his relationship 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.849
 with his father is shallow in 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.890

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.530
 of being born and the weak ones had a 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.780
 Angelic abortion could not decide if the 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.210
 Unborn children would be male or female 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.360
 then he invented the same character in 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.960
 his head but with different genres 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.360
 for another an angelic angel was a 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.610
 bipolar schizophrenic becoming addicted 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.589
 to narcotics returning her to her 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.750
 childhood and his creations the aaron obsession 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.760

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.409
 he made them older 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.510

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.400
 overdose of heroine July in his 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.430

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.710
 look for money gold digger the only item 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.840
 that was not the product of the imagination of 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.609
 angelica was bill but angelica no 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.460
 I noticed the difference between him and his 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.040
 offspring 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.470

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.299
 of despair and angelic anger or 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.420
 hits repeatedly screaming and 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.700
 screaming at what had come running 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.800

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.690
 bill had a cerebral hemorrhage what 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.240
 that resulted in a deformation that 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.130
 grow was more evident by what he lives 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.800
 being ridiculed for its rarity and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.659
