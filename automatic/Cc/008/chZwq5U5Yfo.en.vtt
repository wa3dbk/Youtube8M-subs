you can use it some customers like to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.869 
you can use it some customers like to
use<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.120> measure<00:00:42.300> out<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.879> length

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
use it to measure out this is the length

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.600 
use it to measure out this is the length
of<00:00:45.300> Fringe<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.289> they'd<00:00:46.469> want<00:00:46.500> or<00:00:47.010> maybe<00:00:47.190> here

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
of Fringe that they'd want or maybe here

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.610 
of Fringe that they'd want or maybe here
or<00:00:47.789> here<00:00:48.090> or<00:00:48.120> here<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.230> way<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.440> don't

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
or here or here and that way you don't

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.080 
or here or here and that way you don't
have<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.920> keep<00:00:50.070> looking<00:00:50.460> at<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> ruler<00:00:51.059> you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
have to keep looking at the ruler you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.000 
have to keep looking at the ruler you
can<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.539> run<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.440> go<00:00:52.530> back<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
can just run to here and go back and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.069 
can just run to here and go back and
forth<00:00:53.280> until<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.030> get<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> thickness<00:00:54.660> that

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
forth until you get the thickness that

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.220 
forth until you get the thickness that
you're<00:00:55.230> looking<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.890> other<00:00:56.789> people<00:00:57.239> wind<00:00:57.989> on

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
you're looking for other people wind on

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.170 
you're looking for other people wind on
yarn<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.980> ribbon<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.280> little<00:00:59.309> bit<00:00:59.670> too<00:00:59.879> tight

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
yarn and ribbon a little bit too tight

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.000 
yarn and ribbon a little bit too tight
so<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.809> way<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.020> keep<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> rods<00:01:01.680> from

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
so it's a way to keep the rods from

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.429 
so it's a way to keep the rods from
bending<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.059> giving<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.809> an<00:01:03.960> uneven

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
bending in and giving you an uneven

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.280 
bending in and giving you an uneven
French<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.189> keeps<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.760> tension<00:01:06.290> correct

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
French so this keeps the tension correct

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.800 
French so this keeps the tension correct
I'm<00:01:07.530> spacing<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.549> bars<00:01:08.790> I'm<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.510> simply

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
I'm spacing the bars I'm just simply

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.810 
I'm spacing the bars I'm just simply
going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.140> put<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.920> over<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> side

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
going to put it over here to the side

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.840 
going to put it over here to the side
right<00:01:12.150> now<00:01:12.390> I'm<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.710> start<00:01:14.189> winding<00:01:14.670> on

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
right now I'm going to start winding on

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.899 
right now I'm going to start winding on
you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.930> wind<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.500> all<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> way<00:01:17.130> down<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.700> rod

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
you can wind on all the way down the rod

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.090 
you can wind on all the way down the rod
like<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:19.140> then<00:01:19.530> go<00:01:19.770> back<00:01:21.920> there's<00:01:22.920> any

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
like this you then go back there's any

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.890 
like this you then go back there's any
number<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.610> ways<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.090> do<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.240> there<00:01:24.570> are<00:01:24.600> no

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
number of ways to do it there are no

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.390 
number of ways to do it there are no

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
up and then just go winding it one

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.010 
up and then just go winding it one
strand<00:01:32.280> right<00:01:32.520> next<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.060> another<00:01:33.090> now<00:01:33.630> notice

probably want a monkey with it a little
bit<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.119> spaced<00:01:51.960> out<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.799> when

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
bit to get it spaced out so that when
