I think Jeff feels and I think correctly

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.740 
I think Jeff feels and I think correctly
so<00:04:00.520> that<00:04:00.550> the<00:04:00.910> heightened<00:04:01.270> is<00:04:01.390> largely

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
so that the heightened is largely

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.930 
so that the heightened is largely
unappreciated<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.680> it<00:04:03.100> is<00:04:03.310> we're<00:04:03.489> right<00:04:03.700> all

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
unappreciated and it is we're right all

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.640 
unappreciated and it is we're right all
right<00:04:04.090> fine<00:04:04.360> there<00:04:04.660> is<00:04:04.690> that<00:04:04.900> certain<00:04:05.080> and

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
right fine there is that certain and

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.050 
right fine there is that certain and
also<00:04:06.010> it's<00:04:06.190> a<00:04:06.280> like<00:04:06.459> team<00:04:06.670> building<00:04:06.850> thing

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.220 
also it's a like team building thing
right<00:04:07.390> because<00:04:07.570> it's<00:04:07.720> something<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:08.020> we<00:04:08.080> can

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
right because it's something that we can

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.410
