let's<00:04:12.580> move<00:04:12.760> over<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:12.880> our<00:04:13.000> Bluetooth

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
let's move over to our Bluetooth

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.850 
let's move over to our Bluetooth
functionality<00:04:14.020> and<00:04:14.320> show<00:04:14.440> you<00:04:14.500> how<00:04:14.680> your

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860

work so we go into our settings go to

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.830 
work so we go into our settings go to
general<00:04:23.220> we<00:04:24.220> then<00:04:24.400> go<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.610> bluetooth<00:04:25.180> we're

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
general we then go to bluetooth we're

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.100 
general we then go to bluetooth we're
going<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.110> turn<00:04:26.290> it<00:04:26.440> on<00:04:27.540> it's<00:04:28.540> gonna<00:04:28.630> find<00:04:28.990> the
