00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.920 
pick quick-draw on the sniper that
pretty<00:03:25.580> much<00:03:25.700> eliminates<00:03:26.180> quick<00:03:26.390> scoping<00:03:26.780> if

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
pretty much eliminates quick scoping if

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.870 
pretty much eliminates quick scoping if
you<00:03:27.020> can't<00:03:27.320> quick<00:03:27.620> draw<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.370> can't<00:03:28.640> quick

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
you can't quick draw you can't quick

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.480 
you can't quick draw you can't quick
scope<00:03:29.150> period<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.320> if<00:03:30.470> Infinity<00:03:30.920> Ward<00:03:31.100> really

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490
