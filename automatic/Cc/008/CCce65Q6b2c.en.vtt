00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
for me to find videos actually for some

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.669 
for me to find videos actually for some
reason<00:00:41.539> of<00:00:41.719> how<00:00:41.839> to<00:00:41.899> do<00:00:42.109> this<00:00:42.260> even<00:00:42.559> though<00:00:42.649> I

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:42.679 
reason of how to do this even though I

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:45.099 
reason of how to do this even though I
saw<00:00:42.949> it<00:00:43.010> in<00:00:43.219> a<00:00:43.429> video<00:00:43.699> anyway<00:00:44.629> I'm<00:00:44.870> going<00:00:45.019> to

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:45.109 
saw it in a video anyway I'm going to

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:46.750 
saw it in a video anyway I'm going to
show<00:00:45.199> you<00:00:45.230> quick<00:00:45.499> quick<00:00:45.949> little<00:00:46.190> features<00:00:46.579> of

just switch it to again it'll do the set

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.319 
just switch it to again it'll do the set
keys<00:01:00.920> these<00:01:01.429> are<00:01:01.609> the<00:01:01.670> keys<00:01:01.850> that<00:01:01.969> I<00:01:02.089> have

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
doing that it was just doing it in a

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.080 
doing that it was just doing it in a
different<00:02:49.190> setting<00:02:49.370> anyway<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.760> don't<00:02:50.030> know

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
different setting anyway I don't know

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.840 
different setting anyway I don't know
what<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.170> heck<00:02:51.290> that<00:02:51.320> was<00:02:51.620> but<00:02:51.860> now<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:52.430> sort

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
what the heck that was but now you sort

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.880 
what the heck that was but now you sort
of<00:02:52.940> have<00:02:53.060> an<00:02:53.180> idea<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.290> mean<00:02:54.470> let<00:02:54.620> me<00:02:54.680> try

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
of have an idea so I mean let me try

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.350 
of have an idea so I mean let me try
again<00:02:55.010> actually<00:02:55.670> let<00:02:55.760> me<00:02:55.819> just<00:02:55.850> change

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
again actually let me just change

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.040 
again actually let me just change
something<00:02:56.630> one<00:02:56.900> sec<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.640> let's<00:02:59.239> just<00:02:59.660> try<00:02:59.810> that

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
something one sec so let's just try that

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
something one sec so let's just try that
again<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:01.670> let's<00:03:01.820> say<00:03:01.970> we're<00:03:02.120> in<00:03:02.239> this<00:03:02.450> mode<00:03:02.720> I

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
again so let's say we're in this mode I

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.759 
again so let's say we're in this mode I
press<00:03:04.070> this<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.459> turn<00:03:04.610> it<00:03:04.640> off<00:03:04.820> then<00:03:05.540> we<00:03:06.530> hold

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
press this and turn it off then we hold

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:16.060 
press this and turn it off then we hold
down<00:03:06.950> this<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.730> this<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:14.620> think<00:03:15.620> it<00:03:15.890> is

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
down this and this I think it is

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:25.210 
down this and this I think it is
responsive<00:03:23.050> well<00:03:24.050> I<00:03:24.080> don't<00:03:24.440> know<00:03:24.500> just<00:03:24.950> you

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
responsive well I don't know just you

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.640 
responsive well I don't know just you
sort<00:03:25.519> of<00:03:25.580> have<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.820> fiddle<00:03:26.030> around<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:26.660> see

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
sort of have to fiddle around and see

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.380 
sort of have to fiddle around and see
what<00:03:27.769> works<00:03:27.980> for<00:03:28.250> you<00:03:28.340> but<00:03:28.580> I<00:03:28.640> eventually

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
what works for you but I eventually

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.390 
what works for you but I eventually
obviously<00:03:29.480> get<00:03:29.900> there<00:03:30.110> this<00:03:30.799> is<00:03:30.950> my<00:03:31.070> favorite

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
obviously get there this is my favorite

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.979 
obviously get there this is my favorite
setting<00:03:31.610> out<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:31.940> them<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:32.239> think<00:03:32.720> it's<00:03:32.840> the

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
setting out of them I think it's the

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.190 
setting out of them I think it's the
coolest<00:03:33.350> and<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:35.150> only<00:03:35.750> thing<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:36.049> wish<00:03:36.170> you

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
coolest and the only thing I wish you

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.229 
coolest and the only thing I wish you
would<00:03:36.410> do<00:03:36.530> is<00:03:36.650> if<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.920> fade<00:03:37.220> it<00:03:37.340> out<00:03:37.489> you<00:03:38.150> know

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
would do is if you fade it out you know

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.940 
would do is if you fade it out you know
what<00:03:38.329> I<00:03:38.360> mean<00:03:38.450> if<00:03:38.600> it<00:03:38.720> faded<00:03:39.049> I<00:03:39.140> put<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.440> all

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
what I mean if it faded I put it all
