melting torch a few months ago someone
requested<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:16.640> video<00:00:17.900> demonstration<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.109> how

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
requested a video demonstration of how

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.990 
requested a video demonstration of how
it<00:00:19.859> works<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:21.140> kind<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.260> forgot<00:00:22.680> about<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:23.010> and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
it works I kind of forgot about it and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.009 
it works I kind of forgot about it and
now<00:00:24.470> it's<00:00:25.470> time<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.680> test<00:00:26.039> it

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
now it's time to test it

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.749 
now it's time to test it
what<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.189> have<00:00:29.189> here<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> piece<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.750> cardboard

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
what I have here is a piece of cardboard

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:40.540 
what I have here is a piece of cardboard
some<00:00:32.759> wood<00:00:35.390> an<00:00:36.390> aluminum<00:00:38.329> beer<00:00:39.329> cane<00:00:39.629> and

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
some wood an aluminum beer cane and

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.619 
some wood an aluminum beer cane and
slightly<00:00:41.550> thicker<00:00:42.649> iron<00:00:43.649> either<00:00:45.110> part<00:00:46.110> ape

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
slightly thicker iron either part ape

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.619 
slightly thicker iron either part ape
something

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
something

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.630 
something
let's<00:00:50.289> see<00:00:50.440> how<00:00:50.559> it<00:00:50.710> works<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:52.629> not<00:00:52.870> on<00:00:53.640> it's

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
let's see how it works it's not on it's

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:30.790 
let's see how it works it's not on it's
not<00:00:54.879> a<00:00:54.910> maximum<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.980> almost<00:00:57.519> there

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.440 

I<00:01:32.740> should<00:01:33.740> say<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:35.830> there<00:01:36.830> are<00:01:37.070> about<00:01:37.450> minus

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
I should say that there are about minus

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.420 
I should say that there are about minus
10<00:01:39.230> degrees<00:01:39.710> Celsius<00:01:39.740> outside<00:01:41.290> right<00:01:42.290> now

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.420 

they<00:01:46.430> said<00:01:46.760> that<00:01:47.630> this<00:01:47.960> flame<00:01:48.350> which<00:01:48.770> is<00:01:49.870> 3000

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
they said that this flame which is 3000

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.140 
they said that this flame which is 3000
degrees<00:01:52.430> Celsius<00:01:53.060> but<00:01:53.660> I<00:01:53.720> kind<00:01:54.260> of<00:01:54.350> doubt<00:01:54.590> it

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
degrees Celsius but I kind of doubt it

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:15.220 
degrees Celsius but I kind of doubt it
let's<00:01:56.150> see<00:01:56.390> how<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.720> goes<00:01:56.960> on<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:58.130> wood

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.030 

no<00:02:16.230> problem<00:02:16.890> as<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.490> can<00:02:17.610> see<00:02:18.530> absolutely<00:02:19.530> no

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
no problem as you can see absolutely no

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:41.220 
no problem as you can see absolutely no
problem<00:02:20.870> let's<00:02:21.870> see<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.200> on<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:23.070> aluminum

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:52.710 

it<00:02:41.830> should<00:02:42.099> melt<00:02:42.400> it

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:01.790 

I<00:02:52.810> don't<00:02:53.620> see<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.780> paint<00:02:56.080> is<00:02:56.350> just<00:02:56.880> burning

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:10.860 

let's<00:03:02.800> try<00:03:03.220> higher<00:03:03.760> setting

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.560 

oh<00:03:11.069> it<00:03:12.069> burned<00:03:12.340> through<00:03:12.569> so<00:03:13.569> it<00:03:13.750> works

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:26.410 

it<00:03:18.570> melted<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.050> aluminum<00:03:22.550> see<00:03:23.810> it's<00:03:24.810> true

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
it melted the aluminum see it's true

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.770 
it melted the aluminum see it's true
hope<00:03:27.420> I'm<00:03:27.630> in<00:03:27.780> frame<00:03:32.060> let's<00:03:33.060> see<00:03:33.240> the<00:03:33.480> thicker

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
hope I'm in frame let's see the thicker

00:03:33.780 --> 00:05:04.540 
hope I'm in frame let's see the thicker
material

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.640 

it<00:05:05.090> can<00:05:05.420> get<00:05:05.660> through

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.180 

I<00:05:08.680> might<00:05:09.460> get<00:05:09.760> better<00:05:10.600> results<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:12.040> better

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
I might get better results the better

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:24.470 
I might get better results the better
lighter<00:05:15.190> fluid<00:05:18.510> but<00:05:19.510> that's<00:05:20.470> about<00:05:20.770> it

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:33.990 

Montes<00:05:30.990> bye-bye
