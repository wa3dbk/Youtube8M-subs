00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
can see it you get a survival island you

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.260 
can see it you get a survival island you
get<00:00:30.179> one<00:00:30.510> tree<00:00:30.960> look<00:00:31.650> at<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.040> tree<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.969> if

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
get one tree look at that one tree so if

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.889 
get one tree look at that one tree so if
you<00:00:33.360> break<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.690> tree<00:00:33.899> down<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:35.630> if<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.719> did

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you break this tree down and if you did

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.740 
you break this tree down and if you did
not<00:00:37.020> get<00:00:37.260> any<00:00:37.380> leaves<00:00:37.739> or<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.360> sapling<00:00:39.360> from<00:00:39.600> it

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
it'll take a little while but along the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.619 
it'll take a little while but along the
way<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.430> start<00:00:59.940> minding<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.449> oars

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
way you can start minding for oars

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.770 
way you can start minding for oars
there's<00:01:01.050> iron<00:01:01.739> there's<00:01:02.300> cold<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> passed

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
there's iron there's cold that I passed

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.020 
there's iron there's cold that I passed
earlier<00:01:04.320> let's<00:01:05.070> make<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.280> quick<00:01:05.489> right<00:01:08.030> not

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
earlier let's make it quick right not

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.660 
earlier let's make it quick right not
too<00:01:09.299> far<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.080> you'll<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.490> kind<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.520> walk

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
too far but you'll have to kind of walk

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.149 
too far but you'll have to kind of walk
down<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> little<00:01:12.150> bit<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.600> all<00:01:13.320> these<00:01:13.500> lights<00:01:13.740> go

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
down a little bit so all these lights go

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.780 
down a little bit so all these lights go
down<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.430> actually<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.390> made<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> hole<00:01:15.960> right

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
down and actually I made a hole right

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.070 
down and actually I made a hole right
there<00:01:18.439> look<00:01:19.439> at<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.820> two<00:01:20.820> ravines<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.630> you

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
there look at this two ravines as you

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.100 
there look at this two ravines as you
can<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.409> side-by-side<00:01:22.680> tons<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.520> lava<00:01:24.110> these

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
can see side-by-side tons of lava these

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.370 
can see side-by-side tons of lava these
ravines<00:01:25.409> go<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.979> long<00:01:26.340> long<00:01:26.939> way<00:01:27.240> also<00:01:27.720> both

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
ravines go on a long long way also both

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.920 
ravines go on a long long way also both
directions<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.520> also<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.329> saw<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.630> there

middle of this ravine below your
survival<00:01:43.920> island<00:01:44.360> I<00:01:45.380> like<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.530> see<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.100> next

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
survival island I like to see the next

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.530 
survival island I like to see the next
video<00:01:47.430> I'm<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
video I'm going to have is going to be a

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.330 
video I'm going to have is going to be a
seed<00:01:48.810> kind<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.829> really<00:01:50.159> cool

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
seed kind of like this to a really cool

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.550 
seed kind of like this to a really cool
seed<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.450> one<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.930> thought<00:01:52.170> was<00:01:52.320> pretty

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
seed but this one I thought was pretty

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.520 
seed but this one I thought was pretty
good<00:01:52.799> Minecon<00:01:53.490> 2012<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.750> over<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.380> can

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
good Minecon 2012 it is over but you can

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.560 
good Minecon 2012 it is over but you can
still<00:01:55.740> type<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> seeds<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.700> get<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.299> really

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
still type in the seeds and get a really

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.950 
still type in the seeds and get a really
great<00:01:57.990> seed<00:01:58.409> mine<00:01:58.890> shaft<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.549> a<00:02:00.119> ravine<00:02:00.479> double

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
great seed mine shaft in a ravine double

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.889 
great seed mine shaft in a ravine double
ravine<00:02:01.320> with<00:02:01.920> tons<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.340> lava<00:02:02.869> below<00:02:03.869> a
