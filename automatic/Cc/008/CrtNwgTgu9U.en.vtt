four<00:00:00.269> ways<00:00:00.510> to<00:00:01.079> make<00:00:01.740> your<00:00:02.129> brain<00:00:02.460> work<00:00:02.939> better

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
four ways to make your brain work better

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.410 
four ways to make your brain work better
for<00:00:03.840> you<00:00:04.759> let's<00:00:05.759> make<00:00:05.910> your<00:00:06.000> brain<00:00:06.210> work

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
for you let's make your brain work

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.250 
for you let's make your brain work
better<00:00:06.480> for<00:00:06.870> you<00:00:06.930> one<00:00:07.859> more<00:00:08.580> sleep<00:00:09.260> science

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
better for you one more sleep science

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.140 
better for you one more sleep science
still<00:00:10.469> has<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.740> lot<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.190> learn<00:00:11.370> about<00:00:11.639> sleep

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
still has a lot to learn about sleep

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.839 
still has a lot to learn about sleep
deprivation<00:00:12.300> effects<00:00:12.929> on<00:00:13.110> us<00:00:13.259> but<00:00:13.849> research

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
deprivation effects on us but research

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.220 
deprivation effects on us but research
is<00:00:15.030> starting<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.480> look<00:00:15.630> pretty<00:00:15.690> grave

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
is starting to look pretty grave

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.840 
is starting to look pretty grave
especially<00:00:16.949> in<00:00:17.010> light<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.340> new<00:00:17.550> study

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
especially in light of the new study

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.120 
especially in light of the new study
suggesting<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.140> critical<00:00:19.920> a

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
suggesting that it is critical a

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.880 
suggesting that it is critical a
critical<00:00:20.340> function<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.300> sleep<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:22.050> purge

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
critical function of sleep is to purge

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.040 
critical function of sleep is to purge
the<00:00:23.160> brain<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.869> biochemical<00:00:24.869> waste

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the brain of a biochemical waste

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.230 
the brain of a biochemical waste
products<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.830> are<00:00:26.220> results<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:27.029> our

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
products that are results that our

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.290 
products that are results that our
result<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.349> conscious<00:00:29.099> brain<00:00:29.609> activity

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
result of a conscious brain activity

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.810 
result of a conscious brain activity
this<00:00:30.869> means<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.410> not<00:00:31.590> sleeping<00:00:32.099> enough<00:00:32.309> can

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
this means that not sleeping enough can

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.100 
this means that not sleeping enough can
contribute<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.270> buildup<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.780> harmful

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
contribute to buildup of harmful

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.330 
contribute to buildup of harmful
proteins<00:00:34.620> like<00:00:35.579> beta<00:00:35.969> AMP<00:00:36.300> beta<00:00:36.899> amyloid

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
proteins like beta AMP beta amyloid

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.910 
proteins like beta AMP beta amyloid
which<00:00:38.340> will<00:00:38.670> turn<00:00:39.110> which<00:00:40.110> basically<00:00:40.500> can<00:00:40.800> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
which will turn which basically can you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.299 
which will turn which basically can you
know<00:00:41.420> degenerate<00:00:42.420> your<00:00:42.690> brain<00:00:42.960> right<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.129> get

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
know degenerate your brain right so get

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.049 
know degenerate your brain right so get
more<00:00:44.520> sleep<00:00:44.960> one<00:00:45.960> stop<00:00:46.860> being<00:00:47.460> an<00:00:47.610> Internet

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
more sleep one stop being an Internet

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.240 
more sleep one stop being an Internet
junkie<00:00:48.600> yes<00:00:49.530> indeed<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:51.090> true<00:00:52.190> using<00:00:53.190> the

Internet in this sort of frantic way is
just<00:00:56.399> bad<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:57.149> us<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.050> says

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
just bad for us this is what it says

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.680 
just bad for us this is what it says
when<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.920> start<00:00:59.129> monkey<00:00:59.489> multitasking<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.480> a

what<00:01:08.909> happens<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.600> cause<00:01:09.750> your<00:01:09.930> brain<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
what happens is you cause your brain to

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.230 
what happens is you cause your brain to
just<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> lot<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.549> your<00:01:11.700> brain<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.060> doing

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
just do a lot and as your brain is doing

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.480 
just do a lot and as your brain is doing
all<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:13.140> sort<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.799> messes<00:01:14.189> up<00:01:14.340> your

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
all that it sort of messes up your

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.700 
all that it sort of messes up your
ability<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.630> think<00:01:16.049> through<00:01:16.200> would<00:01:16.590> have

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
ability to think through would have

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.200 
ability to think through would have
critical<00:01:17.100> reasoning<00:01:17.400> skills<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.909> what<00:01:18.090> they

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
critical reasoning skills so what they

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.350 
critical reasoning skills so what they
suggest<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:19.049> an<00:01:19.830> hour<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.729> half<00:01:20.880> emails

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
suggest is an hour and a half emails

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.940 
suggest is an hour and a half emails
followed<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.080> an<00:01:22.200> hour<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> half<00:01:22.799> of

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
followed in an hour and a half of

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.130 
followed in an hour and a half of
Twitter<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.840> force

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
Twitter and so on so you can force

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.130 
Twitter and so on so you can force
yourself<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.650> keep<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.390> discipline<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.630> use

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
yourself to keep a discipline and use

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.730 
yourself to keep a discipline and use
the<00:01:28.290> tools<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.710> help<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.009> do<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:30.740> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the tools to help you do that and the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.260 
the tools to help you do that and the
third<00:01:31.950> thing<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.400> need<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.579> do<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.909> make<00:01:33.119> sure

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
third thing you need to do to make sure

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.260 
third thing you need to do to make sure
your<00:01:33.450> brain<00:01:33.720> works<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:35.270> practice

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
your brain works for you practice

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.440 
your brain works for you practice
mindfulness<00:01:37.430> there<00:01:38.430> are<00:01:38.579> broad<00:01:38.820> solutions

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
mindfulness there are broad solutions

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.569 
mindfulness there are broad solutions
it's<00:01:39.600> called<00:01:39.810> mindfulness<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.829> what<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.369> do
