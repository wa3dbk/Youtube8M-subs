 first thing is first first first 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.520
 what we are going to do is serve 300 grams 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.860
 of flour with a teaspoon of 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.720

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.780
 of sugar and a few drops of extract of 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.550
 vanilla what you're going to do is beat it 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.369
 until the butter changes its color 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.330
 to a paler color whiter and more or 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.330

 this cream of butter takes us 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.300
 a little while to achieve this volume 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.950
 and make it look like a little more cream 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.330
 pale what is the butter in 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.940
 reality but good you have to follow 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.410
