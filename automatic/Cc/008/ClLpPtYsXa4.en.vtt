00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.760 
depending on how spice the curry paste
is<00:03:10.240> all<00:03:10.450> brown<00:03:10.690> is<00:03:10.810> very<00:03:11.050> so<00:03:11.350> it's<00:03:11.470> up<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.620> you

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
is all brown is very so it's up to you

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.050 
is all brown is very so it's up to you
how<00:03:11.890> much<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.070> really<00:03:12.160> want<00:03:12.490> to<00:03:12.580> use<00:03:12.820> and<00:03:12.970> then

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
how much you really want to use and then

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.700 
how much you really want to use and then
just<00:03:13.210> lightly<00:03:13.390> beat<00:03:13.600> your<00:03:13.720> egg<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.110> again

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
just lightly beat your egg and again

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.630 
just lightly beat your egg and again
this<00:03:14.800> will<00:03:14.950> really<00:03:15.130> find<00:03:15.370> all<00:03:15.520> the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
this will really find all the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.010 
this will really find all the
ingredients<00:03:15.730> together<00:03:16.150> for<00:03:16.480> your<00:03:16.540> fish<00:03:16.750> cakes

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
ingredients together for your fish cakes

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.610 
ingredients together for your fish cakes
and<00:03:17.890> then<00:03:18.820> pour<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.330> into<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.660> fish<00:03:20.440> cake

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
and then pour it into the fish cake

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.970 
and then pour it into the fish cake
mixture<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:23.320> all<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.560> ingredient

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
mixture and that is all the ingredient

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.230 
mixture and that is all the ingredient
and<00:03:24.280> just<00:03:24.520> give<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.730> really<00:03:24.910> good<00:03:25.060> mix

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
and just give it a really good mix

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.450 
and just give it a really good mix
together<00:03:25.390> so<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:25.870> just<00:03:26.050> finds<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.710> really<00:03:27.280> nice

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
together so it just finds a really nice

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.610 
together so it just finds a really nice
mixture<00:03:28.030> that<00:03:28.180> will<00:03:28.270> be<00:03:28.420> able<00:03:28.990> to<00:03:29.230> be<00:03:29.350> shaped

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
mixture that will be able to be shaped

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.530 
mixture that will be able to be shaped
into<00:03:29.860> fish<00:03:30.100> cakes<00:03:30.430> I'm<00:03:31.030> going<00:03:31.240> to<00:03:31.300> do<00:03:31.450> these

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
into fish cakes I'm going to do these

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.170 
into fish cakes I'm going to do these
into<00:03:31.810> started<00:03:32.230> size<00:03:32.380> portions<00:03:32.920> so<00:03:33.220> give<00:03:34.090> them

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
into started size portions so give them

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.790 
into started size portions so give them
a<00:03:34.270> good<00:03:34.390> squeeze<00:03:34.750> together<00:03:34.930> now<00:03:35.320> if<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:35.500> find

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
a good squeeze together now if you find

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.770 
a good squeeze together now if you find
at<00:03:35.920> this<00:03:36.070> stage<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.700> mixture<00:03:37.300> isn't<00:03:37.570> binding

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
at this stage the mixture isn't binding

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.120 
at this stage the mixture isn't binding
together<00:03:38.110> too<00:03:38.440> well<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:38.770> obviously<00:03:38.980> all

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
together too well so obviously all

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.320 
together too well so obviously all
ingredients<00:03:39.400> bury<00:03:39.850> that<00:03:39.970> you're<00:03:40.120> going<00:03:40.240> to

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
ingredients bury that you're going to

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.760 
ingredients bury that you're going to
use<00:03:40.390> some<00:03:40.570> curry<00:03:40.960> pastes<00:03:41.410> are<00:03:41.470> going<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.710> be

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
use some curry pastes are going to be

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.710 
use some curry pastes are going to be
slightly<00:03:42.010> wetter<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:42.640> might<00:03:43.270> find<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:43.570> the

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
slightly wetter you might find that the

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.600 
slightly wetter you might find that the
spring<00:03:43.959> onions<00:03:44.260> are<00:03:44.380> more<00:03:44.500> watery<00:03:44.890> if<00:03:45.130> it's

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
spring onions are more watery if it's

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.010 
spring onions are more watery if it's
not<00:03:45.790> holding<00:03:45.970> together<00:03:46.209> you<00:03:46.480> can<00:03:46.660> just<00:03:46.870> add<00:03:46.990> a

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
not holding together you can just add a

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.570 
not holding together you can just add a
couple<00:03:47.290> of<00:03:47.410> spoons<00:03:47.680> of<00:03:47.800> your<00:03:48.130> bread<00:03:48.340> crumbs

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
couple of spoons of your bread crumbs

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.620 
couple of spoons of your bread crumbs
that<00:03:48.670> you're<00:03:48.850> going<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.030> coat<00:03:49.240> these<00:03:49.390> with

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
that you're going to coat these with

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.150 
that you're going to coat these with
afterwards<00:03:50.110> and<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.590> will<00:03:50.680> just<00:03:50.740> hold<00:03:50.950> all

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
afterwards and that will just hold all

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.370 
afterwards and that will just hold all
those<00:03:51.250> ingredients<00:03:51.459> together<00:03:52.140> so<00:03:53.140> there<00:03:53.290> we

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
breadcrumbs will burn and you won't heat

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.660

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.190 
up the actual fish cakes throughout the
center<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.480> then<00:04:33.570> you<00:04:33.690> just<00:04:33.810> want<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.050> pop

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
center and then you just want to pop

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.330 
center and then you just want to pop
them<00:04:34.380> into<00:04:34.950> this<00:04:36.140> oil<00:04:37.140> and<00:04:37.770> just<00:04:38.010> start<00:04:38.220> to

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
them into this oil and just start to

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.220 
them into this oil and just start to
hear<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.520> little<00:04:38.790> bit<00:04:38.970> of<00:04:39.060> a<00:04:39.150> sizzle<00:04:39.480> so<00:04:40.140> you're

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
hear a little bit of a sizzle so you're

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.450 
hear a little bit of a sizzle so you're
probably<00:04:40.470> better<00:04:40.680> off<00:04:40.830> doing<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:41.160> few<00:04:41.310> at<00:04:41.430> a

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
probably better off doing a few at a

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.860 
probably better off doing a few at a
time<00:04:41.520> nothing<00:04:42.150> worse<00:04:42.300> than<00:04:42.420> her<00:04:42.570> over

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
time nothing worse than her over

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.720 
time nothing worse than her over
crowding<00:04:43.200> your<00:04:43.290> pan<00:04:43.560> it<00:04:44.130> takes<00:04:44.340> up<00:04:44.490> too<00:04:44.640> much

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
crowding your pan it takes up too much

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.820 
crowding your pan it takes up too much
of<00:04:44.880> that<00:04:45.000> heat<00:04:45.360> so<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.200> fish<00:04:46.350> cakes<00:04:46.590> have<00:04:46.710> been

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
of that heat so the fish cakes have been

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.990 
of that heat so the fish cakes have been
cooking<00:04:47.130> just<00:04:47.280> for<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.430> few<00:04:47.490> minutes<00:04:47.670> on<00:04:47.970> one
