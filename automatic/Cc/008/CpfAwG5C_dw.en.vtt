firstly how this USB cable get up stand

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:44.280 
firstly how this USB cable get up stand
up<00:01:29.590> cable<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:36.729> is<00:01:38.729> run<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:40.170> power<00:01:41.170> supply<00:01:43.290> it

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
up cable this is run a power supply it

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.830 
up cable this is run a power supply it
is<00:01:44.409> empowered<00:01:44.920> by<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.130> USB<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.210> so<00:01:46.479> is<00:01:46.720> the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
is empowered by the USB and so is the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.410 
is empowered by the USB and so is the
desktop<00:01:47.229> one<00:01:47.440> but<00:01:48.280> you<00:01:48.369> want<00:01:48.580> reliability<00:01:49.060> you

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
desktop one but you want reliability you

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.719 
desktop one but you want reliability you
want<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.720> power<00:01:49.899> pack<00:01:50.229> find<00:01:51.130> in<00:01:51.280> there<00:01:51.490> if

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
want the power pack find in there if

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.219 
want the power pack find in there if
your<00:01:51.880> coffee<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.300> drover<00:01:52.840> if<00:01:52.899> there's<00:01:53.170> a

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
your coffee and a drover if there's a

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.700 
your coffee and a drover if there's a
problem<00:01:53.500> with<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.710> pc<00:01:54.130> runs<00:01:54.490> out<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.670> power

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
problem with the pc runs out of power

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.650 
problem with the pc runs out of power
you<00:01:56.710> could<00:01:56.950> lose<00:01:57.160> your<00:01:57.220> data<00:01:57.550> and<00:01:58.000> probably

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
you could lose your data and probably

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.810 
you could lose your data and probably
worse<00:01:59.280> so<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.670> is<00:02:00.729> powered<00:02:02.250> okay<00:02:03.250> you<00:02:03.670> have

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
worse so it is powered okay you have

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:18.380 
worse so it is powered okay you have
that<00:02:04.000> as<00:02:04.149> well<00:02:10.380> take<00:02:11.380> apple<00:02:16.079> device<00:02:17.079> itself

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
that as well take apple device itself

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.990 
that as well take apple device itself
let's<00:02:19.390> call<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.959> thing<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.290> get<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:20.620> in<00:02:24.000> here

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
let's call the thing and get it in here

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.630 
let's call the thing and get it in here
you<00:02:25.120> have<00:02:25.269> it<00:02:25.650> open<00:02:26.650> up<00:02:33.120> nice<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.150> Lille<00:02:34.570> wraps

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
you have it open up nice and Lille wraps

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.850 
you have it open up nice and Lille wraps
so<00:02:36.640> this<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:36.970> machine<00:02:40.500> that's<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.650> front

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
so this is the machine that's the front

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:50.100 
so this is the machine that's the front
of<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:43.530> see<00:02:44.530> that

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.880 

ok<00:02:51.270> so<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.360> back<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.750> got<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.440> USB

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
ok so the back of it got the USB

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.060 
ok so the back of it got the USB
connector<00:02:55.110> got<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.200> power<00:02:56.380> supply<00:02:56.620> and

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
connector got the power supply and

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.050 
connector got the power supply and
that's<00:02:57.400> pretty<00:02:57.760> much<00:02:57.880> all<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.970> is

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
that's pretty much all it is it is

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.290 
that's pretty much all it is it is
fairly<00:03:01.330> heavy<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:04.150> it's<00:03:04.270> a<00:03:04.330> nice<00:03:04.800> metal<00:03:05.800> case

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
fairly heavy but it's a nice metal case

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.220 
fairly heavy but it's a nice metal case
it's<00:03:07.300> got<00:03:07.510> rubber<00:03:09.330> seals<00:03:10.330> at<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.690> end<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:11.020> guess

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
it's got rubber seals at the end I guess

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.470 
it's got rubber seals at the end I guess
to<00:03:11.410> keep<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.830> steady<00:03:12.520> so<00:03:12.850> doesn't<00:03:13.150> move<00:03:13.330> around

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
to keep it steady so doesn't move around

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.210 
to keep it steady so doesn't move around
doesn't<00:03:14.380> fall<00:03:14.710> off<00:03:14.740> any<00:03:14.980> work<00:03:15.360> surfaces<00:03:17.220> and

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
doesn't fall off any work surfaces and

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.090 
doesn't fall off any work surfaces and
it<00:03:18.340> looks<00:03:18.490> pretty<00:03:18.610> slick<00:03:18.850> I<00:03:19.060> think<00:03:19.740> so<00:03:20.740> i'm

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
it looks pretty slick I think so i'm

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.780 
it looks pretty slick I think so i'm
going<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.310> use<00:03:21.520> this<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.880> back<00:03:22.030> up<00:03:22.180> my<00:03:22.209> pc<00:03:23.790> with

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
going to use this to back up my pc with

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
going to use this to back up my pc with
all<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.120> music<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:26.020> data<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:27.130> pictures

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
all the music the data the pictures

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.750 
all the music the data the pictures
everything<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.820> just<00:03:30.820> keep<00:03:31.239> it<00:03:31.360> upstairs

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
everything and just keep it upstairs

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.360 
everything and just keep it upstairs
that's<00:03:33.760> all<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.060> need<00:03:34.209> it<00:03:34.330> for<00:03:34.510> really<00:03:35.370> it's

this is pretty much the same kind of
thing<00:04:49.499> to<00:04:49.770> support<00:04:50.249> so<00:04:50.729> there's<00:04:50.969> not<00:04:51.089> much

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949

user<00:04:52.949> manuals<00:04:53.430> with<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:54.499> this<00:04:55.499> is<00:04:55.649> pretty<00:04:55.889> much

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
user manuals with it this is pretty much

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.969 
user manuals with it this is pretty much
it<00:04:56.659> but<00:04:57.659> it<00:04:57.779> is<00:04:57.839> pretty<00:04:58.199> much<00:04:58.379> you<00:04:58.589> plug<00:04:58.830> and

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
it but it is pretty much you plug and

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.889 
it but it is pretty much you plug and
play<00:05:00.949> into<00:05:01.949> the<00:05:02.099> USB<00:05:02.369> connector<00:05:03.270> plug<00:05:03.629> it<00:05:03.749> in

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:03.899 
play into the USB connector plug it in

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:06.100 
play into the USB connector plug it in
and<00:05:04.169> where<00:05:04.619> you<00:05:04.740> go<00:05:04.889> and<00:05:05.039> it<00:05:05.189> should<00:05:05.399> show<00:05:05.669> up

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
and where you go and it should show up

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.969 
and where you go and it should show up
so<00:05:07.110> that's<00:05:07.319> about<00:05:07.589> it<00:05:07.819> there<00:05:08.819> it<00:05:08.969> is<00:05:09.029> again<00:05:09.979> the

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
so that's about it there it is again the

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:16.070 
so that's about it there it is again the
hard<00:05:11.159> drive<00:05:12.620> power<00:05:13.620> supply<00:05:14.629> which<00:05:15.629> goes<00:05:15.899> in

hard drive power supply which goes in

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:24.529 
hard drive power supply which goes in
there<00:05:18.710> and<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:20.129> USB<00:05:21.499> which<00:05:23.330> that<00:05:24.330> end

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
formatted I believe as fat so if you

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.829 
formatted I believe as fat so if you
want<00:05:38.159> security<00:05:38.490> on<00:05:38.819> it<00:05:38.969> you<00:05:39.180> need<00:05:39.360> to<00:05:39.479> form<00:05:39.719> a
