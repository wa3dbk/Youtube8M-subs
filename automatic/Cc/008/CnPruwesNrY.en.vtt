 show you now listen to me gsm is 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.570
 I'll be demonstrating now from 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.679
 with putting that chip out with 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.289
 safety 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.529
 remembering that any wax breakage 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.390
 either from the device or microchips 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.890
 automatically loses the warranty before 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.080
 vote for a real one 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.949
 for you to have an idea of ​​the size of the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.220
 appliance 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.080
 I'll put it here, this is the size of the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.079
 as you can see the currency of 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.570
 a real one picks up almost everywhere 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.570
 from above the appliance and there it is dah 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.309
 to get an idea of how the device 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.309
 take the coin down here on the side here 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.829
 So you do not get the phone to show 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.230
 You have an alloy button here. 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.440
 turn this off if it's safe north 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.570
 ensure that slb 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.390
 here the camera is very small 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.609
 this part to the data cable that goes here 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.570
 for you to feed him in strength to 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:07.110
 load and here the microphone 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.360
 this back here is where you go 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.820
 to open the lid how do you do it 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.680
 to open very simple without exerting force 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.740
 people remembering that this device does not 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.930
 must make a little noise press 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.470
 slightly down and pulls a little to the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.400
 right 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.860
 I took this here is the device remembering 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.520
 these safety seals should never 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.720
 to be violated 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.750
 automatically loses personal guarantee 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.880

 here are the two chips a micro sd goes 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.909
 here and the data chip goes here as 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.130
 is the unlocking the two is practically 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.990
 Just like you, can someone here and there? 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.360

 here will pull forth toward 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.360
 It's very simple, it does not require force if you 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.509
 is putting on military strength has 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.350
 something wrong you should not place forces 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.100
 pollen here I'll pull right one 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.429
 noise 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.979
 if you pull here April 3rd 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.650
 now even here you pull a 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.590
 a little 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.620
 and then he's the one here because it's a position 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.470
 here a little bit to take I do not have 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.000
 it's no use seeing that I can not 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.879
 it is loose it can also 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.489
 lifted a little and then wii 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.780
 so you can not do it for yourself 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:38.700
 close the two for example he turns him 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:42.250
 rocked a little bit and the two to 15 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.799
 placing the chip and putting a chip 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.510
 had this device is quadband fusion 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:51.940
 with any chip from Brazil 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.849
 the gsm chip here from any carrier and 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.400
 Download it happened in force 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:01.780

 The noise you're scared of him 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:13.689
 locking micro sd in the same way as 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:18.010
 fit in place closes this here never 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:20.919
 Doing strength with this nail a little to 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.930

 It is already working. 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.500
 manual to get the data 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.840
 This is a demo video for 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.680
 turn on and off and put the chips on 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.690

 force has to be very careful in a 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.040
 small utility tool with lots of 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.090
