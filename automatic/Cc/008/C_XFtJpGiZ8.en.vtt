00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.980
 as a child I liked to look in 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.349
 binoculars and watch nothing 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.429
 suspect people can of course 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.230
 some kind of pathology 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.510
 but nothing myself, I could not 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.210
 childhood has passed but the company panasonic 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.660
 helps me to return to it today we 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:30.109
 let's test the ultrazoom panasonic lumix dmc 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:32.940
 lct 40 42 times optical telescope with 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:36.390
 everything looks standard with a camera 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.370
 typical ultrazoom sizes 126 by 87 on 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.110
 ninety four millimeter button 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.420
 on-off on the top panel 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.320
 next to the record button video lever 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.840
 zoom lens 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.670
 selection wheel at the rear modes 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.649
 under the thumb we find ourselves 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.629
 browsing exposure buttons 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.820
 four-way joystick menu button 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.710
 display information button and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.989
 quick menu button combined with 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.940
 the delete button with the up button 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.969
 built-in flash is to the left of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.890
 her principle outwardly the dignity of this 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.840
 camera almost no way 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.560
 manifest let's try it 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.560
 turn on 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:26.310
 squirrel so op op op op op here about 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.790
 motorcycle and here are the advantages of lumix dmc r 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.860
 z 40 42 times optical mega zoom not 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.990
 it is necessary to approach anywhere that in radius 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.259
 kilometer in a second will be near 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.259
 you 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.080
 chic option for vacation and photo 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.040
 tourism and lawyers will be happy 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.710
 equivalent focal length 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.680
 lens 22900 24 millimeter with 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.400
 aperture 365 is not bad for such a zoom 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.130
 luminosity 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.900
 but not everything is so rosy there are also disadvantages 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.580
 the big picture room winks and 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.070
 stabilizer can not cope if you shoot 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.230
 With the hands of the lens mechanism itself a little 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.970
 brakes and you have to wait when he 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.990
 deigns to bring the next monument 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.760
 architecture 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.760
 although it is not critical if you do not shoot 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.240
 sport or rally for example matrix here and 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.610
 sit down 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.310
 which means beautiful colors and a lot of noise 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.830
 All the more so on sensor size 1 2 and 3 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.690
 shoved 20 megapixels which if 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.650
 only useful for double 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.450
 digital zoom 2x digital zoom 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.530
 so it turns out we can do 10 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.360
 megapixel photo with 80x 4x zoom 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.520
 not bad for such a baby mode 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.560
 shooting standard for panasonic cameras 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.050
 intel engine of the mode is present 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.840
 improving the quality of manual images 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.130
 exposure control available 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.200
 maximum shutter speed 15 seconds 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.830
 minimum 1 and a half thousand on and 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.580
 seconds 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.600
 effective flash power 10 meters 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.280
 there is a wide range of scenes and 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.590
 filters that compensates for the lack 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.630
 manual settings minimum distance 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.420
 macro focus one 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.430
 centimeter shooting raw format is missing 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.520
 display not fixed standards for 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.000
 cheap panasonic 460 thousand models 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.670
 points 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.890
 photo quality is not admirable 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.020
 does not discourage a huge zoom 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.120
 something has to pay it 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.300
 lack of sharpness or position a 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.090
 also focus point misses 9 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.209
 maximum video resolution of 1280 on 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.860
 720 at 30 frames per second quality 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.900
 shooting in low light on 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.300
 Smartphone noise level is not bad 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.550
 detailing the buffer memory is not 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.250
 so there is no serial shooting but there is 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.900
 internal memory 80 megabyte card 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.290
 sd is used 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.560
 maximum capacity of 64 gigabytes of 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.269
 connectors are present only mini usb 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.860
 a battery capacity of 1000 250 milliamperes 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.480
 hours it is enough for an average of 350 shots 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.510
 and battery included yusbi cord 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.630
 charging and strap given democratic 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.000
 the cost of lumix dmc l d 40 most 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.960
 cons can be reconciled the more so 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.370
 there is a huge plus 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.600
 and the absence of competitors who 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.600
 trailing far behind 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.120
 in my opinion it's all if you forgot something 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.340
 sorry 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.360
 subscribe to our channel thanks for 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.360
 attention yet
