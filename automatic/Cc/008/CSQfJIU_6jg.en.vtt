even more volume in the crown area so
what<00:01:35.549> I'm<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.819> do<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.179> add<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.420> little<00:01:36.630> bit

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
what I'm going to do is add a little bit

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.559 
what I'm going to do is add a little bit
of<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> vo5<00:01:37.740> give<00:01:38.159> me<00:01:38.369> texture<00:01:38.969> this<00:01:39.149> is<00:01:39.210> their

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
of the vo5 give me texture this is their

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.020 
of the vo5 give me texture this is their
instant<00:01:40.229> oomph<00:01:40.500> powder<00:01:41.009> I've<00:01:41.340> used<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:41.969> in

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
instant oomph powder I've used this in

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.910 
instant oomph powder I've used this in
videos<00:01:42.450> before<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.289> really<00:01:43.560> does<00:01:43.799> give

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
videos before and this really does give

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.160 
videos before and this really does give
an<00:01:44.250> instant<00:01:44.789> oomph<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> hair<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:46.110> really

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
an instant oomph to the hair it's really

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.289 
an instant oomph to the hair it's really
unique<00:01:46.500> because<00:01:46.679> it's<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.310> powder<00:01:47.580> and<00:01:47.970> then

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
unique because it's a powder and then

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.910 
unique because it's a powder and then
you<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.630> sort<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.899> put<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.289> into<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> hair<00:01:49.740> at

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
you just sort of put it into the hair at

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.399 
you just sort of put it into the hair at
about<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> 45<00:01:50.700> degree<00:01:50.729> angle<00:01:51.060> rub<00:01:51.599> it<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.110> it

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
about a 45 degree angle rub it in and it

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.710 
about a 45 degree angle rub it in and it
just<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.920> does<00:01:53.520> exactly<00:01:53.819> what<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.179> says<00:01:54.209> Linton

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
just it does exactly what it says Linton

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.449 
just it does exactly what it says Linton
gives<00:01:54.959> you<00:01:55.049> an<00:01:55.170> instant<00:01:55.560> oh<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.039> then<00:01:56.220> working

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
gives you an instant oh and then working

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.819 
gives you an instant oh and then working
in<00:01:56.670> sections<00:01:56.970> of<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> crown<00:01:57.780> I'm<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.619> going

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
to take a little bit of hair take the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.569 
to take a little bit of hair take the
instant<00:02:01.289> umph<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:01.709> then<00:02:01.950> apply<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.369> directly

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
instant umph and then apply it directly

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.479 
instant umph and then apply it directly
to<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.750> scalp<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:04.349> that<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.099> little<00:02:05.340> bit

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:05.489 
to the scalp like that just a little bit

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:07.580 
to the scalp like that just a little bit
and<00:02:05.700> then<00:02:06.299> just<00:02:06.450> using<00:02:06.630> my<00:02:06.869> fingertips<00:02:07.200> I'm

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
and then just using my fingertips I'm

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.249 
and then just using my fingertips I'm
just<00:02:07.739> going<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.039> rub<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.549> in<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.299> the<00:02:09.420> root<00:02:09.810> of

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
just going to rub it in to the root of

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.110

fingertips and literally just rub it
into<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.920> roots<00:02:26.130> like<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.870> can't

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:28.139 
into the roots like that and you can't

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:29.990 
into the roots like that and you can't
feel<00:02:28.410> what<00:02:28.470> I'm<00:02:28.829> feeling<00:02:28.859> but<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.519> can<00:02:29.700> feel

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
feel what I'm feeling but you can feel

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.729 
feel what I'm feeling but you can feel
the<00:02:30.239> text<00:02:30.630> you're<00:02:30.780> really<00:02:31.079> building<00:02:31.530> there

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
the text you're really building there

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.500 
the text you're really building there
make<00:02:32.160> sure<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.400> rub<00:02:32.639> it<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.819> really<00:02:33.000> well<00:02:33.299> and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
make sure you rub it in really well and

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.090 
make sure you rub it in really well and
then<00:02:33.870> once<00:02:34.109> we've<00:02:34.290> done<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.590> all<00:02:34.829> over<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
then once we've done this all over the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.039 
then once we've done this all over the
crown<00:02:35.430> we'll<00:02:35.760> have<00:02:35.910> lots<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.269> texture<00:02:36.810> and

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
crown we'll have lots of texture and

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.559 
crown we'll have lots of texture and
lots<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.739> oomph<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.459> our<00:02:38.579> hair<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.150> now<00:02:39.299> that<00:02:39.420> we

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
lots of oomph to our hair so now that we

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.420 
lots of oomph to our hair so now that we
have<00:02:39.600> lots<00:02:40.109> of<00:02:40.290> body<00:02:40.560> in<00:02:40.769> our<00:02:40.859> hair<00:02:41.100> I'm<00:02:41.280> just

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
deeper than I normally would we are

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.979 
deeper than I normally would we are
going<00:02:45.900> for<00:02:46.079> a<00:02:46.109> 60s<00:02:46.680> inspired<00:02:47.359> look<00:02:48.359> okay<00:02:48.930> so

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
leaving the front section out a little

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.770

bit but I just want to smooth over this

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.330 
bit but I just want to smooth over this
crown<00:02:55.170> area<00:02:55.470> because<00:02:55.889> we're<00:02:56.040> going<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.220> be

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
crown area because we're going to be

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.339 
crown area because we're going to be
pulling<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:56.790> back<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.389> we<00:02:57.690> want<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.019> look

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
I don't have a lot of it so that's about

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.820

as<00:03:43.490> big<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.180> bump<00:03:44.510> as<00:03:44.720> I<00:03:44.900> can<00:03:45.290> personally<00:03:45.680> get

modern twist vibe to it and it's

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.040 
modern twist vibe to it and it's
definitely<00:03:52.610> more<00:03:53.180> volume<00:03:53.540> than<00:03:53.630> I'm<00:03:53.750> used<00:03:53.930> to
