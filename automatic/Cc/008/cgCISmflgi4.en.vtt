00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.089 

visibility<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:11.969> would<00:00:12.150> say<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.450> really<00:00:13.099> good

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
visibility I would say is really good

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.359 
visibility I would say is really good
for<00:00:14.309> these<00:00:15.740> especially<00:00:16.740> with<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:16.949> top<00:00:17.190> off

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
for these especially with that top off

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.410 
for these especially with that top off
it<00:00:17.580> just<00:00:17.609> has<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> nice<00:00:18.060> open<00:00:18.210> feel<00:00:23.090> always<00:00:24.090> nice

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
it just has a nice open feel always nice

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.220 
it just has a nice open feel always nice
to<00:00:24.570> look<00:00:24.630> at<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.130> long<00:00:26.130> hood<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.730> front<00:00:30.230> so

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
to look at that long hood in front so

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.049 
to look at that long hood in front so
I'm<00:00:31.439> not<00:00:31.590> sure<00:00:31.800> if<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.219> camera<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.610> picking<00:00:32.700> up

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
I'm not sure if the camera is picking up

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.880 
I'm not sure if the camera is picking up
on<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:33.660> you'll<00:00:33.870> actually<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.380> able<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.649> see

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
on it but you'll actually be able to see

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.229 
on it but you'll actually be able to see
the<00:00:35.070> speedometer<00:00:35.880> right<00:00:36.420> there<00:00:38.180> during<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the speedometer right there during the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.369 
the speedometer right there during the
day<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.570> be<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.719> little<00:00:39.899> bit<00:00:39.989> difficult<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
day it can be a little bit difficult to

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.229 
day it can be a little bit difficult to
see<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> camera<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.879> we're<00:00:41.969> gonna<00:00:42.030> do

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
see on the camera and so we're gonna do

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.819 
see on the camera and so we're gonna do
is<00:00:42.329> watch<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.690> speedometer<00:00:43.170> together<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
is watch that speedometer together and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.950 
is watch that speedometer together and
I'm<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:43.950> going<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.250> slowly<00:00:44.520> press<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.690> pedal

foot-pounds of torque feels like from
the<00:00:50.969> desktop<00:00:51.300> how<00:00:51.539> quickly<00:00:51.780> can<00:00:51.989> get<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.289> about

the desktop how quickly can get to about

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.540 
the desktop how quickly can get to about
660<00:00:53.399> here<00:00:57.590> slow<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.710> down<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> bump

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
660 here slow it down just to the bump

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.560

here

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.760 

nice<00:01:07.140> sound<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> car

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.450 

the<00:01:12.979> suspension<00:01:13.580> on<00:01:13.700> these<00:01:13.850> cars<00:01:14.150> is<00:01:14.420> uh<00:01:15.460> nice

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
the suspension on these cars is uh nice

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.109 
the suspension on these cars is uh nice
and<00:01:16.670> firm<00:01:17.710> but<00:01:18.710> not<00:01:18.860> over<00:01:19.130> overly<00:01:19.610> firm<00:01:19.880> like

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
and firm but not over overly firm like

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.180 
and firm but not over overly firm like
you<00:01:20.299> might<00:01:21.080> have<00:01:21.229> on<00:01:21.380> some<00:01:21.560> of<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.740> older<00:01:21.979> sea

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
you might have on some of the older sea

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.010 
you might have on some of the older sea
forests<00:01:22.640> where<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:23.150> really<00:01:23.390> feel<00:01:23.420> every<00:01:23.840> bump

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
forests where you really feel every bump

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.350 
forests where you really feel every bump
in<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.290> road<00:01:24.430> so<00:01:25.430> they<00:01:25.550> definitely<00:01:25.820> have<00:01:26.150> more

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
in the road so they definitely have more

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.060 
in the road so they definitely have more
refined<00:01:26.810> suspension<00:01:27.470> on<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:27.740> one

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.250 

since<00:01:31.490> disability<00:01:32.120> is<00:01:32.210> nice<00:01:32.480> as<00:01:32.750> I<00:01:32.870> mentioned

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
since disability is nice as I mentioned

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:40.090 
since disability is nice as I mentioned
before<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:38.530> think<00:01:39.530> this<00:01:39.650> year's<00:01:39.830> gonna<00:01:39.920> be<00:01:40.010> a

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
before I think this year's gonna be a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.310 
before I think this year's gonna be a
great<00:01:40.310> year<00:01:40.490> for<00:01:40.520> you<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.730> buy<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:40.940> SEAT<00:01:41.210> vibes

Corvettes<00:01:52.570> now

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.690 

we're<00:02:00.259> starting<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.560> see<00:02:00.649> a<00:02:00.740> pop<00:02:01.009> up<00:02:01.039> an<00:02:01.310> option

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
we're starting to see a pop up an option

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.940 
we're starting to see a pop up an option
and<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.659> good<00:02:02.929> value

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.770 

trying<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.670> give<00:02:07.759> you<00:02:07.880> an<00:02:07.970> idea<00:02:08.090> what<00:02:08.599> it<00:02:08.750> feels

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
trying to give you an idea what it feels

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.719 
trying to give you an idea what it feels
like

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
like

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.380 
like
I<00:02:10.819> think<00:02:11.360> this<00:02:11.510> turned<00:02:11.810> about<00:02:12.080> 25<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.180> just

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
I think this turned about 25 and it just

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.850 
I think this turned about 25 and it just
slices<00:02:14.900> on<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.080> road<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.379> almost<00:02:15.560> feels<00:02:15.799> like

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
slices on the road it almost feels like

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.259 
slices on the road it almost feels like
there's<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.159> little<00:02:16.220> bit<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.489> extra<00:02:16.700> gravity<00:02:17.000> in

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
there's a little bit of extra gravity in

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.230 
there's a little bit of extra gravity in
the<00:02:17.360> atmosphere

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.880 

you<00:02:20.720> don't<00:02:20.900> want<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:21.080> overdo<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.650> want<00:02:21.830> to

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
you don't want to overdo it you want to

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.250 
you don't want to overdo it you want to
get<00:02:22.040> used<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.460> car<00:02:22.870> because<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:23.990> really

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
get used to the car because it really

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.150 
get used to the car because it really
does<00:02:24.440> perform<00:02:24.650> like<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.130> beast

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.120 

we<00:02:30.250> want<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.820> take<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.060> time<00:02:31.270> before<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.660> go

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
we want to take the time before you go

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.900 
we want to take the time before you go
place<00:02:33.130> around<00:02:33.340> turn<00:02:33.580> it's<00:02:33.670> too<00:02:33.820> quick<00:02:34.170> but

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910
