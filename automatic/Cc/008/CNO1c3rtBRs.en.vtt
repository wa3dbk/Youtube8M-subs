00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.330
 and here is the Mohican and before you start 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.759
 the scareware templates and today I invite 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.759
 you to access my blog 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.580
 www.blogdolfg.com.br the videos here do 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.150
 sputum and also exclusive content 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.429
 I divulge there or coming back here to 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.550
 What matters is not only the best ways 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.500
 and the fighting that has already begun 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.440
 I do not live without him anymore. 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.410
 mod earth-air hands that adds the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.210
 Earth Game Armor Scale 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.719
 in like this one that I'm using 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.789
 both armor and hobbies and they 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.700
 they are very easy to do 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.620
 You just have to come down here and do not 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.280
 you need to have none nearby because 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.039
 appear here the armor waits then 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.399
 You have all of them here that range from 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.470
 heavy to light armor and also rob 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.610
 including some delighted as this 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.820
 here o 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.740
 and I do not translate this template guys 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.689
 because it gets better organized 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.250
 English or translate if it was going to be half 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.170
 messy 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.460
 so I thought it best not to enter until 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.439
 because it does not matter so much 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.830
 so it is always organized in 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.720
 Forming glove boot here in English in 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.049
 descriptions of the enchanted ones are 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.060
 Portuguese and who uses the translation is 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.979
 that the wave of armor is with you 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.670
 You can see very cool, very well. 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:44.750
 made are carried there in the game land 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.750
 I'll show you some more here a hobby 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.710
 very good works fine with mode 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.710
 I have already shown here 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.750
 Look at this hobby. 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.750
 It gives even the desire to play as a mage. 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.960
 but some here light amateur 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.610
 the tender game that has some of the 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.790
 most beautiful armor of all games 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.860
 already done, and then it was a size that 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.800
 It was very welcome here, the beef country. 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.900
 even there who does not play with the character 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.780
 can forge there to give her 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.380
 said today for example the lily will 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.160
 leave her there more beautiful 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:43.170
 demonstrating only some here has much more 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:45.920
 there they are in the forge too and they are well 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.920
 varied 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.640
 They are also very strong, not with 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.490
 You may be coming and it wants to 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.500
 to say that you will be able to stay with him 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.260
 leaving with a good time are not so 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.740
 difficult as soon as it was already gone 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.790
 world is to create your ways out 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.490
 tranquilly for sure you will 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.630
 find a mature woman who likes it and you 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.110
 may also be changing the inem 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.110
 to nauseate 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:29.150
 I think there has to show enough 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.790
 another cool model that I like is a 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.670
 High mount on the team really this 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.400
 mold it causes is one of the joe 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.800
 that you are using when 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.860
 you go into passive mode either 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.630
 automatically equipped as you 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.540
 You see that I go into combat and 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:52.430
 put in his vote the normal way he 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.959
 withdraws which makes it much easier because you 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.209
 You do not have to keep coming here on the menu 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.430
 every time you have a helmet and you do not have 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.110
 very useful when you are not in 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.430
 combat mode 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.680
 then it is a hatred that greatly facilitates the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.260
 life 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.769
 Another nice motto is that the racing 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:16.100
 Rude team that adds this hood here 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:19.760
 What are you seeing even here? 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.859
 a back him here and he 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.830
 add that hair and that you 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.870
 are you seeing this little bunch he's part of? 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.240
 of the hood 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.580
 however it is not a hair not only will 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.289
 appear when you are wearing hood 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.010
 does not interfere with your hair at all 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.600
 current is there are several versions here with 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.530
 different colors 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.640
 you do them in the leather forging is 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.640
 good to do 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.850
 they can be delighted with their 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:58.339
 the intention of those where I did and there has 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:01.469
 various colors or consistency and white and 

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:04.229
 There's the yellow one over here. 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:05.610
 No translation, but I 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.489
 I'll be making production available 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.249
 As soon as I finish this video here I 

00:05:08.489 --> 00:05:12.479
 I 'll make you a translation, I 'll go to you. 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:15.509
 They will find there 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:18.019
 in the description of the video although there pro 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:21.360
 our last mode today 

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:23.999
 to finish the cockpit mold pro 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.739
 with this template guys will be added 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:28.949
 a bar that every time you go 

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:32.729
 open a full door lock 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:35.789
 paul off that will have that mark and blue 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:38.309
 here is going to be an exact place where you 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:44.999
 will open locks not only put the 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:50.339
 gaza here and jirak that she will open the 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:52.889
 door or trunk or is any kind of 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:55.829
 lock here game 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:06:00.499
 This template, despite being a chite 

00:05:55.829 --> 00:06:02.909
 it will save your pecs there 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:06.029
 burglary or why you will not 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:08.879
 need to use pecs for burglary and with 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:12.809
 this you will be able to use these pecs in 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:14.879
 other important things here are 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:18.599
 I do not think I play a game. 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:21.479
 waste the moment because 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:26.009
 the items that you usually do not 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:28.889
 There's nothing much of value there. 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:32.159
 to show here in the safe and that belly 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:34.889
 here it will be the size of the 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:36.990
 level or spill here in this case 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:40.080
 what is learned so she is little 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.939
 When you go and get some 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.949
 lock it deserves you will see 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:46.259
 that this blue bar here will be fine 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:49.229
 even though it is the only point 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:51.389
 you had to hit a tip and the 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.639
 staff that is the moment 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.240
 faster faster there breaking the gauzes 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.860
 huh 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.439
 you can put it in red 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.169
 when the rapidion is there and it breaks 

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:02.909
 always a politician a little bit of this 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:06.059
 The way you are going to open all the coffers 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:08.460
 of baa1 and will not need to spend pec 

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:11.219
 go on stealing even because 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:14.069
 you will hardly find something that 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:15.629
 it's worth it and in these neighborhoods 

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:17.849
 So that's it folks this was the 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:20.669
 sputum molds of today I hope you 

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:24.050
 have liked and until the next all of 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:24.050
 good for you always
