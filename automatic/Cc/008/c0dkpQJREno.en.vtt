we had a brand-new CBRN with South Bay
riders<00:00:43.280> what<00:00:44.280> was<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.520> two<00:00:44.760> weeks<00:00:44.940> ago

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
riders what was that two weeks ago

riders what was that two weeks ago
something<00:00:46.230> like<00:00:46.379> brand-new<00:00:48.379> one<00:00:49.379> leg<00:00:49.590> was

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
something like brand-new one leg was

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.910 
something like brand-new one leg was
pinched<00:00:50.809> one<00:00:51.809> caliper<00:00:52.289> wasn't<00:00:52.620> working

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
pinched one caliper wasn't working

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.110 
pinched one caliper wasn't working
properly<00:00:53.160> at<00:00:53.730> 1200<00:00:54.360> miles<00:00:55.160> so<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.760> leg<00:00:56.940> was

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
properly at 1200 miles so one leg was

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.060 
properly at 1200 miles so one leg was
working<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.600> way<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.260> other<00:00:58.350> work<00:00:58.620> leg<00:00:58.859> was

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
working this way the other work leg was

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.490 
working this way the other work leg was
trying<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> work<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.699> way<00:01:00.199> Jim<00:01:01.199> will<00:01:01.350> walk

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
trying to work this way Jim will walk

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.020 
trying to work this way Jim will walk
you<00:01:01.649> through<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.949> next<00:01:02.250> step<00:01:02.489> while<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> put

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
you through this next step while I put

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.299 
you through this next step while I put
some<00:01:03.180> stuff<00:01:03.390> away<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.899> let's<00:01:04.830> assume<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.189> got

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
some stuff away so let's assume you got

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.620 
some stuff away so let's assume you got
the<00:01:05.430> calipers<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.090> get<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> wheel<00:01:06.420> on

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
the calipers on and you get the wheel on

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.530 
the calipers on and you get the wheel on
you<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:06.900> got<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.200> wheel<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.710> axle<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.540> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
you just got the wheel the axle in and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.060 
you just got the wheel the axle in and
actually<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.110> put<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.409> axle<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.830> then<00:01:10.979> you

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
actually you put the axle in then you

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.830 
actually you put the axle in then you
put<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.250> calipers<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.760> get<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.180> talk<00:01:12.330> calipers

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
put the calipers on get to talk calipers

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.359 
put the calipers on get to talk calipers
torqued<00:01:13.310> get<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> wheel<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.850> axle<00:01:15.360> tight

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
torqued get the wheel the axle tight

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.490 
torqued get the wheel the axle tight
pinch<00:01:17.369> bolts<00:01:17.670> still<00:01:17.880> loose<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> fork<00:01:19.200> will

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
pinch bolts still loose so the fork will

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.620 
pinch bolts still loose so the fork will
actually<00:01:19.890> move<00:01:20.040> back<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.460> forth<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.299> axle

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
actually move back and forth on the axle

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.550 
actually move back and forth on the axle
see<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:24.030> sometimes<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.840> most<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
see that so sometimes you most of the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.640 
see that so sometimes you most of the
time<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:26.119> you're<00:01:27.119> screwing<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.780> it's

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
time as you're screwing it in it's

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.760 
time as you're screwing it in it's
catching<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.310> pushing<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:31.110> fork<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.560> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
catching and pushing the fork like that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.370 
catching and pushing the fork like that
yeah<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> forks<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.049> just

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
yeah so the forks in so if you just

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.280 
yeah so the forks in so if you just
loosen<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> pinch<00:01:35.369> bolt<00:01:35.630> like<00:01:36.630> say<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.049> guy

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
loosen the pinch bolt like say a guy

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.080 
loosen the pinch bolt like say a guy
comes<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.770> us<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.430> says<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.759> front<00:01:38.909> end

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
comes in to us and says the front end

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.999 
comes in to us and says the front end
does<00:01:39.180> veal<00:01:39.479> right<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.290> push<00:01:40.590> up<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.890> down

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
does veal right and you push up and down

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.620 
does veal right and you push up and down
and<00:01:41.159> go<00:01:41.220> he<00:01:41.280> adds<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:42.030> feels<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.479> it's

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and go he adds it just feels like it's

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.109 
and go he adds it just feels like it's
dragging<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.320> not<00:01:43.470> right<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.979> lot<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.970> times

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
dragging it's not right a lot of times

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.670 
dragging it's not right a lot of times
we'll<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.570> loosen<00:01:45.720> pinch<00:01:46.079> pull<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.439> grab

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
we'll just loosen pinch pull and grab

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.520 
we'll just loosen pinch pull and grab
the<00:01:47.310> brakes<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.729> rock<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.149> up<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.390> down<00:01:48.530> which

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
the brakes and rock it up and down which

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.359

tubes are actually yes flexing yes yeah
you'll<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.440> fork<00:02:24.830> lower<00:02:25.370> instead<00:02:26.300> of<00:02:26.450> being

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
you'll the fork lower instead of being

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.760 
you'll the fork lower instead of being
like<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.230> with<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.250> neutral<00:02:28.730> axle<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:30.590> like

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
like this with a neutral axle it's like

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.640 
like this with a neutral axle it's like
that<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:32.180> now<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:32.390> have<00:02:32.570> a<00:02:32.600> side<00:02:32.960> load<00:02:33.290> on<00:02:33.530> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
that so now you have a side load on the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.040 
that so now you have a side load on the
axle<00:02:33.980> itself<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.300> have<00:02:35.420> one<00:02:35.630> foot<00:02:35.870> going

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
axle itself and you have one foot going

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.140 
axle itself and you have one foot going
straight<00:02:36.410> up<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:36.680> down<00:02:36.770> in<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.760> way<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:37.970> was

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
straight up and down in the way it was

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.080 
straight up and down in the way it was
designed<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:39.380> one<00:02:39.680> foot<00:02:39.920> trying<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.250> go<00:02:40.340> out

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.080 

yeah<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.860> that<00:02:46.010> was<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.490> lose<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.820> pinch

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
yeah so that was it you lose the pinch

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.990 
yeah so that was it you lose the pinch
bolt<00:02:47.360> that's<00:02:47.960> it<00:02:48.200> we<00:02:48.620> just<00:02:48.800> make<00:02:49.100> sure<00:02:49.310> every

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
bolt that's it we just make sure every

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.020 
bolt that's it we just make sure every
time<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.360> change<00:02:50.630> your<00:02:50.720> wheels<00:02:50.960> right<00:02:51.350> yeah

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
time you change your wheels right yeah

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.660 
time you change your wheels right yeah
every<00:02:53.030> time<00:02:53.180> on<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.570> push<00:02:53.990> yeah<00:02:54.710> you<00:02:55.520> don't

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
every time on it and push yeah you don't

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.370 
every time on it and push yeah you don't
necessarily<00:02:56.360> have<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.540> hold<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.930> brake<00:02:57.140> you

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
necessarily have to hold the brake you

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.410 
necessarily have to hold the brake you
so<00:02:57.560> Jim<00:02:57.860> just<00:02:58.070> grabbed<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:58.640> triple<00:02:59.060> so<00:02:59.240> and

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
so Jim just grabbed the triple so and

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.630 
so Jim just grabbed the triple so and
just<00:02:59.630> push<00:02:59.840> on<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.170> triple<00:03:00.560> yeah<00:03:00.860> because<00:03:01.400> you

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
just push on the triple yeah because you

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.180 
just push on the triple yeah because you
if<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:02.180> hold<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.510> brake<00:03:02.780> then<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.860> your

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
if you hold the brake then and your

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.010 
if you hold the brake then and your
brakes<00:03:04.959> Pistons<00:03:05.959> are<00:03:06.110> offset<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:08.020> they're

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
brakes Pistons are offset and they're

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.290 
brakes Pistons are offset and they're
not<00:03:09.170> sent<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:10.160> creating<00:03:10.970> another<00:03:11.180> problem

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
not sent it you creating another problem

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.199 
not sent it you creating another problem
so<00:03:12.110> just<00:03:12.380> use<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.980> triple<00:03:13.310> clamp<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:14.000> push

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
so just use the triple clamp to push

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.140 
so just use the triple clamp to push
down<00:03:14.420> on<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.630> century
