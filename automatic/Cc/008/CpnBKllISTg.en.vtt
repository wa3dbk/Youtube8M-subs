00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
of us really do express ourselves

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.700 
of us really do express ourselves
differently<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.780> if<00:00:45.899> my<00:00:46.020> brother<00:00:46.110> Philip<00:00:46.590> was

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
differently and if my brother Philip was

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.560 
differently and if my brother Philip was
here<00:00:46.950> he<00:00:47.100> has<00:00:47.219> yet<00:00:47.460> another<00:00:48.239> way<00:00:48.450> of

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
here he has yet another way of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.360 
here he has yet another way of
expressing<00:00:48.930> himself<00:00:49.200> he'd<00:00:49.860> probably<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
expressing himself he'd probably the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.790 
expressing himself he'd probably the
best<00:00:50.550> one<00:00:50.789> yeah<00:00:51.239> why<00:00:51.510> what<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.899> what's<00:00:52.110> he

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
best one yeah why what is what's he

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.799 
best one yeah why what is what's he
definitely<00:00:53.489> has<00:00:53.750> a<00:00:54.750> Boston<00:00:55.410> not<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:56.039> accent

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
definitely has a Boston not then accent

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.599 
definitely has a Boston not then accent
the<00:00:57.809> reason<00:00:58.140> why<00:00:58.260> Philip<00:00:58.739> hasn't<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.219> strong

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the reason why Philip hasn't so strong

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.330 
the reason why Philip hasn't so strong
and<00:01:00.350> emphasizes<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.770> uses<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.160> his

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and emphasizes it and uses it to his

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.920 
and emphasizes it and uses it to his
advantage<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:03.000> because<00:01:03.180> he's<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> only<00:01:03.780> one

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
advantage is because he's the only one

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.410 
advantage is because he's the only one
out<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.860> five<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.189> us<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:06.240> would

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
out of the five of us that would

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.420 
out of the five of us that would
