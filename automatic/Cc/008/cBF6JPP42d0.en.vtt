to<00:00:25.380> which<00:00:25.590> one<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.010> superior<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.359> decided

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
to which one is superior and I decided

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.650 
to which one is superior and I decided
to<00:00:28.050> finally<00:00:28.949> break<00:00:29.250> my<00:00:29.460> silence<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.090> really

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
to finally break my silence and really

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.860 
to finally break my silence and really
weigh<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:31.019> on<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.820> ultimately<00:00:32.870> here's

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
weigh in on this and ultimately here's

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.760 
weigh in on this and ultimately here's
what<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.110> found

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
what I found

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.760 
what I found
much<00:00:35.550> like<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.969> PC<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.450> Mac<00:00:36.660> argument<00:00:37.320> there

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
much like the PC and Mac argument there

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.970 
much like the PC and Mac argument there
is<00:00:37.980> no<00:00:38.820> clear<00:00:39.329> Victor<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.110> really<00:00:40.530> comes<00:00:40.800> out

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
is no clear Victor it really comes out

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.549 
is no clear Victor it really comes out
to<00:00:41.550> what<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> user<00:00:42.570> want<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.140> what<00:00:43.379> you

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
to what you as a user want and what you

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.459 
to what you as a user want and what you
as<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> user<00:00:43.950> believe<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.820> best<00:00:45.719> for<00:00:45.870> you

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
as a user believe is best for you

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.410 
as a user believe is best for you
it<00:00:46.890> depends<00:00:47.280> all<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.550> what<00:00:48.270> your

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
it depends all on what your

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.660 
it depends all on what your
considerations<00:00:49.110> are<00:00:49.260> very<00:00:49.890> similar<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
considerations are very similar to the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.630 
considerations are very similar to the
Mac<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.300> PC<00:00:52.020> debate<00:00:52.350> if<00:00:52.530> your<00:00:53.039> consideration

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
Mac and PC debate if your consideration

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.060 
Mac and PC debate if your consideration
is<00:00:53.760> cost<00:00:54.030> nikon<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.140> cheaper<00:00:55.530> at<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> entry

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
is cost nikon is cheaper at the entry

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.250 
is cost nikon is cheaper at the entry
level<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.579> DSLRs<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.539> cheaper<00:00:57.989> for<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
level for the DSLRs it's cheaper for the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.990 
level for the DSLRs it's cheaper for the
camera<00:00:58.649> bodies<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.370> cheaper<00:00:59.730> for<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
camera bodies and it's cheaper for the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.569 
camera bodies and it's cheaper for the
lenses<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.930> if<00:01:01.230> cost<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.770> your<00:01:01.920> consideration

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
lenses so if cost is your consideration

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.520 
lenses so if cost is your consideration
then<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:03.600> something<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.110> need<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.350> think

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
then that's something you need to think

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.649 
then that's something you need to think
about<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:05.070> will<00:01:05.369> say<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.240> difference

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
about I will say this the difference

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.929 
about I will say this the difference
between<00:01:06.840> them<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.470> cost<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.979> not<00:01:08.250> really<00:01:08.790> that

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
between them and cost is not really that

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.490 
between them and cost is not really that
big<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.450> significant<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.020> what<00:01:10.350> we're

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
big and significant for what we're

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.530 
big and significant for what we're
talking<00:01:10.650> about<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.430> nowhere<00:01:11.670> near<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.150> gap

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
talking about it's nowhere near the gap

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.109 
talking about it's nowhere near the gap
in<00:01:12.750> cost<00:01:12.990> between<00:01:13.229> Macs<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.860> PCs<00:01:14.369> it's

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
in cost between Macs and PCs it's

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.850 
in cost between Macs and PCs it's
usually<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> difference<00:01:15.720> at<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.380> entry

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
usually the difference at the entry

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.980 
usually the difference at the entry
level<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.759> hundred<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> hundred<00:01:18.479> fifty

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
level of a hundred to a hundred fifty

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.170 
level of a hundred to a hundred fifty
bucks<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.350> terms<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.740> camera<00:01:20.040> bodies<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.549> terms

bucks in terms of camera bodies in terms
of<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> lenses<00:01:21.930> depending<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.530> whether<00:01:22.680> we're

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
of the lenses depending on whether we're

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.890 
of the lenses depending on whether we're
talking<00:01:23.130> about<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.460> kit<00:01:23.729> lenses<00:01:24.180> or<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.750> more

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
talking about the kit lenses or the more

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.630 
talking about the kit lenses or the more
expensive<00:01:25.229> ones<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.009> difference<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.580> be

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
expensive ones the difference can be

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.510 
expensive ones the difference can be
negligible<00:01:27.450> they're<00:01:27.689> two<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.920> lower<00:01:29.280> end

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
negligible they're two on the lower end

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.399 
negligible they're two on the lower end
lenses<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.270> usually<00:01:30.600> about<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.960> hundred

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
lenses it's usually about a hundred

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.230 
lenses it's usually about a hundred
bucks<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.799> terms<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> bracket<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
bucks in terms of the bracket but on the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.120 
bucks in terms of the bracket but on the
higher<00:01:33.479> end<00:01:33.689> lenses<00:01:34.140> maybe<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.799> two<00:01:34.979> to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
higher end lenses maybe it's two to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.010 
higher end lenses maybe it's two to
three<00:01:35.340> hundred<00:01:35.460> dollars<00:01:35.750> sometimes<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:36.960> a

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
three hundred dollars sometimes it's a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.020 
three hundred dollars sometimes it's a
little<00:01:37.140> more<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.490> depends<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:38.880> what

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
little more so it just depends on what

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.819 
little more so it just depends on what
type<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.390> glass<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.990> accessories<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.650> are

type of glass and accessories you are

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.120 
type of glass and accessories you are
getting<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.869> terms<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.110> workflow<00:01:43.649> with

mobile apps and triggers and things like

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.370 
mobile apps and triggers and things like
that<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:47.009> will<00:01:47.700> say<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.299> there<00:01:48.509> are<00:01:48.689> probably

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
that I will say that there are probably

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.730 
that I will say that there are probably
more<00:01:49.950> apps<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> Apple<00:01:51.360> side<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:52.200> nikon

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
more apps on the Apple side for nikon

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.830 
more apps on the Apple side for nikon
and<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.189> there<00:01:53.340> are<00:01:53.369> more<00:01:53.640> Canon<00:01:54.390> apps<00:01:54.600> on

and that there are more Canon apps on
the<00:01:55.020> Android<00:01:55.170> side<00:01:55.770> which<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> little<00:01:56.700> weird

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the Android side which is a little weird

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.940 
the Android side which is a little weird
to<00:01:57.180> me<00:01:57.299> I've<00:01:57.479> never<00:01:57.509> quite<00:01:58.140> understood<00:01:58.680> why

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
to me I've never quite understood why

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.800 
to me I've never quite understood why
that<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.490> maybe<00:02:00.000> somebody<00:02:00.299> will<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.600> able<00:02:00.630> to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
that is maybe somebody will be able to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.569 
that is maybe somebody will be able to
answer<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> comment<00:02:02.009> section<00:02:02.310> below

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
it's just something that I've taken note

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.330 
it's just something that I've taken note
of

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
of

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.779 
of
I<00:02:05.869> will<00:02:06.869> say<00:02:07.079> for<00:02:07.109> overall<00:02:07.679> features<00:02:08.340> that

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
I will say for overall features that

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.550 
I will say for overall features that
usually<00:02:09.390> even<00:02:09.629> though<00:02:09.869> you're<00:02:10.019> paying<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.379> bit

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.280 
usually even though you're paying a bit
more<00:02:10.760> canon<00:02:11.760> has<00:02:12.000> more<00:02:12.300> features<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:13.080> my

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
more canon has more features in my

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.619 
more canon has more features in my
opinion<00:02:13.800> on<00:02:13.920> their<00:02:14.280> entry-level<00:02:14.640> DSLRs<00:02:15.360> and

opinion on their entry-level DSLRs and

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.509 
opinion on their entry-level DSLRs and
some<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.140> those<00:02:16.200> features<00:02:16.680> are<00:02:16.920> things<00:02:17.310> like

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
some of those features are things like

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.640 
some of those features are things like
convenient<00:02:18.090> touch<00:02:18.300> screens<00:02:18.690> as<00:02:18.900> well<00:02:19.379> as<00:02:19.530> on

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
articulating screens that do flip out so

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.190 
articulating screens that do flip out so
you<00:02:26.489> can<00:02:26.670> look<00:02:26.790> at<00:02:26.940> those<00:02:27.120> using<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.810> very

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
have to buy comparatively I will say

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.170 
have to buy comparatively I will say
that<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.079> 5200<00:03:01.079> and<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.560> 5300<00:03:02.370> are<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.549> little

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
that the 5200 and the 5300 are a little

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.220 
that the 5200 and the 5300 are a little
more<00:03:03.450> expensive<00:03:03.840> than<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.709> t3i<00:03:05.510> t4i<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.720> t5i

more expensive than the t3i t4i and t5i

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.800 
more expensive than the t3i t4i and t5i
um<00:03:07.709> you<00:03:08.519> know<00:03:08.640> so<00:03:08.970> that's<00:03:09.299> just<00:03:09.569> something

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
um you know so that's just something

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.360 
um you know so that's just something
taking<00:03:10.230> consideration<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:11.010> for<00:03:11.220> that

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
taking consideration that for that

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.490 
taking consideration that for that
particular<00:03:11.549> feature<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.720> price<00:03:13.109> difference

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
particular feature the price difference

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.949 
particular feature the price difference
isn't<00:03:14.010> really<00:03:14.280> there<00:03:14.609> on<00:03:14.850> Canon<00:03:15.299> versus<00:03:15.600> Nikon

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
isn't really there on Canon versus Nikon

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.979 
isn't really there on Canon versus Nikon
and<00:03:16.170> with<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.370> Canon<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.209> do<00:03:18.450> get<00:03:18.810> the

and with the Canon you do get the
touchscreen<00:03:19.530> capabilities<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.700> in<00:03:21.000> terms<00:03:21.510> of

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
touchscreen capabilities so in terms of

touchscreen capabilities so in terms of
ease<00:03:21.989> of<00:03:22.019> use<00:03:22.260> on<00:03:22.829> that<00:03:23.280> particular<00:03:23.639> style<00:03:24.209> of

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.830 
the semi pro and the pro tier well I do
think<00:03:38.220> Canon<00:03:38.579> has<00:03:38.760> more<00:03:39.060> cameras<00:03:39.450> in<00:03:39.599> its

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
think Canon has more cameras in its

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.970 
think Canon has more cameras in its
overall<00:03:40.109> lineup<00:03:40.620> or<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:41.730> think<00:03:42.329> that<00:03:42.569> the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
overall lineup or that I think that the

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.800 
overall lineup or that I think that the
camera<00:03:43.980> is<00:03:44.069> that<00:03:44.099> Nikon<00:03:44.940> has<00:03:44.970> in<00:03:45.389> their<00:03:45.569> lineup

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
camera is that Nikon has in their lineup

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.069 
camera is that Nikon has in their lineup
are<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.560> little<00:03:47.280> more<00:03:47.700> solid<00:03:48.599> and<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.840> little

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
are a little more solid and a little

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.379 
are a little more solid and a little
more<00:03:49.230> varied<00:03:49.829> in<00:03:50.010> what<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:50.459> get<00:03:50.669> in<00:03:50.819> terms<00:03:51.060> of

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
more varied in what you get in terms of

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.349 
more varied in what you get in terms of
that<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:52.139> they<00:03:52.470> don't<00:03:52.500> need<00:03:52.889> the<00:03:53.099> variety<00:03:53.359> but

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
that so they don't need the variety but

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.589 
that so they don't need the variety but
in<00:03:55.290> my<00:03:55.709> opinion<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.519> just<00:03:56.669> me<00:03:56.940> it

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
in my opinion and this is just me it

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.190 
in my opinion and this is just me it
turns<00:03:57.930> out<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.230> be<00:03:58.260> cheaper<00:03:58.889> for<00:03:59.130> more<00:04:00.200> value

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
turns out to be cheaper for more value

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.819 
turns out to be cheaper for more value
with<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.130> Nikon's<00:04:02.609> in<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:03.329> pro<00:04:03.660> tier<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:04.319> the

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
with the Nikon's in the pro tier and the

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.490 
with the Nikon's in the pro tier and the
reason<00:04:05.160> I<00:04:05.250> say<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:05.489> is<00:04:05.750> while<00:04:06.750> megapixels

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
reason I say that is while megapixels

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.520 
reason I say that is while megapixels
kind<00:04:07.799> of<00:04:07.980> don't<00:04:08.250> matter<00:04:08.609> in<00:04:08.970> some<00:04:09.840> cases<00:04:10.139> with

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
kind of don't matter in some cases with

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.349 
kind of don't matter in some cases with
regard<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:10.919> commercial<00:04:11.549> photography<00:04:12.120> for

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
regard to commercial photography for

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.190 
regard to commercial photography for
specific<00:04:12.900> purposes<00:04:13.819> megapixels<00:04:14.819> do<00:04:15.329> matter

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
specific purposes megapixels do matter

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.320 
specific purposes megapixels do matter
and<00:04:16.290> being<00:04:16.830> able<00:04:16.920> to<00:04:17.040> shoot<00:04:17.250> at<00:04:17.430> higher<00:04:17.700> ISO

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
and being able to shoot at higher ISO

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.250 
and being able to shoot at higher ISO
ranges<00:04:18.810> do<00:04:19.530> matter<00:04:19.830> so<00:04:20.520> I<00:04:20.880> will<00:04:21.450> give<00:04:21.750> Nikon

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
ranges do matter so I will give Nikon

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.520 
ranges do matter so I will give Nikon
the<00:04:22.410> edge<00:04:22.590> there<00:04:23.010> in<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.640> pro<00:04:24.390> level<00:04:24.750> but<00:04:25.230> it's

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
the edge there in the pro level but it's

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.680 
the edge there in the pro level but it's
only<00:04:25.830> marginal<00:04:26.610> it's<00:04:26.760> only<00:04:26.940> by<00:04:27.150> like<00:04:27.390> you<00:04:27.570> know

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
only marginal it's only by like you know

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.200 
only marginal it's only by like you know
a<00:04:27.720> couple<00:04:27.960> fractions<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.920> a<00:04:28.980> percent<00:04:29.370> there<00:04:29.580> so

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
a couple fractions of a percent there so

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.570 
a couple fractions of a percent there so
it<00:04:30.570> really<00:04:30.900> just<00:04:31.170> does<00:04:31.380> come<00:04:31.620> back<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:31.890> what

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
it really just does come back to what

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.340 
it really just does come back to what
you're<00:04:32.700> doing<00:04:32.730> if<00:04:33.330> you're<00:04:33.540> a<00:04:33.570> portrait<00:04:33.990> person

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
you're doing if you're a portrait person

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.590 
you're doing if you're a portrait person
you<00:04:34.530> can<00:04:34.710> shoot<00:04:34.950> for<00:04:35.190> cheaper<00:04:35.610> on<00:04:35.820> Nikon<00:04:36.450> if

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
you can shoot for cheaper on Nikon if

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.090 
you can shoot for cheaper on Nikon if
you're<00:04:36.720> just<00:04:36.930> doing<00:04:37.050> portraits<00:04:37.650> and<00:04:37.800> wedding

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
you're just doing portraits and wedding

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.400 
you're just doing portraits and wedding
photography<00:04:38.670> etc<00:04:39.020> if<00:04:40.020> you're<00:04:40.260> shooting

sports<00:04:40.770> photography<00:04:41.250> you're<00:04:41.400> gonna<00:04:41.550> be

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
sports photography you're gonna be

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.760 
sports photography you're gonna be
better<00:04:41.880> off<00:04:42.150> with<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.540> Canon<00:04:43.080> in<00:04:43.200> my<00:04:43.320> opinion

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
better off with a Canon in my opinion

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.160 
better off with a Canon in my opinion
because<00:04:44.220> higher<00:04:45.120> shutter<00:04:45.420> frame<00:04:45.870> rates

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
because higher shutter frame rates

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.860 
because higher shutter frame rates
longer<00:04:46.830> battery<00:04:47.130> life<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.790> just<00:04:48.420> all<00:04:48.600> kinds

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
longer battery life and just all kinds

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.690 
longer battery life and just all kinds

there are a lot of different reasons but

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.860 
there are a lot of different reasons but
I've<00:05:20.160> always<00:05:20.640> felt<00:05:20.820> the<00:05:21.120> most<00:05:21.270> important

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
I've always felt the most important

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.560 
I've always felt the most important
reason<00:05:22.230> behind<00:05:22.620> buying<00:05:23.130> camera<00:05:23.640> or<00:05:23.970> going

reason behind buying camera or going
into<00:05:24.990> a<00:05:25.020> camera<00:05:25.320> system<00:05:25.620> is<00:05:26.000> your<00:05:27.000> ability<00:05:27.390> to

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
into a camera system is your ability to

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.030 
scale up later I went into the Nikon
camera<00:05:30.510> system<00:05:30.840> because<00:05:31.140> of<00:05:31.170> how<00:05:31.470> many<00:05:31.680> Nikon

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
photographers I personally know which

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.150 
photographers I personally know which
means<00:05:34.140> that's<00:05:34.320> easier<00:05:34.620> for<00:05:34.680> me<00:05:34.920> to<00:05:35.040> either

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
means that's easier for me to either

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.910 
means that's easier for me to either
borrow<00:05:35.580> equipment<00:05:35.790> buy<00:05:36.720> used<00:05:37.110> equipment<00:05:37.440> or

borrow equipment buy used equipment or

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.190 
borrow equipment buy used equipment or
inherit<00:05:38.640> equipment<00:05:39.270> from<00:05:39.630> somebody<00:05:40.050> who's

inherit equipment from somebody who's

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.200 
inherit equipment from somebody who's
retiring<00:05:40.590> it's<00:05:40.860> just<00:05:41.010> easier<00:05:41.430> for<00:05:41.460> me<00:05:41.670> to

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
retiring it's just easier for me to

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.810 
retiring it's just easier for me to
really<00:05:42.480> expand<00:05:43.110> my<00:05:43.350> capabilities<00:05:44.040> if<00:05:44.340> I<00:05:44.670> go

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
really expand my capabilities if I go

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.120 
really expand my capabilities if I go
with<00:05:44.970> the<00:05:45.090> Nikon<00:05:45.450> system<00:05:45.900> for<00:05:46.740> you<00:05:46.890> there

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
with the Nikon system for you there

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.680 
with the Nikon system for you there
might<00:05:47.160> be<00:05:47.310> more<00:05:47.550> Canon<00:05:47.940> photographers<00:05:48.540> in

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
might be more Canon photographers in

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.420 
might be more Canon photographers in
your<00:05:48.810> area<00:05:49.140> or<00:05:49.290> their<00:05:49.440> personal<00:05:49.860> friends<00:05:50.340> or

your area or their personal friends or

your area or their personal friends or
colleagues<00:05:50.850> of<00:05:50.970> yours<00:05:51.180> so<00:05:51.540> it<00:05:51.660> might<00:05:51.750> be

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
colleagues of yours so it might be

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.510 
colleagues of yours so it might be
easier<00:05:51.900> to<00:05:52.320> get<00:05:52.470> access<00:05:52.680> to<00:05:53.190> those<00:05:53.460> things

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
easier to get access to those things

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.910 
easier to get access to those things
through<00:05:54.420> those<00:05:54.840> people<00:05:55.290> so<00:05:55.470> you<00:05:55.530> might<00:05:55.740> want

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
through those people so you might want

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.620 
through those people so you might want
to<00:05:55.980> get<00:05:56.070> into<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.310> Canon<00:05:56.670> system<00:05:57.060> even<00:05:57.450> if

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
to get into the Canon system even if

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.720 
to get into the Canon system even if
your<00:05:57.930> considerations<00:05:58.680> would<00:05:59.100> normally<00:05:59.550> put

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
your considerations would normally put

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.580 
your considerations would normally put
you<00:05:59.880> in<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:00.150> Nikon<00:06:00.540> tier<00:06:00.840> it<00:06:01.170> may<00:06:01.350> still<00:06:01.560> be

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
you in the Nikon tier it may still be

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.760 
you in the Nikon tier it may still be
cheaper<00:06:02.100> for<00:06:02.310> you<00:06:02.370> to<00:06:02.460> go<00:06:02.580> Canon<00:06:03.000> for<00:06:03.210> that

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
cheaper for you to go Canon for that

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.960 
cheaper for you to go Canon for that
anyway<00:06:04.770> these<00:06:05.010> are<00:06:05.070> just<00:06:05.220> my<00:06:05.550> thoughts<00:06:05.760> and

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
anyway these are just my thoughts and

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.610 
anyway these are just my thoughts and
opinions<00:06:06.060> I'd<00:06:06.510> actually<00:06:06.990> love<00:06:07.170> to<00:06:07.230> know<00:06:07.470> what

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
opinions I'd actually love to know what

all of you in the photography community

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.660 
all of you in the photography community

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
think about the Canon versus Nikon

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.520 
think about the Canon versus Nikon

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
debate do you agree with me that it

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.870 
debate do you agree with me that it
really<00:06:13.740> comes<00:06:14.040> down<00:06:14.130> to<00:06:14.280> your<00:06:14.700> personal

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
really comes down to your personal

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.240 
really comes down to your personal
preferences<00:06:15.600> and<00:06:15.780> what<00:06:16.320> you<00:06:16.470> get<00:06:16.650> access<00:06:16.920> to

and how affordable it is for you or is
there<00:06:19.620> a<00:06:19.650> real<00:06:19.950> significant<00:06:20.610> difference

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
there a real significant difference

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.580

between<00:06:21.210> the<00:06:21.540> two<00:06:21.570> that<00:06:21.900> I'm<00:06:22.080> completely

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
between the two that I'm completely

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.280 
between the two that I'm completely
overlooking<00:06:23.370> that<00:06:23.820> puts<00:06:24.570> it<00:06:24.720> in<00:06:24.840> favor<00:06:25.110> for

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
overlooking that puts it in favor for

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.260 
overlooking that puts it in favor for
one<00:06:25.620> or<00:06:25.740> the<00:06:25.860> other<00:06:26.040> I'd<00:06:26.370> love<00:06:26.970> to<00:06:27.060> know<00:06:27.180> what
