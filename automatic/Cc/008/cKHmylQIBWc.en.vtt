I'll put these two things off to the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.100 
I'll put these two things off to the
side<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.729> now<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.330> I'm<00:01:09.630> going<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.840> just

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
side for now and I'm going to just

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.880 
side for now and I'm going to just
install<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.159> case<00:01:11.369> onto<00:01:11.670> my<00:01:11.850> computer<00:01:11.909> first

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
install the case onto my computer first

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.270 
install the case onto my computer first
this<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.220> 15<00:01:14.670> inch<00:01:14.820> unibody<00:01:15.000> macbook<00:01:15.689> pro

so<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.340> basically<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:18.890> take<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.040> case<00:01:20.340> and

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
so you basically just take the case and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.310 
so you basically just take the case and
you<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:23.180> snap<00:01:24.180> around<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> edges<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.200> then

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
you just snap around the edges and then

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.700 
you just snap around the edges and then
you<00:01:25.439> take<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.689> bottom<00:01:27.689> piece<00:01:27.900> right<00:01:28.290> here<00:01:28.320> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
you take the bottom piece right here and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.980 
you take the bottom piece right here and
you<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> same<00:01:29.100> thing<00:01:29.630> so<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.689> looks<00:01:30.869> like

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you do the same thing so it looks like

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.890 
you do the same thing so it looks like
it<00:01:31.110> goes<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.770> way<00:01:35.180> there<00:01:36.180> are<00:01:36.329> little<00:01:36.540> foam

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.240 
it goes this way there are little foam
feet<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.689> corners<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.900> case<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.409> to

feet on the corners of the case and to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.160 
feet on the corners of the case and to
make<00:01:41.369> sure<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.759> securely<00:01:42.240> fit<00:01:42.689> onto<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
make sure it's securely fit onto the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.700 
make sure it's securely fit onto the
computer<00:01:43.590> i'm<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.009> open<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:45.149> up

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.180 

and<00:01:55.830> there<00:01:56.760> you<00:01:56.910> go<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.870> right<00:01:58.290> now<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.860> a
