today<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.450> full<00:02:06.960> moon<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.320> going<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.770> exact

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
today the full moon is going to be exact

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.830 
today the full moon is going to be exact
around<00:02:09.030> noon<00:02:09.300> for<00:02:09.929> those<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.229> us<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.590> america

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
around noon for those of us in america

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.690 
around noon for those of us in america
so<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.260> moon<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.650> also<00:02:14.040> going<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.220> be<00:02:14.370> opposing

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
so the moon is also going to be opposing

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.030 
so the moon is also going to be opposing
up<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.090> chyron<00:02:15.540> in<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.750> slight<00:02:16.140> opposition<00:02:16.860> up

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
up to chyron in a slight opposition up

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.770 
up to chyron in a slight opposition up
to<00:02:17.250> Neptune<00:02:17.700> but<00:02:18.210> this<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.480> again<00:02:18.750> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
to Neptune but this is again the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.140 
to Neptune but this is again the
balancing<00:02:19.470> elements<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.130> Leo<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.640> Aquarius

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
balancing elements of Leo and Aquarius

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.780 
balancing elements of Leo and Aquarius
what<00:02:21.900> we<00:02:22.080> enjoy<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.830> what<00:02:22.950> others<00:02:23.220> enjoy<00:02:23.550> what

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
what we enjoy and what others enjoy what

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.670 
what we enjoy and what others enjoy what
the<00:02:23.880> world<00:02:24.120> needs<00:02:24.390> right<00:02:24.660> now<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.470> if<00:02:25.530> we're

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
the world needs right now so if we're

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.560 
the world needs right now so if we're
focused<00:02:26.130> on<00:02:26.250> both<00:02:26.520> if<00:02:26.790> we<00:02:26.910> can<00:02:27.060> find<00:02:27.300> that

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
focused on both if we can find that

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.780 
focused on both if we can find that
middle<00:02:27.750> ground<00:02:27.900> we'll<00:02:28.800> find<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.130> very<00:02:29.340> healing

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
middle ground we'll find it very healing

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.450 
middle ground we'll find it very healing
that's<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.330> energy<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.810> chyron<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.530> there's

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
that's the energy of chyron and there's

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.480 
that's the energy of chyron and there's
a<00:02:32.520> revitalization<00:02:33.030> taking<00:02:33.810> place<00:02:34.050> to

Aquarius oppositely oh there's this

connection and the Leo energy makes it

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.880 
connection and the Leo energy makes it
very<00:03:00.750> grounded<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.500> makes<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.800> very

very grounded it makes it very

very grounded it makes it very
personable<00:03:02.490> in<00:03:02.760> our<00:03:02.910> day-to-day<00:03:03.120> environment

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
personable in our day-to-day environment

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.870 
personable in our day-to-day environment
because<00:03:04.080> it's<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.350> bottom<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.860> chart<00:03:05.070> so

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
because it's the bottom of the chart so

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.730 
because it's the bottom of the chart so
we<00:03:06.000> can<00:03:06.120> feel<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.660> it's<00:03:06.900> there<00:03:07.200> it's<00:03:07.410> available

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
we can feel it it's there it's available

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.320 
we can feel it it's there it's available
but<00:03:08.130> takes<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.490> conscious<00:03:08.940> effort<00:03:09.270> to

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
but takes that conscious effort to

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.940 
but takes that conscious effort to
really<00:03:09.510> tap<00:03:09.780> into<00:03:09.810> our<00:03:10.140> hearts<00:03:10.440> but<00:03:10.680> like<00:03:10.830> I

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
really tap into our hearts but like I

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.680 
really tap into our hearts but like I
said<00:03:11.010> if<00:03:11.280> we<00:03:11.400> do<00:03:11.640> there's<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.450> tremendous

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
said if we do there's a tremendous

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.910 
said if we do there's a tremendous
amount<00:03:13.320> of<00:03:14.000> contribution<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.710> just<00:03:16.710> overall

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
amount of contribution and just overall

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.310 
amount of contribution and just overall
abundance<00:03:17.790> for<00:03:17.970> us<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:18.540> everyone<00:03:18.750> around<00:03:18.960> us

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
abundance for us and everyone around us

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.130 
abundance for us and everyone around us
so<00:03:20.100> that's<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.700> great<00:03:20.850> energy<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.330> tap<00:03:21.630> into<00:03:21.870> at

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
so that's a great energy to tap into at

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.030 
so that's a great energy to tap into at
the<00:03:22.260> full<00:03:22.470> moon<00:03:22.910> now<00:03:23.910> we're<00:03:24.060> coming<00:03:24.420> off<00:03:24.630> of

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
the full moon now we're coming off of

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.320 
the full moon now we're coming off of
yesterday<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.340> still<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.790> energy<00:03:27.120> still

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
yesterday and still the energy still

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.900 
yesterday and still the energy still
today<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.900> this<00:03:28.590> whole<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:29.190> Venus<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.730> Mars

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
today of this whole of Venus and Mars

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.300 
today of this whole of Venus and Mars
activity<00:03:30.570> we<00:03:30.690> had<00:03:30.840> Venus<00:03:31.230> going<00:03:31.530> over<00:03:31.800> Uranus

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
activity we had Venus going over Uranus

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.370 
activity we had Venus going over Uranus
yesterday<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.030> Mars<00:03:33.540> going<00:03:33.840> over<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.140> South

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
yesterday and Mars going over the South

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.460 
yesterday and Mars going over the South
node<00:03:34.740> so<00:03:35.520> I<00:03:35.550> think<00:03:35.960> over<00:03:36.960> the<00:03:36.990> either<00:03:37.440> the

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
node so I think over the either the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.440 
node so I think over the either the
evening<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.070> last<00:03:38.370> night<00:03:38.610> or<00:03:38.790> perhaps<00:03:38.940> even<00:03:39.270> in

uranus was trining up to jupiter so it's
expansive<00:04:52.740> there's<00:04:53.100> opportunities<00:04:53.790> there

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
expansive there's opportunities there

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.120

when we see things in this way and it's

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.620 
when we see things in this way and it's
it's<00:04:56.400> structural<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.180> we're<00:04:57.390> still

it's structural to we're still

this month and the next is going to be

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.110 
this month and the next is going to be
mars<00:05:28.530> right<00:05:28.830> after<00:05:29.070> Mars<00:05:29.280> finishes<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:29.880> South

so<00:05:32.730> perhaps<00:05:32.970> this<00:05:33.300> is<00:05:33.450> a<00:05:33.480> reminder<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.990> step

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
so perhaps this is a reminder to step

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.070 
so perhaps this is a reminder to step
into<00:05:34.830> your<00:05:34.950> true<00:05:35.190> self<00:05:35.520> remember<00:05:36.390> that<00:05:36.690> you
