be great if you're rebuilding a
transmission<00:00:57.149> or<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> transfer<00:00:57.870> case<00:00:58.050> which<00:00:58.800> I

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
transmission or a transfer case which I

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.229 
transmission or a transfer case which I
would<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> had<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.370> background<00:00:59.579> pull<00:01:00.090> those

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
would I had this background pull those

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.470 
would I had this background pull those
apart<00:01:00.649> but<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:02.520> course<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.910> how<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.149> works<00:01:03.329> is

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
apart but of course is how it works is

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.810 
apart but of course is how it works is
we<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:03.989> two<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.439> these<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:05.430> go<00:01:05.460> into<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
we have two of these that go into the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.149 
we have two of these that go into the
holes<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.210> these<00:01:06.330> bearing<00:01:06.659> pullers<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.290> we've

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
holes on these bearing pullers and we've

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.370 
holes on these bearing pullers and we've
got<00:01:08.369> these<00:01:08.820> two<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.330> tie<00:01:09.510> into<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.930> this

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
got these two that tie into this this

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.070 
got these two that tie into this this
bar<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.970> main<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.420> goes<00:01:12.869> through

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
bar and this main one that goes through

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.530 
bar and this main one that goes through
the<00:01:13.170> middle<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:15.090> goes<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.450> touches

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
the middle of this that goes and touches

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.910 
the middle of this that goes and touches
the<00:01:15.840> steering<00:01:16.140> column<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.560> pushes<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the steering column and this pushes the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.999 
the steering column and this pushes the
steering<00:01:17.310> wheel<00:01:17.490> off<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.740> looks<00:01:19.890> like

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
steering wheel off so it looks like

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.010 
steering wheel off so it looks like
we've<00:01:20.189> got<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.729> course<00:01:20.939> maybe<00:01:21.750> I'll<00:01:21.930> do

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
we've got it of course maybe I'll do

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.690 
we've got it of course maybe I'll do
another<00:01:22.229> video<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.680> when<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.860> get<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.490> gear

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
another video of when I get the the gear

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.859 
another video of when I get the the gear
box<00:01:23.850> pulled<00:01:24.150> apart<00:01:24.390> when<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.630> go<00:01:24.720> ahead<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
box pulled apart when I go ahead and

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.260 
box pulled apart when I go ahead and
rebuild<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:27.979> but<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> wagon<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:30.210> a
