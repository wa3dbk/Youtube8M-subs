tutorial for spinning Daisy
this<00:00:04.830> design<00:00:05.190> is<00:00:05.220> stitched<00:00:05.700> from<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.150> center

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
this design is stitched from the center

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.379 
this design is stitched from the center
starting<00:00:07.170> with<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.440> center<00:00:07.740> circle<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.460> then

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
starting with the center circle and then

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.140 
starting with the center circle and then
you're<00:00:09.690> going<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.139> stitch<00:00:10.380> your<00:00:10.920> petals<00:00:11.370> and

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
you're going to stitch your petals and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.620 
you're going to stitch your petals and
so<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.420> started<00:00:12.990> with<00:00:13.200> eight<00:00:13.559> petals<00:00:14.450> usually<00:00:15.450> I

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
so I started with eight petals usually I

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.849 
so I started with eight petals usually I
start<00:00:15.750> by<00:00:16.289> stitching<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.369> four<00:00:17.940> kind<00:00:18.690> of

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
start by stitching the four kind of

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.700 
start by stitching the four kind of
north<00:00:19.859> south<00:00:20.160> east<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.789> west<00:00:20.820> or<00:00:21.359> at<00:00:21.449> least

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
north south east and west or at least

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.980 
north south east and west or at least
one<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.949> straight<00:00:23.430> up<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.359> one<00:00:24.539> going<00:00:24.779> to

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
one going straight up and one going to

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.810 
one going straight up and one going to
one<00:00:25.199> side<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.980> way<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.160> can<00:00:26.279> stitch<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
one side so that way I can stitch the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.540 
one side so that way I can stitch the
diagonal<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.710> very<00:00:28.949> easy<00:00:29.070> because

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
diagonal and this is very easy because

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.820 
diagonal and this is very easy because
it<00:00:29.849> allows<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.480> get<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.750> good<00:00:31.050> placement

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
it allows you to get a good placement

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.970 
it allows you to get a good placement
that's<00:00:32.250> very<00:00:32.550> even<00:00:33.120> if<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.260> break<00:00:34.500> up<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
that's very even if you break up the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.639 
that's very even if you break up the
petals<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.640> way<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.630> break<00:00:36.870> up<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.110> circle

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
petals this way you break up that circle

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.590 
petals this way you break up that circle
this<00:00:37.800> way<00:00:38.010> most<00:00:38.430> people<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:39.059> stitch<00:00:39.360> this

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
this way most people can stitch this

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.720 
this way most people can stitch this
because<00:00:40.020> they're<00:00:40.350> familiar<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.640> know

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
because they're familiar with you know

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.819 
because they're familiar with you know
the<00:00:41.879> compass<00:00:42.300> rose<00:00:42.390> north<00:00:43.050> south<00:00:43.290> east<00:00:43.559> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
the compass rose north south east and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.479 
the compass rose north south east and
west<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:46.140> very<00:00:46.410> easy<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.829> break<00:00:47.039> up<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
west and it's very easy to break up the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.479 
west and it's very easy to break up the
circle<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.030> way<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.739> kind<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
circle this way so this is kind of the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.939 
circle this way so this is kind of the
base<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.360> design<00:00:51.899> you're<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
base for this design you're going to

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.590 
base for this design you're going to
first<00:00:53.250> start<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.860> initial<00:00:55.860> Daisy<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
first start with this initial Daisy and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.689 
first start with this initial Daisy and
now<00:00:57.600> we're<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.140> start<00:00:58.500> spinning<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.370> and

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
now we're going to start spinning it and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.049 
now we're going to start spinning it and
this<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.719> involving<00:01:01.289> feathers<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.879> do

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
this is involving feathers so all you do

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.000 
this is involving feathers so all you do
is<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.570> start<00:01:03.899> with<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> feather<00:01:04.409> you're

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
is you start with the feather you're

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.770 
is you start with the feather you're
going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> bring<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.640> out<00:01:05.760> around<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.330> petal

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
going to bring it out around that petal

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.440 
going to bring it out around that petal
and<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.950> bring<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.430> back<00:01:08.549> down<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
and then bring it back down to the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.149 
and then bring it back down to the
beginning<00:01:09.869> you're<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.590> bounce<00:01:10.770> back

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
beginning you're going to bounce back

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.300 
beginning you're going to bounce back
and<00:01:11.490> build<00:01:12.060> another<00:01:12.390> feather<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:13.020> top<00:01:13.310> you're

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
and build another feather on top you're

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.730 
and build another feather on top you're
going<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.580> want<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.240> first<00:01:15.630> set<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.229> kind

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
going to want it the first set is kind

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.840 
going to want it the first set is kind
of<00:01:16.860> tricky<00:01:17.270> because<00:01:18.270> you're<00:01:18.720> both<00:01:18.990> trying<00:01:19.470> to

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
of tricky because you're both trying to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.570 
of tricky because you're both trying to
start<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.540> design<00:01:21.930> starting<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.950> spend<00:01:23.310> more

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
start the design starting to spend more

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.490 
start the design starting to spend more
or<00:01:23.640> less<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.330> you're<00:01:24.600> also<00:01:24.780> trying<00:01:25.290> to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
or less and you're also trying to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.450 
or less and you're also trying to
estimate<00:01:26.570> your<00:01:27.570> space<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.200> try<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.130> fit<00:01:29.340> it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
estimate your space and try and fit it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.249 
estimate your space and try and fit it
in<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:29.970> what's<00:01:30.240> going<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.869> happening

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
in with what's going to be happening

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.749 
in with what's going to be happening
when<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.560> once<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.040> all<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.369> way<00:01:32.460> around

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
when it once you get all the way around

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.840 
when it once you get all the way around
the<00:01:33.689> flower<00:01:34.170> shape<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.610> lot<00:01:35.820> of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the flower shape so it's a lot of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.060 
the flower shape so it's a lot of
different<00:01:36.210> things<00:01:36.329> if<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.439> mark

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
different things if you have to mark

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.569 
different things if you have to mark
this<00:01:38.520> first<00:01:39.030> set<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.200> feathers<00:01:40.590> that's

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
this first set of feathers that's

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.200 
this first set of feathers that's
certainly<00:01:41.939> not<00:01:42.710> illegal<00:01:43.710> by<00:01:44.189> any<00:01:44.460> means<00:01:44.850> and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
certainly not illegal by any means and

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.590 
certainly not illegal by any means and
it<00:01:45.689> might<00:01:45.899> help<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.380> get<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.740> placement<00:01:46.979> down

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
it might help you get the placement down

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.330 
it might help you get the placement down
so<00:01:48.600> here<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.110> see<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.470> next<00:01:49.770> set<00:01:50.310> of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
so here you can see the next set of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.760 
so here you can see the next set of
feathers<00:01:50.790> coming<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.470> see<00:01:52.590> I'm

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
feathers coming in and you can see I'm

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.350 
feathers coming in and you can see I'm
just<00:01:52.799> simply<00:01:53.490> bringing<00:01:53.729> those<00:01:53.970> up<00:01:54.180> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
just simply bringing those up and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.020 
just simply bringing those up and
budding<00:01:54.780> them<00:01:55.049> against<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.829> flat<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.369> set<00:01:56.850> of

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
budding them against the flat the set of

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.600 
budding them against the flat the set of
feathers<00:01:57.360> before<00:01:57.540> them<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.130> move

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
feathers before them and you just move
