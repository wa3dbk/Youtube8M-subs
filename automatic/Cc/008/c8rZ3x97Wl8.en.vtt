the first is losing control of your
player<00:00:37.800> you'd<00:00:38.579> be<00:00:38.730> stuck<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.180> two<00:00:39.390> men

that sucking and polling feeling where
you're<00:00:43.410> not<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.680> control<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:44.329> completely<00:00:45.329> had

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
you're not in control we completely had

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.810 
you're not in control we completely had
to<00:00:45.719> go<00:00:45.870> away<00:00:45.989> from<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:47.160> second<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.760> that

to go away from that the second is that
shooting<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.989> based<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.469> luck<00:00:50.000> you<00:00:51.000> press<00:00:51.239> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
shooting is based on luck you press a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.119

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
two biggest change is that people will

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.319 
two biggest change is that people will
