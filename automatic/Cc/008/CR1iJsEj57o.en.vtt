00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:16.840
 Well, finally we waited for a new 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:20.660
 golf 7 and there is a possibility on it 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:30.529
 ride car 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:31.599
 became more lightweight more sporty line 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.610
 bodywork 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:39.019
 sharp corners appeared more sloping 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.090
 Well, that is, the design has become all the same 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:43.900
 slightly more aggressive than 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.900
 previous model 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.850
 well what 14 122 forces 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.090
 yes yes yes you just wanted to say we 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.300
 equipped with start-stop system, but that's 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.310
 as far as I understood the Germans were promised there 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.850
 about 20 percent of the economy 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.410
 try yes yes yes here it is now 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.880
 let's try again this 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:13.290
 the moment that is here we stop 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:17.110
 click on the brake the car has become 7 yes 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.470
 Here is a complete set of the novel 750 such 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:25.979
 bundling from 700 to picking 1 and 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.979
 4,122 strength and highline hope g boxes 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.450
 nothing done from each other 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.830
 a little bit more sporty interesting 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.990
 very interesting yes the panel turned here 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:43.869
 and the dynamics of Tyurin 100 kilograms lighter 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.850
 It has become a place that is well bees himself 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:50.170
 drew him up to very nice that is 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.659
 the car attracts attention then 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.600
 please come Still please visibility 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.640
 mirrors that is 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.700
 see how 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.909
 No, no matter how I would say that the mirror 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.220
 small for example here's a driver 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.399
 old mirror such a driver 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.790
 the mirror will say so about the great 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.290
 has a left slice a spherical shape 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.660
 appropriately separated as usual 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.300
 dotted line here and shakalitsa here 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.700
 the feeling that the mirrors still moth 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.250
 after all the city is a car enough 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.400
 Jyrki works very well 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.050
 bumps just with our bumps 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.000
 probably still not a single car 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.220
 never cope cars 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.300
 getting better but our roads are not 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.680
 stand still 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.450
 in the cabin I have already managed to dig deeper 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.940
 a little bit this thing on the central 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.069
 panels here earlier there is a pack of cigarettes not 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.099
 put 10 already arm to go to sleep 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.060
 that is, the side door pockets here 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.590
 front sheathed 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.220
 so somehow soft felt 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.340
 material is convenient there is nothing on them 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:00.220
 does not sound shocked at us as our people 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.900
 my unit car there very often on 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.670
 everyone talked about the center panel 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.209
 still very nicely unfolded it in 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.209
 driver's side 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.129
 slightly changed the climate design 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:18.950
 installation and take as we learn from us 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:22.140
 repairs roads we have forest 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.799
 repairs road categories 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.819
 yes yes yes yes and quite recently 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:32.159
 I came across an official material in 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.239
 which it was written that this year on 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:39.329
 repair of our roads identified 249 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.450
 million rubles from the federal budget 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:46.590
 more precisely, we identified 500 last year 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.430
 broke means for two years and we in 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.810
 this year repair 57 streets is planned 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.019
 who by the way are residents of our city 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.829
 chosen by voting which 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.000
 was opened by the city administration 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.980
 a little by the way I would like to 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.109
 say about the parking system to draw 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.629
 attention on which is shown all 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:13.049
 this thing and here when you turn the steering wheel 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:15.239
 we not only see where the back will go 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.820
 part of the car you also see where it goes 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.650
 our front part which girls have 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.770
 we often like to hang on 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.169
 nearby cars and not so 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.760
 understood system at speed there 20 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.530
 liters per hour just turns off and 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.409
 transfers its standard mode 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.020
 well let's try to park that 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:36.840
 we see here that is, we unscrew the steering wheel 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.909
 there is a nice drive up there 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.190
 there are some steps that just 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:43.900
 we must be fine now 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.080
 appeared on the PDC 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.370
 what a cafe is behind us here and we are on 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.120
 monitor this whole thing 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.630
 see we feel very nice that is 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.780
 firebox 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.930
 we stood on the handbrake that is, here is the lid 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.300
 tank my gift is back and that's it 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.419
 yes yes here's the famous boomerang to him 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.180
 Now we will remove this moment, that is, the form 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:11.039
 rear pillar 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:14.080
 clearly resembles precisely here died ankh 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:18.360
 real such australian mound this 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:22.150
 here there is a tribute to the fourth generation of golf 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:25.710
 which was probably a legend and probably 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.710
 remains a legend of its time
