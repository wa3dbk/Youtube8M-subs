00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.860
 to arrange against the bee knew the ball 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.719
 always leave for the night 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.170
 it is necessary for the bee family 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.140
 stash calmed down and in the morning the bees will 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.480
 consciously already fly over 1 to 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.359
 apron we go to the ball and close all 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.060
 do not touch the upper entrance 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.600
 so as not to disturb the family carefully we take 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.500
 hive and in tier and set on flat 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.750

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.800
 hermitages 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.660
 we take out the hive on the base of q in the morning at 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.420
 reaching ambient temperature 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:09.180
 air + 8 degrees Celsius begins 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:11.010
 circling man we know that the bees over the winter 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.720
 Don't forget where they stood in the past 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.850
 year, therefore, to exclude meetings 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.009
 raids on the apiary if possible in children 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.869

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.409
 Last year at this place was the will 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.650

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.280
 exhibitions may not stand exactly in a row 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.570
 leaning to the left or right it will be 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.579
 mend at the first inspection 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.350
 transplanting in person when the temperature 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.200
 ambient air will not lower plus 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.270
 15 degrees Celsius most important 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.159
 report cleansing bee overflow and 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.049
 only in flight the bee expresses its 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.310
 intestines from feces which 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.290
 accumulated then 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.780
 the bee has no right guard well I 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.369
 so every person get out of the difference
