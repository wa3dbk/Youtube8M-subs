00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:08.790
 and that based on the envelope of Jalisco 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.790
 in the image 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.310
 we have Carmen to review a topic there 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.480
 is 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:25.660
 I guess in the last row of the 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.490
 good theater was presented some clear 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.169
 looking excited and going depending on 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.169
 Press agrees to work to see my 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.169
 son 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.540
 you do not shut up 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.700
 there is a lot of sad emotion of the lion king ' 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.700
 but equal 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.380
 and he was on legs in case he was in 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.900
 three theater houses let's say but only 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:06.410
 with the saw 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:15.420
 if you also have features and how 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:18.050
 comes running I hoped it would be 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.050
 too 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.840
 when he took me all 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.870
 sorry but this will not generate jealousy in the 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.870
 cast 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.010
 I will tell when the work that 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.470
 obviously the author goes to the function of 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.080
 press the author did not go through all the 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.920
 dressing rooms of the rest of the cast and there 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.920
 people who do not like 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.460
 the director for camarín by cliques 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.460
 the evolution to each of its clearings 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.460
 correct them 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:06.720
 I congratulate you and share with you but not 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.720
 He passed by all to Marines, not for me 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.739
 Marin is the director 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.360
 the same would have to look for the tip 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.430
 in the situation of chichilo viale and 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.010
 daniela degrees that also tell me 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:30.240
 that eight cunts pleased happy 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.240
 no not with the whole situation 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.760
 She tells me that Mrs. Carmen is more good and 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.450
 very happy can not be because 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.209
 Boys 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.209
 the protagonist is with nasa 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.930
 what do artists mean in the 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.860
 premiere I do not think it's too bad of 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.860
 we are happening 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.040
 carmen another function the Havana oil 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.800
 more and more things are adding 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.780
 so the audience responds very well to us 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.540
 We had fun with each other 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.819
 well what happens is that it has to do 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.340
 with the stage and the play then there's 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.569
 all a seasoning a novel if you 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.360
 wants to say it in some way that 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:46.000
 they are adding actors and what is said 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.900
 about marcelo's relationship and love 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.849
 cosentino for nazarena if they are very friends 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.420
 nasa with marcelo we are the three together 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.100
 a sea of ​​silver before debuting to 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.140
 rehearse the three a scene that we have 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.530
 we 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.410
 rehearse to know on stage 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.600
 We were with the three of them and when 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:14.110
 I said they were going out I was there with them 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.450
 we had one we rented a house in the 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.940
 tell us that the three of us lived together and 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.260
 this and I'll say no 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.480
 you're going to win I was there I did not see anything 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.700
 I can tell you yes and if I had seen 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.770
 in accounting but you really 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:35.260
 I can tell that nothing to see you did not see 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.670
 looks gestures because as you do not speak that 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.480
 I see 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:42.520
 I do not see a romance between them that way and 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.800
 back of looks I never saw her 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.580
 maybe marcelo if he looked at her with eyes of 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:52.420
 love and this love you because not the 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:55.390
 time in each person is different times 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.910
 it's 10 years old is before sometimes it's one that 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.850
 You need to be with someone to get you 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.010
 embrace in the most difficult moments and 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:07.200
 that I love you that is a man that is not 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.200
 a friend already has millions of friends
