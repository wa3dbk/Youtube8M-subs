00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the one base and you build everything in

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.490 
the one base and you build everything in
that<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:41.040> base<00:00:41.280> whereas<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.090> see<00:00:42.570> no<00:00:42.690> nuts<00:00:42.870> you

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
that one base whereas in see no nuts you

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.290 
that one base whereas in see no nuts you
you<00:00:43.860> place<00:00:44.129> your<00:00:44.280> bases<00:00:44.670> individually

wherever in any region you put in you
put<00:00:48.239> them<00:00:48.329> anywhere<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> map<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.370> that

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
put them anywhere on the map and that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.970 
put them anywhere on the map and that
really<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:51.059> means<00:00:51.300> you're<00:00:52.289> you're<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.860> that

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
really just means you're you're in that

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.959 
really just means you're you're in that
region<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.640> defend<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.940> region<00:00:55.969> you

you're sort of the basis visibility on

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.979 
you're sort of the basis visibility on
what<00:01:02.640> what<00:01:02.969> your<00:01:03.120> foes<00:01:03.300> they<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.629> see<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.969 

you<00:01:13.300> know<00:01:13.480> the<00:01:13.720> Firaxis<00:01:13.990> remake<00:01:14.500> it<00:01:14.650> was<00:01:14.800> like

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
you know the Firaxis remake it was like

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.800 
you know the Firaxis remake it was like
a<00:01:15.010> move<00:01:15.280> shoot<00:01:15.700> that's<00:01:16.180> kind<00:01:16.420> of<00:01:16.450> all<00:01:16.570> you<00:01:16.690> did

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
a move shoot that's kind of all you did

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.480 
a move shoot that's kind of all you did
yet<00:01:17.020> two<00:01:17.170> action<00:01:17.500> points<00:01:17.530> basically<00:01:18.250> and

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
yet two action points basically and

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.030 
yet two action points basically and
that's<00:01:19.000> all<00:01:19.150> you<00:01:19.240> get<00:01:19.420> whereas<00:01:20.290> in<00:01:20.590> Z<00:01:20.770> no<00:01:20.830> knots

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
that's all you get whereas in Z no knots

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.219 
that's all you get whereas in Z no knots
and<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.370> original<00:01:21.670> XCOM<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.540> get<00:01:22.750> a<00:01:22.960> number

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
and the original XCOM you get a number

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.500 
and the original XCOM you get a number
of<00:01:23.440> action<00:01:23.740> points<00:01:23.890> like<00:01:24.190> say<00:01:24.400> 70<00:01:24.850> or<00:01:25.000> 60<00:01:25.119> and

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
of action points like say 70 or 60 and

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.980 
of action points like say 70 or 60 and
every<00:01:25.810> action<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.170> take<00:01:26.640> costs<00:01:27.690> some<00:01:28.690> happen

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
every action you take costs some happen

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.750 
every action you take costs some happen
point<00:01:29.200> so<00:01:29.290> you<00:01:29.380> can<00:01:29.530> say<00:01:29.860> you<00:01:29.920> can<00:01:30.160> move<00:01:30.340> shoot

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
point so you can say you can move shoot

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.020 
point so you can say you can move shoot
move<00:01:31.240> shoot<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:32.020> should<00:01:32.440> move<00:01:32.740> shoot<00:01:33.160> move<00:01:33.400> so

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
move shoot it should move shoot move so

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.060 
move shoot it should move shoot move so
there's<00:01:34.270> just<00:01:34.330> a<00:01:34.540> bigger<00:01:34.750> palette<00:01:35.740> of<00:01:35.860> things

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
there's just a bigger palette of things

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.219 
there's just a bigger palette of things
you<00:01:36.190> can<00:01:36.369> do<00:01:36.550> xeno<00:01:37.060> nuts<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.750> know<00:01:37.840> in<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.020> trunk

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
you can do xeno nuts you know in a trunk

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.440 
you can do xeno nuts you know in a trunk
when<00:01:38.410> it<00:01:38.500> comes<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.860> tactical<00:01:39.450> fighting

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
when it comes to tactical fighting

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.620 
when it comes to tactical fighting
there's<00:01:40.930> on<00:01:41.320> any<00:01:41.710> proper<00:01:42.460> classes<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:43.570> to

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
there's on any proper classes so to

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.210 
there's on any proper classes so to
speak<00:01:43.840> it's<00:01:44.050> all<00:01:44.259> based<00:01:44.530> on<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:44.830> stats<00:01:45.070> of

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
speak it's all based on the stats of

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.499 
speak it's all based on the stats of
your<00:01:45.340> character<00:01:45.759> so<00:01:45.970> if<00:01:46.119> he<00:01:46.270> has<00:01:46.360> high

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
your character so if he has high

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:47.639 
your character so if he has high
accuracy<00:01:46.840> you're<00:01:47.110> going<00:01:47.289> to<00:01:47.350> want<00:01:47.470> to<00:01:47.500> make

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
accuracy you're going to want to make

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.590 
accuracy you're going to want to make
from<00:01:47.800> the<00:01:47.920> sniper<00:01:48.190> if<00:01:48.670> he<00:01:48.820> has<00:01:48.940> a<00:01:48.970> high<00:01:49.210> reflex

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
from the sniper if he has a high reflex

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.670 
from the sniper if he has a high reflex
