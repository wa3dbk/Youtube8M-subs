00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
off to supply depots and a tank depot

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.529 
off to supply depots and a tank depot
sort<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.490> around<00:00:17.789> there<00:00:18.029> where<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.210> can<00:00:18.270> see

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
sort of around there where you can see

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.660 
sort of around there where you can see
on<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.750> map<00:00:18.900> or<00:00:19.170> even<00:00:19.800> on<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.949> other<00:00:20.100> side<00:00:20.369> or

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
on the map or even on the other side or

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.550 
on the map or even on the other side or
in<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.939> middle<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.750> middle<00:00:21.779> doesn't<00:00:22.260> work<00:00:22.380> as

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
in the middle the middle doesn't work as

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.109 
in the middle the middle doesn't work as
well<00:00:22.590> for<00:00:22.740> dynamics<00:00:23.369> i'll<00:00:23.460> probably<00:00:23.699> scout

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
well for dynamics i'll probably scout

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.900 
well for dynamics i'll probably scout
with<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.359> Recon<00:00:24.900> but<00:00:25.859> anywhere<00:00:26.699> that's

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
with the Recon but anywhere that's

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.150 
with the Recon but anywhere that's
sorted<00:00:27.210> out<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> way<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.080> basically<00:00:28.980> what

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
sorted out of the way and basically what

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.939 
sorted out of the way and basically what
you<00:00:29.279> want<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.519> do<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:30.080> once<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.289> sort<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.830> on

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
you want to do is once that sort of on

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.530 
you want to do is once that sort of on
its<00:00:32.099> way<00:00:32.279> you're<00:00:32.489> going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.669> use<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> camera<00:00:33.210> net

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
its way you're going to use a camera net

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.350 
its way you're going to use a camera net
to<00:00:33.719> hide<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.350> another<00:00:35.340> sneaky<00:00:36.030> thing<00:00:36.239> is

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
to hide it and another sneaky thing is

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.740 
to hide it and another sneaky thing is
put<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> decoy<00:00:37.170> airbase<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:38.640> your<00:00:39.120> base<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.600> your

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
put a decoy airbase in your base so your

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.420 
put a decoy airbase in your base so your
enemy<00:00:40.050> actually<00:00:40.440> thinks<00:00:40.770> you're<00:00:40.890> rushing

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
enemy actually thinks you're rushing

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
with paratroops or bombers or something

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.150 
with paratroops or bombers or something
now<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.350> can<00:00:46.559> see<00:00:46.739> I've<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:47.010> switched

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
now as you can see I've just switched

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.330 
now as you can see I've just switched
that<00:00:47.520> over<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:49.170> show<00:00:49.410> my<00:00:49.620> base<00:00:49.860> camp<00:00:50.190> now

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
that over to to show my base camp now

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.279 
that over to to show my base camp now
you<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.940> say<00:00:51.090> about<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.390> D<00:00:51.539> clear<00:00:51.809> field

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
you can say about the D clear field

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.170 
you can say about the D clear field
supplies<00:00:53.250> again<00:00:53.640> they're<00:00:53.850> probably<00:00:54.059> thinking

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
supplies again they're probably thinking

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.660 
supplies again they're probably thinking

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
by now you should have another ruse so

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
I've got one more tank left behind he

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.819 
I've got one more tank left behind he
finally<00:01:50.009> catches<00:01:50.130> up<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:52.350> make<00:01:52.619> these

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
finally catches up and this make these

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
don't take very long that's why you want

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.760 
don't take very long that's why you want
to<00:01:54.329> make<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.570> as<00:01:54.659> close<00:01:54.899> as<00:01:55.110> possible<00:01:55.170> because

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
to make it as close as possible because

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.090 
to make it as close as possible because
that<00:01:56.159> way<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.509> eliminate<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.689> gap<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.200> time

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that way you eliminate the gap of time

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.340 
that way you eliminate the gap of time
they<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.520> react<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.079> against

they have to react and this is against

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
honestly work better against a human

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.180
