00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:09.660
 we removed the old plaster that 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.300
 he did it with little grit sand 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.340
 snug with a sock enough 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:21.470
 spartan and we know pastoni donocol 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:26.160
 new with a crushed stone machine e 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:29.990
 river sand with the right dose of 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.309
 cement so that it does not split 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.410
 the important thing is not to overdo it says doctor 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.130
 because in these areas where there is the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.820
 earthquake 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.700
 the elections are always lurking and it is 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.430
 better to be with a dowry of cement 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.210
 lower then the right dose of 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:53.410
 lime cement a type of sand 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.829
 slightly with a little I understand more 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.829
 thick 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.720
 we opened this little left 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:06.900
 which has been buffered in the past and for 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.680
 a savings pact we have earned 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.180
 a window of the tables we have in 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.440
 somehow put together we have 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.490
 built the track that can tame 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.490
 this wooden boat 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.460
 nothing the aluminum distorted with the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.460
 main entrance 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.790
 I searched for similar materials at the door 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.070
 and of the indoro that has now been made 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.930
 worse nibali and has dried out now yes 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.710
 it's about switching to these 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.710
 soul up 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.020
 here is the left we have gained 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.210
 creating it practically in a way 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.720
 crafts 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.720
 after which it will be fixed on its behalf 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.979
 just won us was passed like 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.470
 You see these houses perfectly 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.919
 old building therefore with the 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.930
 frattazzo is not homogeneous with salt than of 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.540
 usually I handle it with his own 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.630
 a lot of palace way of doing a job 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:39.500
 uniform and make the wall more straight 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.479
 possible here it is now 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.450
 wait for another east this 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:47.260
 we tax everything nice for 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.260
 who is punished 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:47.110
 and we have finished treating ours 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:49.870
 wall that is not plastered now it is 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.569
 to wait a few days for you 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.229
 help perfectly then we'll do 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:55.229
 finishing touches
