00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.480
 there is a lot of balance 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.910
 Colombia also does not much 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.270
 was in a world cup to us does a 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.559
 great experience is the team that 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.180
 there they have fewer players who have 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.540
 played worldwide 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.920
 so we have to be careful I think 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.530
 yes 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.850
 what happened was good but now it starts 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:26.520
 another story with respect there is a team 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.190
 as japan 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.470
 the Asians already playing many 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.290
 consecutive world a team that 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.480
 plays is no longer in Japan of the first 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.820
 world and ivory coast that is 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.440
 also three consecutive worlds a 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.440
 african strong team 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.449
 I think it can be a complication 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.579
 so I think it's going to be very even and 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.379
 very attractive especially also by the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.940
 styles is activities you have a good 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.949
 detail that marks that Colombia seems 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.719
 be the most experienced in the subject of 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.850
 the ability of the football player to have 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.379
 played other cups of the world but 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.210
 it is also true that they are strong what 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.530
 you see how very even is a group in the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.800
 that it is very difficult to say who is the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.800
 candidate 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.300
 yes yes yes we trust that 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.180
 we have potential and 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.550
 and we are going to work with that idea 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.440
 to continue growing in the world and 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.920
 be able to get into the other group 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:27.049
 already in eighth but that is a goal 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.600
 which will not be easy 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.450
 because each party has its difficulty 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.860
 the brasilia horizon and whose base are 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.840
 the venues let 's say the horizon in 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.670
 the means are wanted in the center of 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.549
 country to the east of course all thinking 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.009
 in the sea whose va it is a place of much 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.380
 Brasilia heat is also not far away 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.470
 this makes you alter the plans of the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.950
 time to think where they're going to go let's say 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.409
 the days of world 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.799
 it is not 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.259
 is within what we could expect 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:06.560
 so let's now do the 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.479
 planning we have these months 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.750
 go fine tuning all the details of the 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.849
 logistics and also prepare the friendly 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.090
 that we will now see with some 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.040
 coaches that we can formalize already 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.230
 knowing the equipment that we are going to 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.280
 face the heat of cuiaba for 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.720
 Colombians who are used not 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.580
 It would seem to be a very 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.460
 important 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.760
 is for both of them with japan, but it is a 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.670
 different situation because 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.829
 here 's a previous stay our 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.040
 players also play in europe 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.780
 or maybe it confuses a bit the fact 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.370
 the tie is played locally 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:48.599
 Barranquilla but for sure 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.690
 I take it maybe as the last 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:55.080
 situation the most important thing is the 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.379
 potential of the equipment and as you already 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.819
 I say 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.819
 I respect Japan a lot
