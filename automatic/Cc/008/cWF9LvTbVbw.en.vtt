00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.700
 and everyone was six matches 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.990
 to French turntables which I hope that 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.849
 you have good for me it's okay 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.190
 not bad so today I'm going to you 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.359
 explain how to place your letters if 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.650
 you want them subject to the interest of a 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.600
 x360 controller 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.970
 so you see there is a manna is 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.670
 silly on 60 disassemble so this is 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.279
 inside the circuit board so 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.529
 first of all for me we bother 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.360
 we will remove the independence of 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.370
 vibration 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.129
 I have just two clips if you just have 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.770
 to attract but slowly and says 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.120
 gently still not break it 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.940
 so there normally you will be 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.379
 quiet so the two points this book 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.940
 is right next to the policies 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.190
 so why do justic furnaces 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.610
 with your welding machine we will remove 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.170
 steve games we never know that so 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.489
 there on the other hand to show you how it goes 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.840
 to be delicate because it's really 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.750
 very small so I will try to me 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.180
 show 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.460
 yeah I know of vera told me put in 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.799
 point here that's where you see right there 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.040
 there under the little white thing 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:19.619
 you have a small weld so there 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.710
 it's the least month of the letter that 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.119
 you are going to have from the opposite the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.900
 last under the orders of the same 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.090
 line 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.040
 if the most is to agree the offer of the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.939
 soul and the most so I 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.640
 will show you with a letter 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.829
 starts to really do she wanted 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.090
 to be his psychic development years 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.340
 so you have to know that for 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.170
 wireless controllers its 3-volt delays 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.640
 it does not take for the joysticks with 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.860
 phil give up the two nail symbols then 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.369
 you have resistance for me 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.540
 with now because she just knows 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.119
 than 12 volts the results so that's it 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.950
 So you pull out your little dog his 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.320
 very small 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.210
 so the taller the bigger the next 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.890
 it's the smallest month it's the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.450
 more so I'm going to show you 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.909
 when you put in contact on the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.829
 weld spot but on the only 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.849
 works and that's how these 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.890
 two weeks and if you want that if 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.900
 see if I would like to take 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:23.700
 the back of your xbox you put back 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:26.180
 your circuit on it put in a pack 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.180
 charged batteries 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.120
 you should know that led is not learned 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.720
 really a lot of energy on the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.480
 batteries here so we put the batteries you 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.540
 have not turned on your controller 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:43.620
 so here if I'm doing that that's it so that's it 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.950
 and on these passionate so serious 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:51.329
 option 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:53.880
 so here is so you see and after he 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.530
 there is just one same parade to weld 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.549
 noble ensures that after you can put 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.670
 inside any button 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.269
 for example in the village like that it is 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.350
 a home button 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:07.049
 so just cut one 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.209
 end like that with a knife 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:14.090
 something else and you can spend the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:16.769
 led like that without it hindering the level 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.510
 the circuit works and so that I 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.069
 will show you 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.359
 so here you go you can world 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.410
 all at the same time but on 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.810
 the environment because it's not a 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.000
 bomb or transparent torres it will take a 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.069
 transparent or original I regret the 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.079
 origins sends on the x but I sign 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.560
 a touch of chrome and so normally 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.090
 must not see much but it can 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.799
 maybe work we'll see 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.590
 you still see that they were going 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:45.420
 come on so here is kill so we can also 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.500
 put in the money abxy buttons 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.500
 is not on the sleeve is not asked 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.870
 in this box 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:05.350
 if I have buttons on the bridge 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.590
 no I do not have it in there so you 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.590
 completely wrong 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.680
 on the other hand for the buttons it's a bit 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.850
 more difficult 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.060
 should you take a drill 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.900
 you see inside the buttons there 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.470
 is something that looks like 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:33.170
 a drilling machine that wants to thin out 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.000
 this tweak not up to the bottom you have 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.680
 tried to stop not far away because 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.260
 it's all new china just needs that 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.370
 it fits 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.940
 and then there will be no need 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:48.020
 to cut on the side you can bend 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:53.030
 the watelet sticks that will come to support 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:56.150
 on contacts it starts to 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.190
 inside and then with a pistol 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.240
 to glue you to make up for the lack 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.760
 who had to show you I do not know 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.070
 if it works very well of course but me 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.710
 we will do again you see that the 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.590
 contacts it worked so that's the 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:17.080
 light she finally comes the button I 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.130
 will forget the led so the button and 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.140
 yes there we see nothing because it is a 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.160
 color obviously but you with at 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.210
 original button 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.190
 we are doing very well because the buttons 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.380
 are transparent in fact so that's it 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.930
 so there you see the light goes on 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.770
 still so we have it so we can 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.120
 do the same thing with the joysticks 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.980
 knowing that young people who are just at 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.920
 side you just have to pair the bars 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.080
 and the media like that sticks and here 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.310
 on the bar of just hic it will be seen at 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.500
 through critics and young people 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.060
 transparent girls so here is so 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.470
 I hope you enjoyed this tutorial I 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.290
 give you the whole fish the result on 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.800
 a joystick for the home button and that's it 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.450
 so I tell you to the next nature 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.180
 so that's the result it gave 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.340
 so that's a tustin mania so 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.889
 the empress button emirate guides the uncle 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.849
 for the moment nothing special 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.629
 it's only when you go to put 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:05.710
 the battery that's going to make you have 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:07.080
 just a battery match and there 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:12.819
 normally 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:14.199
 here is the led lights up here I hope 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:16.029
 that you would not want more if you wanted 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:18.539
 other disputes count with the 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:18.539
 here
