00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
hi I'm nationally and thank you for

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.059 
hi I'm nationally and thank you for
watching<00:00:05.069> I<00:00:05.580> learn<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.120> enemy<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.540> calm<00:00:07.069> moving

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
watching I learn to enemy to calm moving

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.820 
watching I learn to enemy to calm moving
on<00:00:08.189> from<00:00:08.490> here<00:00:09.260> we<00:00:10.260> are<00:00:10.290> going<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.559> try<00:00:10.740> to

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
on from here we are going to try to

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.820 
on from here we are going to try to
complete<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:11.790> whole<00:00:11.849> animation<00:00:12.630> by<00:00:13.469> having

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
complete this whole animation by having

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.179 
complete this whole animation by having
more<00:00:14.130> bounce<00:00:14.509> for<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.750> basketball<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:19.189> you

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
more bounce for this basketball and you

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.890 
more bounce for this basketball and you
know<00:00:20.369> do<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.270> got<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> cream<00:00:21.689> more

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
know do that we got a cream more

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.990 
know do that we got a cream more
keyframes<00:00:22.109> definitely<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.460> what<00:00:23.789> I'm<00:00:23.880> going

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
keyframes definitely so what I'm going

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.250 
keyframes definitely so what I'm going
to<00:00:24.090> do<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.420> frame<00:00:25.109> 20<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:26.160> can<00:00:26.369> see<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:27.260> I'm

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
to do is frame 20 you can see that I'm

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.049 
to do is frame 20 you can see that I'm
frame<00:00:28.670> 12<00:00:29.670> frame<00:00:29.910> 10<00:00:30.240> goes<00:00:31.199> down<00:00:31.489> frame<00:00:32.489> 10<00:00:32.790> to

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
frame 12 frame 10 goes down frame 10 to

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.620 
frame 12 frame 10 goes down frame 10 to
frame<00:00:33.329> 20<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.710> goes<00:00:34.950> back<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.850> that's

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
frame 20 it goes back up and that's

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.069 
frame 20 it goes back up and that's
ticket<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.440> I'm<00:00:37.590> going<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:37.920> at<00:00:38.190> frame<00:00:38.489> 30

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
ticket that I'm going to be at frame 30

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.639 
ticket that I'm going to be at frame 30
I'm<00:00:40.079> going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> pull<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:41.000> down<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.500> make<00:00:43.500> it

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
I'm going to pull this down and make it

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.850 
I'm going to pull this down and make it
faster<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.730> just<00:00:44.969> press<00:00:45.239> bring<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> value<00:00:46.410> 5

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
faster you just press bring the value 5

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.340 
faster you just press bring the value 5
and<00:00:48.230> ok<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:50.370> graph<00:00:50.700> your<00:00:51.000> looks<00:00:51.390> like

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
and ok and the graph your looks like

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.650 
and ok and the graph your looks like
this<00:00:53.059> ok<00:00:54.170> now<00:00:55.170> I'm<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.160> share<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
this ok now I'm going to share you the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.229 
this ok now I'm going to share you the
second<00:00:58.350> piece<00:00:58.559> bodemer<00:00:58.980> apply<00:00:59.460> here<00:00:59.820> which<00:01:00.000> is

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
second piece bodemer apply here which is

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.889 
second piece bodemer apply here which is
timing<00:01:01.219> timing<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.609> very<00:01:02.820> important<00:01:03.629> when<00:01:03.840> it

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
timing timing is very important when it

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.300 
timing timing is very important when it
comes<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.500> animation<00:01:06.470> logically<00:01:07.470> last<00:01:08.040> thing

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
comes to animation logically last thing

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.590 
comes to animation logically last thing
when<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> ball<00:01:09.540> loses<00:01:10.140> energy<00:01:10.970> it<00:01:11.970> bounces<00:01:12.450> up

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
when the ball loses energy it bounces up

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.340 
when the ball loses energy it bounces up
at<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> lower<00:01:13.290> distance<00:01:14.540> which<00:01:15.540> means<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.080> time

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
at a lower distance which means the time

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.210 
at a lower distance which means the time
taken<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.740> reach<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.960> lower<00:01:18.960> distance<00:01:19.530> should

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
taken to reach the lower distance should

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.780 
taken to reach the lower distance should
be<00:01:20.430> shorter<00:01:21.420> right<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.509> at<00:01:24.509> frame<00:01:25.080> 20<00:01:25.790> this

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
be shorter right so at frame 20 this

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.450 
be shorter right so at frame 20 this
this<00:01:27.270> particular<00:01:27.470> keyframe<00:01:28.470> Dinty<00:01:28.860> should<00:01:29.280> be

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
this particular keyframe Dinty should be

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.899 
this particular keyframe Dinty should be
when<00:01:29.640> shorter<00:01:30.259> compared<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> first

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
when shorter compared to the first

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.630 
when shorter compared to the first
duration<00:01:32.909> when<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.210> run<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.689> bar<00:01:33.930> drops<00:01:34.200> down

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
duration when I run a bar drops down

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.450 
duration when I run a bar drops down
from<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.509> ten<00:01:37.100> test<00:01:38.100> nine<00:01:38.700> key<00:01:38.970> frames

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
from one to ten test nine key frames

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.639 
from one to ten test nine key frames
from<00:01:41.460> 10<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.180> 20<00:01:42.750> days<00:01:43.640> about<00:01:45.049> 10<00:01:46.049> key<00:01:46.350> frames

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
from 10 to 20 days about 10 key frames

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.649 
from 10 to 20 days about 10 key frames
which<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.369> more<00:01:47.670> than<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.909> previous<00:01:48.299> keyframe

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
which is more than a previous keyframe

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.600 
which is more than a previous keyframe
and<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.560> logical<00:01:49.770> at<00:01:50.070> all<00:01:50.130> that's

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
and that is not logical at all that's

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.749 
and that is not logical at all that's
not<00:01:50.820> realistic<00:01:51.170> ok<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.680> let<00:01:53.310> us<00:01:53.340> try<00:01:53.729> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
not realistic ok so let us try to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.870 
not realistic ok so let us try to
achieve<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.770> frame<00:01:55.770> 20<00:01:56.159> key<00:01:56.369> frames<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.850> a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
achieve this frame 20 key frames to a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.719 
achieve this frame 20 key frames to a
little<00:01:57.149> bit<00:01:57.240> shorter<00:01:57.530> maybe<00:01:58.530> by<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:59.100> one<00:01:59.549> or

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
little bit shorter maybe by just one or

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.109 
little bit shorter maybe by just one or
two<00:01:59.759> keyframes<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.680> how<00:02:01.680> do<00:02:01.740> we<00:02:01.920> do<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.159> we

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
two keyframes and how do we do that we

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.609 
two keyframes and how do we do that we
can<00:02:03.950> let<00:02:04.950> hold<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.549> chief<00:02:06.079> poor<00:02:07.079> Mouse<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:07.590> a

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
can let hold on chief poor Mouse on a

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.650 
can let hold on chief poor Mouse on a
framed<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.580> giver<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:08.910> select

left-click just like this

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.950 
left-click just like this
can<00:02:12.070> see<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.580> whole<00:02:12.820> trim<00:02:13.600> paint<00:02:13.840> is

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
can see that the whole trim paint is

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.950 
can see that the whole trim paint is
being<00:02:14.230> selected<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.910> we<00:02:16.060> can<00:02:16.330> actually<00:02:16.450> drag

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
being selected and we can actually drag

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.400 
being selected and we can actually drag
this<00:02:17.280> backwards<00:02:18.280> I'm<00:02:18.910> going<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.270> put<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.510> frame

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
this backwards I'm going to put a frame

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.450 
this backwards I'm going to put a frame
it<00:02:20.740> in<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:22.240> that<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:23.010> taking<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.070> shorter

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
it in so that it is taking a shorter

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.940 
it in so that it is taking a shorter
time<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:25.000> reach<00:02:25.240> a<00:02:25.480> shorter<00:02:26.020> distance<00:02:26.140> which

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
time to reach a shorter distance which

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.580 
time to reach a shorter distance which
makes<00:02:27.400> sense<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.900> same<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:30.610> next<00:02:30.940> keyframe

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590

i'm going to hold on shiv again and left
click<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:38.230> highlight<00:02:38.500> this<00:02:38.770> keyframe<00:02:39.130> and

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
click and to highlight this keyframe and

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:48.930 
click and to highlight this keyframe and
bring<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.270> backwards<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:42.090> from<00:02:43.090> 18<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:45.390> 26<00:02:47.940> ok

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
bring it backwards to from 18 to 26 ok

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.930 
bring it backwards to from 18 to 26 ok
so<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:50.620> my<00:02:50.890> key<00:02:51.130> frame<00:02:51.340> is<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.780> duration<00:02:53.110> from

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
so now my key frame is the duration from

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.040 
so now my key frame is the duration from
first<00:02:54.940> keyframe<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.600> second<00:02:55.900> key<00:02:56.020> frame

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
first keyframe to the second key frame

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.670 
first keyframe to the second key frame
is<00:02:56.320> 9<00:02:56.970> from<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.030> second<00:02:58.870> key<00:02:59.050> frame<00:02:59.080> so<00:02:59.650> that

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
is 9 from the second key frame so that

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.650 
is 9 from the second key frame so that
keyframe<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:01.590> from<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:04.000> keyframe<00:03:04.450> to

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
keyframe is it from that keyframe to

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.430 
keyframe is it from that keyframe to
fourth<00:03:04.960> key<00:03:05.200> frame<00:03:05.470> your<00:03:05.710> be<00:03:07.140> also<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.800> well<00:03:09.550> um

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
fourth key frame your be also it well um

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.330 
fourth key frame your be also it well um
I'll<00:03:11.440> choose<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.740> play<00:03:11.950> at<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.340> for<00:03:12.820> now<00:03:14.160> ok<00:03:15.160> and

I'll choose to play at it for now ok and

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.970 
I'll choose to play at it for now ok and
we<00:03:16.300> will<00:03:16.390> just<00:03:16.600> try<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.080> edit<00:03:17.610> this<00:03:19.980> this

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
we will just try to edit this this

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.090 
we will just try to edit this this

handle I will need to actually break

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.230 
handle I will need to actually break
this<00:03:27.970> apart<00:03:29.100> by<00:03:30.100> using<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.520> brick<00:03:30.760> tengen<00:03:33.240> ok

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
this apart by using the brick tengen ok

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.290 
this apart by using the brick tengen ok
and<00:03:34.600> put<00:03:34.959> on<00:03:35.170> make<00:03:35.590> sure<00:03:35.620> that<00:03:35.950> i<00:03:35.980> have<00:03:36.370> my<00:03:36.640> free

and put on make sure that i have my free

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:48.070 
and put on make sure that i have my free
tangent<00:03:37.810> weight<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:39.150> pull<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.180> up<00:03:40.420> here

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:59.050 

okay<00:03:48.710> so<00:03:50.680> this<00:03:51.680> one<00:03:51.950> what<00:03:52.280> power<00:03:52.730> half<00:03:58.060> let's

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
okay so this one what power half let's

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.110 
okay so this one what power half let's
play<00:03:59.330> back

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.710 

okay<00:04:05.870> so<00:04:06.489> we<00:04:07.489> all<00:04:07.610> continue<00:04:07.849> to<00:04:08.030> do<00:04:08.209> this<00:04:08.420> until

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
okay so we all continue to do this until

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.599 
okay so we all continue to do this until
we<00:04:09.709> try<00:04:10.700> to<00:04:10.760> end<00:04:11.090> this<00:04:11.720> whole<00:04:13.060> bouncing<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.510> the

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
we try to end this whole bouncing of the

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.900 
we try to end this whole bouncing of the
basketball<00:04:16.609> okay<00:04:17.479> by<00:04:17.690> reducing<00:04:18.290> a<00:04:18.380> time

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
basketball okay by reducing a time

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.030 
basketball okay by reducing a time
reducing<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.000> height<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.650> again<00:04:21.650> reduce<00:04:21.949> the

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
reducing the height and again reduce the

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.550 
reducing the height and again reduce the
time<00:04:22.250> which<00:04:22.580> is<00:04:22.610> high<00:04:22.970> until<00:04:23.419> it<00:04:23.750> comes<00:04:24.320> to<00:04:24.530> a

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
time which is high until it comes to a

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.200 
time which is high until it comes to a
standstill<00:04:24.889> on<00:04:25.430> a<00:04:25.520> flaw<00:04:26.290> okay<00:04:27.290> so<00:04:27.949> if<00:04:28.820> you<00:04:28.970> can

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
standstill on a flaw okay so if you can

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.890 
standstill on a flaw okay so if you can
do<00:04:29.600> it<00:04:29.720> on<00:04:29.870> your<00:04:29.900> own<00:04:30.020> if<00:04:30.440> not<00:04:31.030> you<00:04:32.030> can<00:04:32.150> see<00:04:32.449> how

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
do it on your own if not you can see how

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.460 
do it on your own if not you can see how
I<00:04:32.930> do<00:04:33.080> it<00:04:33.699> how<00:04:34.699> the<00:04:34.760> graph<00:04:35.120> looks<00:04:35.389> like<00:04:35.600> when

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
I do it how the graph looks like when

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.640 
I do it how the graph looks like when
the<00:04:36.680> whole<00:04:36.860> admission<00:04:37.310> is<00:04:37.430> up<00:04:38.260> ok<00:04:39.260> so<00:04:39.320> I'm

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
the whole admission is up ok so I'm

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.550 
the whole admission is up ok so I'm
going<00:04:39.830> to<00:04:39.889> complete<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.520> rest<00:04:40.850> just<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.870> scsu

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
going to complete the rest just to scsu

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.270 
going to complete the rest just to scsu
in<00:04:43.220> case<00:04:43.490> you're<00:04:43.669> doing<00:04:43.940> on<00:04:44.030> your<00:04:44.150> own<00:04:45.280> you're

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
in case you're doing on your own you're

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.159 
in case you're doing on your own you're
going<00:04:46.400> to<00:04:46.490> try<00:04:46.699> to<00:04:46.729> challenge<00:04:47.090> it<00:04:47.419> you<00:04:47.840> are<00:04:47.990> def

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
going to try to challenge it you are def

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.159 
going to try to challenge it you are def
into<00:04:48.590> have<00:04:49.100> a<00:04:49.130> long<00:04:49.580> time<00:04:49.910> line<00:04:50.150> so<00:04:50.840> all<00:04:51.050> i<00:04:51.080> need

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
into have a long time line so all i need

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.010 
into have a long time line so all i need
to<00:04:51.320> do<00:04:51.500> is<00:04:51.650> use<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:51.949> second<00:04:52.729> box<00:04:53.660> over<00:04:53.990> here

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
to do is use the second box over here

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.409 
to do is use the second box over here
this<00:04:54.530> second<00:04:55.190> box<00:04:55.400> means<00:04:55.760> the<00:04:56.210> total

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
this second box means the total

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.500 
this second box means the total
animation<00:04:57.320> timing<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:59.000> we<00:04:59.270> can<00:04:59.449> actually

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
animation timing and we can actually

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.379 
animation timing and we can actually
increase<00:04:59.960> to<00:05:00.639> 300<00:05:01.639> just<00:05:02.449> to<00:05:02.750> be<00:05:02.900> safe<00:05:02.930> and<00:05:04.389> you

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
increase to 300 just to be safe and you

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.740 
increase to 300 just to be safe and you
can<00:05:05.600> actually<00:05:05.720> use<00:05:06.320> this<00:05:06.860> to<00:05:07.310> scrub<00:05:07.699> if<00:05:08.600> you

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
can actually use this to scrub if you

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.620 
can actually use this to scrub if you
wish<00:05:08.960> if<00:05:09.260> you<00:05:09.770> would<00:05:09.950> like<00:05:09.979> to<00:05:10.130> see<00:05:10.490> photo<00:05:11.419> on

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
and something tonight what I normally do

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.129 
and something tonight what I normally do
is<00:05:16.400> I<00:05:16.639> will<00:05:16.849> try<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:17.120> make<00:05:17.389> all<00:05:17.539> the<00:05:17.660> keyframe

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
is I will try to make all the keyframe

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.740 
is I will try to make all the keyframe
first<00:05:18.500> before<00:05:18.950> I<00:05:18.979> did<00:05:19.490> anything<00:05:19.639> in<00:05:20.389> the<00:05:20.510> graph

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
first before I did anything in the graph

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.469 
first before I did anything in the graph
editor<00:05:20.900> so<00:05:21.770> I'll<00:05:22.550> just<00:05:22.610> all<00:05:22.940> the<00:05:23.060> profit<00:05:23.389> it

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
editor so I'll just all the profit it

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:37.519 
editor so I'll just all the profit it
off<00:05:23.630> now<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:28.000> start<00:05:29.000> any<00:05:29.300> meeting

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:37.529 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:06:43.179 

you

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:43.189 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:46.750 

just<00:06:44.189> a<00:06:44.279> sight<00:06:44.520> naught

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 
just a sight naught

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.300 
just a sight naught
to<00:06:46.820> the<00:06:46.910> N<00:06:47.090> are<00:06:48.020> usually<00:06:48.470> try<00:06:48.650> to<00:06:48.680> make<00:06:48.980> it<00:06:49.010> a

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
to the N are usually try to make it a

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.840 
to the N are usually try to make it a
little<00:06:49.610> bit<00:06:49.760> more<00:06:50.330> subtle<00:06:51.100> but<00:06:52.100> the<00:06:52.520> steel

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:52.850 
little bit more subtle but the steel

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.530 
little bit more subtle but the steel
movement<00:06:53.410> because<00:06:54.410> 3d<00:06:55.280> animations<00:06:55.970> are<00:06:56.240> very

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.540 
movement because 3d animations are very

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.780 
movement because 3d animations are very
very<00:06:56.840> precise<00:06:57.230> and<00:06:57.530> the<00:06:58.010> moment<00:06:58.370> it<00:06:58.550> is<00:06:58.580> a

00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:58.790 
very precise and the moment it is a

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.300 
very precise and the moment it is a
total<00:06:59.510> standstill<00:06:59.750> that<00:07:00.530> means<00:07:00.740> the<00:07:00.920> object

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310 
total standstill that means the object

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.380 
total standstill that means the object
is<00:07:01.400> dead<00:07:01.640> or<00:07:02.530> not<00:07:03.530> alive<00:07:03.860> so<00:07:04.700> I<00:07:04.730> will<00:07:05.060> try<00:07:05.330> to

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.390 
is dead or not alive so I will try to

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.990 
is dead or not alive so I will try to
have<00:07:05.750> a<00:07:05.780> very<00:07:06.290> very<00:07:06.590> subtle<00:07:07.130> lingering<00:07:07.880> of

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 
have a very very subtle lingering of

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.030 
have a very very subtle lingering of
animation<00:07:08.690> even<00:07:09.050> when<00:07:09.260> it's<00:07:09.440> almost<00:07:09.770> the<00:07:10.010> end

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.040 
animation even when it's almost the end

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:17.110 
animation even when it's almost the end
and<00:07:12.940> almost<00:07:13.940> like<00:07:14.240> one<00:07:14.570> keyframe<00:07:16.030> just<00:07:17.030> to

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 
and almost like one keyframe just to

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.480 
and almost like one keyframe just to
make<00:07:17.300> sure<00:07:17.330> that<00:07:17.600> it<00:07:17.780> bounds<00:07:18.740> right<00:07:19.310> at<00:07:19.400> the

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.490 
make sure that it bounds right at the

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:26.470 
make sure that it bounds right at the
end<00:07:23.890> let<00:07:24.890> me<00:07:24.950> just<00:07:25.100> that<00:07:25.250> judges<00:07:25.670> so<00:07:25.880> I<00:07:25.910> can<00:07:26.180> see

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:26.480 
end let me just that judges so I can see

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:34.450 
end let me just that judges so I can see
how<00:07:27.170> it<00:07:27.290> looks<00:07:27.380> like<00:07:27.680> for<00:07:27.920> now<00:07:33.010> of<00:07:34.010> course<00:07:34.370> you

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:34.460 
how it looks like for now of course you

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.160 
how it looks like for now of course you
can<00:07:34.580> choose<00:07:34.820> let<00:07:35.090> it<00:07:35.180> lingers<00:07:35.630> a<00:07:35.720> bit<00:07:35.840> longer

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:36.170 
can choose let it lingers a bit longer

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.560 
can choose let it lingers a bit longer
if<00:07:36.410> you<00:07:36.500> wish<00:07:36.740> to<00:07:37.010> but<00:07:37.640> this<00:07:37.940> is<00:07:38.060> roughly<00:07:38.360> how

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:38.570 
if you wish to but this is roughly how

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.320 
if you wish to but this is roughly how
you'll<00:07:38.750> be<00:07:38.930> like
