00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.540
 what I'm going to do now is a classic grade, a great job that has been 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.079
 let's be a delicacy so it's a passing drink 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:13.449
 superb let's say a drink that has its alcoholic eyes 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:17.789
 but great for people who touch him like in many and uterus 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.529
 bush tan of taste and bourbon 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.720
 be at least for me the best classic drink that exists 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.929
 very easy daddy monkey 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.220

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.500

 only your pregnancy will know 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.040
 you mind bigger pd and good transparent glass than in which or with 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.810
 good costs a lot of contradiction 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.030
 so the first thing you have to do to be a drink is just ask for humacata 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.600
 we automatically refresh the cup we will place the logo to lie 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.930
 three or four threads of that size plus or minus 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.340
 nothing else because it does not have fun because it was war entered 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.730
 good drink is very easy going to only consist 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.820
 percent and a cyborg a plastic ounce of bliss and min 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.010
 that is a lot and bourbon some there are that make us 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.860
 echo a lot of mecano tennis and make it a year because they like that year 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.080
 escassi very similar 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.780
 if ounce the recipe is always going to say a lot and bourbon will suppose the march 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.710

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.700
 I really like muface martin and that's why I asked for martí 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.460

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.210

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.210

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.920

 record a withdrawal entry prepared 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.500
 let's get rid of ice 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.719
 and others 1 we propose to overturn 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:12.719
 they entered when singing 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.929

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.080

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.279

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.279
