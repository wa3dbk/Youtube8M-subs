00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:21.660

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.210

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.830
 digital in minecraft in xbox 360 and what 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.920
 this means that little by little the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.899
 version of minecraft on xbox 360 is 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.540
 approaching the sales that is made in 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.059
 Minecraft 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.649

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.989
 was confirmed today by the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.930
 people of moha not saying that good to 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.949
 this moment minecraft on xbox 360 has 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.360
 12 million sales and I started is in 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.360

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.440
 so that 's super awesome I do not know if 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.020
 imagine that that more than suddenly 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.520
 could arrive or suddenly not but 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.810
 we are close to being able to arrive in the 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.210
 moment that people can more 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.130
 minecraft in consoles that I started already 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.690
 we all know they are going to say nothing perez psc 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.910
 better or that is perfect can be better 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.350
 what you want mods and others but the 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.770
 maybe 7 more comfortable people playing 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.140
 minecraft in your console that I started who 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.850
 I do not know that they move but those are 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.400
 the things that people say of wet do not 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.640
 so you already know 12 million copies 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.520
 sold of minecraft on xbox 360 and 15 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.560
 millions of copies in that eye and we talk 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.180
 only from xbox 360 this to see no 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.930
 We know how many you have sold in 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.320
 Playstation 3 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.360
 how many only learn station bit to 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.530
 how many to see in xbox one and how much 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.660
 also in playstation 4 or people 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.580
 is accepting minecraft very well 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.710
 the games came out in consolidate a happened 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.080
 much better and play it I started from peron 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.600
 little man like but there are gentlemen 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.060
 so you know now we talk about 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.509
 a curious thing not 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.880
 security on xbox one you knew that 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:13.670
 a child of 5 years and a child of 5 years 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.280
 could violate Microsoft's security 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.720
 I'm telling you the story 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.459
 was a 5 year old boy who tried to 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.290
 achieved with his dad's account was not 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.959
 really the kid got into the account 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.690
 of his dad tried to buy something a 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.610
 I try to eat something 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.790
 and obviously when you buy something you 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.950
 they ask for your password and the child said they are 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.320
 wax did not put minecraft so to speak 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.080
 he put minecraft and obviously he gets a 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.390
 message in the xbox one telling you that 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.000
 the password was incorrect and incorrect 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.460
 it obviously came out another box and that 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.180
 set the password that was his father 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:55.060
 what made this boy he is not got nothing 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.660
 only put the bar passes now block 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.960
 and automatically logged into the account 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.270
 his father what does this mean that if I 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.460
 I wanted to go to the account of Mr. Cat and 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.510
 lady has a silver button and has 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.510
 things and so on 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.910
 if I this one exposed his password I left 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.680
 error enters again if I put bar 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.380
 spacer the second time I was already entering 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.780
 Mr. Cat's account and he could buy 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.790
 everything I wanted the people of 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.270
 microsoft thanked the father who reported 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.270
 this 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:33.340
 good people but it's the truth 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.910
 even the father gave him a gift 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.720
 I think not a gift received this 4 games 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.270
 free and $ 50 for membership of 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:49.000
 xbox live gold or be won that 4 free and 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:53.490
 50 dollars for the xbox the one web well 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.490
 that already know a boy of 5 years 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.930
 violate security and this certain huevÃ³n 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.270
 this is very stupid yes no but 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.620
 and obviously we'll see each other until 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.620
 next
