00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
think it's pretty good actually but uh I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.100 
think it's pretty good actually but uh I
musically<00:00:51.239> because<00:00:51.420> most<00:00:51.629> people<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:51.930> use

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
musically because most people just use

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.799 
musically because most people just use
the<00:00:52.260> battle<00:00:52.530> rifle<00:00:52.860> or<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.610> DMR<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the battle rifle or the DMR so and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.389 
the battle rifle or the DMR so and
switch<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.110> up<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> little<00:00:55.469> bit<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:56.250> got

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
switch it up a little bit I just got

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.340 
switch it up a little bit I just got
over<00:00:56.670> shield<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.239> think<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.719> can't<00:00:58.170> figure

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350
