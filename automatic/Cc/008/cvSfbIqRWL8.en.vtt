factory<00:00:39.300> reset<00:00:39.629> which<00:00:40.110> basically<00:00:40.559> involves

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
factory reset which basically involves

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.799 
factory reset which basically involves

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
that shipped with the computer

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.020 
that shipped with the computer
so<00:00:48.469> I'm<00:00:48.559> going<00:00:48.739> to<00:00:48.800> turn<00:00:49.039> off<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.430> laptop<00:00:49.579> and

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
so I'm going to turn off the laptop and

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.369 
so I'm going to turn off the laptop and
then<00:00:50.180> turn<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:50.449> back<00:00:50.660> on<00:00:50.840> again<00:00:50.899> and<00:00:51.170> then

then turn it back on again and then

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.130 
then turn it back on again and then
immediately<00:00:51.949> hit<00:00:52.160> f9<00:00:52.399> as<00:00:52.969> sous<00:00:53.329> laptops<00:00:53.899> have

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
immediately hit f9 as sous laptops have

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.200 
immediately hit f9 as sous laptops have
a<00:00:54.170> recovery<00:00:54.590> partition<00:00:55.340> which<00:00:55.699> you<00:00:55.850> can<00:00:56.030> boot

just going to choose the first option as
it's<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.319> lot<00:02:37.500> faster<00:02:37.769> but<00:02:38.160> if<00:02:38.250> you're<00:02:38.370> selling

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
it's a lot faster but if you're selling

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.430 
it's a lot faster but if you're selling
the<00:02:38.910> computer<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.569> have<00:02:39.690> sensitive<00:02:40.200> data
