let's go so good I wrote it for like two
years<00:00:28.310> I<00:00:28.880> think<00:00:29.060> it<00:00:29.300> went<00:00:29.359> pretty<00:00:29.480> bad<00:00:29.779> but<00:00:30.109> I

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
years I think it went pretty bad but I

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.470 
years I think it went pretty bad but I
just<00:00:30.890> loved<00:00:31.160> it<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.490> fact<00:00:31.699> that<00:00:31.759> I<00:00:31.880> shaped<00:00:32.210> it

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
just loved it the fact that I shaped it

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.390 
just loved it the fact that I shaped it
was<00:00:32.570> just<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:32.900> best<00:00:33.020> thing<00:00:33.170> ever<00:00:33.410> this<00:00:34.100> year

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
is definitely my main focus is being to

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.560 
is definitely my main focus is being to
sort<00:00:37.370> my<00:00:37.489> equipment<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.120> I<00:00:38.149> started<00:00:38.390> working

as<00:00:43.730> a<00:00:43.760> shaper<00:00:44.059> growing<00:00:44.539> up<00:00:44.719> so<00:00:44.980> that<00:00:45.980> helps<00:00:46.219> me

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
as a shaper growing up so that helps me

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.250 
as a shaper growing up so that helps me
know<00:00:46.760> a<00:00:46.789> lot<00:00:47.030> about<00:00:47.059> surfboards<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:47.930> yeah<00:00:48.230> I

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
just ended up making a bunch of really

00:00:50.570 --> 00:01:03.119 
just ended up making a bunch of really
good<00:00:50.780> board

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.380 

you<00:01:04.129> know<00:01:04.250> whatever<00:01:04.400> squad<00:01:04.820> I'm<00:01:04.939> going<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.360> I

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
you know whatever squad I'm going to I

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.660 
you know whatever squad I'm going to I
can<00:01:05.689> tweak<00:01:06.470> you<00:01:06.979> know<00:01:07.100> little<00:01:07.340> things<00:01:07.520> here

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
can tweak you know little things here

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.870 
can tweak you know little things here
and<00:01:07.759> there<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:08.270> make<00:01:08.479> a<00:01:08.630> guy<00:01:08.899> that's<00:01:09.229> quite

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
and there to make a guy that's quite

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.070 
and there to make a guy that's quite
yeah<00:01:10.880> you<00:01:10.939> know<00:01:11.119> my<00:01:11.240> general<00:01:11.600> size<00:01:11.780> short

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
yeah you know my general size short

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.100 
yeah you know my general size short
board<00:01:12.290> is<00:01:12.439> probably<00:01:12.979> six<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:13.520> six<00:01:14.390> -<00:01:14.540> no<00:01:14.570> ha

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
board is probably six to six - no ha

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.010 
board is probably six to six - no ha
just<00:01:15.320> over<00:01:15.560> 1919<00:01:16.280> in<00:01:16.399> a<00:01:16.640> four<00:01:16.970> -<00:01:17.060> why<00:01:17.210> two<00:01:17.869> and<00:01:17.990> a

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
just over 1919 in a four - why two and a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.749 
just over 1919 in a four - why two and a
half<00:01:18.200> thick<00:01:18.470> sometimes<00:01:18.740> I<00:01:19.070> got<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.280> little<00:01:19.399> over

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
half thick sometimes I got a little over

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.670 
half thick sometimes I got a little over
two<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.390> five-eighths<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.110> just<00:01:21.289> you<00:01:21.619> know

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
two and five-eighths and just you know

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.929 
two and five-eighths and just you know
shave<00:01:22.009> it<00:01:22.159> down<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.340> little<00:01:22.460> bit<00:01:22.580> on<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.759> rails

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
shave it down a little bit on the rails

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.820 
shave it down a little bit on the rails
but<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:24.140> most<00:01:24.320> part<00:01:24.530> those<00:01:24.649> are<00:01:24.680> my

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
but the most part those are my

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:39.620 
but the most part those are my
dimensions

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.230 

yeah<00:01:40.630> I<00:01:40.659> think<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:41.110> shorter<00:01:41.409> boards<00:01:42.120> you<00:01:43.120> know

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
yeah I think the shorter boards you know

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.730 
yeah I think the shorter boards you know
so<00:01:43.690> many<00:01:43.750> other<00:01:43.870> guys<00:01:44.080> are<00:01:44.290> trying<00:01:44.440> to<00:01:44.560> not

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
so many other guys are trying to not

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.380 
so many other guys are trying to not
kill<00:01:45.010> Eid<00:01:45.159> and<00:01:45.520> everyone's<00:01:45.820> getting<00:01:45.940> shorter

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
kill Eid and everyone's getting shorter

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.120 
kill Eid and everyone's getting shorter
you<00:01:46.750> know<00:01:46.870> for<00:01:47.110> myself<00:01:47.229> I<00:01:47.530> can't<00:01:47.740> really<00:01:47.890> go<00:01:48.070> to

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
you know for myself I can't really go to

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.940 
you know for myself I can't really go to
too<00:01:48.670> much<00:01:48.700> smaller<00:01:49.150> roles<00:01:49.450> you<00:01:50.170> know<00:01:50.290> I<00:01:50.320> end<00:01:50.740> up

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
too much smaller roles you know I end up

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.190 
too much smaller roles you know I end up
losing<00:01:51.850> paddle<00:01:52.300> power<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:52.810> things<00:01:53.020> like<00:01:53.140> that

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
losing paddle power and things like that

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.109 
losing paddle power and things like that
but<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:54.130> smallest<00:01:54.400> board<00:01:54.729> I'll<00:01:54.880> probably

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
but the smallest board I'll probably

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.540 
but the smallest board I'll probably
ride<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.630> about<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.500> 510<00:01:57.130> or<00:01:57.160> 511<00:01:59.009> about<00:02:00.009> 3<00:02:00.250> or<00:02:00.280> 4

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
ride is about a 510 or 511 about 3 or 4

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.060 
ride is about a 510 or 511 about 3 or 4
years<00:02:00.759> ago<00:02:00.820> I<00:02:01.240> was<00:02:01.540> really<00:02:02.020> solvent<00:02:02.500> Fixman<00:02:02.890> I

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
years ago I was really solvent Fixman I

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.100 
years ago I was really solvent Fixman I
just<00:02:03.340> found<00:02:03.490> that<00:02:03.790> you<00:02:03.910> know<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.150> future<00:02:04.750> fins

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
just found that you know the future fins

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.590 
just found that you know the future fins
were<00:02:05.350> really<00:02:06.280> easy<00:02:06.490> for<00:02:06.700> me<00:02:06.759> to<00:02:06.820> travel<00:02:07.119> it<00:02:07.390> and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
were really easy for me to travel it and

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.600 
were really easy for me to travel it and
at<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.619> same<00:02:08.770> time<00:02:09.009> they<00:02:09.190> were<00:02:09.250> giving<00:02:09.459> me<00:02:09.490> the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610
