00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.620 
harder there's a ball that you put on
the<00:02:56.680> inside<00:02:57.069> and<00:02:57.340> then<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.640> dog<00:02:57.819> has<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.269> try

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
the inside and then the dog has to try

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.710 
the inside and then the dog has to try
to<00:02:58.690> get<00:02:58.959> it<00:02:59.109> outside<00:02:59.650> of<00:03:00.070> these<00:03:00.430> areas<00:03:00.880> it

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
to get it outside of these areas it

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.900 
to get it outside of these areas it
actually<00:03:01.750> came<00:03:02.320> with<00:03:02.380> a<00:03:02.650> few<00:03:02.920> doors<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.579> put<00:03:03.760> on

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
actually came with a few doors to put on

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.900 
actually came with a few doors to put on
these<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.359> make<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.660> harder<00:03:05.049> but<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.640> doors

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
these to make it harder but the doors

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.460 
these to make it harder but the doors
never<00:03:07.390> stayed<00:03:07.900> on<00:03:08.310> properly<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.470> think

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
never stayed on properly so I think

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.500 
never stayed on properly so I think
we've<00:03:11.650> actually<00:03:11.829> lost<00:03:12.250> some<00:03:12.489> of<00:03:12.760> them<00:03:12.910> and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
we've actually lost some of them and

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.990 
we've actually lost some of them and
gave<00:03:13.750> up<00:03:13.870> on<00:03:14.049> putting<00:03:14.350> them<00:03:14.500> on<00:03:14.650> because<00:03:15.000> they

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
gave up on putting them on because they

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.500 
gave up on putting them on because they
just<00:03:16.180> fell<00:03:16.510> off<00:03:17.700> if<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.880> enjoyed<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:19.299> video
