00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
get the shop creator badge it's not that

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.609 
get the shop creator badge it's not that
hard<00:00:26.760> some<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.720> them<00:00:27.779> require<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
hard some of them require you to

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.880 
hard some of them require you to
actually<00:00:28.680> use<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.609> analog<00:00:30.289> so<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> first<00:00:31.679> one

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
actually use the analog so the first one

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.280 
actually use the analog so the first one
is<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.189> hob<00:00:32.399> jumper<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.360> must<00:00:33.600> be<00:00:33.750> running<00:00:33.960> at

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
is the hob jumper you must be running at

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.569 
is the hob jumper you must be running at
a<00:00:34.350> diagonal<00:00:35.059> speed<00:00:36.739> diagonally<00:00:37.739> towards<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
a diagonal speed diagonally towards the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.040 
a diagonal speed diagonally towards the
banks<00:00:38.850> lon<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.750> simply<00:00:40.230> tap<00:00:40.890> square<00:00:42.050> just

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
banks lon and you simply tap square just

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930 
banks lon and you simply tap square just
tap<00:00:43.290> square<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.890> understand<00:00:44.340> some<00:00:44.520> people<00:00:44.550> play

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
tap square I understand some people play

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.380 
tap square I understand some people play
with<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> analog<00:00:45.950> it<00:00:46.950> does<00:00:47.370> work<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.180> you

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
with the analog it does work but you

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.420 
with the analog it does work but you
know<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> bad<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.559> suggest<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.250> just

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
know just for the bad I suggest you just

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.220 
know just for the bad I suggest you just
do<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.690> tap<00:00:51.899> square

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
do it like this you can just tap square

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.189 
do it like this you can just tap square
oh<00:00:53.270> I<00:00:54.270> don't<00:00:54.420> know<00:00:54.570> if<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.079> be

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
oh I don't know if you have to be

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.410 
oh I don't know if you have to be
running<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.770> don't<00:00:56.160> think<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.520> do<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:57.300> it

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
running I don't think you do but it

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.380 
running I don't think you do but it
works<00:00:57.600> either<00:00:57.809> way<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:59.520> next<00:00:59.760> jumper<00:01:00.270> that

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
works either way the next jumper that

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.139 
works either way the next jumper that
you<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.890> step<00:01:02.190> back<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.820> this

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
you have to do is to step back and this

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.460 
you have to do is to step back and this
is<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> one<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.600> i'ma<00:01:03.750> show<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.019> next<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
is the one that i'ma show you next to

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.440 
is the one that i'ma show you next to
step<00:01:04.710> back<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.180> they<00:01:06.240> have

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
step back this one is the one they have

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.260 
step back this one is the one they have
to<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.689> with<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> analog<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.590> hard<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.280> with

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
to do with the analog is hard to do with

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.910 
to do with the analog is hard to do with
the<00:01:09.390> square<00:01:09.659> button<00:01:09.930> I've<00:01:10.260> tried<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.770> several

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the square button I've tried it several

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.890 
the square button I've tried it several
times<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.000> never<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.750> not

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
times and I just never it's not

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.380 
times and I just never it's not
consistent<00:01:13.580> but<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.119> also

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
consistent but for this one you also

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.270 
consistent but for this one you also
have<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.930> running<00:01:16.140> diagonally<00:01:16.380> toward<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
have to be running diagonally toward the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.490 
have to be running diagonally toward the
baseline<00:01:17.759> when<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.320> must

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
baseline when you do that you must

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.249 
baseline when you do that you must
either<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:20.070> going<00:01:20.490> right<00:01:20.729> or<00:01:21.030> left<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:22.020> have

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
either be going right or left you have

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.649 
either be going right or left you have
to<00:01:22.439> push<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.040> right<00:01:23.250> analog<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
to push the right analog to that

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.810 
to push the right analog to that
direction<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.070> you're<00:01:26.189> running<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.640> left

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
direction so if you're running the left

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.190 
direction so if you're running the left
you<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.240> push<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.689> left<00:01:27.960> if

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
you have to push it to the left if

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.020 
you have to push it to the left if
you're<00:01:28.320> running<00:01:28.439> right<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.920> must<00:01:29.159> hold<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.520> to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
you're running right you must hold it to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.080 
you're running right you must hold it to
the<00:01:30.180> right<00:01:31.490> sometimes<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.640> get<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.850> different

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the right sometimes you get a different

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.230 
the right sometimes you get a different
animation<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.140> not<00:01:34.350> always<00:01:34.500> consistent<00:01:35.240> so

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
animation is not always consistent so

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.020 
animation is not always consistent so
just<00:01:36.540> bear<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:36.810> me<00:01:37.020> most<00:01:37.470> likely<00:01:37.710> you

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
just bear with me most likely you

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.760 
just bear with me most likely you
another<00:01:39.030> jumper<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.590> will

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
another jumper that you can do that will

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.280 
another jumper that you can do that will
help<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.369> bags<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.899> didn't

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
help you get the bags this one I didn't

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.660 
help you get the bags this one I didn't
actually<00:01:43.439> put<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> video<00:01:44.369> because<00:01:44.579> I

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
actually put in the video because I

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.210 
actually put in the video because I
