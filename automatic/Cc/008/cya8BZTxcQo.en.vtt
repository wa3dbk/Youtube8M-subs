going to use a if you have cheesecloth

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.629 
going to use a if you have cheesecloth
on<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.840> filter<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.380> mean<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> strainer<00:02:53.220> use<00:02:53.489> it

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
on the filter I mean a strainer use it

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.789 
on the filter I mean a strainer use it
I'm<00:02:53.790> going<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.000> use<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.359> coffee<00:02:55.139> filter<00:02:55.319> and

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
without burning it it broke down into

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.000 
without burning it it broke down into
three<00:03:45.450> different<00:03:45.480> byproducts<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.530> first<00:03:46.770> one

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
three different byproducts the first one

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.710 
three different byproducts the first one
forgiving<00:03:47.930> is<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:49.340> this<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:51.060> foam<00:03:51.360> or

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
forgiving is this this is the foam or

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.420 
forgiving is this this is the foam or
the<00:03:51.930> whey<00:03:52.080> protein<00:03:52.620> which<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.130> constantly

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
the whey protein which I constantly

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.390 
the whey protein which I constantly
skimmed<00:03:53.880> off<00:03:54.060> okay<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:55.140> continue<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.010> cook<00:03:56.220> the
