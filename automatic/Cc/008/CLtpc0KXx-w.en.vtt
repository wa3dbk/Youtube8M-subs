fitness where I had just never had a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.069 
fitness where I had just never had a
good<00:00:58.160> recipe<00:00:58.460> for<00:00:58.699> it<00:00:59.059> that<00:00:59.329> I<00:00:59.659> could<00:00:59.870> stick

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
good recipe for it that I could stick

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.430 
good recipe for it that I could stick
with<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:00.969> I<00:01:01.989> tried<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.019> bunch<00:01:03.230> of<00:01:03.379> different

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
with and I tried a bunch of different

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.650 
with and I tried a bunch of different
things<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.250> I<00:01:04.339> tried<00:01:04.610> personal<00:01:05.059> training<00:01:05.449> and

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
things and I tried personal training and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.080 
things and I tried personal training and

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
then I hit on crossfit and all of a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.660 
then I hit on crossfit and all of a
sudden<00:01:08.390> I<00:01:08.510> went<00:01:08.750> from<00:01:09.110> not<00:01:09.950> doing<00:01:10.070> it<00:01:10.280> all<00:01:10.400> to

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
sudden I went from not doing it all to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.760 
sudden I went from not doing it all to
doing<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:10.970> all<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.090> time<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.750> i<00:01:12.380> would<00:01:12.560> say

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
doing it all the time and i would say

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.730 
doing it all the time and i would say
that<00:01:13.100> as<00:01:13.850> soon<00:01:14.120> as<00:01:14.270> i<00:01:14.390> started<00:01:14.810> moving

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
that as soon as i started moving

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.080 
that as soon as i started moving
differently<00:01:15.890> i<00:01:16.400> started<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:16.910> think<00:01:16.940> about

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
differently i started to think about

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.180 
differently i started to think about
eating<00:01:17.330> differently<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.020> what<00:01:18.680> i<00:01:18.710> found<00:01:18.950> is<00:01:19.160> a

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
eating differently and what i found is a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.460 
eating differently and what i found is a
lot<00:01:19.430> of<00:01:19.520> people<00:01:19.820> when<00:01:20.660> you<00:01:20.780> do<00:01:20.870> a<00:01:20.900> lot<00:01:21.140> of<00:01:21.170> one

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
lot of people when you do a lot of one

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.320 
lot of people when you do a lot of one
you<00:01:21.680> start<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.040> think<00:01:22.190> differently<00:01:22.790> about<00:01:22.880> the

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
you start to think differently about the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.570 
you start to think differently about the
other<00:01:23.480> yeah<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.500> hallmark<00:01:24.920> fur<00:01:25.130> of

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
other yeah so the hallmark fur of

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.640 
other yeah so the hallmark fur of
crossfit<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:26.510> it<00:01:26.570> was<00:01:26.750> a<00:01:26.780> big<00:01:27.140> part<00:01:27.380> of<00:01:27.500> why

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
crossfit and it was a big part of why

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.930 
crossfit and it was a big part of why
it's<00:01:27.830> such<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:28.040> good<00:01:28.130> fit<00:01:28.370> for<00:01:28.400> me<00:01:28.700> is

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
it's such a good fit for me is

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.880 
it's such a good fit for me is
everything's<00:01:29.750> different<00:01:29.960> it's<00:01:30.440> never<00:01:30.710> the

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
everything's different it's never the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.850 
everything's different it's never the
same<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.490> it's<00:01:32.120> very<00:01:32.150> focused<00:01:32.780> on<00:01:32.960> functional

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
same and it's very focused on functional

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.700 
same and it's very focused on functional
movement<00:01:34.340> things<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:35.390> echo<00:01:35.900> what<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:36.320> do<00:01:36.500> in

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
movement things that echo what you do in

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.970 
movement things that echo what you do in
real<00:01:36.830> life<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.570> doing<00:01:38.570> them<00:01:38.870> a

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
real life and doing them a

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.810 
real life and doing them a
high-intensity<00:01:39.980> for<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.280> short<00:01:40.490> period<00:01:40.520> of

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
high-intensity for a short period of

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.930 
high-intensity for a short period of
time<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.450> for<00:01:41.750> me<00:01:42.430> CrossFit<00:01:43.430> has<00:01:43.460> been<00:01:43.760> this

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
time so for me CrossFit has been this

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.980 
time so for me CrossFit has been this
very<00:01:44.980> simple<00:01:45.980> but<00:01:46.280> strong<00:01:47.000> prescription<00:01:47.480> for

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
very simple but strong prescription for

eating a lot of foods that don't

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:03.970 
eating a lot of foods that don't
necessarily<00:03:02.629> give<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.349> that<00:03:03.500> really<00:03:03.680> full

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
feeling even though I'm satiated I got

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.559 
feeling even though I'm satiated I got
plenty<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.799> energy<00:03:06.919> and<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:07.969> I<00:03:08.000> really<00:03:08.359> like

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
plenty of energy and so I really like

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.770 
plenty of energy and so I really like
that<00:03:08.599> much<00:03:09.139> more<00:03:09.409> even<00:03:10.359> approach<00:03:11.359> than<00:03:11.629> the

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
that much more even approach than the

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.599 
that much more even approach than the
swings<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.590> ups<00:03:12.739> and<00:03:12.919> downs<00:03:13.099> that<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.400> tend

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
swings and ups and downs that you tend

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.369 
swings and ups and downs that you tend
to<00:03:13.700> get<00:03:13.909> if<00:03:14.569> you're<00:03:14.689> eating<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:15.019> lot<00:03:15.200> of

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
processed carbohydrates I have so much

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.469 
processed carbohydrates I have so much
more<00:03:18.439> consistent<00:03:19.159> energy<00:03:19.760> than<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.090> used<00:03:20.329> to

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:20.479 
more consistent energy than I used to

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.300 
more consistent energy than I used to
before<00:03:20.690> so<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.560> idea<00:03:21.680> of<00:03:21.889> sort<00:03:22.099> of<00:03:22.250> the

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
before so the idea of sort of the

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.920 
before so the idea of sort of the
afternoon<00:03:22.699> crash<00:03:23.180> when<00:03:23.540> you're<00:03:23.659> sort<00:03:23.870> of

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
afternoon crash when you're sort of

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.289 
afternoon crash when you're sort of
smoked<00:03:24.260> from<00:03:24.769> one<00:03:24.979> thing<00:03:25.190> or<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.400> other<00:03:25.519> my

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
smoked from one thing or the other my

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.000 
smoked from one thing or the other my
energy<00:03:26.659> level<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:26.959> pretty<00:03:27.260> consistent<00:03:27.500> across

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
energy level is pretty consistent across

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.399 
energy level is pretty consistent across
the<00:03:28.129> board<00:03:28.510> which<00:03:29.510> is<00:03:29.629> a<00:03:29.659> really<00:03:29.870> nice<00:03:30.109> feeling

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
the board which is a really nice feeling

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.580 
the board which is a really nice feeling
well<00:03:31.129> if<00:03:31.220> you<00:03:31.370> can<00:03:31.549> get<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:32.120> sort<00:03:33.109> of<00:03:33.229> tango

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
well if you can get the sort of tango

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.289 
well if you can get the sort of tango
going<00:03:33.979> of<00:03:34.129> moving<00:03:34.459> differently<00:03:34.609> and<00:03:35.030> eating

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
going of moving differently and eating

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.270 
going of moving differently and eating
differently<00:03:35.659> at<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.930> same<00:03:36.109> time<00:03:36.379> for<00:03:37.010> me<00:03:37.099> and

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
differently at the same time for me and

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.949 
differently at the same time for me and
that's<00:03:37.370> where<00:03:37.729> the<00:03:37.939> results<00:03:38.419> really<00:03:38.720> came

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
that's where the results really came

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.250 
that's where the results really came
from<00:03:39.169> as<00:03:39.439> soon<00:03:39.620> as<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.859> started<00:03:41.260> moving

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
from as soon as I started moving

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.080 
from as soon as I started moving
differently<00:03:42.439> finding<00:03:43.129> an<00:03:43.220> exercise<00:03:43.639> regime

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
differently finding an exercise regime

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.599 
differently finding an exercise regime
that<00:03:44.239> I<00:03:44.389> wanted<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:44.989> do<00:03:45.169> and<00:03:46.069> then<00:03:46.310> eating

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
that I wanted to do and then eating

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.550 
that I wanted to do and then eating
differently<00:03:47.090> it<00:03:47.389> was<00:03:47.629> a<00:03:47.659> little<00:03:47.870> bit<00:03:48.049> sort<00:03:48.379> of

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
differently it was a little bit sort of

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.159 
differently it was a little bit sort of
rocket<00:03:49.159> fuel<00:03:49.189> situation<00:03:49.849> where<00:03:50.569> i<00:03:50.810> saw<00:03:51.139> the

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
rocket fuel situation where i saw the

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.659 
rocket fuel situation where i saw the
results<00:03:51.849> really<00:03:52.849> changed<00:03:53.239> dramatically
