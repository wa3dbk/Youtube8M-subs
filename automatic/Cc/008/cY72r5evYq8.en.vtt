 alchemist data plus winner more 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.610
 shield smith if you are a person 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:38.920
 patient and you want to not go back to 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.530
 worry about this more and more this 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.269
 is your alternative being damaging you can 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.220
 manufacture the required potions for 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.440
 make the minor minor trophies and 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.479
 older simply with this pair of 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.519
 trades you will see some benefits 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.739
 very curious if the factories if you are selling 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.929
 especially considering that the 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.940
 medium and large are more than 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.129
 one hundred thousand beds each unit but if still 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.960
 you want to get more beds with 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.460
 shieldsmith officer you can 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.800
 manufacture yourself the trophies 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.810
 having the potions and doing mana 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.539
 that every day they become practically 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.850
 alone I for example just invest 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:14.560
 something less than a million beds in 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.360
 buy josh pebbles if you do 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.520
 coliseum nor that you have to invest and 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.649
 I get approximately four million 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.200
 for each big trophy I'm talking to you 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.850
 of a profitability of 3 million per 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.189
 every 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.290
 but if you have managed to suffer once 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.259
 trade of smith of shields to 100 no 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.240
 you want to work a lot calm and 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.130
 you have the way half walked 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.649
 simply that you stay in the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.330
 active workshop and even more will rain you 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.149
 I advise that you had with the companions 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.430
 of the sector and you agree more or less 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.470
 same price since if we all start 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.600
 lower 5 kakÃ¡ to our work in 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.479
 actually I am I will end up putting 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.860
 prices on the floor and nobody wins if 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.140
 we all have the same price 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.060
 it will simply be that the faster you answer 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.130
 who will take the beds we are 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.399
 smart and do not compete with 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.890
 if there is good now we will go to the swallowed 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.990
 turkeys here I will develop a 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.119
 strategy to win very good beds 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.190
 that is currently tremendously 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.380
 effective so that it does not stop for 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.600
 get a two emeralds one of the 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.030
 missions requires that you create a few turkeys 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.069
 the people who usually do not know 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.319
 put the fecund or do not want to lose 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.840
 time in this they look for the flea market for 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.140
 you that are already deep almond or 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.480
 redheads 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.940
 in putting a fertile payment it will take longer 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.650
 or less one or two hours so you can 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.080
 buy a payment for less than 20,000 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.080
 beds make me fertile and sell myself for 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.720
 more than 60 thousand beds like you say goes for 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.600
 40 thousand beds is not worth my mistake 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.580
 since I am in public fences 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.310
 you can raise many mounts there are birds 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.740
 always says do it with a single payment yo 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.310
 you do with 10 the benefits happen to be 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.450
 40 thousand beds to 400 thousand beds in which one 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.790
 hour 2 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.860
 I would say it's worth it and for not 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.020
 get out of the turkeys issue I'm going to 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.650
 tell my secret with the one I got 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.660
 win more than 4 million in 4 hours 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.610
 the simple trick for dofus is mere 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.620
 age also asks you to deliver saddles 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.260
 redheads aim tickets and gilt 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.780
 wild people who do not have much 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.600
 idea of how this goes directly buy 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.400
 these payments well since I 'm telling you 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.940
 to capture uncles and almonds 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.709
 redheads is super simple I passed 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.530
 four hours capturing and putting 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.780
 sell redheads in 250 thousand beds each 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.500
 unit and almendrados in 100,000 beds 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.260
 each unit 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.970
 and I got a good deal of money out of the problem 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.190
 is that people get cheaper and 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.260
 cheapen prices without being aware 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.080
 that's how I'm ruining this friend 7 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.810
 to get before beds I 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.120
 leaving holes for you at these prices 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.910
 the next day I already had all sold 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.850
 and that is already demand is huge advantage 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.590
 the moment and if you are multicuenta tropez 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.870
 ar is not too complicated for you 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.600
 go to the market and find resources 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.850
 expensive when you find that you see that 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.980
 are you going to be able to focus well 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.590
 couple of hours in taking out that resource and 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.810
 then sell you may be surprised 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.910
 results there were no resources in 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.280
 concrete because this simply always 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.260
 are changing though a council of 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.510
 friend if you are lucky enough to find 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.150
 some villain of cania those fragments 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.960
 that you get there would end up pella cost 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.630
 between 400 thousand and 600 thousand carpe diem beds 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.760
 that by changing a bit of third 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.650
 I will talk about them file as well 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.230
 you know already harvest is one of the missions 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.150
 most eternal and frustrating of the world's 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.550
 the twelve for that and people who do not have 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.710
 patience instead of spending hours 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.200
 hours looking for these famous artist the 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.180

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.160
 these artist if you have time and desire 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.470
 look for josh and sell georges and finally 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.030
 but no less important if you already 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.100
 you have a few saved shots 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.870
 keep the chat from 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.630
 trade since there are many desperate 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.420
 that needs scales already and sells objects 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.970
 from 5 million in 3 take advantage of the moment 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.340
 and buy me to later sell 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.140
 I for its real price as much in a 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.750
 I'm going to have sold and the 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.390

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.990
 complete and in my opinion it covers 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.840
