00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.590 
of the clavicle then I'm gonna talk
about<00:00:20.189> how<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.460> determine<00:00:20.880> whether<00:00:21.240> it's<00:00:21.480> a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
about how to determine whether it's a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.490 
about how to determine whether it's a
left<00:00:21.869> or<00:00:22.050> right<00:00:22.340> clavicle<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:24.019> then<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
left or right clavicle and then the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.550 
left or right clavicle and then the
structures<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.220> are<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.480> clavicle<00:00:28.109> by

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
structures that are on the clavicle by

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.839 
structures that are on the clavicle by
the<00:00:28.619> end<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.099> video<00:00:29.429> you'll<00:00:29.580> know

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the end of this video you'll know

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.060 
the end of this video you'll know
exactly<00:00:30.000> how<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.510> identify<00:00:31.320> different

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
exactly how to identify different

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.150 
exactly how to identify different
aspects<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.390> clavicle<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.680> let's<00:00:34.920> get

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
aspects of the clavicle and so let's get

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.850 
aspects of the clavicle and so let's get
right<00:00:35.520> into<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.989> here<00:00:37.230> I'm<00:00:37.350> looking<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
right into it so here I'm looking at the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.590 
right into it so here I'm looking at the
clavicle<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.760> spoke<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> little<00:00:39.239> bit<00:00:39.360> about

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
clavicle and we spoke a little bit about

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.200 
clavicle and we spoke a little bit about
the<00:00:39.750> clavicle<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> previous<00:00:41.070> video<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.820> I

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the clavicle in the previous video and I

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.170 
the clavicle in the previous video and I
want<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.450> point<00:00:42.570> out<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> few<00:00:42.870> features<00:00:43.460> of<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
want to point out a few features of the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.229 
want to point out a few features of the
clavicle<00:00:45.899> first<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.500> over<00:00:47.340> here<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.000> have

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
clavicle first of all over here we have

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.189 
clavicle first of all over here we have
the<00:00:48.899> acromial<00:00:49.710> end<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:51.030> clavicle<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:52.079> this

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the acromial end of the clavicle so this

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.779 
the acromial end of the clavicle so this
is<00:00:52.320> where<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.649> articulates<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
is where it articulates with the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.479 
is where it articulates with the
acromion<00:00:54.600> process<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> scapula<00:00:55.890> that

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
acromion process of the scapula that

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.000 
acromion process of the scapula that
acromioclavicular<00:00:57.239> joint<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.770> spoke

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
acromioclavicular joint that we spoke

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.340 
acromioclavicular joint that we spoke
about<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> last<00:00:59.760> video<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
about in the last video and this is the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.840 
about in the last video and this is the
sternal<00:01:02.219> end<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:04.290> clavicle<00:01:04.920> where<00:01:05.729> it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
sternal end of the clavicle where it

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.330 
sternal end of the clavicle where it
attic<00:01:06.270> articulates<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.500> manubrium<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
attic articulates with the manubrium of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.710 
attic articulates with the manubrium of
the<00:01:08.430> sternum<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.960> sternoclavicular<00:01:10.830> joint

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
the sternum the sternoclavicular joint

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.310 
the sternum the sternoclavicular joint
so<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.500> acromial<00:01:14.040> end<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.509> sternal<00:01:16.170> end

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
so the acromial end and the sternal end

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.469 
so the acromial end and the sternal end
and<00:01:17.100> then<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.210> course<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.560> main<00:01:19.860> body<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
and then of course the main body of the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.600 
and then of course the main body of the
sternum<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.740> what<00:01:22.950> we're<00:01:23.159> gonna<00:01:23.310> call

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
sternum that is what we're gonna call

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.929 
sternum that is what we're gonna call
the<00:01:24.360> shaft<00:01:24.780> okay<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.369> ends<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
the shaft okay so we have the ends the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.399 
the shaft okay so we have the ends the
two<00:01:27.119> ends<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.259> shaft<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:30.409> sternum

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
two ends and the shaft of the sternum

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.370 
two ends and the shaft of the sternum
one<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> features<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.869> want<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.200> point

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
one of the features that I want to point

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.399 
one of the features that I want to point
out<00:01:34.619> here<00:01:34.920> if<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.369> look<00:01:35.610> over<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
out here if you look over here on the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.310 
out here if you look over here on the
x-ray<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.250> chest<00:01:38.790> x-ray<00:01:39.299> you'll<00:01:39.840> see<00:01:40.110> that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
x-ray this chest x-ray you'll see that

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.770 
x-ray this chest x-ray you'll see that
you<00:01:40.439> can<00:01:40.590> also<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:41.250> once<00:01:41.579> again<00:01:41.939> we<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
you can also see once again we have the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.359 
you can also see once again we have the
sternal<00:01:43.229> end<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:44.630> we<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.350> acromial<00:01:47.130> end

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
sternal end and we have the acromial end

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.850 
sternal end and we have the acromial end
and<00:01:47.729> what<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.479> notice<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:49.200> terms<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.799> a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
and what you can notice in terms of a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.840 
and what you can notice in terms of a
difference<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:51.240> acromial<00:01:52.020> end<00:01:52.229> here<00:01:52.950> let

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
difference is this acromial end here let

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.590 
difference is this acromial end here let
me<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.240> again

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
me do that again

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.870 
me do that again
this<00:01:55.409> acromial<00:01:55.979> end<00:01:56.130> here<00:01:57.439> it's<00:01:58.439> much<00:01:59.310> flatter

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
this acromial end here it's much flatter

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.600 
this acromial end here it's much flatter
and<00:02:00.299> if<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.810> come<00:02:00.990> over<00:02:01.020> here<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> sternal

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
and if you come over here to the sternal

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.490 
and if you come over here to the sternal
end<00:02:03.890> you'll<00:02:04.890> see<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:06.210> more<00:02:06.540> rounded<00:02:07.290> on

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
end you'll see that it's more rounded on

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.650 
end you'll see that it's more rounded on
the<00:02:07.530> sternal<00:02:08.160> end<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.729> that's<00:02:09.209> one<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
the sternal end and that's one of the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.720 
the sternal end and that's one of the
distinguishing<00:02:10.289> features<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.250> can<00:02:11.430> see

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
distinguishing features that you can see

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
distinguishing features that you can see
you<00:02:12.180> can't<00:02:12.390> see<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.629> as<00:02:12.750> much<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.290> this

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
you can't see it as much in this

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.600 
you can't see it as much in this
picture<00:02:14.080> but<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.350> do<00:02:14.590> kinda<00:02:15.040> see<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.430> this

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
picture but you do kinda see that this

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.480 
picture but you do kinda see that this
is<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.790> little<00:02:16.030> flatter<00:02:16.480> than<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.740> that's<00:02:18.250> a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
is a little flatter than this that's a

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.390 
is a little flatter than this that's a
little<00:02:18.760> more<00:02:19.560> rounded<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.890> sternal<00:02:21.220> end

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
little more rounded so the sternal end

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.960 
little more rounded so the sternal end
is<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.610> little<00:02:22.000> more<00:02:22.440> rounded<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.650> then<00:02:24.580> what

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
is a little more rounded and then what

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.780 
is a little more rounded and then what
else<00:02:25.270> you'll<00:02:25.570> notice<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.260> as<00:02:26.740> we<00:02:27.340> look<00:02:27.580> at

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
else you'll notice is that as we look at

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.230 
else you'll notice is that as we look at
this<00:02:28.110> clavicle<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:30.130> is<00:02:30.280> gonna<00:02:30.459> be<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.850> left

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
this clavicle this is gonna be a left

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.730 
this clavicle this is gonna be a left
clavicle<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.870> there<00:02:32.290> are<00:02:32.350> some<00:02:32.500> features

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
clavicle and there are some features

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.940 
clavicle and there are some features
that<00:02:33.060> kind<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.150> give<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.390> away<00:02:34.840> right<00:02:35.740> here

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
that kind of give that away right here

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.290 
that kind of give that away right here
you<00:02:36.130> can<00:02:36.310> see<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.640> there's<00:02:36.880> kind<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.209> a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
you can see that there's kind of a

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.230 
you can see that there's kind of a
curvature<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.310> what<00:02:39.310> you'll<00:02:39.520> notice<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:40.150> that

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
curvature and what you'll notice is that

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.150 
curvature and what you'll notice is that
there's<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.350> anterior<00:02:43.170> convexity<00:02:44.170> so<00:02:45.010> it

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
there's this anterior convexity so it

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.410 
there's this anterior convexity so it
kind<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.490> curves<00:02:45.850> forward<00:02:46.690> at<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.680> medial

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
kind of curves forward at the medial

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.920 
kind of curves forward at the medial
two-thirds<00:02:49.420> so<00:02:49.750> let's<00:02:49.959> say<00:02:50.140> from<00:02:50.290> about<00:02:50.670> here

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
two-thirds so let's say from about here

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.830 
two-thirds so let's say from about here
all<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.350> way<00:02:53.470> down<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:54.280> medial<00:02:54.940> two-thirds

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
all the way down that medial two-thirds

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.210 
all the way down that medial two-thirds
that's<00:02:56.709> gonna<00:02:57.010> be<00:02:57.780> convex<00:02:58.780> anteriorly<00:02:59.560> so

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
that's gonna be convex anteriorly so

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.800 
that's gonna be convex anteriorly so
curved<00:03:00.610> anteriorly<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.570> then<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:03.070> lateral

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
curved anteriorly and then the lateral

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.650 
curved anteriorly and then the lateral
one-third<00:03:04.810> is<00:03:05.110> gonna<00:03:05.320> be<00:03:05.500> convex<00:03:06.660> posteriorly

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
one-third is gonna be convex posteriorly

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.290 
one-third is gonna be convex posteriorly
so<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.050> curves<00:03:08.620> backwards<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.780> that's<00:03:11.020> one

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
so it curves backwards so that's one

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.520 
so it curves backwards so that's one
differentiating<00:03:13.300> feature<00:03:13.630> so<00:03:14.170> if<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.350> want

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
differentiating feature so if you want

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.229 
differentiating feature so if you want
to<00:03:14.590> tell<00:03:14.800> if<00:03:14.950> it's<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.220> left<00:03:15.489> or<00:03:15.640> right<00:03:15.790> clavicle

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
to tell if it's a left or right clavicle

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.970 
to tell if it's a left or right clavicle
what<00:03:16.690> you're<00:03:16.840> gonna<00:03:16.930> do<00:03:17.170> you're<00:03:17.560> gonna<00:03:17.680> make

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
what you're gonna do you're gonna make

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.150 
what you're gonna do you're gonna make
sure<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.549> acromial<00:03:19.090> end<00:03:19.299> is<00:03:19.570> distal<00:03:20.290> the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
sure that the acromial end is distal the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.330 
sure that the acromial end is distal the
sternal<00:03:21.700> end<00:03:21.910> is<00:03:22.239> proximal<00:03:23.080> and<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:24.040> there's

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
sternal end is proximal and that there's

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.110 
sternal end is proximal and that there's
this<00:03:24.640> anterior<00:03:25.450> convexity<00:03:26.350> for<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.190> the

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
this anterior convexity for the the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.390 
this anterior convexity for the the
proximal<00:03:28.870> two-thirds<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:31.709> lateral<00:03:32.709> and

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
proximal two-thirds and a lateral and

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.090 
proximal two-thirds and a lateral and
posterior<00:03:34.769> convexity

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
posterior convexity

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.740 
posterior convexity
and<00:03:36.250> once<00:03:36.790> you<00:03:36.940> have<00:03:37.120> it<00:03:37.269> in<00:03:37.390> that<00:03:37.540> position

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
and once you have it in that position

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.780 
and once you have it in that position
you'll<00:03:38.140> be<00:03:38.260> able<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:38.590> tell<00:03:38.799> that<00:03:38.830> okay<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:39.580> is

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
you'll be able to tell that okay this is

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.840 
you'll be able to tell that okay this is
left<00:03:40.630> if<00:03:41.500> it<00:03:41.709> were<00:03:41.860> right<00:03:42.100> it<00:03:42.280> would<00:03:42.370> be<00:03:42.400> the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
left if it were right it would be the

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.539 
left if it were right it would be the
exact<00:03:43.420> opposite<00:03:44.260> so<00:03:44.769> what<00:03:45.040> I'm<00:03:45.130> looking<00:03:45.459> at

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
exact opposite so what I'm looking at

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.009 
exact opposite so what I'm looking at
here<00:03:45.970> I'm<00:03:46.930> looking<00:03:47.200> at<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:49.180> superior

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
here I'm looking at the the superior

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.370 
here I'm looking at the the superior
surface<00:03:50.350> of<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:51.459> left<00:03:51.940> clavicle<00:03:52.660> so<00:03:53.110> this<00:03:53.230> is

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
surface of the left clavicle so this is

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.970 
surface of the left clavicle so this is
looking<00:03:53.769> from<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.400> top<00:03:54.640> down<00:03:55.540> so<00:03:56.470> let's<00:03:56.739> look

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
looking from the top down so let's look

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.330 
looking from the top down so let's look
at<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.760> inferior<00:03:58.750> surface<00:03:59.049> which<00:04:00.010> is<00:04:00.160> what

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
at the inferior surface which is what

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.580 
at the inferior surface which is what
you<00:04:00.519> see<00:04:00.850> here<00:04:01.180> so<00:04:01.930> I'm<00:04:02.019> basically<00:04:02.470> just

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
you see here so I'm basically just

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.250 
you see here so I'm basically just
taking<00:04:03.130> this<00:04:03.310> one<00:04:03.549> and<00:04:03.760> flipping<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:04.780> over<00:04:05.019> and

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
taking this one and flipping it over and

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.979 
taking this one and flipping it over and
I<00:04:05.799> want<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:06.010> point<00:04:06.190> out<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.549> few<00:04:06.959> structures

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
I want to point out a few structures

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.550 
I want to point out a few structures
okay<00:04:08.769> so<00:04:08.829> first<00:04:09.459> let's<00:04:09.790> deal<00:04:10.570> with<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:11.140> the

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
okay so first let's deal with the the

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.670 
okay so first let's deal with the the
distal<00:04:12.310> structures<00:04:12.910> more<00:04:13.299> on<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.680> acromial

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
distal structures more on the acromial

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.090 
distal structures more on the acromial
and<00:04:14.970> here<00:04:15.970> you<00:04:16.090> can<00:04:16.269> see<00:04:16.479> there's<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:17.019> tuber<00:04:17.919> a

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
and here you can see there's a tuber a

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.699 
and here you can see there's a tuber a
tubercle<00:04:18.820> here<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.359> we're<00:04:20.049> gonna<00:04:20.169> call<00:04:20.470> this

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
tubercle here and we're gonna call this

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.300 
tubercle here and we're gonna call this
the<00:04:20.890> coronoid<00:04:21.479> tubercle<00:04:22.479> and<00:04:22.620> then<00:04:23.620> here<00:04:24.099> we

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
the coronoid tubercle and then here we

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.820 
the coronoid tubercle and then here we
see<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:25.000> trapezoid

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
see the trapezoid

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.809 
see the trapezoid
so<00:04:27.759> the<00:04:27.879> Connaught<00:04:28.419> tubercle<00:04:29.259> the<00:04:30.159> trapezoid

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
so the Connaught tubercle the trapezoid

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.270 
so the Connaught tubercle the trapezoid
line<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.509> these<00:04:31.840> are<00:04:32.080> all<00:04:32.199> on<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.710> inferior

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
line and these are all on the inferior

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.129 
line and these are all on the inferior
aspect<00:04:33.729> and<00:04:34.300> these<00:04:34.419> good<00:04:34.599> are<00:04:34.750> gonna<00:04:34.990> be

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
aspect and these good are gonna be

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.080 
aspect and these good are gonna be
significant<00:04:35.860> when<00:04:35.979> we<00:04:36.099> talk<00:04:36.340> about<00:04:36.370> the

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
significant when we talk about the

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.800 
significant when we talk about the
ligaments<00:04:37.780> that<00:04:38.129> connect<00:04:39.129> to<00:04:39.729> these<00:04:40.360> this

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
ligaments that connect to these this

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.439 
ligaments that connect to these this
tubercle<00:04:41.409> the<00:04:41.560> coronoid<00:04:41.979> tubercle<00:04:42.849> and<00:04:43.000> the

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
tubercle the coronoid tubercle and the

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.850 
tubercle the coronoid tubercle and the
trapezoid<00:04:44.050> line<00:04:44.259> and<00:04:44.440> we're<00:04:44.530> going<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.680> talk

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
trapezoid line and we're going to talk

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.129 
trapezoid line and we're going to talk
about<00:04:44.889> that<00:04:45.250> in<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.460> later<00:04:45.610> video<00:04:45.940> then<00:04:46.659> we<00:04:46.930> also

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
about that in a later video then we also

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.520 
about that in a later video then we also
see<00:04:47.740> on<00:04:48.009> the<00:04:48.270> distal<00:04:49.270> end<00:04:49.509> or<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.900> acromial

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
see on the distal end or the acromial

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.260 
see on the distal end or the acromial
end<00:04:50.710> coming<00:04:51.159> down<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.490> acromial<00:04:51.909> end<00:04:52.030> we

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
end coming down to the acromial end we

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.879 
end coming down to the acromial end we
have<00:04:52.479> the<00:04:52.979> deltoid<00:04:53.979> tuberosity<00:04:55.500> okay<00:04:56.500> so<00:04:56.560> the

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
have the deltoid tuberosity okay so the

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.950 
have the deltoid tuberosity okay so the
deltoid<00:04:57.520> tubercle<00:04:58.090> or<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.449> deltoid

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
deltoid tubercle or the deltoid

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.680 
deltoid tubercle or the deltoid
tuberosity<00:04:59.069> you<00:05:00.069> can<00:05:00.250> see<00:05:00.520> that<00:05:00.819> here<00:05:01.360> also

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
tuberosity you can see that here also

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.469 
tuberosity you can see that here also
and<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.830> can<00:05:02.860> assume<00:05:03.340> by<00:05:03.639> right<00:05:03.909> now<00:05:04.090> that

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
and you can assume by right now that

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.330 
and you can assume by right now that
that's<00:05:05.139> gonna<00:05:05.349> have<00:05:05.560> something<00:05:05.949> to<00:05:06.069> do<00:05:06.190> with

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
that's gonna have something to do with

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.189 
that's gonna have something to do with
the<00:05:06.490> deltoid<00:05:07.000> muscle<00:05:07.569> and<00:05:07.810> we're<00:05:07.990> going<00:05:08.169> to

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
the deltoid muscle and we're going to

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.610 
the deltoid muscle and we're going to
talk<00:05:08.409> about<00:05:08.560> that<00:05:09.180> in<00:05:10.180> a<00:05:10.360> later<00:05:10.539> video<00:05:11.110> so<00:05:11.349> the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
talk about that in a later video so the

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.270 
talk about that in a later video so the
deltoideus<00:05:12.750> has<00:05:13.750> to<00:05:14.020> do<00:05:14.199> with<00:05:14.710> this<00:05:14.919> the

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
deltoideus has to do with this the

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.279 
deltoideus has to do with this the
naming<00:05:15.639> of<00:05:15.759> this<00:05:15.940> tubercle<00:05:16.840> then<00:05:17.740> let's<00:05:18.490> look

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
naming of this tubercle then let's look

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.459 
naming of this tubercle then let's look
right<00:05:20.289> here<00:05:21.099> on<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.460> inferior<00:05:22.270> aspect<00:05:22.509> we<00:05:23.199> see

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:23.469 
right here on the inferior aspect we see

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:25.589 
right here on the inferior aspect we see
we<00:05:23.620> also<00:05:23.919> have<00:05:24.099> a<00:05:24.550> groove<00:05:24.969> that<00:05:25.000> we're<00:05:25.479> gonna

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
we also have a groove that we're gonna

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.670 
we also have a groove that we're gonna
call<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.500> subclavian<00:05:27.419> groove<00:05:28.419> and<00:05:28.900> that<00:05:29.500> has

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
call the subclavian groove and that has

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.589 
call the subclavian groove and that has
to<00:05:29.800> do<00:05:29.949> with<00:05:30.039> the<00:05:30.190> subclavius<00:05:31.029> muscle<00:05:31.060> and

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
to do with the subclavius muscle and

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:32.969 
to do with the subclavius muscle and
we're<00:05:31.690> gonna<00:05:31.779> talk<00:05:32.050> about<00:05:32.080> that<00:05:32.409> later<00:05:32.710> and

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
we're gonna talk about that later and

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.480 
we're gonna talk about that later and
then<00:05:33.909> as<00:05:34.120> we<00:05:34.330> go<00:05:34.569> more<00:05:34.830> medially<00:05:35.830> or<00:05:36.099> to<00:05:36.370> the

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
then as we go more medially or to the

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.360 
then as we go more medially or to the
proximal<00:05:37.029> end<00:05:37.469> we're<00:05:38.469> gonna<00:05:38.650> see<00:05:38.979> there's<00:05:39.279> a

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
proximal end we're gonna see there's a

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.339 
proximal end we're gonna see there's a
tuberosity<00:05:40.300> here<00:05:40.599> that<00:05:40.840> we're<00:05:40.990> gonna<00:05:41.110> call

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
tuberosity here that we're gonna call

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.939 
tuberosity here that we're gonna call
the<00:05:41.680> costal<00:05:42.690> tuberosity<00:05:43.690> okay<00:05:44.529> so<00:05:44.590> I'm<00:05:44.800> not

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
the costal tuberosity okay so I'm not

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:46.680 
the costal tuberosity okay so I'm not
gonna<00:05:45.099> go<00:05:45.310> through<00:05:45.460> all<00:05:45.759> of<00:05:45.789> the<00:05:46.210> structures

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
gonna go through all of the structures

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.689 
gonna go through all of the structures
on<00:05:46.990> it<00:05:47.199> because<00:05:47.949> we're<00:05:48.069> gonna<00:05:48.159> deal<00:05:48.400> with<00:05:48.520> some

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
on it because we're gonna deal with some

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.209 
on it because we're gonna deal with some
of<00:05:48.789> the<00:05:48.909> other<00:05:49.330> structures<00:05:49.779> later<00:05:50.409> but<00:05:51.039> for

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:51.219 
of the other structures later but for

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:53.670 
of the other structures later but for
now<00:05:51.279> I<00:05:51.460> want<00:05:51.849> you<00:05:52.060> to<00:05:52.150> remember<00:05:52.389> the<00:05:52.810> ends<00:05:53.469> I

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
now I want you to remember the ends I

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.990 
now I want you to remember the ends I
want<00:05:54.130> you<00:05:54.250> to<00:05:54.340> remember<00:05:54.520> some<00:05:54.789> of<00:05:54.819> the

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
want you to remember some of the

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.029 
want you to remember some of the
features<00:05:55.449> like<00:05:55.690> the<00:05:55.810> curvature<00:05:56.469> and<00:05:56.650> so<00:05:56.830> on

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
features like the curvature and so on

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.040 
features like the curvature and so on
and<00:05:57.219> be<00:05:57.310> able<00:05:57.490> to<00:05:57.610> determine<00:05:57.969> between<00:05:58.360> left

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
and be able to determine between left

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.129 
and be able to determine between left
and<00:05:59.289> right<00:05:59.830> some<00:06:00.789> of<00:06:00.909> the<00:06:01.029> tubercles<00:06:01.900> and

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
and right some of the tubercles and

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.339 
and right some of the tubercles and
tuberosities<00:06:02.889> the<00:06:03.129> deltoid<00:06:03.900> the<00:06:04.900> deltoid

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
tuberosities the deltoid the deltoid

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:08.430 
tuberosities the deltoid the deltoid
tubercle<00:06:05.889> the<00:06:06.310> coronoid<00:06:06.849> tubercle<00:06:07.719> and<00:06:07.930> the

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
tubercle the coronoid tubercle and the

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.029 
tubercle the coronoid tubercle and the
trapezoid<00:06:09.129> line<00:06:09.490> the<00:06:10.330> subclavian<00:06:10.870> groove<00:06:11.710> and

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 
trapezoid line the subclavian groove and

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.869 
trapezoid line the subclavian groove and
the<00:06:12.490> costal<00:06:13.199> tuberosity<00:06:14.199> so<00:06:15.099> that's<00:06:15.610> pretty

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:15.879 
the costal tuberosity so that's pretty

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:19.170 
the costal tuberosity so that's pretty
much<00:06:15.969> it<00:06:16.330> let<00:06:16.690> us<00:06:17.229> do<00:06:17.770> our<00:06:18.039> review<00:06:18.639> quiz<00:06:18.940> as

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
much it let us do our review quiz as

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.629 
much it let us do our review quiz as
usual<00:06:19.810> if<00:06:19.960> you<00:06:20.379> would<00:06:20.500> like<00:06:20.650> to<00:06:20.800> review<00:06:20.979> it<00:06:21.430> and

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
usual if you would like to review it and

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.490 
usual if you would like to review it and
test<00:06:22.240> yourself<00:06:22.419> you<00:06:22.810> can<00:06:22.960> turn<00:06:23.169> the<00:06:23.349> volume

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
test yourself you can turn the volume

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.189 
test yourself you can turn the volume
now<00:06:23.979> turn<00:06:24.699> the<00:06:24.849> volume<00:06:25.000> down<00:06:25.270> I'm<00:06:25.719> gonna<00:06:25.900> point

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 
now turn the volume down I'm gonna point

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:28.290 
now turn the volume down I'm gonna point
to<00:06:26.440> the<00:06:26.740> different<00:06:27.099> structures<00:06:27.580> and<00:06:27.610> then<00:06:28.090> you

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
to the different structures and then you

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.499 
to the different structures and then you
can<00:06:28.479> answer<00:06:28.750> it<00:06:29.139> with<00:06:29.740> me<00:06:30.039> so<00:06:30.490> first<00:06:31.240> let's

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:31.509 
can answer it with me so first let's

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:35.209 
can answer it with me so first let's
start<00:06:31.599> with<00:06:32.169> the<00:06:32.409> simple<00:06:32.830> this<00:06:33.550> is<00:06:33.849> the

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:35.219 
start with the simple this is the

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:40.050 
start with the simple this is the
acromial<00:06:36.219> end<00:06:36.870> over<00:06:37.870> here<00:06:38.110> we<00:06:38.229> have<00:06:38.380> the<00:06:38.940> stern

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
acromial end over here we have the stern

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:46.860 
acromial end over here we have the stern
and<00:06:40.480> and<00:06:41.550> this<00:06:42.550> would<00:06:42.940> be<00:06:43.320> the<00:06:44.320> shaft<00:06:45.510> then<00:06:46.510> if

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
and and this would be the shaft then if

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.490 
and and this would be the shaft then if
we<00:06:47.800> were<00:06:47.919> to<00:06:48.100> look<00:06:48.280> at<00:06:48.460> the<00:06:48.940> structures<00:06:49.540> on<00:06:49.810> the

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
we were to look at the structures on the

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.909 
we were to look at the structures on the
clavicle<00:06:52.050> here<00:06:53.050> we<00:06:53.230> have<00:06:54.180> the<00:06:55.180> deltoid

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 
clavicle here we have the deltoid

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:01.770 
clavicle here we have the deltoid
tubercle<00:06:57.870> over<00:06:58.870> here<00:06:59.020> we<00:06:59.260> have<00:07:00.150> the<00:07:01.150> Connaught

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
tubercle over here we have the Connaught

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:07.310 
tubercle over here we have the Connaught
tubercle<00:07:02.910> then<00:07:03.910> we<00:07:04.090> have<00:07:04.240> the<00:07:05.190> trapezoid<00:07:06.190> line

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.320 
tubercle then we have the trapezoid line

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:13.980 
tubercle then we have the trapezoid line
we<00:07:08.320> have<00:07:08.530> the<00:07:09.870> subclavian<00:07:11.220> groove<00:07:12.220> and<00:07:12.990> we

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
we have the subclavian groove and we

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.450 
we have the subclavian groove and we
have<00:07:14.200> the<00:07:15.240> costal<00:07:16.290> tuberosity<00:07:17.290> all<00:07:18.250> right

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.460 
have the costal tuberosity all right

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.370 
have the costal tuberosity all right
those<00:07:18.760> are<00:07:18.790> all<00:07:19.150> the<00:07:19.360> structures<00:07:19.900> for<00:07:20.229> now

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:20.380 
those are all the structures for now

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.230 
those are all the structures for now
that's<00:07:20.950> pretty<00:07:21.160> much<00:07:21.340> it<00:07:21.580> for<00:07:21.610> this<00:07:21.820> video<00:07:22.060> if

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 
that's pretty much it for this video if

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.180 
that's pretty much it for this video if
