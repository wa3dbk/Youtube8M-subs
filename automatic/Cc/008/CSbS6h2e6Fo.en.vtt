00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
profit so we want to do with the mass

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.350 
profit so we want to do with the mass
bidding<00:00:44.460> technique<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.030> want<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.210> look<00:00:45.270> at

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
bidding technique is you want to look at

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.020 
bidding technique is you want to look at
the<00:00:45.450> market<00:00:45.860> understand<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.250> average<00:00:47.820> price

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.760 
to do is go to the 59th minute and just
trying<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.240> find<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:27.689> there's<00:01:28.049> any<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> bit

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
trying to find if there's any that a bit

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.230 
trying to find if there's any that a bit
cheaper<00:01:29.130> because<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.490> web<00:01:29.610> app<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> bit

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
cheaper because the web app is a bit

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.600 
cheaper because the web app is a bit
buggy<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.409> doesn't<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.009> know<00:01:32.040> display

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
buggy and it doesn't you know display

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.609 
buggy and it doesn't you know display
all<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.939> different<00:01:33.600> vinyls<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.320> could

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
all the different vinyls that it could

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.830 
all the different vinyls that it could
be<00:01:34.650> possible<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.610> what<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.329> do<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.540> now<00:01:36.780> we

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
be possible so what we do is now we

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.620 
be possible so what we do is now we
definitely<00:01:37.320> know<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.920> us<00:01:38.070> by<00:01:38.280> now<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.670> 1200

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
definitely know to us by now is 1200

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.359 
definitely know to us by now is 1200
coins<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:40.350> gotta<00:01:40.500> go<00:01:40.590> into<00:01:40.740> maximum<00:01:41.130> price

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
coins we gotta go into maximum price

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.249 
coins we gotta go into maximum price
probably<00:01:42.240> would<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:42.390> gone<00:01:42.479> with<00:01:42.540> 700<00:01:43.079> but

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
probably would have gone with 700 but

go find out the cheapest blind let's
have<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.370> quick<00:02:39.910> guess<00:02:40.150> maybe<00:02:40.390> five<00:02:40.660> thousand

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
have a quick guess maybe five thousand

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.900 
have a quick guess maybe five thousand
coins<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.470> tubes<00:02:41.680> by<00:02:41.890> now<00:02:42.069> there's<00:02:42.310> quite<00:02:42.880> a

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
coins the tubes by now there's quite a

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.699 
coins the tubes by now there's quite a
few<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.150> them<00:02:43.239> on<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.420> market<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:44.020> gonna<00:02:44.560> go

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
few of them on the market so gonna go

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.050 
few of them on the market so gonna go
for<00:02:44.860> another<00:02:44.950> guest<00:02:45.310> may<00:02:45.430> be<00:02:45.489> four<00:02:45.700> thousand

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
for another guest may be four thousand

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.780 
for another guest may be four thousand
coins<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.510> we<00:02:47.080> do<00:02:47.260> find<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.830> correct<00:02:48.340> by<00:02:48.580> now

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
coins and we do find the correct by now

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.620 
coins and we do find the correct by now
so<00:02:48.970> that's<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.180> cheapest<00:02:49.420> on<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.540> market

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
so that's the cheapest on the market

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.570 
so that's the cheapest on the market
getting<00:02:50.410> kind<00:02:50.560> of<00:02:50.590> good<00:02:50.739> at<00:02:50.769> that<00:02:50.920> one<00:02:51.100> but

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
getting kind of good at that one but

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.460 
getting kind of good at that one but
over<00:02:52.390> there<00:02:52.570> what<00:02:52.750> I'm<00:02:52.840> trying<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.050> do<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:53.260> find

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
over there what I'm trying to do is find

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.449

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
chemist style and you pick them up for

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.430 
chemist style and you pick them up for
discard<00:03:24.610> value<00:03:24.970> do<00:03:25.690> check<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.019> price<00:03:26.230> in<00:03:26.350> the

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.439 
the transfer players I'm thinking that's
going<00:05:37.520> to<00:05:37.580> be<00:05:37.639> the<00:05:37.729> next<00:05:37.880> method<00:05:38.150> actually

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
going to be the next method actually

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:39.850 
going to be the next method actually
because<00:05:38.930> that's<00:05:39.199> one<00:05:39.440> that<00:05:39.560> you<00:05:39.620> can<00:05:39.710> make<00:05:39.830> a

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
because that's one that you can make a

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.060 
because that's one that you can make a
lot<00:05:40.039> of<00:05:40.099> coins<00:05:40.400> on<00:05:40.580> very<00:05:41.300> simply<00:05:41.870> so<00:05:42.229> anyway

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
lot of coins on very simply so anyway

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.070 
lot of coins on very simply so anyway
going<00:05:43.400> back<00:05:43.490> to<00:05:43.669> this<00:05:43.760> method<00:05:44.120> I'm<00:05:44.780> trying<00:05:44.960> to

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
going back to this method I'm trying to

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.270 
going back to this method I'm trying to
win<00:05:45.199> a<00:05:45.229> few<00:05:45.349> players<00:05:45.560> over<00:05:45.770> there<00:05:45.919> will<00:05:46.039> bid<00:05:46.250> on

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
win a few players over there will bid on

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.370 
win a few players over there will bid on
that<00:05:46.400> embargo<00:05:47.090> because<00:05:47.539> got<00:05:47.690> a<00:05:47.720> finisher<00:05:48.199> and

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
that embargo because got a finisher and

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.320 
that embargo because got a finisher and
if<00:05:48.889> we<00:05:49.010> win<00:05:49.130> that<00:05:49.310> will<00:05:49.430> be<00:05:49.550> not<00:05:49.729> too<00:05:49.880> bad<00:05:50.060> I'll

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
if we win that will be not too bad I'll

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.839 
if we win that will be not too bad I'll
start<00:05:50.510> a<00:05:50.539> few<00:05:50.750> deals<00:05:50.990> but<00:05:51.710> nonetheless<00:05:52.280> you

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
start a few deals but nonetheless you

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:53.830 
start a few deals but nonetheless you
know<00:05:52.909> that's<00:05:53.090> how<00:05:53.270> the<00:05:53.330> mass<00:05:53.570> building

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
know that's how the mass building

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.240 
know that's how the mass building
technique<00:05:54.169> goes<00:05:54.349> you're<00:05:54.620> not<00:05:54.710> necessarily

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
technique goes you're not necessarily

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.999 
technique goes you're not necessarily
not<00:05:55.520> always<00:05:55.940> attending<00:05:56.300> it<00:05:56.710> but<00:05:57.710> you<00:05:57.830> are

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
not always attending it but you are

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.860 
not always attending it but you are
making<00:05:58.190> some<00:05:58.639> returns<00:05:59.000> so<00:05:59.270> I<00:05:59.479> think<00:05:59.720> we're

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
making some returns so I think we're

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.999 
making some returns so I think we're
going<00:05:59.960> to<00:06:00.050> win<00:06:00.080> this<00:06:00.259> a<00:06:00.320> barber<00:06:00.680> over<00:06:00.860> here

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
pretty much their mass bidding technique

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.629 
pretty much their mass bidding technique
mixed<00:06:24.409> in<00:06:24.500> with<00:06:24.590> a<00:06:24.680> buy<00:06:24.860> low<00:06:25.039> sell<00:06:25.070> high<00:06:25.460> and
