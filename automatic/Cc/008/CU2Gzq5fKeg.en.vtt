00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
 Hello vocabulary cramming 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.190
 Algae hurriedly I would like to quickly get instructions for this today 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:07.460
 iPhone etc vocabulary trainer show 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.129
 It would fit well 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.439
 because with this squad coach they can really lightning fast 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:16.429
 with minimal effort you the current cup-off lesson 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:21.279
 Record seminars or course with the iPhone and then take it away immediately 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.279
 they use one 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.970
 and let's go 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.169
 A view of this sky can 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:35.230
 state the program and lands on the homepage of the Kukaduh for that 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.510
 with the list of tact Alan Wake tions 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.510
 here will now be with the same name switch in the bottom bar 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.290
 create a new lesson 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.700
 with the name 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.080
 Italia Hanau 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.080
 thus sends 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.630
 first with 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.630
 the sections 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.900
 after a look in this new way Sion 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.430
 Velich on the functions page the menu item 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.430
 Data input only Alfio 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.900
 Here now feels like picking up the microphone 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.159
 Reproduction Korbel 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.480
 and speak the first cup hurdle the microphone 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.450
 «El Mundo» 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.650
 then the microphone starts 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.950
 for meaning 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.150
 and speak its meaning into the microphone 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.110
 the world 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.880
 and that's the first record already finished that's why I create myself 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.210
 by views 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.210
 on the plus sign a new record 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.600
 not in the same way at this speed 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.260
 when the next cup round 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.610
 and its meaning and so on and so on for you now 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.039
 sometimes spoil cups before 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.270
 so that draws an impression 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.470
 how fast and easy this preparation for learning is 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.899
 Rosso 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.439
 Well 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.639
 provides new data 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.949
 had become loud 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:16.589
 the drinks 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:18.849
 the record 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.879
 in the future 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.769
 the juice 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.819
 the record 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.719
 in the cinema 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.879
 the wine 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.649
 Lad you was 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:34.649
 the beer 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:36.899
 Lotte 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:40.169
 the milk 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:42.699
 Picture should Luther 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.699
 the greeting 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.059
 Benvenuto 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:51.459
 welcome 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.479
 Aqua Minerals 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:56.579
 the mineral water 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.399
 that's enough 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.579
 I am the data entry 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.090
 now the button comes up 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.229
 and her hers 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.449
 that and selection and longs records contains 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.129
 she could do the lesson 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.599
 of course, new records at any time, but we go home now 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.769
 comfortably with the scooter the headset 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:17.889
 on the couch 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.339
 and that must have the puck our lesson 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:22.369
 play in the course of the mode 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.369
 to do this we choose on the functions page 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.189
 in the menu item School 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.760
 I'll go then it starts already 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.659
 the l 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.659
 the latte 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.609
 Cityscapes 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.569
 the drinks 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.569
 I'm missing out, I told Hars 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.889
 if we heard that on the one hand 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.149
 that we are reasonably sure 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:50.829
 then turn them over 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.089
 to query the function Pierer 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.829
 Immediately the first cables are announced here as well 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.359
 but there remains the opportunity to think about the answer after one 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.049
 Look somewhere in the middle 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.329
 the display is 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.669
 the interpretation is announced 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.929
 and only after another click comes the cups soon 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.509
 instead of planned 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.919
 and the limb meaning 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.669
 they are queried automatically, meaning they will no longer be anyone 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.620
 you need to ask 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.789
 the latte 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.689
 similar 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.689
 I am 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.199
 the l 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.199
 Corso 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.249
 and so on 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:47.729
 Of course, the automatic query should be carried out as long 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.759
 until they have memorized the cup hurdle well 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.990
 After that, of course, we want to know what we have really learned 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:57.029
 and therefore choose 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:00.029
 check the function 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.240
 here too 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.339
 now the first cup announced 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.339
 but we only have three seconds to react 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.810
 a click within that time says that meaning to that puck though 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.240
 is known 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.419
 on the other hand, the time is exceeded 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.060
 if that is reported a small chord leads to a bad one 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.069
 rating 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:23.400
 the rating 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.330
 in the form of a note is carried out at a complete 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.779
 audit program 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.400
 registered on the home page 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.330
 okay the city now 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.449
 the brain functions check satire 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:36.310
 30 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.599
 her 8 as well 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.509
 that is no money in the end all 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:42.610
 of course, too 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.210
 the latte 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.099
 the milk 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:46.680
 he is too short 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.669
 as I do not 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.639
 to scatter that 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:54.199
 El Gallo because a tour 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.210
 welcome 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.710
 instead of planned 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.729
 who does not 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.770
 the drinks 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.759
 all Merkel too short 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:07.270
 It should be 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.400
 the welcome instead of planned 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.569
 I still do not know 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:14.759
 the drinks 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.430
 Cityscapes the drinks 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.270
 and that's it 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.409
 completed by passage 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:25.430
 and keynote is entered by 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.430
 we got kick 1 common 9 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.889
 okay the word 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.220
 Finally, just a short summary of the highlights of the 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:35.770
 program 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.789
 it is not necessary to enter from the cadre the text 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.759
 but it is of course possible 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:44.029
 the program is not limited to one language 

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.159
 It is suitable for both languages 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:49.649
 The core function is also heard while driving about the car 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:53.059
 Car radio possible because no conditions are required here 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:57.589
 the number of lessons and records is only through the 

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:59.439
 Limited storage space 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:03.029
 in none of the three years functions is not eye contact part of 

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:07.219
 necessary for the clicks the display turned into a large switch 

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:08.149
 has been 

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:11.669
 they are queried in random mode after their cup coup 

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:16.519
 it can also input questions and answers from the respective grammar 

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:17.610
 become 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.800
 Under certain circumstances, the vocabulary is already difficult to teach 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.810
 to pick up 5 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.350
 the voice recording 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.740
 are always immediately verifiable via the two speakers symbolism 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.500
 The application has a detailed page for each page 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.749
 description 

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:37.399
 and also interesting 

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:41.100
 to the first part is an action price for this corner 

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.139
 from 79 cents 

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:46.460
 So who a stalemate of or an iPod Touch until now 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.360
 and one or more methods spoke who a Berlin or must 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.169
 He does not listen to the program at all 

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:57.120
 but with this app, the FCA currently had the fastest opportunity 

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.529
 Input and how little to learn but on his part 

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.550
 so and now I wish all a lot of fun 

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:04.629
 with these famous coaches
