00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.160
 Centuries have passed but ours 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 Orden has unswervingly its sacred 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.809
 mission pursues the balance 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.360
 between humans and semiconductors too 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.070
 uphold 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.490
 today, this balance will be of 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.619
 a new bad as well with bad 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.410
 red the rebellion they do not know 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.570
 whom they are dealing with 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.880
 It is as far as the order 18 86 is 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.490
 exclusively on the playstation 4 appeared 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.199
 we had the game in advance of court 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.660
 lyrics and have many hours in the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.110
 alternative london of the year 18 86 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.110
 awarded 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:47.870
 many weapons shortly after the announcement of 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.809
 the order and the publication 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.329
 first ingame trailer skeptical shooter 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.280
 or rather interactive film with her 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.649
 and there are a few scenes to play 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.140
 The answer is the order 18 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.760
 86 you from the beginning fantastic and 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.949
 is cinematic through and through 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.110
 staged one of the core points of the 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.909
 game is the glossy look with the 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.490
 detailed environments and crystal clear 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.740
 drawn character animations here 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.600
 the playstation 4 reveals its graphic 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.740
 Paris was the goal of our founder 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.950
 King Artus may be his name in all 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.140
 eternal radiance is it has been the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.869
 lord chancellor side fought that says 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.759
 the legend and that is the story one 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.830
 elite troops of knights as the 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.340
 Known for fighting against one 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.259
 experienced powerful threat you have know 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.149
 as good as me that weibel the key 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.830
 for all this unrest is mine for everything 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.459
 opinion is meaningless the advice has 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.289
 spoken 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.810
 few have the desires of 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.209
 I have to remind you of father 's 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.770
 that we are all the loud chancellor to 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:52.209
 Services are so up the knight 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.950
 Commander brings him to reason 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:57.140
 Do you have that penetration into a rebel? 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.179
 fortress it is reasonable 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.619
 acceptable risk one for that you 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.420
 it would be ready to take responsibility 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.459
 Wear if unpredictable circumstances 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.080
 enter everything that happens to us 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.700
 no one else responsible 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.200
 too much will not be revealed here 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.210
 the story about the turn of the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.650
 Events is also one of the 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.290
 core points of new order 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.470
 as well as the slightly different London, though 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.000
 plays the story 18 86 but offers 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.310
 among other things already progressive 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.350
 technologies about the victorian 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.210
 City skyline fly airships 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.680
 and also the weapons are for the 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.680
 that time pretty advanced 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.980
 already falls during the first hours of play 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.629
 on that long between sequences 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.349
 through very short game passages 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.390
 alternate 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.400
 the player has the first chapter behind 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.510
 then take the story of the order 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.510
 right away 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.140
 Damn who has a transmitter here 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:03:12.760
 is my communicator i still can 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:15.030
 what to pay discovery all devices 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.030
 out 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.459
 many passages in the third person 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.620
 shooter strongly reminiscent of others 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.480
 well-known computer games so clever of 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.400
 player along house walls and feels 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.980
 Partially the ezio from assassin's 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.930
 creed and also the firefights the 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.700
 Feel yourself already experienced at the 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.989
 that's because you know it 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.319
 gears of war 3 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.040
 In general, the controls are a bit 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.500
 getting used to and above all something 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.720
 sluggish the quick time events so that 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.060
 Press button at the right time 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.550
 Of course it is a matter of taste but the 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.769
 playing time of about six hours the 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.930
 is kept pretty short even if that 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.570
 with today's title yes almost normal 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.060
 is the new title of sony is a 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.470
 glossy game with a thrilling 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.350
 story in an interesting 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.840
 setting in any case is the order 18 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.170
 86 a blockbuster and even one 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.480
 the first in this still fresh year 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.900
 2015, however, on a title from 18 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.900
 years 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.820
 I smell
