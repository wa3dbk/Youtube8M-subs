 whole we will then add the flour 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:46.390
 just before the blends and the yeast 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.390
 in the flour 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:58.380
 here 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:02:01.490
 you're falling here and now we're 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.490
 will add the melted butter 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:12.780
 not to mention our little pinch of salt 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.290
 ok here is our paw is ready she is 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.120
 very smooth 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.360
 so we can supply our madeleine 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.580
 oh no there a little secret to have 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.560
 madeleines had beautiful bumps 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.720
 it is to let the dough rest 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.460
 fridge for 2 hours later 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.230
 when we bake gold unlike 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.170
 temperature will allow the formation of the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.650
 hump and that's it more than 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.500
 expect 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.180
 So here are the mussels we do not fill them 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.590
 to the brim they are filled to the three 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.710
 quarters now that our footprints 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.280
 are filled we're going to bake so we're going 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.530
 put to 240 and splinters bost will start 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.250
 to form we will go down to 180 Â° during 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.290
 6 to 8 minutes 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.879
 our madeleine are cooked we can see 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:04.800
 beautiful bumps they are golden brown 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:08.780
