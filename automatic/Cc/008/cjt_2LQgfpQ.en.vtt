00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.130 
neutrals I love using all the natural
textures<00:01:18.619> this<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> color<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.479> really

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
textures this is a color that I really

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.700 
textures this is a color that I really
would<00:01:22.320> say<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.729> good<00:01:24.360> color<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.470> work

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
would say is not a good color to work

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.830 
would say is not a good color to work
with<00:01:25.979> especially<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> wall<00:01:27.240> because<00:01:27.720> I

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
with especially on the wall because I

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.890 
with especially on the wall because I
think<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.200> turns<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.680> fleshy<00:01:29.210> this<00:01:30.210> was<00:01:30.509> this

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
think it turns out fleshy this was this

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.219 
think it turns out fleshy this was this
color<00:01:31.170> was<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.770> before<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.520> got<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.900> so

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
color was here before I got here and so

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.590 
color was here before I got here and so
these<00:01:34.860> walls<00:01:35.220> will<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.490> changed<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.479> more

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
these walls will be changed to a more

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.760 
these walls will be changed to a more
neutral<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:38.340> color<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.479> softer<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.740> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
neutral a color that is softer this is a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.210 
neutral a color that is softer this is a
