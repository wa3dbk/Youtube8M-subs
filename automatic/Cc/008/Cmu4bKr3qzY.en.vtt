are<00:04:10.430> not<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:10.730> same<00:04:11.410> so<00:04:12.410> you<00:04:13.010> cannot<00:04:13.340> just

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
are not the same so you cannot just

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
anymore then you can views clear to

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.010 
anymore then you can views clear to
clear<00:04:26.950> so<00:04:27.950> it's<00:04:28.910> quite<00:04:29.090> a<00:04:29.150> confusing<00:04:29.840> thing
