00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
that's pretty much going to take out the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.650 
that's pretty much going to take out the
rest<00:02:32.099> of<00:02:32.250> them<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.549> that<00:02:32.760> wizard<00:02:33.150> tower<00:02:33.390> and

where exactly your units are headed

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.589 
where exactly your units are headed
before<00:02:41.129> you<00:02:41.400> drop<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.879> rage<00:02:42.120> spell<00:02:42.450> so

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
before you drop that rage spell so

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.449 
before you drop that rage spell so
they're<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.930> last<00:02:43.200> rage<00:02:43.590> goes<00:02:43.890> down<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.250> king
