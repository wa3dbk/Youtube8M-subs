around<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:13.960> used<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.380> think<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.280> have<00:02:15.640> a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
around and I used to think that I have a

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.360 
around and I used to think that I have a
message<00:02:15.880> from<00:02:16.690> someone<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.740> it'll<00:02:17.920> show<00:02:18.010> up

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
message from someone and it'll show up

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.210 
message from someone and it'll show up

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
on my Windows 8 computer because Windows

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.710 
on my Windows 8 computer because Windows
8<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.490> actually<00:02:21.640> pretty<00:02:22.000> good<00:02:22.240> and<00:02:22.420> then<00:02:22.630> one

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
8 is actually pretty good and then one

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.120 
8 is actually pretty good and then one
who<00:02:22.810> says<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.080> chip<00:02:23.350> just<00:02:23.650> has<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.830> problem

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
who says the chip just has a problem

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.940 
who says the chip just has a problem
with<00:02:24.460> it<00:02:24.960> doesn't<00:02:25.960> like<00:02:26.050> try<00:02:26.200> new<00:02:26.380> things<00:02:26.410> but

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
with it doesn't like try new things but

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.920 
with it doesn't like try new things but
um<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.730> known<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.180> kind<00:02:28.270> of<00:02:28.390> made<00:02:28.540> me<00:02:28.690> think

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
um that known that kind of made me think

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.690 
um that known that kind of made me think
of<00:02:29.280> film<00:02:30.280> called

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
of film called

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.240 
of film called
Generation<00:02:31.660> X<00:02:31.840> or<00:02:32.140> Project<00:02:32.620> X<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.950> think<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.160> was

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
Generation X or Project X I think it was

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.420 
Generation X or Project X I think it was
called<00:02:33.430> Project<00:02:33.730> X<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:34.630> was<00:02:34.720> just<00:02:35.430> like

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
called Project X and it was just like

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.950 
called Project X and it was just like
the<00:02:36.580> numbers<00:02:36.910> for<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.120> drugs<00:02:37.390> like<00:02:37.810> ecstasy

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
the numbers for the drugs like ecstasy

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.380 
the numbers for the drugs like ecstasy
or<00:02:38.380> something<00:02:38.770> I<00:02:38.920> had<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.880> watch<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.240> with

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
or something I had to watch that with

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.930 
or something I had to watch that with
Charlie<00:02:40.570> and<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.710> didn't<00:02:42.250> particularly<00:02:42.580> enjoy

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
Charlie and I didn't particularly enjoy

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.730 
Charlie and I didn't particularly enjoy
it<00:02:43.090> was<00:02:43.210> over<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:43.480> guess<00:02:43.900> not<00:02:44.170> something<00:02:44.650> I'd

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
it was over I guess not something I'd

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.950 
it was over I guess not something I'd
recommend<00:02:45.000> more<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.300> probable

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
recommend more of the probable

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.690 
recommend more of the probable
developers<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.830> people<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.340> kind<00:02:48.430> looks

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
developers of people that kind looks

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.120 
developers of people that kind looks
like<00:02:48.790> Callum<00:02:49.150> if<00:02:49.510> he<00:02:49.690> was<00:02:49.900> from<00:02:50.260> America<00:02:50.920> and

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
like Callum if he was from America and

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.460 
like Callum if he was from America and
had<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.370> different<00:02:51.970> head<00:02:52.120> shape<00:02:52.390> doesn't<00:02:53.320> look

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
had a different head shape doesn't look

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.040 
had a different head shape doesn't look
like<00:02:53.590> him<00:02:53.709> at<00:02:53.800> all<00:02:53.950> actually<00:02:54.130> never<00:02:54.520> mind<00:02:54.670> that

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
like him at all actually never mind that

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.610 
like him at all actually never mind that
um<00:02:56.050> but<00:02:56.709> yeah<00:02:56.920> there's<00:02:57.880> a<00:02:57.970> gnome<00:02:58.480> which<00:02:59.020> was<00:02:59.230> in

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
um but yeah there's a gnome which was in

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.010 
um but yeah there's a gnome which was in
that<00:02:59.770> room<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:01.180> there's<00:03:01.420> not<00:03:01.540> really<00:03:01.600> that

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
that room and there's not really that

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.370 
that room and there's not really that
much<00:03:02.380> else<00:03:02.650> but<00:03:02.800> we<00:03:02.920> will<00:03:03.040> have<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:04.080> nice<00:03:05.080> little

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380

look<00:03:05.800> around<00:03:05.950> very<00:03:06.640> quickly<00:03:06.820> but<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.930> few

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
look around very quickly but a few

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.449 
look around very quickly but a few

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
papers which are still everywhere

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.170 
papers which are still everywhere
because<00:03:10.240> this<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.110> at<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:11.440> heart<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.860> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
because this is at the heart of the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.180 
because this is at the heart of the
federation's<00:03:13.180> invasion<00:03:13.800> send<00:03:14.800> menace<00:03:15.070> and

other such things creepy messages

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.540 
other such things creepy messages
Walking<00:03:18.640> Dead<00:03:18.880> references<00:03:19.510> probably<00:03:19.989> like<00:03:20.200> in

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
Walking Dead references probably like in

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.979 
Walking Dead references probably like in
octane<00:03:21.550> I<00:03:21.580> believe<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.180> map<00:03:22.330> was<00:03:22.570> when<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:22.810> call

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
octane I believe the map was when I call

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.090 
octane I believe the map was when I call
it<00:03:23.080> before<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.530> lot<00:03:23.650> of<00:03:23.680> people<00:03:23.950> in<00:03:24.040> the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
it before and a lot of people in the

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.259 
it before and a lot of people in the
comment<00:03:24.400> section<00:03:24.670> were<00:03:24.760> thinking<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:25.150> was

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
comment section were thinking it was

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.259 
comment section were thinking it was
Walking<00:03:26.110> Dead<00:03:26.260> references<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:27.010> there's<00:03:27.970> that

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
Walking Dead references so there's that

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.810 
Walking Dead references so there's that
I<00:03:29.170> generally<00:03:30.010> don't<00:03:30.280> think<00:03:30.550> there's<00:03:30.700> much

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
I generally don't think there's much

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.600 
I generally don't think there's much

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
bunch of stuff around here I remember

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.690 
bunch of stuff around here I remember
seeing<00:03:41.080> that<00:03:41.230> picked<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:42.160> know<00:03:42.250> that<00:03:42.430> little

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
man in red with a different map I think

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.009 
man in red with a different map I think
it<00:03:47.170> was<00:03:47.260> on<00:03:47.670> containment<00:03:48.670> but<00:03:49.420> there's<00:03:49.690> just
