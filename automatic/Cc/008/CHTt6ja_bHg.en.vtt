00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
just quickly reset time and also the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.650

weather<00:00:24.560> because<00:00:25.560> for<00:00:25.769> some<00:00:25.980> reason<00:00:26.660> it

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
weather because for some reason it

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.810 
weather because for some reason it
starts<00:00:28.019> raining<00:00:28.260> or<00:00:28.680> snowing<00:00:28.769> every<00:00:29.580> time<00:00:29.789> I

starts raining or snowing every time I

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.790 
starts raining or snowing every time I
set<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.359> time<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.019> need<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.260> fix<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.529> up

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
set the time so I need to fix that up

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.190 
set the time so I need to fix that up
eventually<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.460> not<00:00:32.850> now<00:00:33.300> i'm<00:00:33.660> too<00:00:33.809> lazy<00:00:33.930> to

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
eventually but not now i'm too lazy to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.470 
eventually but not now i'm too lazy to
do<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.730> probably<00:00:36.030> tell<00:00:36.149> by

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
do that so as you can probably tell by

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.139 
do that so as you can probably tell by
now<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.989> quite<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.469> different<00:00:37.980> land<00:00:38.250> what

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
now this is quite a different land what

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.540 
now this is quite a different land what
was<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.480> talking<00:00:39.540> about<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.920> last<00:00:40.950> server

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
was I talking about in the last server

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.220 
was I talking about in the last server
update<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.000> was<00:00:42.210> talking<00:00:42.510> about<00:00:42.570> making<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
update I was talking about making the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.490 
update I was talking about making the
starting<00:00:43.739> spawn<00:00:44.100> area<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:45.480> floating<00:00:46.230> island

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
starting spawn area the floating island

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.650 
starting spawn area the floating island
so<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:48.030> looking<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.480> little

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
so this is going to be looking a little

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.619 
so this is going to be looking a little
bit<00:00:48.840> godlike<00:00:49.440> divine<00:00:49.950> like<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:51.210> way<00:00:51.360> doesn't

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
bit godlike divine like in a way doesn't

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.750 
bit godlike divine like in a way doesn't
it<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.500> see<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:52.739> birch<00:00:53.039> trees<00:00:53.430> with

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
you are with you'll spawn for the first

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.250 
you are with you'll spawn for the first
time<00:01:06.030> when<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.360> enter<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> server<00:01:06.990> so

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
time when you enter the server so

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.840 
time when you enter the server so
imagine<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.799> will<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.580> entered

imagine if you will I have just entered

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.789 
imagine if you will I have just entered
the<00:01:09.180> server<00:01:09.390> I've<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.840> spawned<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.530> just

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the server I've just spawned and I just

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.760 
the server I've just spawned and I just
spawned<00:01:11.040> over<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:13.020> mystical<00:01:13.710> land

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
spawned over here in this mystical land

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.010 
spawned over here in this mystical land
you<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> Sun<00:01:15.330> shines<00:01:15.689> across

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
you can see that the Sun shines across

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.560 
you can see that the Sun shines across
the<00:01:16.200> leaves<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.799> such<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> divine<00:01:17.970> way<00:01:18.270> doesn't

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the leaves in such a divine way doesn't

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.330 
the leaves in such a divine way doesn't
it<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:18.960> anyway<00:01:19.229> let's<00:01:19.439> head<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.590> down<00:01:19.710> towards

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
it so anyway let's head on down towards

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.940 
it so anyway let's head on down towards
this<00:01:20.430> area<00:01:20.640> over<00:01:20.820> here<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.540> as<00:01:22.409> soon<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:22.860> you

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
this area over here and as soon as you

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.380 
this area over here and as soon as you
start<00:01:23.159> approaching<00:01:23.400> start<00:01:24.060> making<00:01:24.270> your<00:01:24.360> way

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
start approaching start making your way

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.120 
start approaching start making your way
into<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.840> world<00:01:25.049> what<00:01:25.650> you'll<00:01:25.799> come<00:01:26.040> across

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
into the world what you'll come across

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.520 
into the world what you'll come across
is<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.759> crossroads<00:01:27.360> over<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.320> will

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
is to crossroads over here this will

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.190 
is to crossroads over here this will
eventually<00:01:28.740> entail<00:01:29.729> some<00:01:30.270> rules<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
eventually entail some rules on the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.469 
eventually entail some rules on the
server<00:01:31.640> hopefully<00:01:32.640> not<00:01:32.790> too<00:01:32.970> much<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.390> i'll

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
server hopefully not too much but i'll

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.480 
server hopefully not too much but i'll
be<00:01:33.600> explaining<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.380> main<00:01:34.530> premise<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
be explaining the main premise of it

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.460 
be explaining the main premise of it
being<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.820> realism<00:01:36.240> server<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.930> such<00:01:37.170> stuff

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
being a realism server and such stuff

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.249 
being a realism server and such stuff
like<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:38.150> eventually<00:01:39.150> though<00:01:39.360> you'll<00:01:40.140> have

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
like that eventually though you'll have

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.719 
like that eventually though you'll have
two<00:01:40.409> sides<00:01:40.590> over<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:40.950> rules<00:01:41.189> their<00:01:41.400> rules

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
two sides over here rules their rules

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.370 
two sides over here rules their rules
there<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.270> forth<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.720> then

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
there and so on so forth and then

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.050 
there and so on so forth and then
eventually<00:01:43.590> you'll<00:01:44.100> probably<00:01:44.340> want<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> work

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
eventually you'll probably want to work

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.580 
eventually you'll probably want to work
your<00:01:45.240> way<00:01:45.390> into<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> world<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.200> what<00:01:46.470> you'll

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
your way into the world and what you'll

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.469 
your way into the world and what you'll
come<00:01:46.799> across<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.579> wooden<00:01:47.850> platform<00:01:48.299> with

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
come across is this wooden platform with

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.160 
come across is this wooden platform with
the<00:01:48.509> world<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.590> if<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.119> okay<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:52.110> course

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the world but if you okay and of course

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.870 
the world but if you okay and of course
if<00:01:52.710> you're<00:01:52.829> going<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> progress<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.700> go

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
if you're going to progress you go

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.370 
if you're going to progress you go
you're<00:01:54.030> gonna<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.390> jump<00:01:54.630> off<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.110> let's

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
you're gonna have to jump off so let's

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.490 
you're gonna have to jump off so let's
take<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> big<00:01:55.770> leap<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:56.130> faith<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.549> let's<00:01:57.090> go

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
take a big leap of faith and let's go

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.639 
take a big leap of faith and let's go
here<00:01:58.500> we<00:01:58.619> go<00:01:58.649> falling<00:01:59.399> into<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> world

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
here we go falling into the world

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.100 
here we go falling into the world
crashing<00:02:02.060> crashing<00:02:03.060> right<00:02:03.420> into<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:03.869> big

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
crashing crashing right into this big

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.039 
crashing crashing right into this big
lake<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.799> having<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.790> make<00:02:06.030> our<00:02:06.210> way<00:02:06.509> up<00:02:06.540> to

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
lake and having to make our way up to

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.390 
lake and having to make our way up to
the<00:02:07.799> surface<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:09.149> water<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:10.370> of<00:02:11.370> course

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
the surface of the water and of course

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.620 
the surface of the water and of course
we<00:02:11.760> come<00:02:11.970> across

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
we come across

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.760 
we come across
this<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:14.730> landing<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:16.020> some<00:02:16.230> source<00:02:16.470> and

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
this this landing of some source and

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.830 
this this landing of some source and
that<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.310> floating<00:02:17.730> island<00:02:17.880> right<00:02:18.690> up

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
that is the floating island right up

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.600 
that is the floating island right up
there<00:02:19.050> guys<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.830> know<00:02:19.980> it's<00:02:20.190> going<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.400> look

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
there guys so I know it's going to look

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.940 
there guys so I know it's going to look
a<00:02:20.730> little<00:02:20.970> bit<00:02:21.180> weird<00:02:21.390> from<00:02:22.350> this<00:02:22.770> perspective

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
a little bit weird from this perspective

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.860 
a little bit weird from this perspective
when<00:02:23.400> you're<00:02:23.520> down<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.940> main<00:02:24.150> island<00:02:24.180> but

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
when you're down on the main island but

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.650 
when you're down on the main island but
of<00:02:25.320> course<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.760> floating<00:02:27.360> islands

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
of course that is the floating islands

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.480 
of course that is the floating islands
where<00:02:27.780> everyone<00:02:28.170> will<00:02:28.290> be<00:02:28.410> starting<00:02:28.800> off<00:02:28.920> from

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
where everyone will be starting off from

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.180 
where everyone will be starting off from
and<00:02:29.850> they'll<00:02:30.000> be<00:02:30.150> jumping<00:02:30.540> down<00:02:30.750> into<00:02:31.350> into

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
and they'll be jumping down into into

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.610 
and they'll be jumping down into into
the<00:02:32.220> real<00:02:32.850> world<00:02:32.880> right<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.840> real<00:02:34.020> world<00:02:34.320> this

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
the real world right the real world this

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.530 
the real world right the real world this
is<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.890> real<00:02:35.250> world<00:02:35.580> don't<00:02:36.030> mind<00:02:36.180> some<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
is the real world don't mind some of the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.640 
is the real world don't mind some of the
stuff<00:02:36.690> that's<00:02:36.840> going<00:02:37.080> on<00:02:37.170> here<00:02:37.410> like<00:02:37.560> this

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
stuff that's going on here like this

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.110 
stuff that's going on here like this
grass<00:02:37.920> along<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.400> path<00:02:38.580> that's<00:02:38.820> going<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.030> be

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
grass along the path that's going to be

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.000 
grass along the path that's going to be
changed<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.820> pretty<00:02:42.180> much<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:43.010> and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
changed and that is pretty much it and

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.920 
changed and that is pretty much it and
that<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.460> majority<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.120> what<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.360> worked<00:02:45.720> on

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
that is the majority of what I worked on

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.070 
that is the majority of what I worked on
since<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.920> last<00:02:47.430> server<00:02:47.730> update<00:02:48.210> apart<00:02:48.960> from

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
since the last server update apart from

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.350 
since the last server update apart from
a<00:02:49.260> free<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.560> few<00:02:50.220> tweaks<00:02:50.580> for<00:02:50.730> example<00:02:51.300> I

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
a free a few tweaks for example I

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.700 
a free a few tweaks for example I
brought<00:02:51.600> on<00:02:51.630> one<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.990> my<00:02:52.080> friends<00:02:52.530> on<00:02:52.650> the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
brought on one of my friends on the

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.640 
brought on one of my friends on the
server<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.760> other<00:02:53.880> day<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.450> we<00:02:54.720> balanced<00:02:55.530> up

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
server the other day and we balanced up

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.410 
server the other day and we balanced up
the<00:02:55.830> jump<00:02:56.100> quest<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.850> little<00:02:57.450> bit<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:57.870> it's<00:02:58.200> not

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
the jump quest a little bit so it's not

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.110 
the jump quest a little bit so it's not
so<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.780> exclude<00:03:01.380> some<00:03:01.650> bits<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.430> were<00:03:02.580> way

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
so to exclude some bits that were way

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.850 
so to exclude some bits that were way
too<00:03:03.150> easy<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.960> get<00:03:04.110> through<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.380> jump<00:03:04.620> quest

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
too easy to get through the jump quest

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.270 
too easy to get through the jump quest
now<00:03:05.100> it's<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.490> more<00:03:06.300> balanced<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:08.130> bit

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
now it's a more balanced and a bit

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.710 
now it's a more balanced and a bit
harder<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.670> actually<00:03:08.910> get<00:03:09.210> through<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:09.690> that

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
harder to actually get through so that

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.780 
harder to actually get through so that
is<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.050> whole<00:03:10.200> point<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.650> apart<00:03:11.610> from<00:03:11.760> that

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
is the whole point of it apart from that

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.820 
is the whole point of it apart from that
I've<00:03:12.270> done<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.480> few<00:03:12.600> other<00:03:12.900> tweaks<00:03:13.230> such<00:03:13.530> as

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
I've done a few other tweaks such as

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.400 
I've done a few other tweaks such as
fixing<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.030> landmasses<00:03:15.720> where<00:03:16.260> these

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
fixing the landmasses where these

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.710 
fixing the landmasses where these
islands<00:03:16.920> were<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.340> other<00:03:17.460> islands<00:03:18.000> as<00:03:18.120> you

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
islands were the other islands as you

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.920 
islands were the other islands as you
can<00:03:18.840> see<00:03:19.080> before<00:03:19.830> in<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.970> previous<00:03:21.510> server

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
can see before in the previous server

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.740 
can see before in the previous server
updates<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.680> was<00:03:23.190> just<00:03:23.460> the<00:03:24.270> landmass<00:03:24.720> just

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
updates it was just the landmass just

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.080 
updates it was just the landmass just
went<00:03:25.170> straight<00:03:25.530> down<00:03:25.560> there<00:03:26.130> was<00:03:26.280> no<00:03:26.490> sloped

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
went straight down there was no sloped

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.810 
went straight down there was no sloped
pneus<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.230> going<00:03:28.590> down<00:03:28.740> towards<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.400> sea

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
pneus of it going down towards the sea

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.390 
pneus of it going down towards the sea
bed<00:03:30.000> now<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.720> has<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:30.930> wii<00:03:31.170> slope<00:03:31.590> going<00:03:31.980> down<00:03:32.160> so

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
bed now it has a wii slope going down so

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.890 
bed now it has a wii slope going down so
those<00:03:32.610> are<00:03:32.790> minor<00:03:33.000> tweaks<00:03:33.390> same<00:03:33.660> with<00:03:33.810> the

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
those are minor tweaks same with the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.900 
those are minor tweaks same with the
other<00:03:33.930> Island<00:03:34.410> over<00:03:34.530> there<00:03:34.650> has<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.310> bit<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:35.820> a

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
other Island over there has a bit of a

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.790 
other Island over there has a bit of a
slope<00:03:36.210> going<00:03:36.510> downwards<00:03:36.900> stuff<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.710> probably

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
slope going downwards stuff you probably

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.210 
slope going downwards stuff you probably
won't<00:03:38.190> really<00:03:38.480> care<00:03:39.480> about<00:03:40.140> but<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.860> does<00:03:41.040> make

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
won't really care about but it does make

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.970 
won't really care about but it does make
a<00:03:41.280> bit<00:03:41.490> of<00:03:41.520> a<00:03:41.640> difference<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.620> so<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:43.830> is

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
a bit of a difference and so that is

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.980 
a bit of a difference and so that is
pretty<00:03:44.160> much<00:03:44.340> what<00:03:44.400> i've<00:03:44.610> done<00:03:44.820> thus<00:03:45.209> far<00:03:45.240> ok

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
pretty much what i've done thus far ok

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.560 
pretty much what i've done thus far ok
so<00:03:46.050> what<00:03:46.470> I'll<00:03:46.590> be<00:03:46.740> working<00:03:46.860> on<00:03:47.160> next<00:03:47.970> is

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
so what I'll be working on next is

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.140 
so what I'll be working on next is
probably<00:03:49.320> hmm<00:03:50.100> good<00:03:50.580> question<00:03:50.610> actually

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
probably hmm good question actually

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.690 
probably hmm good question actually
probably<00:03:52.080> working<00:03:52.380> on<00:03:52.650> more<00:03:52.890> islands<00:03:53.400> so<00:03:53.520> that

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
probably working on more islands so that

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.730 
probably working on more islands so that
one<00:03:53.940> place<00:03:54.330> where<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.750> jump<00:03:54.959> quest<00:03:55.230> was<00:03:55.470> I'll

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
one place where the jump quest was I'll

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.280 
one place where the jump quest was I'll
probably<00:03:55.890> working<00:03:56.310> on<00:03:56.520> that<00:03:56.730> next<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:58.050> finish

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
probably working on that next to finish

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.340 
probably working on that next to finish
off<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.470> Island<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:59.690> want<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.810> change<00:04:01.140> this

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
off that Island I want to change this

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.140 
off that Island I want to change this
jungle<00:04:01.860> sooner<00:04:02.220> or<00:04:02.280> later<00:04:02.400> but<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.760> think<00:04:03.030> I'm

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
jungle sooner or later but I think I'm

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.340 
jungle sooner or later but I think I'm
gonna<00:04:03.270> do<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:03.630> a<00:04:03.660> little<00:04:03.840> bit<00:04:04.020> later<00:04:04.200> because

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
gonna do that a little bit later because

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.140 
gonna do that a little bit later because
I<00:04:04.530> can't<00:04:04.740> really<00:04:04.950> be<00:04:05.070> bothered<00:04:05.220> with<00:04:05.490> it<00:04:05.640> just

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
I can't really be bothered with it just

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.170 
I can't really be bothered with it just
at<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.420> moment<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:07.850> yeah<00:04:08.850> that's<00:04:09.030> pretty

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
at the moment and yeah that's pretty

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.170 
at the moment and yeah that's pretty
much<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:10.380> terms<00:04:10.709> of<00:04:10.950> what's<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.730> server<00:04:12.090> is

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
much it in terms of what's the server is

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.180 
much it in terms of what's the server is
going<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.600> be<00:04:12.750> like<00:04:12.959> I've<00:04:13.620> been<00:04:13.860> thinking

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
going to be like I've been thinking

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.680 
going to be like I've been thinking
about<00:04:14.280> a<00:04:14.400> little<00:04:14.730> bit<00:04:14.850> more<00:04:15.030> don't<00:04:15.450> worry

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
about a little bit more don't worry

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.599 
about a little bit more don't worry
about<00:04:16.109> that<00:04:16.320> glitches<00:04:16.920> in<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.190> hut<00:04:17.370> in<00:04:17.520> the

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
about that glitches in the hut in the

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.210 
about that glitches in the hut in the
ground<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.330> is<00:04:18.510> just<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.930> little<00:04:19.020> slow<00:04:19.470> chunka

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
ground that is just a little slow chunka

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.490 
ground that is just a little slow chunka
loading<00:04:20.609> whatever<00:04:20.940> that<00:04:21.090> might<00:04:21.270> be<00:04:21.380> what<00:04:22.380> the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
loading whatever that might be what the

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.920 
loading whatever that might be what the
server<00:04:22.680> is<00:04:22.770> gonna<00:04:22.950> be<00:04:23.040> like<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.490> like<00:04:24.479> there<00:04:24.780> to

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
server is gonna be like I like there to

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.390 
server is gonna be like I like there to
be<00:04:24.960> an<00:04:25.229> end<00:04:25.410> goal<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.950> everything

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
be an end goal to everything

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.890 
be an end goal to everything
no<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:26.610> keep<00:04:26.820> talking<00:04:27.210> about<00:04:27.300> this<00:04:27.479> button<00:04:27.750> and

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
no I keep talking about this button and

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.290 
no I keep talking about this button and
go<00:04:28.169> to<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.530> server<00:04:28.770> is<00:04:28.949> what<00:04:29.310> ideally<00:04:30.060> like<00:04:30.240> to

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
go to the server is what ideally like to

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.990 
go to the server is what ideally like to
have<00:04:30.690> so<00:04:31.110> of<00:04:32.100> course<00:04:32.310> you'll<00:04:32.520> have<00:04:32.699> the<00:04:32.820> free

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
have so of course you'll have the free

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.969 
have so of course you'll have the free
roaming<00:04:33.270> aspect<00:04:33.900> of<00:04:34.050> it<00:04:34.169> and<00:04:34.320> everything<00:04:34.860> like

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
roaming aspect of it and everything like

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.400 
roaming aspect of it and everything like
that<00:04:35.039> but<00:04:36.030> I<00:04:36.210> would<00:04:36.330> like<00:04:36.509> all<00:04:37.169> these

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
that but I would like all these

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.140 
that but I would like all these
alliances<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:38.430> everything<00:04:38.789> to<00:04:38.940> have<00:04:39.120> a

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
alliances and everything to have a

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.080 
alliances and everything to have a
meaning<00:04:39.780> eventually<00:04:40.770> in<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.130> server<00:04:41.759> there

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
meaning eventually in the server there

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.230 
meaning eventually in the server there
will<00:04:42.270> be<00:04:43.340> obstacles<00:04:44.340> of<00:04:44.699> some<00:04:44.880> sort<00:04:45.180> so

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
will be obstacles of some sort so

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.090 
will be obstacles of some sort so
they'll<00:04:45.509> be<00:04:45.630> landmass<00:04:46.169> is<00:04:46.199> far<00:04:46.740> away<00:04:46.919> from

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
they'll be landmass is far away from

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.670 
they'll be landmass is far away from
this<00:04:47.400> main<00:04:47.639> island<00:04:48.210> where<00:04:48.509> there<00:04:49.500> will<00:04:49.620> be

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
this main island where there will be

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.219 
this main island where there will be
very<00:04:50.220> very<00:04:50.370> hard<00:04:50.820> monsters<00:04:51.479> and<00:04:51.720> such<00:04:51.930> and

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
very very hard monsters and such and

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.230 
very very hard monsters and such and
it'll<00:04:52.410> be<00:04:52.470> these<00:04:52.650> gigantic<00:04:53.280> land<00:04:53.580> masses<00:04:53.880> and

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
it'll be these gigantic land masses and

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.770 
it'll be these gigantic land masses and
the<00:04:54.360> main<00:04:54.539> objectives<00:04:55.259> of<00:04:55.440> those<00:04:56.280> of<00:04:56.940> doing<00:04:57.570> so

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
the main objectives of those of doing so

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.290 
the main objectives of those of doing so
of<00:04:58.259> having<00:04:58.560> those<00:04:58.800> land<00:04:59.070> masses<00:04:59.310> will<00:05:00.000> be<00:05:00.120> to

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
of having those land masses will be to

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.219 
of having those land masses will be to
cross<00:05:00.690> cross<00:05:01.380> them<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:03.210> basically<00:05:03.780> well<00:05:04.199> I

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
cross cross them and to basically well I

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:05.420 
cross cross them and to basically well I
still<00:05:04.500> have<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.710> determine<00:05:05.010> what<00:05:05.340> the

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
still have to determine what the

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.740 
still have to determine what the
objectives<00:05:05.910> are<00:05:06.000> going<00:05:06.150> to<00:05:06.210> be<00:05:06.330> but<00:05:06.539> for

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
objectives are going to be but for

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.469 
objectives are going to be but for
example<00:05:07.199> I'll<00:05:07.560> maybe<00:05:07.949> make<00:05:08.220> it<00:05:08.400> grow<00:05:08.610> for<00:05:09.270> the

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
example I'll maybe make it grow for the

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.050 
example I'll maybe make it grow for the
first<00:05:09.990> alliance<00:05:10.350> to<00:05:10.800> build<00:05:11.190> some<00:05:11.789> sort<00:05:11.940> of

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
first alliance to build some sort of

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.420 
first alliance to build some sort of
tower<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.750> center<00:05:13.199> of<00:05:13.350> that<00:05:13.500> land<00:05:13.740> mass<00:05:14.039> right

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
tower and center of that land mass right

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.550 
tower and center of that land mass right
and<00:05:14.729> in<00:05:15.120> order<00:05:15.300> to<00:05:15.449> get<00:05:15.570> into<00:05:15.810> that<00:05:15.870> land<00:05:16.169> into

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
and in order to get into that land into

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.960 
and in order to get into that land into
the<00:05:16.770> center<00:05:17.039> of<00:05:17.070> that<00:05:17.220> land<00:05:17.430> mass<00:05:17.639> there's

actually getting that end goal right of

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.279 
actually getting that end goal right of
course<00:05:39.030> these<00:05:39.240> end<00:05:39.479> goals<00:05:39.720> such<00:05:40.080> as<00:05:40.110> a

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
course these end goals such as a

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.260 
course these end goals such as a
building<00:05:41.160> that<00:05:41.220> tower<00:05:41.550> in<00:05:41.820> the<00:05:41.880> middle<00:05:41.970> of<00:05:42.180> the

building that tower in the middle of the

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.719 
building that tower in the middle of the
of<00:05:42.599> the<00:05:43.080> landmass<00:05:43.440> will<00:05:43.740> eventually<00:05:44.310> lead<00:05:44.520> up

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
of the landmass will eventually lead up

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.659 
of the landmass will eventually lead up
to<00:05:44.789> a<00:05:45.330> more<00:05:46.020> final<00:05:46.560> goal<00:05:46.800> and<00:05:47.099> that<00:05:47.220> final

to a more final goal and that final

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.129 
to a more final goal and that final
final<00:05:48.030> goal<00:05:48.180> will<00:05:48.330> hopefully<00:05:48.479> be<00:05:48.810> something

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
final goal will hopefully be something

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.230 
final goal will hopefully be something
like<00:05:49.289> beating<00:05:50.070> the<00:05:50.220> ender<00:05:50.610> dragon<00:05:51.150> or

like beating the ender dragon or
whatever<00:05:51.479> the<00:05:51.690> very<00:05:52.139> very<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:53.130> final<00:05:53.490> boss

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
whatever the very very the final boss

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:55.370 
whatever the very very the final boss
something<00:05:54.449> like<00:05:54.599> that<00:05:54.780> right<00:05:54.810> and<00:05:55.169> this<00:05:55.260> is

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
something like that right and this is

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.790 
something like that right and this is
going<00:05:55.530> to<00:05:55.590> take<00:05:55.740> a<00:05:55.800> long<00:05:56.130> time<00:05:56.550> but<00:05:57.479> in<00:05:57.780> in<00:05:58.440> that

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
going to take a long time but in in that
