questions how do you set one up what is
it<00:00:31.560> what<00:00:31.859> different<00:00:32.099> types<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.430> radar<00:00:32.669> there

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
it what different types of radar there

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.270 
it what different types of radar there
what<00:00:33.149> kind<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.360> raid<00:00:33.540> should<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.750> use<00:00:34.020> etc<00:00:34.290> so

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
what kind of raid should I use etc so

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.620 
what kind of raid should I use etc so
I'm<00:00:35.399> just<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.700> go<00:00:35.880> over<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> little<00:00:36.390> bit

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
I'm just going to go over a little bit

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.590 
I'm just going to go over a little bit
on<00:00:36.870> what<00:00:37.710> rate<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.190> there<00:00:38.940> are<00:00:39.059> types<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.390> raid

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
on what rate is there are types of raid

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.190 
on what rate is there are types of raid
help<00:00:39.930> me<00:00:40.050> implemented<00:00:40.730> etc<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.450> I'll<00:00:43.050> get

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
help me implemented etc so I'll get

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.279 
help me implemented etc so I'll get
right<00:00:43.320> into<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.700> raid<00:00:44.700> stands<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.360> redundant

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
right into it raid stands for redundant

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.590 
right into it raid stands for redundant
array<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.559> independent<00:00:47.190> disks<00:00:47.579> or<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.480> also

basically what rate is is it's the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.510 
basically what rate is is it's the
process<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.870> combining<00:00:58.109> two<00:00:59.039> or<00:00:59.070> more<00:00:59.190> hard

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
process of combining two or more hard

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.760 
process of combining two or more hard
drives<00:00:59.609> in<00:01:00.059> such<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> way<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.469> storage

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
drives in such a way that the storage

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.039 
drives in such a way that the storage

hard drive setup you just one hard drive

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.210 
hard drive setup you just one hard drive
is<00:01:19.140> one<00:01:19.320> hard<00:01:19.530> drive<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.890> see<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
is one hard drive that you see in the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.910 
is one hard drive that you see in the
operating<00:01:20.549> system<00:01:21.470> they're<00:01:22.470> independent

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
operating system they're independent

storage units raid combines hard drives

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.929 
storage units raid combines hard drives
so<00:01:25.320> there's<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> few<00:01:26.369> reasons<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.700> would<00:01:26.790> use

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
so there's a few reasons you would use

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.710 
so there's a few reasons you would use
raid<00:01:27.350> 1<00:01:28.350> data<00:01:28.860> security<00:01:29.280> or<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> dungeon<00:01:29.909> see<00:01:30.090> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
raid 1 data security or a dungeon see it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.060 
raid 1 data security or a dungeon see it
can<00:01:30.869> be<00:01:30.990> used<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.290> basically<00:01:31.439> maintain<00:01:31.860> an

automatic copies of your data or backups

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.670 
automatic copies of your data or backups
could<00:01:36.570> result<00:01:36.930> depending<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.530> type<00:01:37.650> of

could result depending on the type of

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.710 
could result depending on the type of
raid<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.100> use<00:01:38.220> once<00:01:38.430> again<00:01:38.720> faster

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
to set up a raid hard drive away there's

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.740 
to set up a raid hard drive away there's
hardware<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.939> their<00:01:54.390> software

hardware<00:01:57.890> hardware<00:01:58.890> RAID<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.310> basically<00:01:59.880> you

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
hardware hardware RAID is basically you

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.149 
hardware hardware RAID is basically you
have<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.020> chip<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.289> your<00:02:01.320> motherboard<00:02:01.649> that

pretty<00:04:03.690> expensive<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:05.100> other<00:04:05.310> option<00:04:05.760> the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
pretty expensive the other option the

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.880 
pretty expensive the other option the
other<00:04:06.030> way<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.180> do<00:04:06.300> rate<00:04:06.480> is<00:04:06.720> software<00:04:07.200> raid<00:04:07.380> so

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
other way to do rate is software raid so

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.590 
other way to do rate is software raid so
that's<00:04:08.250> handled<00:04:08.670> by<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.850> operating<00:04:09.300> system

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
that's handled by the operating system

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.860 
that's handled by the operating system
or<00:04:09.720> some<00:04:09.930> program<00:04:10.230> in<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.380> operating<00:04:10.800> system

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
or some program in the operating system

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.020 
or some program in the operating system
generally<00:04:13.250> depending<00:04:14.250> once<00:04:14.430> again<00:04:14.640> type<00:04:14.880> of

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
generally depending once again type of

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.789 
generally depending once again type of
raid<00:04:15.150> you're<00:04:15.300> doing<00:04:15.570> it's<00:04:16.140> a<00:04:16.350> little<00:04:16.530> slower

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
raid you're doing it's a little slower

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.590 
raid you're doing it's a little slower
than<00:04:16.950> home<00:04:17.130> raid<00:04:17.430> because<00:04:17.700> it's<00:04:18.000> using<00:04:18.209> CPU

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
than home raid because it's using CPU

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.790 
than home raid because it's using CPU
cycles<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.109> do<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.350> raid<00:04:19.500> processing<00:04:21.800> and

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
cycles to do the raid processing and

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.590 
cycles to do the raid processing and
some<00:04:23.340> raid<00:04:23.700> schemes<00:04:24.060> require<00:04:24.450> more

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
some raid schemes require more

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.370 
some raid schemes require more
processing<00:04:25.200> than<00:04:25.350> others<00:04:25.970> basically<00:04:27.380> it's

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
processing than others basically it's

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.409 
processing than others basically it's
linked<00:04:28.980> to<00:04:29.040> operating<00:04:29.460> system<00:04:29.760> protocols<00:04:30.180> too

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
linked to operating system protocols too

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.590 
linked to operating system protocols too
so<00:04:31.160> if<00:04:32.160> you<00:04:32.220> set<00:04:32.580> up<00:04:32.640> a<00:04:32.700> raid<00:04:32.850> away<00:04:33.090> a<00:04:33.300> raid

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
so if you set up a raid away a raid

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.170 
so if you set up a raid away a raid
array<00:04:33.810> in<00:04:34.260> a<00:04:34.440> one<00:04:35.070> operating<00:04:35.490> system<00:04:35.550> it's<00:04:36.060> not

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
array in a one operating system it's not

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.460 
array in a one operating system it's not
necessarily<00:04:36.660> transfer<00:04:36.990> over<00:04:37.169> to<00:04:37.320> another

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
necessarily transfer over to another

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.990 
necessarily transfer over to another
operating<00:04:37.919> system<00:04:38.190> so<00:04:38.430> that<00:04:38.550> in<00:04:38.700> other<00:04:38.820> words

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
operating system so that in other words

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.610 
operating system so that in other words
like<00:04:39.180> it<00:04:39.300> makes<00:04:39.450> it<00:04:39.570> difficult<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:40.080> do<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:40.290> boot

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
like it makes it difficult to do a boot

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.400 
like it makes it difficult to do a boot
using<00:04:41.240> software<00:04:42.240> raid<00:04:42.510> because<00:04:42.870> it's<00:04:43.140> at<00:04:43.290> the

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
using software raid because it's at the

using software raid because it's at the
operating<00:04:43.800> system<00:04:43.890> instead<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.400> lower<00:04:44.640> than

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
that and in the event of a drive failure

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.380 
that and in the event of a drive failure
it's<00:04:48.390> a<00:04:48.540> it's<00:04:48.750> harder<00:04:49.020> to<00:04:49.140> recover<00:04:49.470> usually

it's a it's harder to recover usually

it's a it's harder to recover usually
