00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.450 
so my name is Benjamin I'm doing the
idea<00:00:29.050> of<00:00:29.110> the<00:00:29.230> workshop<00:00:29.860> is<00:00:30.040> to<00:00:30.220> combine<00:00:30.430> a<00:00:32.460> bit

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
idea of the workshop is to combine a bit

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.130 
idea of the workshop is to combine a bit
of<00:00:33.579> knowledge<00:00:33.940> and<00:00:34.269> introduction<00:00:35.050> of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
of knowledge and introduction of

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.779 
of knowledge and introduction of

those parts and wasted elements you can

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.179

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
parts this one in Dublin we had people

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.600 
parts this one in Dublin we had people
with<00:01:12.939> very<00:01:13.450> different<00:01:13.630> background<00:01:14.430> most<00:01:15.430> of

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
with very different background most of

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.389 
with very different background most of
them<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:15.969> no<00:01:16.500> experience<00:01:17.500> in<00:01:17.649> probing<00:01:18.189> or

them and no experience in probing or
electronic<00:01:18.969> and<00:01:19.149> it's<00:01:19.299> actually<00:01:19.810> something

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
electronic and it's actually something

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.609 
electronic and it's actually something
we<00:01:20.789> we've<00:01:21.789> kind<00:01:21.969> of<00:01:22.000> enjoy<00:01:22.420> because<00:01:22.750> it's<00:01:23.110> way

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
we we've kind of enjoy because it's way

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.070 
we we've kind of enjoy because it's way
of<00:01:23.710> sharing<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:24.189> people

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080

no<00:01:25.560> experience<00:01:25.980> that<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.580> today<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.840> get

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
no experience that in today you can get

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.770 
no experience that in today you can get
something<00:01:28.470> finished<00:01:28.980> and<00:01:29.390> made<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.750> that

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
something finished and made and that

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.410 
something finished and made and that
works<00:01:31.260> and<00:01:31.590> that's<00:01:31.740> not<00:01:32.370> that<00:01:32.670> complicated<00:01:33.000> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
works and that's not that complicated to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.860 
works and that's not that complicated to
build<00:01:33.630> after<00:01:33.990> all<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.440> it's<00:01:35.100> all<00:01:35.250> idea<00:01:35.610> that

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
build after all so it's all idea that

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.750 
build after all so it's all idea that
it's<00:01:36.870> not<00:01:37.140> reserved<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.920> technicians<00:01:38.310> or

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
it's not reserved for technicians or

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.210 
it's not reserved for technicians or
engineers<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.560> pretty<00:01:40.560> much<00:01:40.710> anybody<00:01:41.010> can

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
engineers that pretty much anybody can

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.580 
engineers that pretty much anybody can
do<00:01:41.550> it<00:01:41.580> to<00:01:41.880> spend<00:01:42.120> a<00:01:42.180> bit<00:01:42.330> of<00:01:42.390> time<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.020> just

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
do it to spend a bit of time and just

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.500 
do it to spend a bit of time and just
somebody<00:01:44.010> who<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.400> help<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.970> bitch<00:01:45.150> with<00:01:45.390> it

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
somebody who can help you bitch with it

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.810 
somebody who can help you bitch with it
and<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.770> yeah<00:01:46.910> it<00:01:47.910> is<00:01:48.060> not<00:01:48.210> clear<00:01:48.540> exactly<00:01:49.820> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
and so yeah it is not clear exactly the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.070 
and so yeah it is not clear exactly the
sense<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.560> an<00:01:52.560> interface<00:01:53.360> system<00:01:54.360> between<00:01:54.840> a

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
the towel container and then the flowers

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.290 
the towel container and then the flowers
are<00:02:23.850> turning<00:02:24.540> their<00:02:24.690> will<00:02:25.590> turn<00:02:25.830> exactly<00:02:26.370> 180

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
are turning their will turn exactly 180

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.590 
are turning their will turn exactly 180
degrees<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.280> can<00:02:29.610> change<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.330> side<00:02:30.570> of

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
degrees so you can change the side of

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.130 
degrees so you can change the side of
the<00:02:30.959> foul<00:02:31.170> pot<00:02:31.470> which<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:31.920> facing<00:02:32.820> front<00:02:33.140> this

way<00:02:34.350> when<00:02:35.340> you're<00:02:35.459> walking<00:02:35.670> in<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.030> city<00:02:36.209> and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
way when you're walking in the city and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.120 
way when you're walking in the city and
see<00:02:36.690> one<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.080> flower<00:02:37.350> containers<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.100> can

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
see one of the flower containers you can

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.880 
see one of the flower containers you can
change<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:39.570> flowers<00:02:39.810> from<00:02:39.989> red<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.410> white<00:02:40.440> or

change the flowers from red to white or

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.949 
change the flowers from red to white or
come<00:02:41.550> by<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.760> read<00:02:42.060> there<00:02:42.420> are<00:02:42.510> 10<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.750> these

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
come by to read there are 10 of these

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.259 
come by to read there are 10 of these
flower<00:02:43.230> containers<00:02:43.800> hanging<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.430> off<00:02:44.640> all

idea of interfacing real words and then

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.810 
idea of interfacing real words and then
with<00:02:49.080> an<00:02:49.260> output<00:02:49.709> after<00:02:50.070> it's<00:02:50.550> called

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
with an output after it's called

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.570 
with an output after it's called
physical<00:02:51.300> packaging

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
physical packaging

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.060 
physical packaging
which<00:02:53.150> combine<00:02:53.570> this<00:02:53.720> idea<00:02:54.050> of<00:02:54.140> controlling

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
which combine this idea of controlling

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.660 
which combine this idea of controlling
the<00:02:55.370> real<00:02:55.580> word<00:02:55.960> and<00:02:56.960> then<00:02:57.410> controlling<00:02:58.160> like

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
the real word and then controlling like

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.210 
the real word and then controlling like
mixolydian<00:02:59.480> output<00:03:00.080> could<00:03:00.410> be<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.620> video<00:03:01.010> but

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
mixolydian output could be a video but

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.180 
mixolydian output could be a video but
it<00:03:01.280> could<00:03:01.460> also<00:03:01.490> be<00:03:01.820> a<00:03:02.210> motor<00:03:02.720> or<00:03:03.290> machine<00:03:03.920> that

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
it could also be a motor or machine that

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:12.520 
it could also be a motor or machine that
move<00:03:04.460> and<00:03:04.850> react<00:03:05.270> to<00:03:05.770> physical<00:03:06.770> presence<00:03:11.530> and

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
move and react to physical presence and

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.740 
move and react to physical presence and
the<00:03:12.850> printable<00:03:13.850> is<00:03:16.030> basically<00:03:17.030> it's<00:03:17.180> using<00:03:17.660> a

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
the printable is basically it's using a

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.680 
the printable is basically it's using a
paintball<00:03:18.140> gun<00:03:18.200> you<00:03:18.920> know<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.160> spindle<00:03:19.700> kind

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
paintball gun you know the spindle kind

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.940 
paintball gun you know the spindle kind
of<00:03:20.750> war<00:03:21.190> imitation<00:03:22.190> games<00:03:22.900> but<00:03:23.900> this<00:03:24.080> one<00:03:24.320> is

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
of war imitation games but this one is

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.700 
of war imitation games but this one is
this<00:03:25.400> gun<00:03:25.640> is<00:03:25.970> mounted<00:03:26.930> on<00:03:27.080> what's<00:03:27.440> called<00:03:27.620> a

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
this gun is mounted on what's called a

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.640 
this gun is mounted on what's called a
penitent<00:03:28.190> so<00:03:28.550> it's<00:03:28.700> basically<00:03:29.270> device<00:03:29.990> which

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
penitent so it's basically device which

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.890 
penitent so it's basically device which
combined<00:03:31.010> two<00:03:31.190> motors<00:03:31.580> so<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.510> thing<00:03:32.690> can<00:03:32.870> go

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
combined two motors so the thing can go

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.860 
combined two motors so the thing can go
left<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.440> right<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:34.010> up<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.430> down<00:03:34.520> and<00:03:35.060> then

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
left and right and up and down and then

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.160 
left and right and up and down and then
that<00:03:36.350> way<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.620> can<00:03:36.830> this<00:03:37.730> gun<00:03:38.420> is<00:03:38.540> mounted<00:03:39.050> on

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
that way I can this gun is mounted on

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.560 
that way I can this gun is mounted on
this<00:03:39.320> device<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:39.890> can<00:03:40.100> select<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.060> part<00:03:41.330> and

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
this device and can select a part and

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.160 
this device and can select a part and
then<00:03:41.720> trigger<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.440> shoot<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:44.600> then<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:44.959> can

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
then trigger to shoot and then I can

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.010 
then trigger to shoot and then I can
basically<00:03:46.390> know<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.540> picture<00:03:47.840> in<00:03:47.930> the

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
basically know the picture in the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.370 
basically know the picture in the
program<00:03:48.490> pixel<00:03:49.490> by<00:03:49.610> pixel<00:03:49.640> so<00:03:50.270> demolish<00:03:50.720> the

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
program pixel by pixel so demolish the

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.320 
program pixel by pixel so demolish the
shooting<00:03:51.830> or<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.370> system<00:03:52.730> of<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:52.940> picture

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
shooting or the system of the picture

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330 
shooting or the system of the picture
and<00:03:53.450> then<00:03:53.630> a<00:03:53.840> distance<00:03:54.770> I<00:03:54.980> can<00:03:55.190> do<00:03:55.310> that

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
and then a distance I can do that

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.800 
and then a distance I can do that
gravity<00:03:56.230> style<00:03:57.230> drawing<00:03:58.220> or<00:03:58.640> text<00:03:59.150> or<00:03:59.300> drugs

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
gravity style drawing or text or drugs

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.920 
gravity style drawing or text or drugs
so<00:04:00.709> that<00:04:01.010> was<00:04:01.220> like<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.790> big<00:04:02.030> project<00:04:02.720> we<00:04:02.840> did

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
so that was like the big project we did

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:22.520 
so that was like the big project we did
together

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.850 

parents<00:04:23.530> also<00:04:23.680> helped<00:04:24.070> me<00:04:24.220> on<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:24.760> interface

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
parents also helped me on the interface

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.050 
parents also helped me on the interface
project<00:04:26.860> that<00:04:27.010> is<00:04:27.100> showing<00:04:27.310> year<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.880> light

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
project that is showing year the light

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.750 
project that is showing year the light
festival<00:04:28.540> called<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.169> pong<00:04:29.410> game<00:04:29.650> so<00:04:30.400> it's<00:04:30.550> a

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
festival called the pong game so it's a

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.470 
festival called the pong game so it's a
game<00:04:31.690> that<00:04:32.220> use<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.370> concept<00:04:33.730> of<00:04:33.910> multi

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
game that use the concept of multi

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.150 
game that use the concept of multi
reality<00:04:35.050> where<00:04:35.260> you<00:04:35.380> project<00:04:35.770> on<00:04:36.130> the

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
reality where you project on the

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.240 
reality where you project on the
building<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.990> tongue<00:04:38.229> game<00:04:38.380> got<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.680> remote

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
building the tongue game got a remote

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.240 
building the tongue game got a remote
control<00:04:39.729> so<00:04:39.760> you<00:04:40.000> can<00:04:40.090> actually<00:04:41.190> control<00:04:42.190> the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
control so you can actually control the

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.270 
control so you can actually control the
pedal<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:42.820> slider<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:44.050> then<00:04:44.200> you<00:04:44.350> play

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
pedal the slider and then you play

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.370 
pedal the slider and then you play
against<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.820> architecture<00:04:46.479> basically<00:04:46.930> every

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
against the architecture basically every

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.990 
against the architecture basically every
time<00:04:47.560> you<00:04:47.650> eat<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.040> bow<00:04:48.190> is<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.550> slider<00:04:48.850> it's

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
time you eat the bow is the slider it's

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.240 
time you eat the bow is the slider it's
going<00:04:49.510> it's<00:04:49.810> increasing<00:04:50.620> speed<00:04:50.919> so<00:04:51.130> it's

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
going it's increasing speed so it's

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.450 
going it's increasing speed so it's
going<00:04:51.400> faster<00:04:51.790> and<00:04:51.820> faster<00:04:53.100> basically<00:04:54.100> on<00:04:54.400> the

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
going faster and faster basically on the

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.240 
going faster and faster basically on the
blue<00:04:54.880> man<00:04:55.080> website<00:04:56.080> bloomin<00:04:56.500> on<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.770> bar<00:04:57.040> go
