00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
and he's definitely the most fitting

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.160 
and he's definitely the most fitting
person<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.849> find<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.389> has<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.719> do<00:00:15.839> with<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170

strange because it only happens if you
put<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.240> into<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.480> keepsake<00:00:21.900> box<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:23.100> just<00:00:23.310> lose

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
strange but yeah that's really it for

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.060 
strange but yeah that's really it for
that<00:01:06.240> one<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.990> next<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.439> don't<00:01:07.590> really<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.830> all

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that one so next I don't really have all

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.190 
that one so next I don't really have all

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
that much footage for it but it's one

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.020 
that much footage for it but it's one
that<00:01:10.229> I'm<00:01:11.040> actually<00:01:11.250> not<00:01:11.490> sure<00:01:11.549> if<00:01:11.760> i<00:01:11.939> should

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that I'm actually not sure if i should

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.520 
that I'm actually not sure if i should
say<00:01:12.330> his<00:01:12.420> name<00:01:12.540> i<00:01:12.630> decided<00:01:13.020> not<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:13.380> he

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
say his name i decided not to if he

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.260 
say his name i decided not to if he
sends<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.040> message<00:01:14.369> telling<00:01:14.640> me<00:01:14.700> otherwise<00:01:14.820> I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
sends a message telling me otherwise I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.990 
sends a message telling me otherwise I
will<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.860> pretty<00:01:17.310> serious<00:01:17.610> glitch

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
will but it's a pretty serious glitch

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.080 
will but it's a pretty serious glitch
which<00:01:18.210> allows<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:19.080> dungeons<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.880> theme

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
which allows the dungeons to the theme

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.020 
which allows the dungeons to the theme
to<00:01:21.240> change<00:01:21.479> depending<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.460> what<00:01:23.460> room<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.880> go

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
to change depending on what room you go

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.090 
to change depending on what room you go
into<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.110> change<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.799> whichever

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
into like you can change it to whichever

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.550 
into like you can change it to whichever
theme<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.549> choose<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.479> theoretically<00:01:28.470> you

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
theme you choose so theoretically you

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.640 
theme you choose so theoretically you
could<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:29.369> into<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.850> an<00:01:30.659> abandoned<00:01:31.170> floor<00:01:31.409> and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
could go into a an abandoned floor and

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.480 
could go into a an abandoned floor and
end<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.670> fighting<00:01:32.880> calgar<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.570> getting<00:01:33.869> a

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
end up fighting calgar and getting a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.249 
end up fighting calgar and getting a
primal<00:01:35.490> two-handed<00:01:36.000> sword<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.479> I'm<00:01:36.689> not

might have I think you could way back
maybe<00:02:24.989> in<00:02:25.140> 07<00:02:25.920> scape<00:02:26.129> you<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:26.459> now<00:02:26.700> but<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.360> know

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
maybe in 07 scape you can now but I know

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.030 
maybe in 07 scape you can now but I know
that<00:02:27.599> they<00:02:27.870> stopped<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.349> from<00:02:28.440> doing<00:02:28.620> after<00:02:29.010> a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
that they stopped you from doing after a

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.470 
that they stopped you from doing after a
while<00:02:29.160> because<00:02:29.400> when<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.819> do<00:02:29.940> emotes<00:02:30.269> with

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
while because when you do emotes with

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.960 
while because when you do emotes with
the<00:02:30.599> flag<00:02:30.780> it's<00:02:31.590> normally<00:02:32.280> supposed<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.700> hide

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
the flag it's normally supposed to hide

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.570 
the flag it's normally supposed to hide
the<00:02:33.150> flag<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.690> they<00:02:33.989> wouldn't<00:02:34.349> want<00:02:34.440> people

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
the flag and they wouldn't want people

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.100 
the flag and they wouldn't want people
identified<00:02:35.580> like<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.540> actually<00:02:36.720> on

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
identified like that and actually on

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.009 
identified like that and actually on
that<00:02:37.260> topic<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.830> remember<00:02:38.250> back<00:02:38.880> in<00:02:38.910> 07<00:02:39.660> scape<00:02:39.900> I

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
that topic I remember back in 07 scape I

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.839 
that topic I remember back in 07 scape I
used<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.440> bring<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.099> ring<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.370> stone<00:02:41.580> into

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
used to bring a ring of stone into

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.309 
used to bring a ring of stone into
castle<00:02:42.120> wars<00:02:42.269> which<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.690> don't<00:02:42.930> think<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.200> can

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
castle wars which I don't think you can

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.170 
castle wars which I don't think you can
do<00:02:43.410> anymore<00:02:43.650> or<00:02:44.129> if<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.489> can<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.819> definitely

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
do anymore or if you can you definitely

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.180 
do anymore or if you can you definitely
can't<00:02:45.390> use<00:02:45.540> about<00:02:45.810> wearing<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.290> flag<00:02:46.470> but<00:02:47.069> you

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
can't use about wearing the flag but you

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.089 
can't use about wearing the flag but you
used<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.489> be<00:02:48.060> able<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.410> pick<00:02:49.410> up<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.680> flag<00:02:49.860> and
