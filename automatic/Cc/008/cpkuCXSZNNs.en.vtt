00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
doctor create the intense light I would

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.350 
doctor create the intense light I would
like<00:06:02.050> to<00:06:02.169> say<00:06:02.320> using<00:06:02.710> intense<00:06:03.340> color<00:06:03.730> but

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
like to say using intense color but

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.150 
like to say using intense color but
bring<00:06:04.630> the<00:06:04.810> level<00:06:05.230> the<00:06:05.410> light<00:06:05.590> on<00:06:05.740> the<00:06:05.860> shadow

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
bring the level the light on the shadow

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.250 
bring the level the light on the shadow
on<00:06:06.900> trade<00:06:08.130> lumen<00:06:09.130> aiding<00:06:09.490> the<00:06:09.700> subject<00:06:10.230> so<00:06:11.230> I

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
on trade lumen aiding the subject so I

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.060 
on trade lumen aiding the subject so I
think<00:06:11.470> this<00:06:11.800> is<00:06:11.890> my<00:06:12.040> way<00:06:12.220> to<00:06:12.490> using<00:06:12.970> them<00:06:14.070> the

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
think this is my way to using them the

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.750 
think this is my way to using them the
value<00:06:15.430> contract<00:06:16.060> for<00:06:16.660> the<00:06:16.750> key<00:06:17.280> to<00:06:18.280> repenting

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.940 

that's<00:06:21.760> a<00:06:21.880> little<00:06:22.060> bit<00:06:22.180> idea<00:06:22.600> to<00:06:23.050> using<00:06:23.530> the

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
that's a little bit idea to using the

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.670 
that's a little bit idea to using the
color<00:06:24.250> and<00:06:24.610> the<00:06:24.729> value<00:06:25.180> for<00:06:25.780> the<00:06:26.260> Chi<00:06:26.440> of<00:06:26.470> the

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
color and the value for the Chi of the

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.170 
color and the value for the Chi of the
painting
