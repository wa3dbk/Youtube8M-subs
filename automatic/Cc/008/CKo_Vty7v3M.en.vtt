00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.200
 it's the effect I hope you go 

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:05.970
 well today we talk about each other 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.919
 hen i'm going to give you a few 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.500
 advice to take the train of 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.480
 hat on the one hand because the cold and 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.170
 the skin are not really the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.780
 best friends of the world 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.640
 they are in a chicane then it seems because 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.249
 that there for often and more dry so 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.910
 we see paintings of dead cells 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:25.859
 the skin is duller we are not sure 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.169
 but I have a few things to you 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.179
 ask for precisely take 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.220
 care of your skin we go there and it's 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.840
 stuff is pretty simple I think they 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.350
 are going to be very helpful and you have 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.900
 love 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.180
 so we start with the first thing 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.150
 maybe it would be if you 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.200
 can 2 to change your product 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.660
 daily moisturizer for 1 kg and a little 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.910
 richer in swimming literate so 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.070
 if you use a cream sense city 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.320
 green is precisely elected lotion 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.420
 moisturizing of a very fashion lotion 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.310
 maintain a richer triangle or 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.230
 even if you also have skin 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.300
 very very very very dry them 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.579
 good times perfect for you and 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.490
 anywhere the three etc are a little bit 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:12.149
 more moisturizing a good way he missed the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.520
 skin and create a kind of barrier seen 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.159
 that more innovation in the skin and the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.159
 cover my best protect from the cold 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.020
 so that's the 1st 2nd and 2nd small 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.420
 trick that would be as soon as heal his skin 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.359
 why are we shipping the skin like what 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.710
 it serves in the background you have an idea 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.759
 cells on the skin that are dying 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.520
 everyday 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.770
 do not worry and the skin in 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.259
 valuable for the tone elected but 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.409
 sometimes this principle is not enough 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.840
 slow so and then have the cells 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.389
 may appear the court y term on the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.009
 daughter of the prince appliances as you are 

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:50.039
 andrier like scales on the skin 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.560
 it's for their beauty is not great 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.659
 sexy so relationships is really 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.310
 the key to the problem 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.760
 it 's really going to take off all 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.340
 dead skin on the road 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.980
 at super sweet and I really like that 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.010
 it's a scrub of the trade with 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.930
 full of good acid for the skin or even 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.360
 sugar with coconut oil from 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.470
 sweet almond olive oil one of 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.820
 your choice 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.410
 the exfoliation is really running a 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.350
 pure evening with spurs always fun 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.660
 so that and according to your skin type of 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.640
 one to three times a week once so 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.740
 you have very dry skin and three 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.950
 once if you have skin crack hockey 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.390
 voice third thing that would be if he in 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.420
 need to make masks 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.340
 moisturizers for 10 minutes 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.780
 until all night if your skin is 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.910
 very dry and in need 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.980
 and it's masculine that we missed 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.560
 depth and he's going a lot more 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.060
 of a gratin kill your usual cream it 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.130
 a little with me I come I like 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.410
 much this the mask of home clarins 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.870
 who is really very very good and a 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.190
 mask at the number 7 also or even 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.720
 coconut oil applied 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.310
 directly on the skin and that directly in 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.590
 depth that is really very low 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.790
 a very good for the skin so either 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.870
 the masks it's really strong where 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.570
 is the sweater pays there his desires it's 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.830
 really very very toned 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.470
 that's it and even for those who have the 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.730
 oily skin may be useful as 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.220
 crossed a little less rich but 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.709
 anyway if we said the focus me 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.370
