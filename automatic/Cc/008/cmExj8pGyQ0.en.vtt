sort of have guessed it's supposed to go
in<00:02:48.270> here<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:49.320> little<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.890> know<00:02:49.920> um

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
in here in this little you know um

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.720 
in here in this little you know um
unsafe<00:02:51.990> cardboard<00:02:52.650> flap<00:02:52.860> think<00:02:53.280> that's<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
unsafe cardboard flap think that's the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.980 
unsafe cardboard flap think that's the
way<00:02:53.850> supposed<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.240> be<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.510> then<00:02:54.600> this<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:54.960> just

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
way supposed to be and then this is just

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.650 
way supposed to be and then this is just
wrapping<00:02:55.410> around<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.370> decided<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.330> put<00:02:57.480> in<00:02:57.570> a

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
wrapping around so I decided to put in a

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.140 
wrapping around so I decided to put in a
plastic<00:02:57.960> bag<00:02:58.170> just<00:02:58.470> keep<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.800> safe<00:02:59.150> because

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
plastic bag just keep it safe because

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.270 
plastic bag just keep it safe because
otherwise<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.960> just<00:03:00.990> fly<00:03:01.530> around<00:03:01.710> whenever

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
otherwise it just fly around whenever

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.320 
otherwise it just fly around whenever
you<00:03:02.490> move<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.850> box<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.440> moving<00:03:04.440> on<00:03:05.090> here<00:03:06.090> is

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
you move the box so moving on here is

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.560 
you move the box so moving on here is
something<00:03:06.630> which<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.740> need<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.430> mention<00:03:08.760> this

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.979 
is a paper sort of wrap around thing and
this<00:03:13.380> was<00:03:13.830> originally<00:03:15.200> glued<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.180> inside

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
this was originally glued to the inside

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:19.810 
this was originally glued to the inside
of<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.200> box

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
of the box

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.940 
of the box
you<00:03:20.820> had<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.150> glued<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.110> side<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.770> box

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.040 
you had it glued to the side of the box
here<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.520> to<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.150> side<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.570> Box<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:24.900> this

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
here and to the side of the Box on this

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.199 
here and to the side of the Box on this
side<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.560> that's<00:03:26.070> why<00:03:26.310> we<00:03:26.489> got<00:03:26.610> this<00:03:26.730> damaged

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
side and that's why we got this damaged

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.970 
side and that's why we got this damaged
because<00:03:27.540> this<00:03:27.750> was<00:03:27.930> really<00:03:28.230> hard<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.560> take<00:03:28.800> off

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
because this was really hard to take off

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.190 
because this was really hard to take off
and<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.880> know<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.239> just<00:03:30.270> a<00:03:30.570> loose<00:03:30.870> paper

this is obviously an old release so it

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.670

collector's booklet as well and notice

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:36.659 
collector's booklet as well and notice
that<00:05:35.320> this<00:05:35.500> pocket<00:05:35.860> is<00:05:36.159> actually<00:05:36.460> one<00:05:36.639> of

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
that this pocket is actually one of

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.969 
that this pocket is actually one of
those<00:05:36.820> you<00:05:37.000> know<00:05:37.060> entire<00:05:37.780> a<00:05:37.810> flap<00:05:38.199> thing<00:05:38.620> so

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
those you know entire a flap thing so

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.219 
those you know entire a flap thing so
it's<00:05:39.490> not<00:05:39.669> that<00:05:39.880> sort<00:05:40.060> of<00:05:40.090> annoying<00:05:40.360> 1/2<00:05:40.810> thing

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
it's not that sort of annoying 1/2 thing

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.290 
it's not that sort of annoying 1/2 thing
so<00:05:41.949> I<00:05:42.159> think<00:05:42.280> that<00:05:42.520> looks<00:05:42.699> really<00:05:42.880> a<00:05:43.150> lot

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
so I think that looks really a lot

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.250 
so I think that looks really a lot
better<00:05:43.570> than<00:05:43.840> the<00:05:43.960> usual<00:05:44.139> side<00:05:44.530> and<00:05:46.229> before<00:05:47.229> I

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
better than the usual side and before I

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.680 
better than the usual side and before I
go<00:05:47.530> can<00:05:47.860> just<00:05:48.099> give<00:05:48.610> a<00:05:48.639> quick<00:05:48.940> look<00:05:49.180> at<00:05:49.389> the

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
go can just give a quick look at the

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.640 
go can just give a quick look at the
other<00:05:50.500> part<00:05:51.370> of<00:05:51.400> the<00:05:51.610> box<00:05:51.880> as<00:05:52.300> you<00:05:52.720> can<00:05:52.750> tell<00:05:53.050> it

and<00:06:29.659> it<00:06:29.750> is<00:06:29.870> still<00:06:30.080> sticky<00:06:30.530> by<00:06:30.650> the<00:06:30.710> way<00:06:30.889> I

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:31.069 
and it is still sticky by the way I

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:33.159 
and it is still sticky by the way I
think<00:06:31.669> this<00:06:31.970> is<00:06:32.090> a<00:06:32.180> great<00:06:32.419> addition<00:06:32.690> of<00:06:32.930> King

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
think this is a great addition of King

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:37.050 
think this is a great addition of King
Kong<00:06:33.409> is<00:06:34.129> really<00:06:34.970> unique<00:06:35.330> and<00:06:35.599> definitely<00:06:36.590> has

the<00:06:38.060> watch<00:06:38.629> going<00:06:39.050> for<00:06:39.289> it<00:06:39.379> which<00:06:39.530> i<00:06:39.650> think<00:06:39.710> is

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
the watch going for it which i think is

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:42.249 
the watch going for it which i think is
probably<00:06:40.129> the<00:06:40.430> coolest<00:06:40.610> part<00:06:40.909> it<00:06:41.690> does<00:06:41.990> have

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:42.259 
probably the coolest part it does have

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:45.040 
probably the coolest part it does have
some<00:06:42.590> weird<00:06:42.979> minor<00:06:43.520> flaws<00:06:43.909> like<00:06:44.150> the<00:06:44.300> adhesive

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
some weird minor flaws like the adhesive

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.339 
some weird minor flaws like the adhesive
and<00:06:45.289> the<00:06:45.889> adhesive<00:06:46.220> on<00:06:46.580> the<00:06:46.750> front<00:06:47.750> cover<00:06:47.990> box

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:48.349 
and the adhesive on the front cover box

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:51.670 
and the adhesive on the front cover box
which<00:06:49.280> so<00:06:49.610> you<00:06:49.819> know<00:06:49.940> make<00:06:50.210> it<00:06:50.449> a<00:06:50.690> bit<00:06:51.199> more

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
which so you know make it a bit more

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.140 
which so you know make it a bit more
easily<00:06:51.949> damaged<00:06:52.370> than<00:06:52.580> you<00:06:52.729> would<00:06:52.909> have<00:06:53.000> hoped

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
easily damaged than you would have hoped

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.379 
easily damaged than you would have hoped
it<00:06:53.389> to<00:06:53.419> be<00:06:54.190> but<00:06:55.190> that's<00:06:55.340> it<00:06:55.550> for<00:06:55.580> me<00:06:55.819> today<00:06:56.120> and

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:56.389 
it to be but that's it for me today and

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.729 
it to be but that's it for me today and
I<00:06:57.289> guess<00:06:57.440> I'll<00:06:57.680> see<00:06:57.949> you<00:06:58.009> all<00:06:58.159> next<00:06:58.520> time
