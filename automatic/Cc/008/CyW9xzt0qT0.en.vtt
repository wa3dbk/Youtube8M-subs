uses 26 aq5 output tubes you can see
there<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.890> down<00:00:23.310> at<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.519> bottom<00:00:23.640> larger<00:00:24.449> tube

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
there and down at the bottom larger tube

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.339 
there and down at the bottom larger tube
is<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> 6x5<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.369> now<00:00:27.150> i<00:00:27.420> think<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.720> other<00:00:27.960> tubes

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
is a 6x5 and now i think the other tubes

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.589 
is a 6x5 and now i think the other tubes
are<00:00:28.560> they<00:00:28.710> think<00:00:28.859> there's<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.099> 71<00:00:29.670> 99<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.420> there

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
are they think there's a 71 99 and there

speed accuracy going on 78 just it's

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.330 
speed accuracy going on 78 just it's
just<00:00:53.309> slightly<00:00:53.820> off<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.390> 78<00:00:55.039> it's<00:00:56.039> got<00:00:56.190> this

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
just slightly off of 78 it's got this

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
screwdriver a decimal for speed I don't

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.830 
screwdriver a decimal for speed I don't
know<00:00:58.590> if<00:00:58.680> that's<00:00:58.859> how<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.280> was<00:00:59.430> originally<00:00:59.840> or

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
know if that's how it was originally or

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.389 
know if that's how it was originally or
if<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.140> originally<00:01:01.620> would<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:01.829> had<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> knob

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
if it originally would have had a knob

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.429 
if it originally would have had a knob
probably<00:01:03.000> what<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> had<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> knob<00:01:03.719> originally

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
probably what I had a knob originally

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.340 
probably what I had a knob originally
but<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.909> continuously<00:01:05.909> variable<00:01:06.420> all<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
but it's continuously variable all the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.630 
but it's continuously variable all the
