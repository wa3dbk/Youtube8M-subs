too<00:02:35.360> short<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.740> definitely<00:02:37.670> does<00:02:39.040> velcro

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
too short so it definitely does velcro

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.699

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.050 
I'm wearing skinny jeans right now but
since<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.080> buckle<00:03:39.380> is<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.500> little<00:03:39.830> short<00:03:40.250> when

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
since the buckle is a little short when

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.780 
since the buckle is a little short when
I<00:03:41.120> put<00:03:41.299> them<00:03:41.420> on<00:03:41.510> they<00:03:42.200> work<00:03:42.440> better<00:03:42.799> if<00:03:43.670> I

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
I put them on they work better if I

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.210 
I put them on they work better if I
don't<00:03:43.970> tuck<00:03:44.150> them<00:03:44.269> in<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:44.810> I<00:03:45.140> saw<00:03:45.799> pictures<00:03:45.950> of

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
don't tuck them in so I saw pictures of

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.960 
don't tuck them in so I saw pictures of
like<00:03:46.760> models<00:03:47.269> wearing<00:03:47.480> them<00:03:47.720> for<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.890> ads<00:03:49.489> and

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
like models wearing them for the ads and

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.850 
like models wearing them for the ads and
it<00:03:50.900> looks<00:03:51.049> like<00:03:51.110> they're<00:03:51.320> just<00:03:51.470> rolling<00:03:51.709> their

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
it looks like they're just rolling their

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.130 
it looks like they're just rolling their
pants<00:03:52.130> up<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:52.489> i<00:03:52.670> will<00:03:53.299> probably<00:03:53.540> just<00:03:53.930> end<00:03:54.049> up

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
pants up so i will probably just end up

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.410 
pants up so i will probably just end up
doing<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:54.650> but<00:03:55.489> hopefully<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:56.090> guys<00:03:56.239> can
