00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.160
 I had already tasted it in Paris 2014 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.809
 these 90 included on info tainment that 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.400
 then it was in demo version when you 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.650
 loves almost final version because 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.460
 November will also be compatible 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.230
 with google auto and ios car play already 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.330
 still interesting photons with a 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.090
 display from us then diagonal is a 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.480
 really interesting touch system for 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.699
 the most nerds will remember that of the new note 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.800
 n 1 because there is a lattice of rays 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:37.079
 infrared reading our finger but the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.370
 nice thing is that you don't surf on 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.160
 ancient ritual but can be navigated with 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.109
 any object although not a 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.170
 resistive display so no need 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.269
 to press a lot to print commands 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.820
 there is a key that allows you to return 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.559
 on the home page there are three sections 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.659
 main ones that are fixed 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.609
 the navigation section with 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.620
 the passions of the break destination 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:02.010
 mute repeat etcetera with the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.770
 company also to maximize the display 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.500
 then there is the media section 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.060
 we can choose between ipod if it comes 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.810
 connected and miss is connected via 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.570
 usb socket that put in the armrest maybe 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.700
 I'll show you here with Ing 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.950
 auxiliary process to which to connect any 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.110
 analogical source 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.450
 we have the audio broadcasting and 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.250
 obviously you see bluetooth here 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.930
 the third section, the one related to 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.450
 phone where we have recent contacts 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.430
 keypad and the ability to peel between 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.350
 over too much and the other is the last 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.810
 section that can be modified through 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.480
 settings we have enabled here 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.820
 drivers' performance therefore 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.680
 how much we are consuming in this 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.020
 moment on the left we have the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.420
 split adjustment then left 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.690
 for the right passenger driver of the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.240
 temperature possibility to adjust the 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.180
 seat heating air conditioning 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.410
 and steering wheel and to activate the automatism 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.210
 as regards always the 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.350
 connotation pulling from above then 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.970
 very comfortable even when you are 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.580
 driving the possibilities of both 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.350
 there are really settings 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.300
 lots 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.770
 see here all the relative positions 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.120
 to the system now language in others la 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.310
 keyboard voice commands among others 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.660
 excellent voice commands 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.080
 there is a hard drive then the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.180
 ability to save songs up 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.790
 hard drive possibility of 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.790
 remote update because this 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.420
 car can also be equipped with one 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.069
 internal sim card here you can go to 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.220
 balance our audio among other things 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.319
 version of audio to wilkins bowers with 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.870
 lots of speakers really sound 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.560
 very very good here other settings 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.319
 related to always the car you see 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.690
 how many are obviously settings 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.790
 which are used once only 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.880
 the parking assistant that allows 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.850
 to park the car automatically 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.739
 360 degree camera you see how 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.459
 is also displayed in a manner 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.080
 defined the whole area around the 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.340
 camera I came out to but it's not there 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.380
 problem we do so that we return 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.410
 in the settings related settings 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.780
 to the navigator but it goes path 3d and 2d 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.260
 north up of all the various 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.880
 settings such as settings of 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.540
 radio of digital audio broadcasting of 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.870
 gracenote that that online database that 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.160
 allows us if we connect a source 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.040
 digital to see the cover 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.390
 of the album and also to have the title 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.549
 of the album even though it is not memorized 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.739
 maybe the mp3 track if we go in 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.590
 communication if you connect to the phone 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.510
 see you can go to define the 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.280
 notification of messages I'm trying a 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.100
 s6 android and I must say that the messages 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.380
 they are read automatically but if there 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.470
 were a sim integrated into the car I could 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.750
 activate the car's wifi spot then 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.450
 use the syndrome accra to do 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.120
 browse eccentric three cell phones 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.120
 central otherwise you can use the 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.700
 our smartphone as an access point for 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.100
 for the car we go back to which one 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.670
 settings related to 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.040
 air conditioning 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.630
 if we want to automate all the 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.420
 commands we've seen before and here 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.220
 always many on the system 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.330
 settings back to the home 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.820
 with this key 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.100
 making a swipe to the right all the 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.140
 functions related to the aid vehicle 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.000
 at the comfortable driving have them all here in one 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.830
 unique in a single panel without having 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.710
 many pockets scattered throughout the 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.320
 we have so many cars 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.730
 spoken in the test drive while 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.340
 on the other hand we have the possibility 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.990
 to update the applications of 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.810
 add the new ones when in fact 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.910
 these powers November 20 will come 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.220
 updated the new release is below 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.170
 to define this this part of the 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.960
 let 's say about the initial screen vi 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:54.230
 I put this interface because 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.570
 One moment I wanted you to hear the 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.110
 audio quality ok 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.110
 we light 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.380
 now I don't think the microphone of 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.720
 camera managed to capture the 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.030
 dark two shades of music but there 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.590
 they are ad hoc calibrations for this 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.150
 car and really feels great at 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.450
 maximum does not distort absolutely 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.610
 in front of my eyes a huge lcd 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.680
 which obviously reproduces the tachometer 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.940
 speedometer all information 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.889
 obviously available instead of here 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.720
 now we are not yet central 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.630
 but if we were on the march we would open the 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.130
 navigator screen with the key 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.150
 right we can activate the commands 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.100
 vowels as I said before 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.350
 much more active very intelligent 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.830
 while with the keys here on the left 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.600
 we can activate the relative mode 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.160
 to cruise control 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.200
 this is not meant to be a video 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.110
 exhaustive of these xc90 we will do another 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:08.419
 video in November at the end of the year when it will be 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:10.880
 updated system for google play apple 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:15.070
 car play and we also promised 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.070
 windows then goodbye
