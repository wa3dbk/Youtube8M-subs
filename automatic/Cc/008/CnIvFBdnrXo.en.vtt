00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.470
 here are the Indians 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.209
 and at that point is who we are three miles 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.130
 out of their reserve and you want 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.160
 counterattack and as soon as i arrive 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.240
 reinforcements violated the treaty 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.130
 agree but these Indians usually 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.270
 they are very peaceful if they have you 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.210
 attacked I think they had to be 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.890
 drunk drunk but how can you tell 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.930
 for some time and suspect that some 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.400
 criminal sells spirits to Indians e 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:38.500
 maybe I also imagine where theirs is 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.879
 finished deposit can tell me if 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.379
 these are not full of quality era 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.699
 easy to imagine this old woman 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.140
 mine and just a stone's throw from the 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.410
 Indian territory a hideout 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.410
 sure 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.890
 but which are the channels have gone up 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:01:02.200
 from the aide they discovered everything 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:04.170
 here he is, they caught us 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.710
 begins the dance is certainly not cheerful 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.800
 sheriff 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.930
 look what dynamite is there 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.180
 this is the time we all jump to 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.250
 less than if you do their too much 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.890
 long but this time you will make the end of 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.100
 mouse we will come out alive to put on the rope 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.100
 to the neck 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.319
 look at the throw in there is one who 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.319
 try to get by 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.100
 all the shores then I guessed the 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.509
 dose of dynamite 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.130
 if I had used all that is there 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.439
 in the mine at this time of you not 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.090
 there would not even be a sheriff finger left 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.009
 this time it went well 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.100

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.090
