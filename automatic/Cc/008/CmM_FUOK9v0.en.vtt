00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.430
 hi friends from youtube I am your friend 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.370
 of bed dry almost as they went up 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.360
 show how aloe aloe is prepared 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.580
 will see in the regeneration of our 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.630
 speciation guppies veins of those who 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.090
 usually we fight we are 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.890
 they mistreat their fins between them and good 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.130
 This is a very easy and simple method 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.900
 to prepare the aloe for who to 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.900
 those who do not know it is aloe 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.760
 because we are going to use here is everything 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.540
 what is inside that is the aloe vera that 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.030
 is the pulp of aloe vera 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.020
 you can help with a razor like this 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.340
 to use a knife after taking out 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.340
 the pulp is going to be this 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.780
 we 're going to grind this, then add a 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.780
 little bit of water 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.350
 and this we are going to grind for 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.100
 they supplied our aquariums 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.310
 I will use 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.390
 this artifact that is like an arm 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.390
 robotic for grinding 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.330
 it sounds a lot better because I study here 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.250
 by 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.440
 For now I blender that 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.980
 I have equipment and I 'm not going broke 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.980
 but good 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.080
 they grind it 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.050
 they will not move very well to everything be here 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.340
 I got a lot of foam 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:54.250
 but it's going to stay like that something 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.700
 they are going to sit down it is going to be like 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.799
 liquid so very slight as well as aloe vera 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.320
 they will supply it to their aquariums 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.140
 ones that seem to depend on what is 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.180
 now yes that the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.149
 in proportion to their to the liters that 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.930
 he has his aquarium 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.989
 about 10 English if it's for example from 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.329
 about 10 liters can be put about 5 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.340
 milliliters of aloe so they can 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.340
 regenerate your fins of your fish 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.010
 and well basically that's what you do if 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.379
 they want they can strain it too 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.079
 and well do not despair if they say no 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.450
 is that I do not regenerate the fins of 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.860
 my fish is something a bit slow 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.489
 depending on the food that 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.170
 they have their fish the amount of aloe 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.299
 that they put on it they are going activities 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.569
 he does it like that water a little 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.189
 rosita but it is normal is for aloe 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.180
 and well, this is what they want 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:55.269
 teach today 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.450
