00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.210
 to ask me whether to die to welcome them 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.929
 yes it would take a miracle 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.769
 should we put fertilizer on it yes 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.909
 question c 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.419
 how 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:19.619
 and in what quantity 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.619
 and apart from that I propose you what to keep with me 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.819
 all we can do 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.359
 agriculture that will pay active 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.810
 she grows every year 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.470
 develops flowers 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.470
 raw products 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.490
 it needs to be supported 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.490
 by mineral and organic elements in fertilizers 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.960
 there are three essential nutrients in fertilizer 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.960
 that we know well under the thermal baths 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.980
 that allows growth 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.310
 phosphoric acid 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.310
 if and rooting 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.560
 and potassium 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.010
 he will support the bloom 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 and will allow fruiting 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.370
 it is the food of the plant 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.740
 English in pellets and the most practiced the most visible but in great 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.180
 area 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.180
 they go once a month from March to October 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.510
 for the time being in line with the foliage 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.530
 they did not plan to find 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.150
 above the foliage 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.120
 that I locate all these little roots that will absorb the materials 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.120
 organic and mineral 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.169
 three years to get to know each other or to maintenance 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.389
 to succeed
