00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.540 
this and you want to get it up quite
small<00:00:23.300> so<00:00:24.939> this<00:00:25.939> is<00:00:26.060> what<00:00:26.710> how<00:00:27.710> I<00:00:27.740> do<00:00:28.099> it<00:00:28.250> and

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
small so this is what how I do it and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.400 
small so this is what how I do it and
it's<00:00:29.179> literally<00:00:29.509> very<00:00:29.810> similar<00:00:30.170> to<00:00:30.320> the

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
it's literally very similar to the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.549 
it's literally very similar to the
nettle<00:00:30.710> tea

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
nettle tea

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.960 
nettle tea
this<00:00:33.559> can<00:00:33.830> be<00:00:34.010> dipped<00:00:34.250> below<00:00:34.430> what<00:00:34.640> is<00:00:34.730> better

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
this can be dipped below what is better

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.189 
this can be dipped below what is better
than<00:00:35.089> if<00:00:35.180> you<00:00:35.210> get<00:00:35.420> it<00:00:35.540> before<00:00:35.600> your<00:00:35.870> flowers

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
than if you get it before your flowers

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:37.450 
than if you get it before your flowers
because<00:00:36.470> it<00:00:36.559> haven't<00:00:36.769> used<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:36.980> energy<00:00:37.100> to

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
because it haven't used the energy to

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.170 
because it haven't used the energy to
flower<00:00:38.019> but<00:00:39.159> it's<00:00:40.159> still<00:00:40.430> okay<00:00:40.699> to<00:00:40.760> use<00:00:40.970> as<00:00:41.150> a

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
flower but it's still okay to use as a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.660 
flower but it's still okay to use as a
fertilizer<00:00:41.920> and<00:00:42.920> we're<00:00:43.040> gonna<00:00:43.129> make<00:00:43.309> a<00:00:43.370> big
