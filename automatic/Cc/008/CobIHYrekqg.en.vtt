 Hello. 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.560
 Today I will show how to fix the problem with the steering position sensor. 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.540
 First, remove all the screws on the back of the steering wheel housing. 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.920
 Then unscrew the steering wheel with a hex key. 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.560
 After that, carefully remove it there will be wires from the chip on the steering wheel. Disconnect them 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.480
 Next, unscrew the 3 screws fastening the stalk petals 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.560
 Remove the cover by unscrewing the steering clamp clamps make sure that you unscrew all the screws on the bottom panel !!! 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.440
 Then unscrew the screws on the large chip and on the Z-shaped piece of iron under it. Carefully pull out the piece of iron. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.800
 Raise the unit with the motors. We need a motor with a black cover 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:54.160
 It is necessary to remove the center wire. Pliers or similar tool will work best. 

00:00:55.875 --> 00:01:09.155
 Then you need to carefully remove the cover from the motor. Without damaging the elements of the chip as well as the wheel responsible for calibration. 

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:13.113
 And here it is: (( 

00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:20.101
 Then unscrew the small board to get to the main mount. 

00:01:20.184 --> 00:01:25.784
 remove it carefully on it are located photodiodes responsible for steering calibration 

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:27.635
 Tighten all screws on all fasteners. 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.260
 With a thin glue, I glued the calibration wheel. 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.040
 Do not fill the slots carefully, otherwise the steering operation is not guaranteed !!! 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.600
 Checking the steering wheel tightly holding hands 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.000
 The wheel should be calibrated and stand straight. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:05.280
 But you must hold it tightly with your hands, otherwise it will not be calibrated and it will jerk infinitely make sure that the strip with the comb rests in its place is important !!! 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.509
 Next, collect the steering wheel in reverse order. 

00:02:14.594 --> 00:02:26.034
 Screw the wheel :)) 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.240
 Now almost .............. 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.000
 Aesthetically laid wiring on the back of the steering box :)) 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.880
 Turn on the power to the outlet and connect the steering wheel via USB 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.480
 Done!
