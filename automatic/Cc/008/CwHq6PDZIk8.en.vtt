00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the next octave nohup um then you would

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.250 
the next octave nohup um then you would
need<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:10.710> tremolo<00:01:11.659> tremolo<00:01:12.659> pedal<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.080> some

time<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.619> made<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.070> where<00:01:14.460> you're<00:01:15.119> after

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
time that made it where you're after

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.649 
time that made it where you're after
this<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.920> then<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.130> distortion<00:01:20.670> pedal<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.270> I

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
this and then a distortion pedal and I

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.890 
this and then a distortion pedal and I
think<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:22.020> probably<00:01:22.530> about<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.280> um<00:01:25.189> so

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900

think that's probably about it um so

you<00:03:11.380> just<00:03:11.590> go<00:03:19.140> really<00:03:20.140> just<00:03:21.070> let<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.520> ring<00:03:21.670> out

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
you just go really just let it ring out

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.300 
you just go really just let it ring out
or<00:03:21.880> whatever<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.709> then<00:03:23.920> I<00:03:25.890> think<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.190> goes

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
or whatever and then I think it goes

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.980 
or whatever and then I think it goes
back<00:03:27.520> in<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.850> verse<00:03:28.030> again<00:03:28.240> and<00:03:28.690> then<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:28.870> go

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
back in the verse again and then you go

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.030 
back in the verse again and then you go
do<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:30.480> chorus<00:03:31.480> yet<00:03:32.230> again<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.500> second<00:03:32.770> chorus

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
do a a chorus yet again a second chorus

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.960 
do a a chorus yet again a second chorus
and<00:03:33.400> then<00:03:33.820> you<00:03:33.970> get<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.900> solo<00:03:35.560> section

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
and then you get to the solo section

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.280 
and then you get to the solo section
which<00:03:36.970> is<00:03:37.150> where<00:03:37.360> you<00:03:37.390> need<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.840> octave<00:03:38.140> pedal

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
which is where you need the octave pedal

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.380 
which is where you need the octave pedal
which<00:03:38.709> I<00:03:38.830> don't<00:03:38.890> have<00:03:39.070> but<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.030> would<00:03:40.150> turn

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
which I don't have but you would turn

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.250 
which I don't have but you would turn
your<00:03:40.420> trim<00:03:40.959> level<00:03:41.140> off<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.930> train<00:03:44.170> your

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
your trim level off you train your

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.320 
your trim level off you train your
tumble<00:03:44.530> off<00:03:44.740> keep<00:03:45.400> your<00:03:45.490> distortion<00:03:45.910> on<00:03:48.330> turn

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
tumble off keep your distortion on turn

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.699 
tumble off keep your distortion on turn
on<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.510> octave<00:03:49.810> pedal<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.230> then<00:03:50.350> have<00:03:50.590> your

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
on the octave pedal and then have your

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.580 
on the octave pedal and then have your
wall<00:03:50.980> ready<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:52.690> kind<00:03:52.959> of<00:03:52.990> have<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.170> just

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
wall ready and you kind of have to just

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:08.860 
wall ready and you kind of have to just
feel<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.520> wah

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.550 

that's<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.959> first<00:04:10.170> part<00:04:10.349> of<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:10.469> sale<00:04:10.620> of<00:04:10.650> um

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
that's the first part of the sale of um

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:27.589 
that's the first part of the sale of um
again<00:04:13.560> that's<00:04:20.989> so<00:04:22.580> on<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.699> g<00:04:23.880> string<00:04:23.960> 12<00:04:25.340> 14<00:04:26.599> 15

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
again that's so on the g string 12 14 15

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:34.879 
again that's so on the g string 12 14 15
on<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:28.770> then<00:04:29.090> 15<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:32.340> 13<00:04:32.880> on<00:04:33.000> B<00:04:33.770> and<00:04:34.770> then

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
on the and then 15 and 13 on B and then

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:42.560 
on the and then 15 and 13 on B and then
back<00:04:35.130> down<00:04:37.130> then<00:04:38.130> you<00:04:38.340> do<00:04:38.520> 12<00:04:39.349> 14<00:04:41.330> down<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:42.479> the

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
back down then you do 12 14 down to the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
10 on the g string then you do then get

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:53.089 
10 on the g string then you do then get
15<00:04:47.250> here<00:04:49.009> 50<00:04:50.009> on<00:04:50.039> the<00:04:50.190> g<00:04:50.310> string<00:04:51.320> good<00:04:52.320> 17<00:04:52.860> and

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
15 here 50 on the g string good 17 and

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:57.830 
15 here 50 on the g string good 17 and
then<00:04:53.520> 18<00:04:54.360> 20<00:04:55.280> on<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.340> beast<00:04:56.729> on<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:57.090> on<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:57.449> B

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
then 18 20 on the beast on the on the B

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.189 
then 18 20 on the beast on the on the B
string<00:04:58.160> and<00:04:59.160> that's<00:04:59.340> it<00:04:59.940> for<00:05:00.780> that<00:05:00.810> first

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
string and that's it for that first

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.140 
string and that's it for that first
section<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:01.740> then<00:05:02.460> this<00:05:02.729> is<00:05:02.880> where<00:05:02.970> the

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
section and then this is where the

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:11.360 
section and then this is where the
octave<00:05:03.449> would<00:05:03.630> turn<00:05:04.050> on<00:05:04.220> where<00:05:05.220> you<00:05:05.340> go<00:05:10.370> that's

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
octave would turn on where you go that's

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:19.730 
octave would turn on where you go that's
what<00:05:11.520> it<00:05:11.550> sound<00:05:11.820> like<00:05:11.849> with<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.210> octave<00:05:18.740> like

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
what it sound like with the octave like

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.290 
what it sound like with the octave like
on<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:19.919> last<00:05:20.099> video<00:05:20.250> you<00:05:20.430> why<00:05:20.849> into

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
on the last video you why into

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.339 
on the last video you why into
everything<00:05:23.240> but<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.360> notes<00:05:24.509> you<00:05:24.599> be<00:05:24.750> playing

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
everything but the notes you be playing

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:30.800 
everything but the notes you be playing
with<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:25.710> octave<00:05:26.039> that<00:05:26.849> it<00:05:26.940> would<00:05:27.030> be<00:05:27.590> 5th<00:05:29.810> 15

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
with the octave that it would be 5th 15

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.980 
with the octave that it would be 5th 15
14<00:05:31.710> on<00:05:32.220> the<00:05:32.490> g<00:05:32.970> string<00:05:33.199> and<00:05:34.199> 15<00:05:35.070> 12<00:05:35.580> on<00:05:36.509> the<00:05:36.690> D

14 on the g string and 15 12 on the D
string

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.120 

some<00:05:41.150> are<00:05:41.330> number<00:05:41.780> of<00:05:41.840> times<00:05:42.080> and<00:05:42.920> then<00:05:43.040> you

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
some are number of times and then you

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:51.700 
some are number of times and then you
get<00:05:43.340> to<00:05:49.810> which<00:05:50.810> you<00:05:50.930> might<00:05:51.080> need<00:05:51.230> a<00:05:51.290> whammy<00:05:51.560> bar

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
get to which you might need a whammy bar

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.930 
get to which you might need a whammy bar
for<00:05:51.920> that<00:05:52.070> I'm<00:05:52.760> not<00:05:53.000> sure<00:05:53.080> most<00:05:54.080> likely<00:05:54.940> which

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
for that I'm not sure most likely which

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.920 
for that I'm not sure most likely which
and<00:05:56.420> that<00:05:56.570> whole<00:05:56.780> little<00:05:57.080> doohickey<00:05:57.950> there<00:05:58.130> is

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
and that whole little doohickey there is

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.960 
and that whole little doohickey there is
12<00:06:00.340> 14<00:06:01.630> 15<00:06:02.630> on<00:06:03.260> the<00:06:03.500> D<00:06:03.650> string<00:06:03.680> and<00:06:04.070> then<00:06:04.160> 12<00:06:04.550> 14

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
12 14 15 on the D string and then 12 14

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:12.360 
12 14 15 on the D string and then 12 14
15<00:06:05.920> on<00:06:06.920> the<00:06:07.340> g<00:06:08.270> string<00:06:08.300> and<00:06:08.570> they<00:06:08.750> need<00:06:08.900> just

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.560 

until<00:06:13.370> it<00:06:13.430> feels<00:06:13.520> good<00:06:13.790> and<00:06:14.030> then<00:06:16.390> then<00:06:17.390> the

until it feels good and then then the

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:23.820 
until it feels good and then then the
song<00:06:17.810> goes<00:06:18.110> into<00:06:18.740> ah<00:06:22.030> then<00:06:23.030> it<00:06:23.060> goes<00:06:23.300> into<00:06:23.330> this

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
song goes into ah then it goes into this

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
song goes into ah then it goes into this
like<00:06:24.830> I<00:06:25.220> guess<00:06:26.800> kind<00:06:27.800> of<00:06:27.860> like<00:06:27.980> a<00:06:28.010> second

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:52.850 
that whole thing and then then there's

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:59.260 
that whole thing and then then there's
power<00:06:53.120> just<00:06:56.950> where<00:06:57.950> you<00:06:58.100> build<00:06:58.280> up<00:06:58.460> with<00:06:58.760> B

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
power just where you build up with B

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.340 
power just where you build up with B
flat<00:06:59.570> at<00:07:00.140> least<00:07:00.290> I<00:07:00.380> think<00:07:00.530> of<00:07:00.680> B<00:07:00.830> flat<00:07:02.350> that's

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.350 
flat at least I think of B flat that's

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:14.080 
flat at least I think of B flat that's
when<00:07:03.500> you<00:07:03.560> have<00:07:03.680> this<00:07:03.800> torsion<00:07:04.280> back<00:07:04.400> on<00:07:13.090> take

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:14.090 
when you have this torsion back on take

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.530 
when you have this torsion back on take
back<00:07:14.330> in<00:07:14.510> the<00:07:14.660> course<00:07:14.870> and<00:07:15.580> then<00:07:16.580> I<00:07:16.610> think

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:17.540 
back in the course and then I think

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.850 
back in the course and then I think
that's<00:07:17.690> pretty<00:07:17.810> much<00:07:17.960> it<00:07:18.020> them<00:07:18.290> i<00:07:18.410> think<00:07:18.740> there

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
that's pretty much it them i think there

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.800 
that's pretty much it them i think there
might<00:07:19.010> be<00:07:19.070> another<00:07:19.370> verse<00:07:19.700> i<00:07:20.030> can't<00:07:20.660> remember

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:20.810 
might be another verse i can't remember

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.640 
might be another verse i can't remember
i<00:07:20.990> don't<00:07:21.200> think<00:07:21.350> there<00:07:21.530> is<00:07:23.170> no<00:07:24.170> there<00:07:24.350> isn't

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.650 
i don't think there is no there isn't

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.710 
i don't think there is no there isn't
after<00:07:25.160> that<00:07:25.490> you<00:07:25.760> display<00:07:26.060> the<00:07:26.090> chorus<00:07:26.450> ahmad

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 
after that you display the chorus ahmad

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.350 
after that you display the chorus ahmad
number<00:07:26.990> of<00:07:27.080> times<00:07:27.290> and<00:07:27.530> that's<00:07:28.130> it<00:07:28.370> well

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 
number of times and that's it well

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.170 
number of times and that's it well
thanks<00:07:30.020> for<00:07:30.050> watching
