I'm going to also make another card when
I<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> resources<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:24.270> make<00:01:24.450> this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
I get to the resources to make this

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.980 
I get to the resources to make this
combo<00:01:24.930> even<00:01:25.140> stronger<00:01:26.000> so<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.390> think<00:01:27.630> taupe

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
combo even stronger so I think taupe

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.359 
combo even stronger so I think taupe
string<00:01:28.229> has<00:01:28.350> got<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> lot<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.710> potential<00:01:29.070> for

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
string has got a lot of potential for

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.640 
string has got a lot of potential for
the<00:01:29.460> planet<00:01:29.729> guys<00:01:29.880> next<00:01:30.869> up<00:01:30.990> we've<00:01:31.110> got<00:01:31.140> Pablo

the planet guys next up we've got Pablo

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.590 
the planet guys next up we've got Pablo
who's<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> one-star<00:01:32.880> creature<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> planet
