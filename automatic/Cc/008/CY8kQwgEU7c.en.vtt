 under the protocol that the 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.730

 the front and all the 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.350
 accessories are white iker because it is a 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.359
 tail suit and is the suit by 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.850
 excellence is very happy of the gala 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.859
 nocturnal now fine if the boyfriend lightly 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.309
 in this type of costumes not necessarily 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:38.040
 the rest of the striker must come from the 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.570
 same way there are combinations 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.670
 there are adjustments in the problem which 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.059
 we can locate the rest of the members 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.200
 with similar combinations more than the same 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.200
 giving authenticity 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.730
 this model 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.890
 then we have the Levite childbirth as well as 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.359
 we have the evening coat 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.399
 this would be of gala of crisis now well 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.030
 true I do not even find you in 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:07.030
 their wedding 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.030
 of two shifts we can use the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.250
 black pants I remember this costume is a 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.080
 moment used for work that does not 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.229
 exceed the average synchro 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.880
 the afternoon and it is characterized as already 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.040
 I said by the type of pants and with the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.990
 Accessories that are totally toned 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.300
 clear this concept in this increase of 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.510
 a red accessory that gives you nothing 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.090
 the essence of the day 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.220
 then we have the mill that would be 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.200
 in a failure but really what 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.880
 we know with the black tie and the sashes 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.189
 black back 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.340
 After commonly used for any 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:48.460
 gala event I remember and it can be 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.100
 combined with the star do not leave 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.659
 trunk and only heal like the ones that then 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.240
 we have this type of suits is here 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.369
 which is a fusion between the neck of the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.399
 liquid liquid and the tail of the frock coat 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.130
 it's called levita more where it closes with 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:07.530
 three buttons on the front 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:11.140
 Lift the flap to the neck leaving it on 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.300
 a much shorter school 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.819
 the previous two while 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.310
 tufts that kind of suit a suit 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.440
 pretty modern 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.720
 It is used for people of not much 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.160
 stature and want to use bold is 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.560
 say for people who are low 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.760
 stature can use a tail being 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.760
