00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:53.170 

slide<00:00:45.790> it<00:00:45.940> back<00:00:45.969> in<00:00:46.420> lock<00:00:47.230> it<00:00:47.379> into<00:00:47.530> position

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.060 

now<00:00:53.720> you're<00:00:53.930> ready<00:00:54.110> to<00:00:54.260> put<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.530> lens<00:00:54.740> rings

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
now you're ready to put the lens rings

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.280 
now you're ready to put the lens rings
on<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.640> lens<00:00:55.880> rings<00:00:56.300> are<00:00:56.600> really<00:00:56.780> just<00:00:57.200> very

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
on the lens rings are really just very

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.270 
on the lens rings are really just very
large<00:00:57.890> zip<00:00:58.550> ties<00:00:59.290> so<00:01:00.290> they<00:01:00.410> lock<00:01:00.710> around<00:01:00.890> the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
large zip ties so they lock around the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.150 
large zip ties so they lock around the
lens<00:01:01.640> but<00:01:02.300> these<00:01:02.540> zip<00:01:02.810> ties<00:01:02.840> actually<00:01:03.800> can<00:01:04.040> be

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
lens but these zip ties actually can be

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.610 
lens but these zip ties actually can be
undone<00:01:04.580> and<00:01:04.940> removed<00:01:05.300> and<00:01:05.570> done<00:01:05.720> again<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:06.530> you

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
undone and removed and done again so you

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.410 
undone and removed and done again so you
can<00:01:06.770> put<00:01:06.980> it<00:01:07.070> on<00:01:07.190> all<00:01:07.460> different<00:01:07.820> lenses<00:01:08.180> if

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
can put it on all different lenses if

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.990 
can put it on all different lenses if
you're<00:01:08.600> gonna<00:01:08.690> use<00:01:08.870> it<00:01:09.080> just<00:01:09.170> on<00:01:09.380> one<00:01:09.650> camera

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
you're gonna use it just on one camera

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.670 
you're gonna use it just on one camera
you<00:01:11.000> can<00:01:11.150> actually<00:01:11.330> cut<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.990> ends<00:01:12.230> of<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.470> zip

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
you can actually cut the ends of the zip

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.070 
you can actually cut the ends of the zip
ties<00:01:12.890> off<00:01:13.300> you're<00:01:14.300> gonna<00:01:14.390> use<00:01:14.600> it<00:01:14.750> on<00:01:14.810> multiple

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
ties off you're gonna use it on multiple

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.110 
ties off you're gonna use it on multiple
cameras<00:01:15.770> then<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:16.280> may<00:01:16.490> want<00:01:16.700> to<00:01:16.760> leave<00:01:16.910> them

tight so you'll lock them in place if I
pull<00:01:22.280> them<00:01:22.370> in<00:01:22.520> tight<00:01:22.760> you<00:01:23.090> can<00:01:23.270> still<00:01:23.540> even

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
pull them in tight you can still even

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.450 
pull them in tight you can still even
though<00:01:24.080> they<00:01:24.260> won't<00:01:24.440> slide<00:01:24.800> around<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.220> lens

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
though they won't slide around the lens

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
each motor is spring-loaded so you want

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.539 
each motor is spring-loaded so you want
to<00:01:46.600> load<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.080> springs<00:01:47.530> as<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:48.010> mount<00:01:48.220> it<00:01:48.430> in
