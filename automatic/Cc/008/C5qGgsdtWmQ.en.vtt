00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.410
 respond because it is of course one 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.960
 Monday 8:00 AM and that means only 1 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.420
 thing and new reaction video yes 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.460
 people previous episode 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.400
 holy your drawers overreactions 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.090
 left behind and so many bad ones 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.070
 jokes 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.080
 I have read them all and I have 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.400
 can laugh at my bad eyes 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.410
 jokes really true 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.359
 this was really crying but yes 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.740
 at least the moon of dressing sauce me 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.510
 think it's great for all of you 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.660
 leave comments because because of that 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.149
 I of course your reactions to which I am 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.070
 can rule yes it is that simple l'avenir 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.360
 case just to the very first 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.910
 response 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.980
 you brush your teeth no of course brush 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.270
 i never got my teeth this is for one 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.890
 whole non rhetorical question really where me 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.629
 must of course my teeth i even have 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.829
 an electric toothbrush now 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.829
 totally hip hi 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.149
 there is one between the numbers 0 and 1 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.159
 infinite numbers between the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.580
 numbers 0 and 2 they more infinitely many 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.920
 numbers 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.299
 what is your opinion on this well i have 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.920
 anyway not really an opinion on it and me 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.570
 don't think you can have that because 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.310
 something scientific is what 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.290
 actually not even proved it 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.030
 infinity but I find it quite 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.710
 interesting to think about why 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.150
 threw half a math lesson 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.759
 tender because that is my opinion 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.590
 math teacher also fun to do 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.170
 and of course all of those things 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.210
 with infinity with the number infinity and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.740
 thought it was interesting yes and then had 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.270
 who told this also from another one 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.060
 have very little for number but yes 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.850
 between 0 and 2 you have more infinite 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.770
 languages ​​or what about what is infinite then 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.270
 so think weird wavy hair 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.829
 because yes you have infinity 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.520
 but he will come a piece we also 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.070
 so on finite is infinite 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.100
 become big but it doesn't stop thinking 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.350
 I aving nicely said what is 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.210
 epic music at 5 minutes 19 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.210
 to be souls what this music means 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.420
 ok sorry no but just a serious answer 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.440
 I have had a website for a short time 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.870
 found it 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.620
 and therefore you really fucking much like 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.840
 the music 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.129
 yes I have a link every time in the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.659
 description 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.540
 And yes, just look at it 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.579
 and then yes you know I have 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.860
 just always use the music or 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.659
 I almost always have to say into the music 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.340
 the description or the link to 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.659
 the website where you got the music from 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.950
 you can do a lot more in the 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.860
 description I think 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.290
 people think and yes so it is with this 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.790
 also so beautiful and so watch the music 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.530
 description is from youtube 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.540
 probably has looks then again 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.379
 put I can do that of course myself 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.579
 Open 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.579
 david young rendon 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.510
 do you believe in flying fish i believe 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.000
 flying fish certainly know why 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.720
 because they actually exist 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.720
 see some images here 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.060
 Bobino are flying fish 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.709
 I mean they really don't exist 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.329
 idea what the use of those animals is 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.310
 still exist 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.419
 hey melvin how did you always deal with one 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.040
 key w 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:21.650
 I also have a very simple one 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.599
 step-by-step plan for step 1 says two weeks 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.579
 in advance against a couple of okay we 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.190
 go slow sure we start that 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.290
 test week step 2 you think of five days 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.599
 start in advance also at the end 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.370
 step three roll as almost on a later 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.139
 At least they went with me whole 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.060
 often not with all subjects but with the 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.590
 most courses was already from oh yes now must 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.840
 still do that and give up if everything is one 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.180
 slightly raised and maybe not quite 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.190
 very nice but hey I made it with 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.780
 So do Novy on a diploma and then go 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.030
 I think it will eventually come 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.949
 look guys so my diplomas super 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.660
 awesome no but just as serious i am 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:56.209
 really happy that I just made it 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.699
 and also somewhat proud of me if yes 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.010
 it is veveo what i have here 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:02.989
 hey yes and do you ever have to 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.359
 doing exams it's easier than it 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.799
 body and practice a lot that I have 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.650
 why i also did i have nothing anymore 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.620
 learned only exercises and 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.250
 what really helped so that is real 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.290
 a 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.239
 pretty smart something I think to do 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.160
 melvin you are really super cool do you want 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.109
 maybe show your garden or frodo 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.639
 previous episode means me 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.250
 especially by letting me vlog back 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.460
 so I'm going to take him to 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.919
 our beautiful garden 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.310
 see our beautiful garden here 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.330
 namely planters and beautiful set and 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.509
 a swimming pool 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.400
 yes it is because we have everything else 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:42.669
 even more planters around the fence 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.729
 harmonize very beautiful dry rich and one 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.410
 orange beanbag against the loft gerard 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.389
 we also have a newspaper and a bicycle 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.949
 and saw a barbecue so quickly and a whole 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.900
 nice score sentence and note this is to now 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.419
 look gorgeous and the next response is 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.550
 the best joke i could find in between 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.370
 all the jokes that were left behind 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.650
 why is a sheep happy that i already open 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.650
 answer because I used to be lamas 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.580
 really this was seriously one of the 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.229
 better that proves but again the level 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.389
 of the jokes 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.400
 talk your home or Dutch fries but 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:21.310
 speak your home just dutch mine 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.720
 father has already been brought up freeze but mine 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.820
 mother is from south holland so i am 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.949
 Ordinary or Dutch brought up of course 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.250
 I can understand freezer very well 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:32.349
 only speak no it is not 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.210
 me that is not going to be real but yes 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.070
 the school at home as you 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.960
 could read the thoughts of who would you then 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.110
 read I thought about it for a moment 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.060
 but i was thinking of someone who is a best 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.010
 high function for example as one 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.780
 grab al willem-alexander as an example 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.310
 or maybe it will sound very strange 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.860
 and who really suffer 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.150
 what does the well dozeman go in terms of 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.889
 train of thought 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.650
 went pretty interesting so i would 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.449
 someone who has a lot of influence on 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.570
 I'd just like to take a look at 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.520
 what does a type do so well so what is 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.710
 your number safe in school own 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.270
 really no idea we get in 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.050
 the fifth class of new lockers 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.970
 assigned and 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.159
 I have no idea the houses I was 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.830
 Always recognized me locker because I have one 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:17.000
 particularly safe because my lock had that 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.979
 was wrong 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.900
 yes with louis headed in there and me 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.580
 she just has to look from there 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.740
 the dash at the bottom instead of at the top 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.120
 so that 's my safe you recognized by that 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.120
 I did not because I works 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.470
 silly idea the number the Walloon 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.000
 but yes i almost never use it 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.280
 so what does it matter then 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.970
 but so Melvin describe it in herself 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.970
 three words 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.770
 good looking 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.370
 awesome 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:52.460
 even more handsome battery that there are 5 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:54.620
 at least this was the reaction again 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.240
 video today you enjoyed busy then 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.620
 maybe your high smoke on that blue 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.840
 a nice reaction below 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.430
 to have sex in and then there is it can 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.169
 you next week will be discussed there 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.270
 shape then I only have one thing to do 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:07.840
 say to you and that's good 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.840
 people
