00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.150
 which is the new mini version I think that 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.099
 is at zero point 11.1 they will ask but 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.640
 if it's good ballads 0.11 points but 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.550
 Well, I'm not going out to knit 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.099
 with 2.1 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.020
 very fast true and good here they 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.020
 I bring what is the version and how 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.019
 so can the creative and 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.980
 because it makes the way is also 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:46.180
 minutes a day 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.710
 it also brings what are all shovels 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.050
 peaks all 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.570
 in creative but not because they are not very 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.630
 useful so that we really want 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.690
 please say them 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.440
 write them 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.440
 of what 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.730
 eleven 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.730
 to see is the squid is the spider 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.000
 the cube 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.840
 and what will be missing there are the 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.140
 bats 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.909
 the test spiders that poison you 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.549
 is in the slams that only come out 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.740
 with difficulty so do not forget to put 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:32.659
 the difficulty they wish to die 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.050
 it is not this what the 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.400
 fish 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.400
 the arch is improved 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.650
 flipper university 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.500
 I gave him 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.810
 and here we go 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.430
 and so we go 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.479
 in which that is not what the 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.090
 tiny zombies how are they running in 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.360
 region 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.940
 today runs from me 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.230
 95 weapons 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.230
 until flying to reach n 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.880
 It runs pretty strong 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.330
 It's bad because I feel the goal of 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.930
 encounter are the rest blocks 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.390
 how they see 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.340
 to get a lot of rest not 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.670
 waste the law possible as 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.670
 decorative 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:43.710
 which is more creative 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.350
 what I already said dependent is capital 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.600
 it is good is the good 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.250
 a snow 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.910
 which is very good because you can shoot 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.300
 the zombies uy 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.660
 maybe from the most proposed books 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.630
 and mocking a bit playing aim 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.320
 jose in short 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.320
 of the same 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.220
 do not miss 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.220
 it would be all this 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.420
 Hello 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.210
 well now we're going to the part of 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.340
 out is what they also put the 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.840
 sound volume in the options of 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.860
 upstairs since I was up here 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.140
 work but they have improved 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.970
 give account in this Spanish and position 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.980
 in Spanish, Mexico 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.890

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.240
 good multiplier only the bar of the 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.350

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.519
 he stopped pictures true 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:14.150
 what it is being also for that 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.989
 means that when for example I'm 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.329
 watching very fixedly skin stopped and 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.820

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.820
 footwear and it is moving swinging 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.430
