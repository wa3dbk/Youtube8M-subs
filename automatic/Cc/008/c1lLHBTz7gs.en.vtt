00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.910
 also in the month of May 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:41.930
 and glucose 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.080
 but when you get there 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.080
 yes 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 has 54 milligrams about decided to say 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.480
 is now 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.480
 what you have 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.840
 about blood 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.730
 swim and mobilize the patient 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.410
 we proceed to stabilize it with a 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.410
 5% dextrose solution 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.260
 Y 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.290
 and we see 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.520
 I do not know how much but it does not reach me 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.520
 so good 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.740
 look at your soul behind exams 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.570
 and the impasse 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.370
 where to do those exams for 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.140
 determine what can be 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.140
 and lots 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.900
 goodbye 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.000
 family I followed higher 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:32.100
 but a question 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:34.910
 Yes Yes Yes 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:41.900
 look what you have everything that is 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.900
 presents is because of pancreatitis 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:53.980
 unfortunately if you have to intervene 10 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.980
 and proceed to stabilize the patient 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.580
 dextrose solutions at 5 and 10% are 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.220
 used as a vehicle means of 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.390
 some drugs when necessary 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.850
 administer them by 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.670
 intravenous increases osmotic pressure 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.920
 of blood increases the current of 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.580
 the fluids in the blood and intensify 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.580
 the metabolic process 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.480
 provides that treatment encounter 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.250
 of nutrition hypoglycemia 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.350
 parenteral and agents of the saints 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.450
 also as solvents for drugs 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.100
 injectables the choice form with logic 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.410
 the stress one hundred percent serves 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.090
 as a cellular metabolic substrate has 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.190
 used for obtaining energy 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.620
 produces four calories per gram of 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.660
 glucose administration of what destroys 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.200
 produces the preferential undivided 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.200
 the metabolic pathways 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.990
 stations of dextrose to 10% the 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.700
 Dextrose is indicated as a source of 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.250
 calories for the provision of energy 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.410
 parenterally from your 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.600
 glucose content are indicated 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.820
 patients with oral intake is in 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.170
 this entity whose requirements 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.840
 energetics are not adequately 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.670
 supplemented can be used alone or 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.770
 mixing the purposes of reduction and 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.140
 parenteral nutrition the action 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.300
 pharmacological in the destruction of 10% is 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.700
 a source of calories and depletes is applied 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.310
 to patients unable to use 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.660
 in the oral route for integrally 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.750
 provide the necessary glucose to 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.240
 the energy metabolism generating 4 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.610
 nutritional calories for the program 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.320
 of dextrose lave thing is the source 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.800
 preferred principal for the contribution of
