scrap piece of wood will work just fine
normally<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.910> know<00:00:20.970> I'd<00:00:21.090> use<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> compass<00:00:21.840> but

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
normally you know I'd use a compass but

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.230 
normally you know I'd use a compass but
for<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> radius<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.460> want<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.850> don't<00:00:23.880> have

for the radius that I want I don't have

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.170 
for the radius that I want I don't have
one<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.570> will<00:00:24.689> go<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:24.990> large<00:00:25.939> so<00:00:26.939> I'm<00:00:27.029> just

out<00:02:41.130> along<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.700> line

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.809 

let's<00:02:52.290> be<00:02:52.439> careful<00:02:52.680> with<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.219> make<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.519> couple

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
let's be careful with it make a couple

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.569 
let's be careful with it make a couple
of<00:02:53.939> passes<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.480> get<00:02:54.749> through<00:02:55.129> and<00:02:56.129> you<00:02:56.159> can<00:02:56.400> see

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
of passes to get through and you can see

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.509 
of passes to get through and you can see
I've<00:02:56.700> got<00:02:56.879> a<00:02:56.939> seven<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:57.389> a<00:02:57.480> half<00:02:57.689> inch<00:02:57.900> radius

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
I've got a seven and a half inch radius

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.250 
I've got a seven and a half inch radius
you<00:02:59.519> can<00:02:59.549> also<00:02:59.760> do<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.180> same<00:03:00.209> procedure

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
you can also do the same procedure

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.709 
you can also do the same procedure
I'll<00:03:01.620> show<00:03:01.859> I've<00:03:02.189> made<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.549> ten<00:03:02.879> inch<00:03:03.090> radius<00:03:03.329> as

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:03.719 
I'll show I've made a ten inch radius as

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:09.349 
I'll show I've made a ten inch radius as
well<00:03:06.379> here's<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.620> attend<00:03:08.010> inch<00:03:08.219> you<00:03:08.969> can<00:03:09.150> see

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
well here's the attend inch you can see

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.509 
well here's the attend inch you can see
it<00:03:09.450> compared<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.290> seven<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:10.980> half<00:03:11.189> inch

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
it compared to the seven and a half inch

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.009 
it compared to the seven and a half inch
now<00:03:11.909> you<00:03:11.969> get<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.209> little<00:03:14.450> sharper<00:03:15.450> curve<00:03:15.719> out

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
now you get a little sharper curve out

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.030 
now you get a little sharper curve out
of<00:03:16.139> the<00:03:16.230> seven<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.739> half<00:03:16.799> and<00:03:18.560> now<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.799> I'm

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
of the seven and a half and now this I'm

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.289 
of the seven and a half and now this I'm
just<00:03:20.159> going<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.430> take<00:03:20.639> a<00:03:20.669> scrap<00:03:20.999> piece<00:03:21.269> of

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
just going to take a scrap piece of

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.020 
just going to take a scrap piece of
lumber<00:03:22.069> this<00:03:23.069> is<00:03:23.280> like<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.909> 1<00:03:24.359> by<00:03:25.129> 2<00:03:26.129> maybe<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.849> 1

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
lumber this is like a 1 by 2 maybe a 1

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.629 
lumber this is like a 1 by 2 maybe a 1
by<00:03:27.180> 3<00:03:27.230> just<00:03:28.230> depends<00:03:28.650> on<00:03:28.709> how<00:03:28.919> wide<00:03:29.129> the<00:03:29.400> block

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
by 3 just depends on how wide the block

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.000 
by 3 just depends on how wide the block
is<00:03:29.879> that<00:03:30.060> you're<00:03:30.209> going<00:03:30.329> to<00:03:30.419> use<00:03:30.769> I'm<00:03:31.769> just

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
is that you're going to use I'm just

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.250 
is that you're going to use I'm just
going<00:03:32.189> to<00:03:32.219> find<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.609> center<00:03:32.939> point<00:03:32.969> on<00:03:33.510> each

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
going to find the center point on each

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:42.459 
going to find the center point on each
end<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:35.389> draw<00:03:36.389> a<00:03:36.480> line<00:03:36.719> through<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.049> center

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:42.469 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:45.170 

and<00:03:43.469> then<00:03:44.189> I<00:03:44.250> want<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.489> take<00:03:44.730> that<00:03:44.939> line<00:03:45.150> and

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
and then I want to take that line and

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.250 
and then I want to take that line and
extend<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.900> down<00:03:45.930> on<00:03:46.319> each<00:03:46.590> end

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
extend it down on each end

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.449 
extend it down on each end
just<00:03:49.260> yuvan<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.650> triangle<00:03:50.250> here<00:03:50.549> and<00:03:52.250> just<00:03:53.250> draw

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
just yuvan a triangle here and just draw

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.740 
just yuvan a triangle here and just draw
that<00:03:53.669> line<00:03:54.260> perpendicular<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.949> top<00:03:56.750> and

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
that line perpendicular to the top and

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.539 
that line perpendicular to the top and
do<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:58.019> on<00:03:58.199> each<00:03:58.379> end<00:03:58.709> and<00:04:00.919> now<00:04:01.919> I'm<00:04:02.069> going<00:04:02.370> to

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
do that on each end and now I'm going to

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.890 
do that on each end and now I'm going to
draw<00:04:03.479> a<00:04:03.509> line<00:04:03.750> here<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.439> little<00:04:05.280> less<00:04:05.909> you<00:04:06.569> than

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
draw a line here a little less you than

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.879 
draw a line here a little less you than
the<00:04:07.859> thickness<00:04:08.159> of<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.549> wood<00:04:09.650> what<00:04:10.650> I'm<00:04:10.739> going

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
the thickness of the wood what I'm going

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.949 
the thickness of the wood what I'm going
to<00:04:10.919> do<00:04:11.099> is<00:04:11.280> cut<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.519> little<00:04:11.579> window<00:04:12.239> out<00:04:12.479> here<00:04:12.750> so

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
to do is cut a little window out here so

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.770 
to do is cut a little window out here so
that<00:04:12.989> we<00:04:13.259> can<00:04:13.439> line<00:04:13.799> up<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:15.060> template<00:04:15.599> with

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
that we can line up the template with

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.539 
that we can line up the template with
the<00:04:15.810> line<00:04:16.169> we<00:04:16.440> just<00:04:16.470> drew<00:04:16.709> on<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.190> end<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.459> the

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
the line we just drew on the end of the

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.330 
the line we just drew on the end of the
block<00:04:18.620> this<00:04:19.620> will<00:04:19.769> make<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:19.949> lot<00:04:20.130> more<00:04:20.280> sense

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
block this will make a lot more sense

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.399 
block this will make a lot more sense
when<00:04:20.789> you<00:04:20.940> see<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:23.870> so<00:04:24.870> we've<00:04:25.020> cut<00:04:25.259> out<00:04:25.380> a

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
when you see it so we've cut out a

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.339 
when you see it so we've cut out a
little<00:04:25.650> window<00:04:26.099> there<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:26.750> now<00:04:27.750> I'm<00:04:27.870> going<00:04:28.139> to

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
little window there and now I'm going to

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.430 
little window there and now I'm going to
line<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:29.039> top<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:30.120> template<00:04:30.539> up<00:04:30.750> and<00:04:31.020> now

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
line the top of the template up and now

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.710 
line the top of the template up and now
you<00:04:31.500> can<00:04:31.770> see<00:04:32.039> the<00:04:32.190> little<00:04:32.340> line<00:04:32.720> going

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
you can see the little line going

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.510 
you can see the little line going
through<00:04:33.750> at<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.259> bottom<00:04:34.650> through<00:04:35.009> the<00:04:35.130> window

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
through at the bottom through the window

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.320 
through at the bottom through the window
and<00:04:35.789> then<00:04:36.750> you<00:04:36.780> just<00:04:37.080> want<00:04:37.289> to<00:04:37.349> draw<00:04:38.330> that

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
and then you just want to draw that

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.060 
and then you just want to draw that
curve<00:04:40.280> there<00:04:41.280> on<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.699> end<00:04:42.210> of<00:04:42.419> the<00:04:42.509> block<00:04:42.750> and

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
curve there on the end of the block and

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.749 
curve there on the end of the block and
do<00:04:44.070> this<00:04:44.250> on<00:04:44.430> both<00:04:44.699> ends<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:47.400> once<00:04:47.639> you've

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
do this on both ends and once you've

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.510 
do this on both ends and once you've
done<00:04:47.789> that<00:04:47.969> I'm<00:04:48.389> just<00:04:48.599> going<00:04:48.780> to<00:04:48.810> stem<00:04:49.110> these

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
done that I'm just going to stem these

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.469 
done that I'm just going to stem these
little<00:04:50.520> lines<00:04:50.729> on<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.000> side<00:04:51.949> on<00:04:52.949> each<00:04:53.130> end

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.089 

and<00:04:57.479> then<00:04:57.630> I'm<00:04:57.720> just<00:04:57.780> going<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.380> connect<00:04:58.919> those

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
and then I'm just going to connect those

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.120 
and then I'm just going to connect those
two<00:04:59.340> dots<00:04:59.580> and<00:04:59.880> draw<00:05:00.180> a<00:05:00.270> line<00:05:00.569> down<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.770> side

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
two dots and draw a line down the side

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:12.530 
two dots and draw a line down the side
of<00:05:02.370> this<00:05:02.490> block

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.560 

now<00:05:13.110> I<00:05:13.140> want<00:05:13.350> to<00:05:13.670> secure<00:05:14.670> this<00:05:14.940> to<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.330> table

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
now I want to secure this to the table

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.080 
now I want to secure this to the table
with<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.080> vise<00:05:16.290> and<00:05:16.680> I<00:05:17.520> want<00:05:17.700> to<00:05:17.760> just<00:05:17.850> take<00:05:18.030> a

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
with the vise and I want to just take a

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.450 
with the vise and I want to just take a
little<00:05:18.540> hand<00:05:18.840> plane<00:05:19.200> and<00:05:19.860> I<00:05:19.920> want<00:05:20.100> to<00:05:20.160> plane

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
little hand plane and I want to plane

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.990 
little hand plane and I want to plane
off<00:05:20.700> that<00:05:21.030> excess<00:05:21.660> wood<00:05:22.500> there<00:05:22.800> just<00:05:23.700> kind<00:05:23.880> of

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
off that excess wood there just kind of

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.300 
off that excess wood there just kind of
plane<00:05:24.750> it<00:05:24.900> straight<00:05:25.200> down<00:05:25.410> to<00:05:25.650> that<00:05:25.830> line<00:05:26.100> that

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
plane it straight down to that line that

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:34.190 
plane it straight down to that line that
we<00:05:26.490> drew<00:05:26.730> on<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:27.030> side<00:05:31.430> and<00:05:32.430> now<00:05:32.610> this<00:05:33.200> may

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
we drew on the side and now this may

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.990 
we drew on the side and now this may
look<00:05:34.230> a<00:05:34.500> little<00:05:34.530> backwards<00:05:35.280> this<00:05:35.520> isn't<00:05:35.910> the

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
look a little backwards this isn't the

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.180 
look a little backwards this isn't the
finished<00:05:36.360> block<00:05:36.540> we're<00:05:37.380> going<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.650> use<00:05:37.830> this

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
finished block we're going to use this

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.290 
finished block we're going to use this
piece<00:05:38.520> to<00:05:38.910> make<00:05:39.150> our<00:05:39.420> radius<00:05:39.840> block<00:05:41.300> once

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
piece to make our radius block once

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.520 
piece to make our radius block once
you've<00:05:42.450> got<00:05:42.630> it<00:05:42.660> planed<00:05:43.020> I'm<00:05:43.200> going<00:05:43.350> to<00:05:43.410> take

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
you've got it planed I'm going to take

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.860 
you've got it planed I'm going to take
some<00:05:43.710> 100<00:05:44.010> grit<00:05:44.160> sandpaper<00:05:44.550> and<00:05:45.030> just<00:05:45.510> smooth

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
some 100 grit sandpaper and just smooth

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
some 100 grit sandpaper and just smooth
it<00:05:45.990> all<00:05:46.170> out<00:05:51.080> you<00:05:52.080> want<00:05:52.350> to<00:05:52.410> make<00:05:52.590> sure<00:05:52.620> that

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
it all out you want to make sure that

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.740 
it all out you want to make sure that
it's<00:05:53.040> pretty<00:05:53.250> uniform<00:05:53.850> down<00:05:54.120> the<00:05:54.300> length<00:05:54.510> of

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
it's pretty uniform down the length of

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:03.500 
it's pretty uniform down the length of
the<00:05:54.810> block

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.090 

I'm<00:06:04.050> going<00:06:04.230> to<00:06:04.290> move<00:06:04.410> in<00:06:04.590> a<00:06:04.650> little<00:06:04.800> closer

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
I'm going to move in a little closer

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.350 
I'm going to move in a little closer
here<00:06:05.280> and<00:06:05.520> let<00:06:05.640> you<00:06:05.760> show<00:06:05.970> how<00:06:06.180> we're

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
here and let you show how we're

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.940 
here and let you show how we're
following<00:06:06.600> that<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.950> curve<00:06:08.220> of<00:06:08.400> that<00:06:08.460> radius

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
following that the curve of that radius

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:19.390 
following that the curve of that radius
then<00:06:10.950> do<00:06:11.070> the<00:06:11.190> same<00:06:11.400> thing<00:06:11.460> on<00:06:11.820> the<00:06:11.940> other<00:06:11.970> side

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.190 

and<00:06:20.400> now<00:06:21.030> you<00:06:21.120> may<00:06:21.360> want<00:06:21.510> to<00:06:21.600> periodically

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
and now you may want to periodically

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.520 
and now you may want to periodically
check<00:06:22.590> it<00:06:22.740> this<00:06:23.190> is<00:06:23.490> the<00:06:23.840> piece<00:06:24.840> that<00:06:25.260> we<00:06:25.500> cut

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
check it this is the piece that we cut

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.860 
check it this is the piece that we cut
off<00:06:25.890> from<00:06:26.550> the<00:06:26.700> template<00:06:27.120> and<00:06:27.210> just<00:06:27.270> make<00:06:27.630> sure

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
off from the template and just make sure

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.690 
off from the template and just make sure
that<00:06:27.900> you<00:06:28.230> are<00:06:28.380> nice<00:06:28.650> and<00:06:28.920> uniform<00:06:29.190> through

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
that you are nice and uniform through

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.260 
that you are nice and uniform through
the<00:06:29.820> length<00:06:30.030> of<00:06:30.210> the<00:06:30.300> board<00:06:31.910> okay<00:06:32.910> now<00:06:33.090> I<00:06:33.120> want

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
the length of the board okay now I want

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.300 
the length of the board okay now I want
to<00:06:33.330> take<00:06:33.480> some<00:06:33.660> sixty<00:06:34.080> grit<00:06:34.260> paper<00:06:34.500> and<00:06:34.890> just

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
to take some sixty grit paper and just

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.760 
to take some sixty grit paper and just
spray<00:06:35.610> it<00:06:35.700> with<00:06:35.850> some<00:06:35.910> spray<00:06:36.360> adhesive<00:06:36.900> and

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.010 

then<00:06:40.770> I'm<00:06:40.920> just<00:06:41.070> going<00:06:41.280> to<00:06:41.400> mount<00:06:42.270> that<00:06:42.390> on<00:06:42.570> top

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
then I'm just going to mount that on top

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.870 
then I'm just going to mount that on top
of<00:06:43.080> this<00:06:43.320> block<00:06:43.680> on<00:06:43.980> the<00:06:44.160> curved<00:06:44.400> part<00:06:44.670> of<00:06:44.820> this

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
of this block on the curved part of this

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.950 
of this block on the curved part of this
block<00:06:49.790> this<00:06:50.790> is<00:06:50.850> just<00:06:51.240> going<00:06:51.390> to<00:06:51.450> hold<00:06:51.660> it<00:06:51.840> in

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
block this is just going to hold it in

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.310 
block this is just going to hold it in
place<00:06:52.110> while<00:06:52.500> we<00:06:52.650> use<00:06:52.680> it<00:06:54.020> and<00:06:55.020> now<00:06:55.140> I'm<00:06:55.200> going

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
place while we use it and now I'm going

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.430 
place while we use it and now I'm going
to<00:06:55.410> clamp<00:06:55.620> this<00:06:55.830> back<00:06:56.130> into<00:06:56.340> the<00:06:56.550> vise<00:06:56.760> and<00:06:57.440> now

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 
to clamp this back into the vise and now

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.500 
to clamp this back into the vise and now
this<00:06:58.620> I've<00:06:59.130> glued<00:06:59.580> a<00:06:59.730> couple<00:07:00.060> of<00:07:00.120> pieces<00:07:00.330> of

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.510 
this I've glued a couple of pieces of

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.920 
this I've glued a couple of pieces of
the<00:07:00.870> 1x2<00:07:01.470> together<00:07:02.330> these<00:07:03.330> are<00:07:03.480> actually<00:07:03.750> one

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
the 1x2 together these are actually one

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.920 
the 1x2 together these are actually one
by<00:07:04.080> threes<00:07:04.440> and<00:07:04.790> I<00:07:05.790> want<00:07:06.000> to<00:07:06.060> just<00:07:06.210> sand<00:07:06.660> these

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
by threes and I want to just sand these

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:15.770 
by threes and I want to just sand these
down<00:07:13.010> sort<00:07:14.010> of<00:07:14.100> cutting<00:07:14.550> that<00:07:14.730> curve<00:07:15.180> into<00:07:15.690> the

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 
down sort of cutting that curve into the

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.290 
down sort of cutting that curve into the
top<00:07:16.020> of<00:07:16.050> the<00:07:16.200> block<00:07:16.730> and<00:07:17.730> now<00:07:17.850> once<00:07:18.120> you<00:07:18.270> start

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 
top of the block and now once you start

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.420 
top of the block and now once you start
getting<00:07:18.690> toward<00:07:19.050> the<00:07:19.110> outside<00:07:19.320> edges

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
getting toward the outside edges

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.300 
getting toward the outside edges
notice<00:07:21.030> how<00:07:21.180> I'm<00:07:21.300> kind<00:07:21.480> of<00:07:21.570> moving<00:07:21.750> it<00:07:22.110> up<00:07:22.950> and

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310 
notice how I'm kind of moving it up and

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.360 
notice how I'm kind of moving it up and
down<00:07:23.520> and<00:07:23.880> side-to-side<00:07:24.660> all<00:07:25.650> at<00:07:26.010> the<00:07:26.130> same

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.370 
down and side-to-side all at the same

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.560 
down and side-to-side all at the same
time<00:07:26.960> and<00:07:27.960> then<00:07:28.650> you<00:07:28.770> can<00:07:28.800> see<00:07:29.190> how<00:07:29.370> you've<00:07:29.570> cut

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.570 
time and then you can see how you've cut

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.560 
time and then you can see how you've cut
that<00:07:30.780> curve<00:07:31.080> out<00:07:31.350> there<00:07:32.090> again<00:07:33.090> take<00:07:33.330> your

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:33.570 
that curve out there again take your

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.510 
that curve out there again take your
template<00:07:34.230> and<00:07:34.530> just<00:07:34.620> make<00:07:35.010> sure<00:07:35.220> that<00:07:35.250> you've

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 
template and just make sure that you've

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.000 
template and just make sure that you've
got<00:07:35.550> it<00:07:35.790> nice<00:07:35.970> and<00:07:36.030> uniform<00:07:39.650> make<00:07:40.650> sure<00:07:40.860> it's

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.010 
got it nice and uniform make sure it's

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.870 
got it nice and uniform make sure it's
uniform<00:07:41.460> to<00:07:41.640> the<00:07:41.670> entire<00:07:42.060> length<00:07:42.360> and<00:07:43.880> that's

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:44.880 
uniform to the entire length and that's

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.330 
uniform to the entire length and that's
your<00:07:45.240> radius<00:07:45.990> sanding<00:07:46.380> block<00:07:46.620> seven<00:07:47.160> and<00:07:47.280> a

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340
