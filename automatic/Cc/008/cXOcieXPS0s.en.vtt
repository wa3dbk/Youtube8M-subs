think that's what it is you in there

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.440 
think that's what it is you in there
maybe<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.650> little<00:02:32.950> bit<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.400> little<00:02:33.700> bit<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.180> kind

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
maybe a little bit a little bit I kind

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.570 
maybe a little bit a little bit I kind
of<00:02:34.540> maybe<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.950> takes<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.190> little<00:02:36.310> bit<00:02:36.430> of

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
of maybe it takes a little bit of

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.430 
of maybe it takes a little bit of
aspects<00:02:37.000> for<00:02:37.180> me<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.480> also<00:02:37.600> takes<00:02:37.840> aspects

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
aspects for me it also takes aspects

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.140 
aspects for me it also takes aspects
from<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.950> lot<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.370> other<00:02:39.520> people<00:02:39.910> that<00:02:40.000> I've
