hi<00:00:11.750> I'm<00:00:12.750> Michelle<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.530> I'm<00:00:14.460> here<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.759> talk

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
hi I'm Michelle and I'm here to talk

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.760 
hi I'm Michelle and I'm here to talk
about<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:16.170> shock<00:00:16.650> zombie<00:00:17.640> note<00:00:17.850> study<00:00:18.330> guides

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
about the shock zombie note study guides

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.990 
about the shock zombie note study guides
so<00:00:19.770> shocked<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.060> very<00:00:21.779> complex<00:00:22.439> topic<00:00:23.010> as<00:00:23.189> a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
so shocked is a very complex topic as a

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.359 
so shocked is a very complex topic as a
critical<00:00:24.539> care<00:00:24.869> nurse<00:00:25.109> I've<00:00:25.590> taken<00:00:25.920> care<00:00:26.130> of

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
critical care nurse I've taken care of

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.720 
critical care nurse I've taken care of
many<00:00:27.150> patients<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.869> are<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.109> shock<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.830> it

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
many patients that are in shock and it

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.030 
many patients that are in shock and it
took<00:00:29.939> me<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> while<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.510> really<00:00:30.960> understand<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
took me a while to really understand the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.229 
took me a while to really understand the
concepts<00:00:32.930> of<00:00:33.930> shock<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:35.280> know<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.430> understand

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
concepts of shock you know I understand

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.540 
concepts of shock you know I understand
the<00:00:36.390> symptoms<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.350> how<00:00:37.950> my<00:00:38.129> patient

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the symptoms and how my patient

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.790 
the symptoms and how my patient
presented<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.809> wasn't<00:00:40.079> always<00:00:40.290> sure<00:00:40.410> what

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
presented but I wasn't always sure what

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.729 
presented but I wasn't always sure what
was<00:00:40.920> going<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.340> inside<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.149> patient<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.840> it

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
was going on inside the patient and it

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.950 
was going on inside the patient and it
takes<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.070> lot<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.250> studying<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.149> understand

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
takes a lot of studying to understand

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.220 
takes a lot of studying to understand
that<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.820> patients<00:00:47.820> will<00:00:48.090> respond<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.930> shock

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
that on patients will respond to shock

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.000 
that on patients will respond to shock
by<00:00:49.829> trying<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.280> compensate<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.360> then<00:00:52.260> they<00:00:52.800> no

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
by trying to compensate and then they no

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.410 
by trying to compensate and then they no
longer<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.640> compensate<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.329> they

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
longer can compensate and they

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.229 
longer can compensate and they
decompensate<00:00:55.129> so<00:00:56.129> there's<00:00:56.340> terminologies

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
decompensate so there's terminologies

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.410 
decompensate so there's terminologies
around<00:00:57.750> shock<00:00:58.199> states<00:00:58.760> there's<00:00:59.760> many<00:01:00.059> names

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
around shock states there's many names

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.319 
around shock states there's many names
of<00:01:00.780> different<00:01:01.109> types<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.440> shock<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.329> it

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
of different types of shock and it

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.200 
of different types of shock and it
becomes<00:01:04.019> very<00:01:04.199> complex<00:01:04.939> so<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.090> I've<00:01:06.180> done

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
becomes very complex so what I've done

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.800 
becomes very complex so what I've done
is<00:01:06.780> I've<00:01:07.170> taken<00:01:07.229> those<00:01:07.860> ideas<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.640> put<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.600> on

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
is I've taken those ideas and put it on

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.380 
is I've taken those ideas and put it on
a<00:01:10.290> chart<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:12.060> one<00:01:12.330> side<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:13.369> is<00:01:14.390> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
a chart so on one side is is a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.380 
a chart so on one side is is a
memorization<00:01:16.320> guide<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.939> different

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
memorization guide on the different

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.840 
memorization guide on the different
types<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.869> shock<00:01:19.200> whether<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.369> hemorrhagic

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
types of shock whether it's hemorrhagic

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.060 
types of shock whether it's hemorrhagic
whether<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.840> cardiogenic<00:01:23.060> septic<00:01:24.060> shock

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
whether it's cardiogenic septic shock

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.980 
whether it's cardiogenic septic shock
anaphylactic<00:01:26.070> shock<00:01:26.150> there's<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.299> few<00:01:27.630> others

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
anaphylactic shock there's a few others

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.420 
anaphylactic shock there's a few others
respiratory<00:01:29.150> metabolic<00:01:30.530> neurogenic<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
respiratory metabolic neurogenic and it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.420 
respiratory metabolic neurogenic and it
actually<00:01:32.640> talks<00:01:33.509> about<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.140> causes<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:35.040> each

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
actually talks about the causes of each

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.510 
actually talks about the causes of each
type<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.729> shock<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.530> talks<00:01:37.530> about<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.890> common

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
type of shock it talks about the common

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.929 
type of shock it talks about the common
culprits<00:01:39.270> what<00:01:40.140> causes<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.460> types<00:01:41.759> of

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
culprits what causes the the types of

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.319 
culprits what causes the the types of
shock<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.540> then<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.619> goes<00:01:43.770> into<00:01:43.880> how<00:01:44.880> does<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
shock and then it goes into how does it

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.749 
shock and then it goes into how does it
affect<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.930> patient<00:01:46.439> what<00:01:47.130> are<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.310> going<00:01:47.520> to

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
affect the patient what are we going to

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.219 
affect the patient what are we going to
see<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.119> our<00:01:48.270> patient<00:01:48.479> when<00:01:48.869> they're<00:01:49.079> in

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
see in our patient when they're in

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.889 
see in our patient when they're in
different<00:01:49.409> types<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.979> shock<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.899> new

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
different types of shock and the new

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.530 
different types of shock and the new
theory<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.619> shock<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.939> really<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:55.399> identify<00:01:56.399> it

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
theory on shock is really to identify it

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.050 
theory on shock is really to identify it
before<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.689> patient<00:01:57.899> becomes<00:01:58.200> severely

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
before the patient becomes severely

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.240 
before the patient becomes severely
symptomatic<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.210> other<00:02:00.960> words<00:02:01.229> put<00:02:02.070> in

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
symptomatic in other words put in

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.800 
symptomatic in other words put in
treatment<00:02:02.850> protocols<00:02:03.450> before<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.920> becomes<00:02:05.369> a

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
treatment protocols before it becomes a

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.320 
treatment protocols before it becomes a
decompensated<00:02:06.810> event<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:08.970> we<00:02:09.149> can

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
decompensated event so if we can

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.370 
decompensated event so if we can
understand<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.920> concepts<00:02:11.660> this

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
understand the concepts this

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.600 
understand the concepts this
subtle<00:02:13.770> signs<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.400> symptoms<00:02:16.040> we<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.310> start

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
subtle signs and symptoms we can start

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.570 
subtle signs and symptoms we can start
treating<00:02:18.060> patients<00:02:18.270> before<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:20.040> events

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
treating patients before the events

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.680 
treating patients before the events
become<00:02:21.060> very<00:02:21.900> difficult<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.560> treat<00:02:22.830> if<00:02:23.700> you

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
become very difficult to treat if you

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.440 
become very difficult to treat if you
want<00:02:25.230> more<00:02:25.470> information<00:02:25.710> about<00:02:26.130> shock<00:02:26.580> you

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
want more information about shock you

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.970 
want more information about shock you
know<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.660> can<00:02:27.900> get<00:02:28.080> large<00:02:28.380> tech<00:02:28.710> book

they're<00:02:32.910> starting<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.360> think<00:02:33.630> about<00:02:33.830> scoring

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
they're starting to think about scoring

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.650 
they're starting to think about scoring
patients<00:02:35.250> who<00:02:35.700> have<00:02:35.880> these<00:02:36.150> types<00:02:36.480> of

patients who have these types of

symptoms and start treating them based
on<00:02:39.570> their<00:02:39.630> score<00:02:40.230> but<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.310> really<00:02:41.610> gives<00:02:42.150> us

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
on their score but this really gives us

on treating our patients we have

on treating our patients we have

different<00:03:57.180> types<00:03:57.420> of<00:03:57.570> shock<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.170> it's<00:03:58.860> a

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
different types of shock so it's a

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.030 
different types of shock so it's a
complex<00:03:59.670> topic<00:04:01.730> put<00:04:02.730> into<00:04:03.330> easy<00:04:04.040> terminology

complex topic put into easy terminology

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.120 
complex topic put into easy terminology
and<00:04:05.450> ways<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:06.720> we<00:04:06.870> can<00:04:07.050> memorize<00:04:07.680> the

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
and ways that we can memorize the

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.730 
and ways that we can memorize the
different<00:04:08.490> phases<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.940> shock<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:10.080> names<00:04:10.440> of

different phases of shock the names of

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.730 
different phases of shock the names of
shock<00:04:11.690> because<00:04:12.690> in<00:04:12.990> different<00:04:13.350> textbooks

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
shock because in different textbooks

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.300 
shock because in different textbooks
they<00:04:14.459> have<00:04:14.880> different<00:04:15.090> names<00:04:15.500> so<00:04:16.500> we<00:04:16.830> try<00:04:17.250> to

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
they have different names so we try to

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.270 
they have different names so we try to
minimize<00:04:17.640> that<00:04:18.180> but<00:04:18.900> put<00:04:19.230> the<00:04:19.350> ones<00:04:19.620> down<00:04:20.010> that

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
minimize that but put the ones down that

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.150 
minimize that but put the ones down that
we<00:04:20.430> see<00:04:20.760> very<00:04:21.000> frequently<00:04:21.270> and<00:04:21.989> it<00:04:22.860> gives<00:04:23.040> us

we see very frequently and it gives us
