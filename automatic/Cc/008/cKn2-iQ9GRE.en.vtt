minutes which is just fine for me very
manageable<00:02:15.220> and

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
manageable and

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.910 
manageable and

there's more than three or more than

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.120 
there's more than three or more than
what<00:02:47.780> your<00:02:47.900> misdirect<00:02:48.410> shots<00:02:48.620> can<00:02:48.770> handle

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
what your misdirect shots can handle

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.949 
what your misdirect shots can handle
because<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.520> only<00:02:49.670> have<00:02:49.820> three<00:02:50.030> shots<00:02:50.270> then

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
because you only have three shots then

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.720 
because you only have three shots then
feign<00:02:51.440> death<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.920> then<00:02:52.160> they'll<00:02:52.310> all<00:02:52.520> go

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
feign death and then they'll all go
