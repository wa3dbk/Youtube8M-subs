like<00:00:54.600> specks<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.379> think<00:00:55.920> third<00:00:56.750> type<00:00:57.750> of

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
like specks I think third type of

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.420 
like specks I think third type of
packaging<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.559> they've<00:00:58.800> had<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> last

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
packaging that they've had in the last

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.330 
packaging that they've had in the last
like<00:00:59.760> say<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> year<00:01:00.480> or<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.160> one

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
like say a year or so I do like this one

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.650 
like say a year or so I do like this one
better<00:01:02.460> than<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.699> previous<00:01:03.090> one<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.480> bit

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
better than the previous one it's a bit

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.690 
better than the previous one it's a bit
easier<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.019> get<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.470> out<00:01:04.559> off<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.400> had<00:01:05.580> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
easier to get on and out off you had to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.399 
easier to get on and out off you had to
like<00:01:05.850> kind<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.090> destroy<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.810> packaging<00:01:07.320> in

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
like kind of destroy the packaging in

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.080 
like kind of destroy the packaging in
the<00:01:07.500> last<00:01:07.650> version<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.430> new<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:08.760> has<00:01:08.880> this

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
the last version the new one has this

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.910 
the last version the new one has this
like<00:01:09.240> little<00:01:09.360> push<00:01:09.750> button<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> back<00:01:10.380> they

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
like little push button in the back they

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
looks it looks almost identical to the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.139 
looks it looks almost identical to the
original<00:01:42.420> card<00:01:43.140> case<00:01:43.520> except<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.670> totally

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
original card case except it's totally

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.630 
original card case except it's totally
flexible<00:01:45.479> as<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.899> can<00:01:46.049> see<00:01:46.290> made<00:01:46.890> them<00:01:47.070> TPU

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
flexible as you can see made them TPU

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.940 
flexible as you can see made them TPU
now<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.180> it'll<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.869> much<00:01:49.049> easier<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.619> get<00:01:49.740> on

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
now and it'll be much easier to get on

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.100 
now and it'll be much easier to get on
and<00:01:50.250> off<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.790> let's<00:01:51.180> get<00:01:51.360> my<00:01:51.479> phone<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.960> here
