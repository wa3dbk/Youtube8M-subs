one of those lucky guys that never goes
bald<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.420> think<00:02:23.840> for<00:02:24.019> my<00:02:24.200> hair<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.680> generally<00:02:25.250> do

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.640 
bald I think for my hair I generally do
a<00:02:25.459> good<00:02:25.940> job<00:02:26.000> of<00:02:26.239> hiding<00:02:26.599> it<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:27.110> mean<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.409> can

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
a good job of hiding it I mean I can

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.730

my scalp on the sides or want us in a

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.399 
my scalp on the sides or want us in a
braid<00:03:02.620> because<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:04.060> used<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.480> be<00:03:04.659> that<00:03:05.049> I<00:03:05.079> could

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
braid because it used to be that I could

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.640

put<00:03:05.620> my<00:03:05.769> hair<00:03:06.099> into<00:03:06.400> two<00:03:06.760> piggy<00:03:07.750> tails<00:03:08.079> and

put my hair into two piggy tails and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.250 
put my hair into two piggy tails and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
each braid would be thicker than this

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.729

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
of geology education things but they're

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.390 
of geology education things but they're
either<00:05:30.569> really<00:05:31.569> high<00:05:31.870> level<00:05:32.289> or<00:05:32.560> there's<00:05:33.099> just

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
either really high level or there's just

level in order for people to really

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.159 
level in order for people to really
recognize<00:05:57.669> you<00:05:58.240> so<00:05:58.599> far<00:05:58.779> what<00:05:58.930> I've<00:05:59.050> been

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
recognize you so far what I've been

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.429

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:02.439 
doing is writing scripts and planning

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:06.389 
doing is writing scripts and planning
out<00:06:02.589> what<00:06:03.009> I<00:06:03.370> would<00:06:03.819> actually<00:06:04.710> want<00:06:05.710> to<00:06:06.009> do

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:06.399 
out what I would actually want to do

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.490 
out what I would actually want to do
with<00:06:07.210> the<00:06:07.360> channel<00:06:07.629> because<00:06:08.050> there's<00:06:08.229> so<00:06:08.409> many

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
with the channel because there's so many

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.129 
with the channel because there's so many
different<00:06:08.919> aspects<00:06:09.460> of<00:06:09.839> geology<00:06:10.839> it's<00:06:11.050> a

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
different aspects of geology it's a

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.409 
different aspects of geology it's a
fairly<00:06:11.379> new<00:06:11.710> science<00:06:12.279> and<00:06:12.610> it<00:06:12.969> doesn't<00:06:13.270> just

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
fairly new science and it doesn't just

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.550 
fairly new science and it doesn't just
include<00:06:13.990> I<00:06:14.580> mean<00:06:15.629> specifically<00:06:16.629> Geoscience

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
include I mean specifically Geoscience

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.379 
include I mean specifically Geoscience
we're<00:06:17.740> talking<00:06:18.009> geology<00:06:18.490> then<00:06:18.879> that's<00:06:19.089> more

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
we're talking geology then that's more

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:22.379 
we're talking geology then that's more
of<00:06:19.539> the<00:06:19.750> earth<00:06:20.080> structure<00:06:20.800> based<00:06:21.550> but<00:06:22.300> if

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069 
you're talking Geoscience which is I

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:25.769 
you're talking Geoscience which is I
guess<00:06:24.550> more<00:06:24.849> of<00:06:24.909> what<00:06:25.180> I<00:06:25.210> would<00:06:25.360> want<00:06:25.569> my

really<00:07:13.630> teach<00:07:13.870> in<00:07:14.110> a<00:07:14.200> lecture<00:07:14.560> so<00:07:14.920> field<00:07:15.310> trips

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.640 
really teach in a lecture so field trips

really teach in a lecture so field trips
are<00:07:15.940> really<00:07:16.300> important<00:07:16.840> or<00:07:17.020> just<00:07:17.080> having<00:07:17.800> like

samples<00:07:22.270> so<00:07:22.630> that<00:07:22.900> I<00:07:22.930> can<00:07:23.320> teach<00:07:23.530> you<00:07:23.770> know

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:23.920 
samples so that I can teach you know

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.150 
samples so that I can teach you know
like<00:07:24.180> what<00:07:25.180> certain<00:07:25.650> cleavage<00:07:26.650> is<00:07:26.890> on

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 
like what certain cleavage is on

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.310 
like what certain cleavage is on
minerals<00:07:27.910> and<00:07:28.240> teach<00:07:28.480> what<00:07:28.750> type<00:07:28.960> of<00:07:29.110> rocks

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.320 
minerals and teach what type of rocks

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.370

are igneous rock sedimentary rocks
metamorphic<00:07:32.380> rocks<00:07:32.650> and<00:07:33.040> just<00:07:33.280> be<00:07:33.880> able<00:07:34.060> to

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.150 
metamorphic rocks and just be able to

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.060 
metamorphic rocks and just be able to
have<00:07:34.330> an<00:07:34.450> actual<00:07:34.750> sample<00:07:35.230> there<00:07:35.410> with<00:07:35.620> me<00:07:35.800> so

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.070 
have an actual sample there with me so

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.360 
have an actual sample there with me so
just<00:07:36.310> seeing<00:07:36.490> how<00:07:36.760> far<00:07:36.790> I<00:07:37.120> want<00:07:37.510> to<00:07:37.930> take<00:07:38.370> all

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.170 
be done how I'm going to get samples and

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.230 
be done how I'm going to get samples and
how<00:07:47.530> I'll<00:07:47.740> be<00:07:47.770> able<00:07:47.920> to<00:07:48.190> go<00:07:48.520> out<00:07:48.700> in<00:07:48.880> the<00:07:48.970> field

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 
how I'll be able to go out in the field

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.510 
how I'll be able to go out in the field
and<00:07:49.450> have<00:07:49.660> someone<00:07:50.140> take<00:07:50.650> a<00:07:50.680> camera<00:07:51.220> and
