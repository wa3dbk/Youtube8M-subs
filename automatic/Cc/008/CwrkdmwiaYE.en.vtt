00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.529
 about 300 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.160

 Lion lead kus-kus Kan medium without 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.030
 this station is not fully built yet 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.190
 but it is already working it can give the region 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.830
 twice as much energy but for that to her 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.199
 need to stretch the power line 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.820
 continue the topic lyudmila puck Shcherbakov

 woodcutter walked 40 kilometers left 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.960
 more than 300 have to work away from 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.329
 settlements practically 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.430
 impassable taiga but dense years here 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.950
 the problem is not the main trees before 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.140
 manually electric saws of a frost for 40 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.030
 don't give up the first people refuse 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.890
 equipment 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.280
 stall and itâ€™s necessary to heat his order 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.329
 meaning heats up works freezes 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.720
 Gray again the heaviest hard frost 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.910
 work in the cold 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.190
 just impossible to freeze and even on 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.470
 site of the future as long as that's such landmarks 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.690
 with number plates builders dig 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.730
 foundation pit first 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.340
 set the concrete base then 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.560
 scaffolding poles in many places eternal 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.450
 permafrost features which power engineers 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.030
 will have to be considered in such places 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.610
 10 meter wells will be planned and 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.290
 builders will have to drive piles into them 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.570
 work and literally in the swamp and 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.930
 defeat the rocks a lot of sites 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.090
 marshy areas a lot line 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.750
 cross the passes which 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.460
 characterized by rocky soil 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.910
 respectively, the supports are mounted on 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.050
 top point to ensure 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.170
 maximum distance from wire to 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.590
 land yes and to get to these supports 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.780
 at 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.450
 have to produce very large 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.250
 rock bundle length 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.890
 lines rotokan tent central 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.900
 will be almost 400 kilometers and all she 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.330
 will be built off-road conditions, 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.979
 remoteness from civilization he is among 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.390
 Kama hydro power station at full capacity 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.830
 power could provide 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.390
 electricity all Kolyma 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.729
 but there are not enough lines for it 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.380
 power lines so the station is often 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.750
 do idle discharges to just 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.759
 get rid of excess energy on 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.800
 last year's station under construction miles in 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.170
 operation of the first two hydraulic units 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.450
 it is planned that there will be a total of four 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.120
 however the power generated by the station 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.050
 now actually locked inside it 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.410
 but to work today about 45 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.040
 percent of what the present could 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.719
 time 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.829
 on handicap open them at this state 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:32.690
 from design capacity 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:35.030
 it's there 15 percent probably 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.010
 power lines which will connect u 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.420
 middle peasant hellish from the territory of the greater 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.460
 parts of the head are planning to surrender in 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.040
 operation next year 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.090
 this work needs to be continued more 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.620
 the fast pace we still have stock 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.710
 need to build two more lines 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.280
 power lines suit chock chuck and 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.120
 flight berry all this whole complex 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.150
 measures 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.640
 which creates a serious base for 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.490
 connecting our power system with 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.770
 power system of Yakutia and capacity 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.910
 new production capacity 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.070
 it is planned that Nizhnekamsk hydroelectric station 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.260
 provide the largest energy reserves 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.390
 gold deposits in Russia on Talkin 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.460
 ska and from here the electricity will go to 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.620
 Pavlik mine preparing for launch 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.330
 new power lines will allow 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.070
 start exploring unexplored 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.620
 deposits i slam yang said 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:28.600
