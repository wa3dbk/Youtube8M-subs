00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.420 
is about my third actual online match
using<00:00:14.840> the<00:00:15.080> gamepad<00:00:15.260> I<00:00:15.500> started<00:00:16.010> off<00:00:16.160> a<00:00:16.400> little

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
using the gamepad I started off a little

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.220 
using the gamepad I started off a little
bit<00:00:16.880> of<00:00:17.000> combat<00:00:17.390> training<00:00:17.599> to<00:00:17.810> be<00:00:17.900> honest<00:00:18.140> I

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
bit of combat training to be honest I

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.140 
bit of combat training to be honest I
didn't<00:00:18.439> play<00:00:18.560> that<00:00:18.590> much<00:00:18.770> um<00:00:19.700> but<00:00:20.000> when<00:00:20.119> I

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
didn't play that much um but when I

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.690 
didn't play that much um but when I
first<00:00:20.450> got<00:00:20.660> into<00:00:20.930> it<00:00:21.050> I<00:00:21.079> was<00:00:21.320> really<00:00:21.919> confused

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
first got into it I was really confused

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.609 
first got into it I was really confused
because<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:23.329> gamepad<00:00:23.750> felt<00:00:24.020> really<00:00:24.320> awkward

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
because the gamepad felt really awkward

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.890 
because the gamepad felt really awkward
and<00:00:25.009> the<00:00:25.579> controls<00:00:26.000> were<00:00:26.210> really<00:00:26.509> weird<00:00:26.750> as

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
and the controls were really weird as

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.870 
and the controls were really weird as
well<00:00:27.079> but<00:00:27.259> I<00:00:27.320> set<00:00:27.590> the<00:00:27.680> controls<00:00:27.919> over<00:00:28.340> to

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
well but I set the controls over to

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.639 
well but I set the controls over to
classic<00:00:29.300> mode<00:00:29.509> and<00:00:29.810> that<00:00:30.110> fixed<00:00:30.320> everything

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:30.649 
classic mode and that fixed everything

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.650 
classic mode and that fixed everything
and<00:00:31.070> everything<00:00:31.460> felt<00:00:31.700> fairly<00:00:31.939> normal<00:00:32.180> I'm

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
and everything felt fairly normal I'm

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.360 
and everything felt fairly normal I'm
still<00:00:32.989> not<00:00:33.110> used<00:00:33.170> to<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:33.560> knife<00:00:33.770> button<00:00:34.190> being

believe<00:01:37.460> uh<00:01:38.350> I<00:01:39.350> actually<00:01:40.070> don't<00:01:40.340> know<00:01:40.490> what

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
believe uh I actually don't know what

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.130 
believe uh I actually don't know what
the<00:01:40.700> gun<00:01:40.820> is<00:01:40.940> called<00:01:41.180> I'm<00:01:41.420> not<00:01:41.570> even<00:01:41.750> gonna<00:01:41.840> try

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
the gun is called I'm not even gonna try

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.610 
the gun is called I'm not even gonna try
because<00:01:42.310> I'm<00:01:43.310> probably<00:01:43.910> wrong<00:01:44.450> but<00:01:44.510> so<00:01:45.200> far<00:01:45.560> I

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
because I'm probably wrong but so far I

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.190 
because I'm probably wrong but so far I
am<00:01:45.770> enjoying<00:01:46.370> black<00:01:46.670> ops<00:01:46.940> 2<00:01:47.180> on<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.900> wii<00:01:48.020> u<00:01:48.170> i

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
am enjoying black ops 2 on the wii u i

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.020 
am enjoying black ops 2 on the wii u i
really<00:01:48.830> like<00:01:49.010> a<00:01:49.040> couple<00:01:49.490> of<00:01:49.550> things<00:01:49.760> they've

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
really like a couple of things they've

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.570 
really like a couple of things they've
done<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.510> feel<00:01:50.780> like<00:01:50.960> no<00:01:51.530> one<00:01:51.890> controller

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
done I feel like no one controller

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.000 
done I feel like no one controller
scheme<00:01:53.000> is<00:01:53.180> too<00:01:53.530> overpowered<00:01:54.530> I<00:01:54.620> have<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.830> say

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
scheme is too overpowered I have to say

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.290 
scheme is too overpowered I have to say
the<00:01:55.190> gamepad<00:01:55.640> is<00:01:55.670> probably<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.090> little

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
the gamepad is probably a little

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.480 
the gamepad is probably a little
underpowered<00:01:56.720> just<00:01:57.320> because<00:01:57.590> of<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.740> awkward

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
underpowered just because of the awkward

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.820 
underpowered just because of the awkward
feeling<00:01:58.820> of<00:01:58.940> it<00:01:59.060> but<00:01:59.300> of<00:01:59.780> course<00:02:00.290> I<00:02:00.560> don't<00:02:00.710> have

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
feeling of it but of course I don't have

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.760 
feeling of it but of course I don't have
the<00:02:00.980> classic<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:02.210> Wii<00:02:02.390> U<00:02:02.600> pro<00:02:02.630> controller<00:02:02.990> yet

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
the classic the Wii U pro controller yet

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.740 
the classic the Wii U pro controller yet
i<00:02:04.070> might<00:02:04.280> get<00:02:04.550> that<00:02:04.580> this<00:02:05.120> christmas<00:02:05.540> but<00:02:05.720> i

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
i might get that this christmas but i

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.729 
i might get that this christmas but i
really<00:02:06.050> am<00:02:06.170> enjoying<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.590> gamepad<00:02:07.209> of<00:02:08.209> course

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
really am enjoying the gamepad of course

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.779 
really am enjoying the gamepad of course
there's<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.800> classic<00:02:10.009> controller<00:02:10.280> pro<00:02:10.610> i

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
there's the classic controller pro i

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.040 
there's the classic controller pro i
think<00:02:11.030> that's<00:02:11.150> what<00:02:11.300> almost<00:02:11.420> everyone<00:02:11.810> is

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
think that's what almost everyone is

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.020 
think that's what almost everyone is
using<00:02:12.230> that<00:02:12.440> I'm<00:02:12.680> seen<00:02:12.980> although<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.670> can

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
using that I'm seen although you can

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.610 
using that I'm seen although you can
never<00:02:14.180> be<00:02:14.390> sure<00:02:14.420> whether<00:02:14.810> somebody's<00:02:15.500> using

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
never be sure whether somebody's using

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.650 
never be sure whether somebody's using
the<00:02:15.770> gamepad<00:02:16.010> rest

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
the gamepad rest

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.390 
the gamepad rest
p<00:02:16.810> but<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.470> can<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.650> think<00:02:17.980> there<00:02:18.070> are<00:02:18.100> subtle

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
p but you can I think there are subtle

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.460 
p but you can I think there are subtle
differences<00:02:18.580> within<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.450> when<00:02:20.350> you're

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
differences within the when you're

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.110 
differences within the when you're
watching<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.890> game<00:02:21.010> play<00:02:21.220> if<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.490> can<00:02:21.670> spot

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
watching the game play if you can spot

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.200 
watching the game play if you can spot
those<00:02:22.360> go<00:02:23.290> for<00:02:23.320> it<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:24.520> only<00:02:24.670> thing<00:02:24.850> that

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
those go for it and the only thing that

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.120 
those go for it and the only thing that
saves<00:02:25.480> just<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.810> tad<00:02:26.290> over<00:02:26.320> powered<00:02:26.950> on<00:02:27.040> the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
saves just a tad over powered on the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.490 
saves just a tad over powered on the
wiimote<00:02:27.490> is<00:02:27.670> people<00:02:28.300> getting<00:02:28.570> SMGs<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.350> just

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
wiimote is people getting SMGs and just

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.620 
wiimote is people getting SMGs and just
doing<00:02:29.650> their<00:02:29.860> wiimote<00:02:30.280> sprain<00:02:30.610> but<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.510> know

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
doing their wiimote sprain but you know

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.330 
doing their wiimote sprain but you know
hipfire<00:02:32.110> sprain<00:02:32.530> has<00:02:32.710> always<00:02:32.920> been<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.100> little

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
hipfire sprain has always been a little

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.760 
hipfire sprain has always been a little
bit<00:02:33.670> overpowered<00:02:34.420> on<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.600> wiimote<00:02:34.930> but<00:02:35.110> so

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
bit overpowered on the wiimote but so

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.460 
bit overpowered on the wiimote but so
far<00:02:35.920> i'm<00:02:36.160> finding<00:02:36.550> not<00:02:36.820> too<00:02:37.210> many<00:02:37.480> balancing

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
far i'm finding not too many balancing

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.580 
far i'm finding not too many balancing
issues<00:02:38.880> people<00:02:39.880> do<00:02:40.150> die<00:02:40.360> fairly<00:02:41.080> quickly<00:02:41.320> and

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
issues people do die fairly quickly and

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.710 
issues people do die fairly quickly and
