people<00:00:10.830> not<00:00:10.980> knowing<00:00:11.280> where<00:00:11.430> the<00:00:11.519> water<00:00:11.700> comes

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
people not knowing where the water comes

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.779 
people not knowing where the water comes
from<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.420> not<00:00:12.570> unique<00:00:12.959> to<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.709> desert<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.280> think

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:14.789 
from is not unique to the desert I think

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.330 
from is not unique to the desert I think
its<00:00:14.940> worldwide<00:00:15.299> if<00:00:15.959> you've<00:00:16.380> got<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> faucet<00:00:17.130> and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
its worldwide if you've got a faucet and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.330 
its worldwide if you've got a faucet and
you<00:00:17.369> turn<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.210> faucet<00:00:19.009> pretty<00:00:20.009> much<00:00:20.189> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
you turn on that faucet pretty much the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.710 
you turn on that faucet pretty much the
extent<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.790> knowledge<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.240> my<00:00:21.480> water

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
extent of the knowledge is my water

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.290 
extent of the knowledge is my water
comes<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.200> this<00:00:22.320> faucet<00:00:22.610> but<00:00:23.610> what<00:00:23.849> gets<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
comes from this faucet but what gets the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.530 
comes from this faucet but what gets the
water<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.170> faucet

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.810 

so<00:00:29.170> this<00:00:29.290> is<00:00:29.500> absolutely<00:00:29.950> a<00:00:30.040> regional<00:00:30.400> problem

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
so this is absolutely a regional problem

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.060 
so this is absolutely a regional problem
but<00:00:30.970> it's<00:00:31.090> also<00:00:31.270> a<00:00:31.420> global<00:00:31.840> problem<00:00:32.070> because

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
but it's also a global problem because

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.020 
but it's also a global problem because
of<00:00:33.370> the<00:00:34.050> drainage<00:00:35.400> infrastructure<00:00:36.400> that<00:00:36.880> we

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
of the drainage infrastructure that we

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.690 
of the drainage infrastructure that we
create<00:00:37.420> that<00:00:37.960> gets<00:00:38.230> rid<00:00:38.440> of<00:00:38.470> our<00:00:38.680> free<00:00:39.040> local

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
create that gets rid of our free local

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.330 
create that gets rid of our free local
waters<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.360> oftentimes<00:00:41.230> leads<00:00:42.130> the

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
waters and oftentimes leads the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.310 
waters and oftentimes leads the
contamination<00:00:43.000> of<00:00:43.030> that<00:00:43.150> water<00:00:43.330> we're<00:00:43.900> having

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
contamination of that water we're having

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.740 
contamination of that water we're having
to<00:00:44.590> import<00:00:45.160> all<00:00:45.580> across<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.300> globe
