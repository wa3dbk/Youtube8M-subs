 speak personal beauty welcome to 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.150
 plus the video in which the geo game channel is the 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.549
 next more news for you 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.170
 about md 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.050
 it highlights five key 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.060
 features that directx 12 brings 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.779
 Buffet behavior storage 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.539
 command 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.789
 green or overload is reduced by 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.099
 significantly since the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.040
 communication of nuclei occurs in a 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.500
 between cpu and gpu is the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.110
 second is the absolute time required 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.210
 to complete complex CPU tasks is 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.149
 remarkably reduced to the third 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.489
 clÃ³vis workloads will let the screen to 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.020
 new studios or the distribution of 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.670
 game tasks can be 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.700
 significantly distributed in 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.180
 four or more cpu cores the new 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.210
 bandwidth and wi-fi and allows 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.489
 make calls and make the most of the peaks 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.010
 high processing power 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.280
 so many more detailed in kind 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.680
 expert more consignments at stake is 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.350
 fifth is all cpu cores 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.320
 can now talk to 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.909
 video card was the same as the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.729
 manufacturer provides a description 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.680
 direct x 12 when you say 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.110
 which opens quotation marks 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.060
 would be a monumental change is like leaving 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.520
 two-lane runway and for one 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.990
 with eight hands to go to 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.210
 eight hands to go back 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.610
 thanks to the uses it accelerates if the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.079
 from cpu to gpu and can 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.570
 provide better quality of 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.000
 image frame rates for those who 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.119
 opt to use it to demonstrate 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.060
 your benefits to stardock games have 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.390
 cooperated with amd for the next 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.930
 reches office English game's outcome 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.659
 strategies the sky and developer brazil 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.579
 keep saying that directx 12 offers 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.509
 quality performance of images and 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.520
 resolutions that are something elusive 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.420
 impossible to perform on the version 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.860
 previous tha each of each game is 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.410
 has a list of tasks that the cpu 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.470
 should retransmit as soon as possible 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.260
 for the grateful plate ie is the gpu 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.270
 this is called the reverse command and 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.850
 may include things vital to the 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.100
 playing a game such as lighting is 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.890
 put the characters loading 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.690
 texture and reflection effects generation 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.380
 although the process of processors 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.490
 multi-core being over 7 years old 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.740
 limited by previous versions of the 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.110
 direct x for not availing and of the various 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.660
 cores efficiently these versions 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.360
 have been struggling to reduce 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.760
 command buffer being cut in 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.070
 pieces of sensitive form being 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.410
 distributed through the cores to 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.320
 work in parallel with the nature of 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.940
 direct x 11 of its predecessors did 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.670
 with an overload of 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.920
 work between cpu and gpu creating delay 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.709
 significant amount of time the driver takes 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.709
 to interpret the commands is 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.200
 this extra time causes instability in the 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.500
 performance with a multi topic system 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.190
 or directx 12 multitasking 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.870
 This tends not to happen, okay, people. 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.790
 This brings this news to you. 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.560
