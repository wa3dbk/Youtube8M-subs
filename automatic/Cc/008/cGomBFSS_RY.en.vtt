interesting in their own way but I like

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.469 
interesting in their own way but I like
walking<00:00:45.949> on<00:00:46.040> a<00:00:46.100> path<00:00:46.339> less<00:00:46.730> traveled<00:00:49.390> kind<00:00:50.390> of

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:50.479 
walking on a path less traveled kind of

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.600 
walking on a path less traveled kind of
discovering<00:00:51.409> things<00:00:51.530> from<00:00:51.800> myself<00:00:52.100> rather

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
discovering things from myself rather

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.080

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.650 

I<00:00:57.550> think<00:00:58.550> that<00:00:58.670> originality<00:00:59.060> is<00:00:59.420> really

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
I think that originality is really

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.990 
I think that originality is really
important<00:01:00.050> I<00:01:00.080> mean<00:01:00.250> it's<00:01:01.250> really<00:01:01.490> important

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
important I mean it's really important

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.540 
important I mean it's really important
but<00:01:02.540> at<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:03.260> same<00:01:03.440> time<00:01:03.680> you<00:01:03.950> need<00:01:04.129> your

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
but at the same time you need your

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.760 
but at the same time you need your
staples<00:01:05.089> that<00:01:05.510> oh<00:01:05.720> you<00:01:06.140> know<00:01:06.229> everyone's

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
staples that oh you know everyone's

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.710 
staples that oh you know everyone's
always<00:01:06.950> going<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:07.310> have<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.760> pair<00:01:08.180> of<00:01:08.210> amazing

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
always going to have a pair of amazing

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.600 
always going to have a pair of amazing
black<00:01:08.990> boots<00:01:09.290> or<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.590> good<00:01:09.800> leather<00:01:09.920> jacket<00:01:10.400> or

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
black boots or a good leather jacket or

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.400 
black boots or a good leather jacket or
a<00:01:10.640> good<00:01:10.820> pair<00:01:11.000> of<00:01:11.030> jeans<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:11.630> in<00:01:11.750> that

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
a good pair of jeans and so in that

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.790 
a good pair of jeans and so in that

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
respect it's not always mandatory but in

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.370 
respect it's not always mandatory but in
London<00:01:16.070> especially<00:01:16.940> I<00:01:16.970> think<00:01:17.150> being<00:01:17.900> original

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
London especially I think being original

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.380 
London especially I think being original
is<00:01:18.560> really<00:01:18.770> important<00:01:19.280> because<00:01:19.369> in<00:01:19.760> London
