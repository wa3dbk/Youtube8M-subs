00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
like it has a pretty good supposed to be

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.070 
like it has a pretty good supposed to be
leather<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.210> don't<00:00:27.510> know<00:00:27.570> if<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.900> really

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
leather I don't know if this is really

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.080 
leather I don't know if this is really
leather<00:00:28.380> or<00:00:28.529> not<00:00:28.710> probably<00:00:29.550> prefer<00:00:29.880> that

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
leather or not probably prefer that

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.749 
leather or not probably prefer that
weren't<00:00:30.660> actually<00:00:30.840> real<00:00:31.230> leather<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.769> would

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
weren't actually real leather I would

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.850 
weren't actually real leather I would
guess<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.059> isn't<00:00:33.239> feel<00:00:33.840> sort<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.170> vitally<00:00:34.710> to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
guess it isn't feel sort of vitally to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.930 
guess it isn't feel sort of vitally to
me<00:00:36.380> but<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.530> substantial<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.489> feels<00:00:38.730> like

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
me but it's substantial it feels like

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.299 
me but it's substantial it feels like
something<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.360> your<00:00:39.450> hand<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:39.780> you'd<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.309> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
something in your hand if you'd like the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.619 
something in your hand if you'd like the
fact<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.790> kindle<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.300> little<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.809> so

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
fact that the kindle is so little and so

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.479 
fact that the kindle is so little and so
sort<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.719> slight<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.289> light<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.129> this

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
sort of slight and light and this

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.639 
sort of slight and light and this
doesn't<00:00:47.730> add<00:00:47.910> anything<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.780> create

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
doesn't add anything it's just create

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.860 
doesn't add anything it's just create
some<00:00:49.890> sort<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.190> bulk<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.210> i<00:00:51.360> kind<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
some sort of bulk but i kind of like the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.770 
some sort of bulk but i kind of like the
bulkiness<00:00:52.399> not<00:00:53.399> too<00:00:53.579> bulky<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.239> feels<00:00:54.390> you

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
bulkiness not too bulky but it feels you

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.020 
bulkiness not too bulky but it feels you
know<00:00:54.809> substantial<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.489> way<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.610> works<00:00:56.730> is

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
know substantial so the way it works is

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.139 
know substantial so the way it works is
it<00:00:57.180> closes<00:00:57.719> by<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.020> little<00:00:58.609> flap<00:00:59.609> which<00:00:59.969> is

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it closes by this little flap which is

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.240 
it closes by this little flap which is
has<00:01:00.449> two<00:01:00.690> little<00:01:00.780> magnets<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.129> that's

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
has two little magnets in it and that's

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.119 
has two little magnets in it and that's
one<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> drawbacks<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:04.769> magnets

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
one of the drawbacks is that the magnets

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.300 
one of the drawbacks is that the magnets
are<00:01:05.309> pretty<00:01:05.549> weak<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.390> it'll<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.619> its<00:01:07.799> job<00:01:08.010> I

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
are pretty weak it it'll do its job I

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.830 
are pretty weak it it'll do its job I
feel<00:01:08.670> pretty<00:01:08.970> confident<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:09.689> not

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
feel pretty confident that it's not

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.910 
feel pretty confident that it's not
going<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.080> open<00:01:10.290> up<00:01:12.350> while<00:01:13.350> I'm<00:01:13.470> carrying<00:01:13.830> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
going to open up while I'm carrying it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.440 
going to open up while I'm carrying it
around<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.810> it's<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:17.090> velcro<00:01:18.090> would<00:01:18.330> be

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
around but it's not velcro would be

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.120 
around but it's not velcro would be
stronger<00:01:18.900> let's<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.409> say<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.740> although

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
stronger let's just say that although

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.630 
stronger let's just say that although
not<00:01:20.670> as<00:01:20.820> aesthetically<00:01:21.420> pleasing<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:23.580> you

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
not as aesthetically pleasing so you

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.550 
not as aesthetically pleasing so you
open<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.299> opens<00:01:24.450> up<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.840> an<00:01:24.990> easel<00:01:25.350> and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
open it up it opens up like an easel and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.870 
open it up it opens up like an easel and
the<00:01:25.740> first<00:01:25.920> thing<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.159> could<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.430> sort<00:01:26.790> of

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the first thing you could do is sort of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.060 
the first thing you could do is sort of
flip<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.119> flap<00:01:27.659> around<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.500> it

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
flip the flap around and just it

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.789 
flip the flap around and just it
magnetizes<00:01:29.790> itself<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.299> closes<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.990> you

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
magnetizes itself it closes in it you

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.600 
magnetizes itself it closes in it you
can<00:01:31.950> read<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> up<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:34.430> some<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
can read it up like this so some of the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.600 
can read it up like this so some of the
good<00:01:35.729> things<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:37.040> pretty<00:01:38.040> solidly

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
good things are that it's pretty solidly

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.219 
good things are that it's pretty solidly
in<00:01:38.909> there<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.360> not<00:01:39.479> going<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.750> come<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:39.990> you

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
in there it's not going to come out you

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.980 
in there it's not going to come out you
sort<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.530> slide<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.360> through<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.479> top<00:01:42.509> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
sort of slide it in through the top and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.010 
sort of slide it in through the top and
it<00:01:43.110> has<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.500> little<00:01:44.630> leather<00:01:45.630> or<00:01:45.930> vinyl

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
it has this little leather or vinyl

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.899 
it has this little leather or vinyl
strip<00:01:46.740> here<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> middle<00:01:47.369> which<00:01:47.610> I'm<00:01:47.759> not

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
strip here in the middle which I'm not

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.490 
strip here in the middle which I'm not
really<00:01:48.360> such<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> big<00:01:49.110> fan<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:52.170> holds<00:01:52.350> it

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
really such a big fan of but it holds it

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.350 
really such a big fan of but it holds it
in<00:01:52.619> place<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.829> leaves<00:01:53.159> space<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> sides

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
in place it leaves space on the sides

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.819 
in place it leaves space on the sides
for<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.689> buttons<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.380> buttons<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
for the buttons the buttons on the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.709 
for the buttons the buttons on the
bottom<00:01:55.950> now<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:57.119> another<00:01:57.329> one<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
bottom now that's another one of the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.270 
bottom now that's another one of the
drawbacks<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.469> unless<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:58.860> all<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
drawbacks is that unless it's all the

the Kindle if you have fat fingers like
I<00:02:09.660> do<00:02:09.720> then

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
I do then

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.849 
I do then
it's<00:02:10.689> not<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:11.079> makes<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.379> little<00:02:11.469> harder<00:02:11.829> to

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:11.859 
it's not it makes it a little harder to

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:15.509 
it's not it makes it a little harder to
do<00:02:12.099> that<00:02:12.280> but<00:02:13.180> it's<00:02:13.989> not<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.409> big<00:02:14.859> deal<00:02:14.889> my<00:02:15.310> fat

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
do that but it's not a big deal my fat

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.699 
do that but it's not a big deal my fat
fingers<00:02:15.730> can<00:02:16.120> manage<00:02:16.450> all<00:02:16.599> right<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:18.569> then

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
fingers can manage all right and then

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.020 
fingers can manage all right and then
what<00:02:20.709> else<00:02:20.859> did<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.189> want<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.489> say<00:02:21.579> all<00:02:21.760> right<00:02:21.849> so

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
what else did I want to say all right so

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.239 
what else did I want to say all right so
on<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.989> back<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.409> has<00:02:23.469> this<00:02:23.739> sort<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:24.040> like<00:02:24.219> a

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:24.249 
on the back it has this sort of like a

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.250 
on the back it has this sort of like a
picture<00:02:24.489> frame<00:02:24.639> II<00:02:24.939> kind<00:02:25.299> of<00:02:25.420> thing<00:02:25.599> and<00:02:25.810> the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
picture frame II kind of thing and the

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.979 
picture frame II kind of thing and the
deal<00:02:26.469> with<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.769> is<00:02:26.980> that<00:02:27.010> there<00:02:27.370> are<00:02:27.489> these

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
deal with that is that there are these

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.140 
deal with that is that there are these
ridges<00:02:28.989> these<00:02:29.439> grooves<00:02:29.829> and<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.819> can<00:02:31.000> just

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
ridges these grooves and you can just

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.539 
ridges these grooves and you can just
sort<00:02:31.329> of<00:02:31.560> set<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:32.650> up<00:02:32.769> like<00:02:32.829> that<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.280> if<00:02:33.430> you

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
sort of set it up like that so if you

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.360 
sort of set it up like that so if you
read<00:02:33.760> your<00:02:34.000> kindle<00:02:34.209> on<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:35.349> bed<00:02:35.709> like<00:02:36.159> I<00:02:36.310> do

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
read your kindle on the bed like I do

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.190 
read your kindle on the bed like I do
sort<00:02:36.819> of<00:02:36.969> lie<00:02:37.090> again<00:02:37.359> usually<00:02:37.719> I'm<00:02:37.840> lying<00:02:38.079> down

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
sort of lie again usually I'm lying down

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.509 
sort of lie again usually I'm lying down
all<00:02:38.469> like<00:02:38.829> 180<00:02:39.760> degrees<00:02:41.040> parallel<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.219> the<00:02:42.340> bed

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
all like 180 degrees parallel to the bed

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.270 
all like 180 degrees parallel to the bed
so<00:02:42.790> this<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.090> actually<00:02:43.359> not<00:02:43.689> I<00:02:44.049> would<00:02:44.980> want<00:02:45.159> it

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
so this is actually not I would want it

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.309 
so this is actually not I would want it
to<00:02:45.400> sort<00:02:45.549> of<00:02:45.669> be<00:02:45.849> more<00:02:45.879> like<00:02:46.299> this<00:02:46.480> but<00:02:47.200> it

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
to sort of be more like this but it

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.500 
to sort of be more like this but it
doesn't<00:02:47.590> go<00:02:47.739> like<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:48.159> is<00:02:48.370> as<00:02:48.549> high<00:02:49.269> as<00:02:49.299> it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
doesn't go like this is as high as it

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.659 
doesn't go like this is as high as it
goes<00:02:49.569> but<00:02:49.900> if<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.109> sort<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.409> sit<00:02:50.650> in<00:02:51.159> an<00:02:51.519> L

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:51.669 
goes but if you sort of sit in an L

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.490 
goes but if you sort of sit in an L
shape<00:02:51.699> I<00:02:52.180> think<00:02:52.359> it<00:02:52.480> would<00:02:52.599> be<00:02:52.959> just<00:02:53.109> fine<00:02:53.319> and

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
shape I think it would be just fine and

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.110 
shape I think it would be just fine and
you<00:02:53.590> can<00:02:53.739> adjust<00:02:53.859> this<00:02:54.159> so<00:02:54.549> that<00:02:54.699> it<00:02:54.790> goes<00:02:54.879> back

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
you can adjust this so that it goes back

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.939 
you can adjust this so that it goes back
a<00:02:55.150> little<00:02:55.389> a<00:02:55.659> little<00:02:56.079> bit<00:02:56.349> that<00:02:56.530> sort<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:56.799> works

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:56.949 
a little a little bit that sort of works

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:05.069 
a little a little bit that sort of works
like<00:02:57.099> a<00:02:57.150> lawn<00:02:58.150> chair<00:03:00.689> so<00:03:01.689> uh<00:03:02.609> yeah<00:03:03.609> I<00:03:03.639> think<00:03:04.090> if

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
like a lawn chair so uh yeah I think if

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.289 
like a lawn chair so uh yeah I think if
you<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.829> bottom<00:03:06.459> line<00:03:06.549> I<00:03:06.609> guess<00:03:06.760> would<00:03:07.239> be

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
you the bottom line I guess would be

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.449 
you the bottom line I guess would be
that<00:03:07.480> if<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:07.870> like<00:03:08.079> holding<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:08.859> kindle<00:03:09.219> as<00:03:09.430> a

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
that if you like holding the kindle as a

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.720 
that if you like holding the kindle as a
kindle<00:03:09.939> really<00:03:10.299> you<00:03:11.049> like<00:03:11.199> it's<00:03:11.439> very<00:03:11.769> small

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
kindle really you like it's very small

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.849 
kindle really you like it's very small
pneus<00:03:12.959> then<00:03:13.959> i<00:03:14.349> would<00:03:14.859> go<00:03:14.889> with<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:16.379> they<00:03:17.379> sell

pneus then i would go with a they sell

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.490 
pneus then i would go with a they sell
you<00:03:18.400> need<00:03:18.639> a<00:03:18.669> case<00:03:18.939> because<00:03:19.689> otherwise<00:03:20.199> when

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
to like 18 bucks I think it's worth 25

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.020

bucks<00:04:02.199> to<00:04:02.949> protect<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.340> kindle<00:04:03.639> and<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.879> look

cool and to be able to prop it up like

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.189 
cool and to be able to prop it up like
an<00:04:06.069> easel<00:04:06.569> but<00:04:07.569> it's<00:04:07.719> probably<00:04:07.959> definitely

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.199 
an easel but it's probably definitely

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.990 
an easel but it's probably definitely
worth<00:04:08.500> 18<00:04:08.829> bucks<00:04:09.099> there's<00:04:09.370> another<00:04:09.609> version

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
that looks like it's probably made in

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.089 
that looks like it's probably made in
the<00:04:12.159> same<00:04:12.400> factory<00:04:12.849> in<00:04:13.030> China<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.719> a<00:04:14.079> case<00:04:14.709> and

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
the same factory in China the a case and

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.310 
the same factory in China the a case and
I<00:04:15.549> don't<00:04:15.699> know<00:04:15.789> I<00:04:15.819> mean<00:04:15.969> I<00:04:16.030> assume<00:04:16.209> it's<00:04:16.599> just<00:04:17.079> a

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
I don't know I mean I assume it's just a

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.680 
I don't know I mean I assume it's just a
different<00:04:17.500> rule

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
different rule

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.479 
different rule
cigna<00:04:18.900> that<00:04:19.320> someone<00:04:19.709> effects<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.220> it<00:04:20.340> but

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
cigna that someone effects to it but

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.770 
cigna that someone effects to it but
it's<00:04:20.640> probably<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.150> same<00:04:21.330> thing<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.630> that's

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
it's probably the same thing and that's

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.120 
it's probably the same thing and that's
I<00:04:21.900> think<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:22.140> little<00:04:22.260> bit<00:04:22.410> cheaper<00:04:22.740> by<00:04:22.890> a<00:04:22.920> couple

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
I think a little bit cheaper by a couple

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.250 
I think a little bit cheaper by a couple
