00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
we're going to come back make the slides

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.770 
we're going to come back make the slides
even<00:01:34.470> longer<00:01:35.070> add<00:01:35.280> an<00:01:35.820> additional<00:01:36.270> player<00:01:36.509> go

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
even longer add an additional player go

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.109 
even longer add an additional player go
to<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.080> offense<00:01:37.500> as<00:01:37.710> well<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.490> defensive

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
to the offense as well as the defensive

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.880 
to the offense as well as the defensive
slide<00:01:39.299> package<00:01:39.570> making<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> little<00:01:40.650> bit<00:01:40.770> more

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
slide package making a little bit more

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.620 
slide package making a little bit more
complicated<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:42.240> we're<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.509> go

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
complicated and then we're going to go

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.230 
complicated and then we're going to go
back<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.899> even<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.860> what<00:01:44.040> happens<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
back to even so what happens is the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.120 
back to even so what happens is the
coach<00:01:45.450> starts<00:01:45.840> with<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.080> ball<00:01:46.290> out<00:01:46.500> here<00:01:46.530> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
coach starts with a ball out here and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.160 
coach starts with a ball out here and
the<00:01:47.580> coach<00:01:47.820> decides<00:01:48.299> which<00:01:48.690> of<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> four

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the coach decides which of the four

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.050 
the coach decides which of the four
corners<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:50.009> he's<00:01:50.580> going<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.880> roll<00:01:51.000> over

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
corners that he's going to roll over

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.050 
corners that he's going to roll over
often<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.229> let's<00:01:52.440> say<00:01:52.590> hypothetically<00:01:53.060> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
often so let's say hypothetically the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.179 
often so let's say hypothetically the
coach<00:01:54.299> rolls<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:54.899> ball<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.470> corner<00:01:55.830> here

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
coach rolls the ball to this corner here

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.940 
coach rolls the ball to this corner here
and<00:01:56.490> blows<00:01:56.759> whistle<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.990> offensive<00:01:58.710> player

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
and blows whistle this offensive player

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.469 
and blows whistle this offensive player
picks<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> ball<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.330> starts<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.439> attack

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479

ball goes in that corner this particular
defensive<00:02:09.179> player<00:02:09.390> can't<00:02:10.319> move<00:02:10.530> he's<00:02:10.950> frozen

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
until he hears a second whistle so the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.240 
until he hears a second whistle so the
players<00:02:15.420> don't<00:02:15.780> know<00:02:16.110> whether<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.709> open<00:02:17.040> man

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
players don't know whether the open man

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.100 
players don't know whether the open man
is<00:02:17.430> going<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:17.730> until<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.630> coach<00:02:18.840> actually

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
is going to be until the coach actually

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.440 
is going to be until the coach actually
rolls<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.680> ball<00:02:19.709> once<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.760> coach<00:02:20.940> rolls<00:02:21.269> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
rolls the ball once the coach rolls the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.789 
rolls the ball once the coach rolls the
ball<00:02:21.660> would<00:02:21.810> we<00:02:21.930> understand<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.680> this

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
ball would we understand that this

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.800 
ball would we understand that this
attackman<00:02:23.400> has<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.700> ball<00:02:23.850> he's<00:02:24.510> going<00:02:24.750> to

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
attackman has the ball he's going to

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.590 
attackman has the ball he's going to
drive<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.860> obviously<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.819> smile<00:02:27.120> needs<00:02:27.450> to

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
drive so obviously the smile needs to

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.650 
drive so obviously the smile needs to
come<00:02:27.810> out<00:02:28.049> here<00:02:28.590> or<00:02:29.069> even<00:02:29.549> come<00:02:29.760> down<00:02:29.940> here<00:02:30.450> and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
come out here or even come down here and

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.630 
come out here or even come down here and
as<00:02:31.110> soon<00:02:31.290> as<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:31.590> one<00:02:31.799> sparks<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:32.489> one

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
as soon as this one sparks this one

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.120 
as soon as this one sparks this one
comes<00:02:32.880> in<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.299> is<00:02:33.450> splitting<00:02:33.870> too<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.620> this

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
comes in and is splitting too and this

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.819 
comes in and is splitting too and this
defender<00:02:35.670> sags<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.600> then<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.650> where

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
defender sags in and then this is where

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.979 
defender sags in and then this is where
it<00:02:37.920> gets<00:02:38.100> interesting<00:02:38.310> because<00:02:38.820> now<00:02:39.209> the

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
it gets interesting because now the

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.630 
it gets interesting because now the
offense<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.590> trying<00:02:40.859> to<00:02:40.950> find<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.280> open<00:02:41.609> man

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
offense is trying to find the open man

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.300 
offense is trying to find the open man
and<00:02:42.150> they're<00:02:42.660> actually<00:02:42.840> playing<00:02:43.530> for<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.100> very

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
and they're actually playing for a very

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.630 
and they're actually playing for a very
short<00:02:44.670> period<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:45.120> time<00:02:45.620> with<00:02:46.620> four<00:02:47.010> offensive

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
short period of time with four offensive

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.030 
short period of time with four offensive
players<00:02:47.880> versus<00:02:48.870> three<00:02:49.140> defensive<00:02:49.739> players

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
players versus three defensive players

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.280 
players versus three defensive players
because<00:02:50.910> this<00:02:51.090> player<00:02:51.299> this<00:02:51.750> defense<00:02:52.140> ER

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
because this player this defense ER

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.560 
because this player this defense ER
where<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.709> balls<00:02:52.950> first<00:02:53.280> world<00:02:53.609> is<00:02:53.970> frozen

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
where the balls first world is frozen

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.690 
where the balls first world is frozen
then<00:02:55.170> shortly<00:02:55.620> thereafter<00:02:55.709> you're<00:02:56.489> going<00:02:56.640> to

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
then shortly thereafter you're going to

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.509 
then shortly thereafter you're going to
hear<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.880> second<00:02:57.420> whistle<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.290> DVD<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:59.100> the

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
hear a second whistle on the DVD and the

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.280 
hear a second whistle on the DVD and the
second<00:02:59.970> was<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.390> indicates<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:01.109> this

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
second was so indicates that this

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.759 
second was so indicates that this
defenseman<00:03:01.950> now<00:03:02.459> joins<00:03:02.850> play<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:04.109> this<00:03:04.560> drill

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
defenseman now joins play so this drill

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.770 
defenseman now joins play so this drill
is<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.010> lot<00:03:05.340> even<00:03:05.850> though<00:03:06.150> everybody<00:03:06.570> knows

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
is a lot even though everybody knows

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.539 
is a lot even though everybody knows
where<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.350> hoop<00:03:07.500> command<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:08.040> going<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.310> start

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
where the hoop command is going to start

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:09.530 
where the hoop command is going to start
run<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.940> ball

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
run to the ball

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.569 
run to the ball
they<00:03:10.110> don't<00:03:10.349> understand<00:03:10.950> where<00:03:11.280> it's<00:03:11.459> going

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
they don't understand where it's going

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.580 
they don't understand where it's going
to<00:03:11.610> be<00:03:11.790> until<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.329> ball<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.569> rolled<00:03:12.959> then

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
to be until the ball is rolled then

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.550 
to be until the ball is rolled then
immediately<00:03:13.980> they<00:03:14.459> need<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.760> drive<00:03:15.120> hard<00:03:15.659> to

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
immediately they need to drive hard to

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.289 
immediately they need to drive hard to
the<00:03:16.680> ball<00:03:16.859> carrier<00:03:17.250> this<00:03:17.400> directly<00:03:17.819> emulates

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
the ball carrier this directly emulates

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.030 
the ball carrier this directly emulates
the<00:03:18.420> scenario<00:03:18.810> in<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.049> game<00:03:19.260> where<00:03:19.500> Blair<00:03:19.709> gets

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
the scenario in a game where Blair gets

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.880 
the scenario in a game where Blair gets
beat<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.609> his<00:03:21.150> attack<00:03:21.569> player<00:03:21.870> or<00:03:22.230> his

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
beat and his attack player or his

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.649 
beat and his attack player or his
offensive<00:03:23.400> player<00:03:23.579> is<00:03:23.760> now<00:03:23.909> driving<00:03:24.239> hard<00:03:24.629> to

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
offensive player is now driving hard to

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.660 
offensive player is now driving hard to
the<00:03:24.780> cage<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:25.409> you'll<00:03:25.920> see<00:03:26.129> with<00:03:26.310> this<00:03:26.459> group

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
the cage and you'll see with this group

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.220 
the cage and you'll see with this group
took<00:03:27.000> us<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.269> while<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.480> get<00:03:27.840> them<00:03:28.019> acclimated

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
took us a while to get them acclimated

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.380 
took us a while to get them acclimated
to<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.829> fact<00:03:29.069> that<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.939> know<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.150> first

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
to the fact that you know the first

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.270 
to the fact that you know the first
slide<00:03:30.629> is<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.170> ball<00:03:31.319> coming<00:03:31.650> in<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.189> that

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
slide is to the ball coming in and that

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.580 
slide is to the ball coming in and that
is<00:03:32.430> obviously<00:03:32.909> the<00:03:33.090> most<00:03:33.239> key<00:03:33.480> slide<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.109> then

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
is obviously the most key slide and then

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.589 
is obviously the most key slide and then
the<00:03:34.709> others<00:03:34.950> have<00:03:35.189> to<00:03:35.310> drift<00:03:35.579> in<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.030> then<00:03:36.480> the

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
the others have to drift in and then the

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.959 
the others have to drift in and then the
interesting<00:03:36.840> thing<00:03:37.319> is<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.859> once<00:03:38.459> we<00:03:38.700> play

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:38.969 
interesting thing is that once we play

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:41.509 
interesting thing is that once we play
uneven<00:03:39.659> and<00:03:39.959> we<00:03:40.230> have<00:03:40.409> to<00:03:40.560> adjust<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.250> slide

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
uneven and we have to adjust and slide

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.069 
uneven and we have to adjust and slide
with<00:03:41.849> only<00:03:42.000> three<00:03:42.299> defensive<00:03:42.870> players

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
with only three defensive players

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.289 
with only three defensive players
against<00:03:43.560> four<00:03:43.739> offensive<00:03:44.310> players<00:03:44.549> on<00:03:44.849> the

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
against four offensive players on the

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.690 
against four offensive players on the
second<00:03:45.750> whistle<00:03:45.930> this<00:03:46.650> defensive<00:03:47.280> player<00:03:47.459> now

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
second whistle this defensive player now

even I got number 4 I get Billy I got

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.809 
even I got number 4 I get Billy I got
Johnny<00:03:58.409> whatever<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.919> turns<00:03:59.040> out<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.310> be<00:03:59.430> and

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
Johnny whatever it turns out to be and

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.030 
Johnny whatever it turns out to be and
they<00:04:00.209> need<00:04:00.389> to<00:04:00.480> communicate<00:04:01.049> so<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.709> drill

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
they need to communicate so the drill

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.000 
they need to communicate so the drill
does<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.280> lot<00:04:02.639> it<00:04:03.629> spreads<00:04:04.049> out<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.470> field<00:04:04.709> and

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
does a lot it spreads out the field and

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.679 
does a lot it spreads out the field and
even<00:04:05.099> if<00:04:05.340> we<00:04:05.459> were<00:04:05.579> doing<00:04:05.849> this<00:04:05.939> drill<00:04:06.150> outside

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
even if we were doing this drill outside

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.780 
even if we were doing this drill outside
we<00:04:06.959> would<00:04:07.109> still<00:04:07.379> predominantly<00:04:08.129> run<00:04:08.549> with

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
we would still predominantly run with

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.280 
we would still predominantly run with
four<00:04:09.000> players<00:04:09.269> so<00:04:09.540> there's<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.810> lot<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:10.049> space

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
four players so there's a lot of space

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.080 
four players so there's a lot of space
why<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.040> there<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.310> lot<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.579> space<00:04:11.819> because<00:04:12.000> I

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
why is there a lot of space because I

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.699 
why is there a lot of space because I
want<00:04:12.299> kids<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.629> have<00:04:12.659> room<00:04:13.019> to<00:04:13.169> create<00:04:13.470> and

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
want kids to have room to create and

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.830 
want kids to have room to create and
move<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.400> recognize<00:04:14.909> where<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.329> open<00:04:15.629> player

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
move to recognize where the open player

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.640 
move to recognize where the open player
is<00:04:16.310> so<00:04:17.310> we<00:04:17.549> now<00:04:17.909> move<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.299> space<00:04:18.900> 2<00:04:19.229> of<00:04:19.470> our

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
is so we now move to space 2 of our

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.469 
is so we now move to space 2 of our
progression<00:04:20.220> if<00:04:20.340> you<00:04:20.459> will<00:04:20.639> we<00:04:21.209> start

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
progression if you will we start

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.740 
progression if you will we start
stacking<00:04:21.870> 3p2<00:04:22.199> here<00:04:23.010> we<00:04:23.130> move<00:04:23.310> into<00:04:23.750> movement

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
stacking 3p2 here we move into movement

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.500 
stacking 3p2 here we move into movement
for<00:04:24.990> v3<00:04:25.169> and<00:04:25.680> then<00:04:26.550> we<00:04:26.699> end<00:04:26.849> with<00:04:27.000> an<00:04:27.120> even

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
for v3 and then we end with an even

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.689 
for v3 and then we end with an even
scenario<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.229> again<00:04:28.830> we<00:04:29.250> keep<00:04:29.460> these

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
scenario and again we keep these

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.429 
scenario and again we keep these
extremely

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:31.439 
extremely

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.219 
extremely
and<00:04:31.860> moving
