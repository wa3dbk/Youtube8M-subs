00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:04.609
 here 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:09.070
 it works 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.209
 on 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.919
 Follow only 5 we look once again at the idea of â€‹â€‹a specific feature 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.999
 and start with the compromise 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:21.619
 It does exactly what you would expect from a compass just to the north 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:22.999
 demonstrate 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:26.589
 in the settings you can choose between geographical London at the tables and 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.219
 Toggle and when you get from the computer you can see that here 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:34.769
 obviously, my iMac confused in the compass so much that he does not care 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.679
 indicates that has a disturbance and I should him middle of the Bernese 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.460
 Remove the magnetic field 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.350
 and that can not be seen here again decided a bit again 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.350
 closer 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.310
 there is the nice hint 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.300
 and back again 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.280
 If you look closely then you can see that the nice hint us percent 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.010
 recommends calibrating the iPhone by moving it in one night 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.450
 so that the 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.000
 Compass see more and I work 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.400
 so expand the setting there are also innovations on the one hand 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.170
 Natural Nagib load that can be seen at the bottom like on the iPod Touch's 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.070
 second generation too 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.800
 here you can turn that on and off and wind power Plass specific features 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.350
 serve 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.310
 for me one of the most exciting features you could get from a colleague 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.369
 also clearly not read in order to think in the servants of each of us 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.380
 that's voice-over, for example 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.620
 which is certainly very badly implemented Lena now has to win here 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.770
 the measure 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.079
 guest 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.079
 St as approx 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.720
 Yes 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.760
 from approx 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.760
 8th 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.150
 guest 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.920
 have 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.030
 guest 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.290
 as a coach 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.290
 Guest guest 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.650
 guest 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.799
 b 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.519
 as a good guest 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.680
 So the trick is to be excused 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.159
 what the find law is the zoom that can be the park 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.620
 if you take well-sighted far-sighted is whatever 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.930
 to make known 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.879
 with his three fingers score twice 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.329
 so you zoomed 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.769
 and now important we can move the whole thing with three fingers 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.419
 so if you do that with one finger then you'll be more freaked out in ours 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.769
 Starting position and three fingers can move back and forth all year 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:44.289
 because I am a very nice thing 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:49.159
 but what else is going on right we can invest in the bushes 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.159
 You can also make it here as well as black and green with one click 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.419
 Mono audio too 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.799
 and auto-fill can also turn on and off here 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.859
 so much to the few centers gets Rose feature last the camera 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:06.039
 of course with video function 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:08.869
 around and out of pressure 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.879
 autofocus function so far in the quick test quite well you just type 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.679
 on the area you would like to focus on and percent larger 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:19.039
 The team is working from the short distance that I mean up 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:22.090
 ten inches now our under ten inches and still 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.219
 Schaeffler should also get the picture out of there 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.219
 So also quite useful for barcodes 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:31.999
 when a four-week high of knox's family feature turns on briefly 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.789
 Record price around ten weeks very very fast 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:37.919
 um and what exactly the same looks like there I turn on you in the video sometimes 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.459
 1 where we know that 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.639
 in principle, sometimes synonymous short the video editing function to therefore he could 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.329
 go to the album select the video 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.019
 then these parts lifted the master that a movie will just be in front 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:50.959
 and behind 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.199
 press to apply the repayment and percent shift position and then press 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.149
 the video cuts us to the right we have no other function only in one 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:02.069
 is cut then it is just so and if it has cut off too much 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.069
 then he strengthens 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.339
 Son at the conclusion Chance again a mid-May from recorded video 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.359
 by name, Fry 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:30.210
 firmly 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.029
 here 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:36.189
 the phasing out of this episode had been his photo dpa in the next few weeks 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:38.460
 Comparison test between 3g and 3gs 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.410
 whether it then loses its office in value while being viewed on the majority 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.839
 Page again and let that go
