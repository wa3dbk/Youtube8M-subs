00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
that little thing there that locks it

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.719 
that little thing there that locks it
into<00:01:45.000> place<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.979> because<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.009> was<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> bit<00:01:47.460> rough

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
into place and because I was a bit rough

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.670 
into place and because I was a bit rough
when<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.060> dropped<00:01:48.360> there<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.780> knew<00:01:49.020> no<00:01:49.350> need<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
when I dropped there I knew no need to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.859 
when I dropped there I knew no need to
get<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.920> out<00:01:50.009> right<00:01:50.280> getting<00:01:51.060> my<00:01:51.360> foot<00:01:51.630> onto

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
get it out right getting my foot onto

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.499 
get it out right getting my foot onto
there<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.159> matter<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.520> doing<00:01:54.210> that

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
there it's just a matter of doing that

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.660 
there it's just a matter of doing that
and<00:01:55.079> let's<00:01:55.500> see<00:01:55.829> how<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.189> winding

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
and let's see how it's just winding

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.440 
and let's see how it's just winding
around<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.090> edge<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.420> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.810 

and<00:02:04.450> just<00:02:04.690> keep<00:02:04.870> going<00:02:04.900> until<00:02:05.830> you<00:02:06.550> get<00:02:06.700> as

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
and just keep going until you get as

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.060 
and just keep going until you get as
much<00:02:07.060> cotton<00:02:07.420> on<00:02:07.660> there<00:02:07.870> as<00:02:08.020> you<00:02:08.050> need<00:02:08.500> right

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
much cotton on there as you need right

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.350 
much cotton on there as you need right
that'll<00:02:09.340> do<00:02:09.490> for<00:02:09.610> about<00:02:09.820> now<00:02:10.000> being<00:02:10.240> you

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
that'll do for about now being you

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.570 
that'll do for about now being you
pulled<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.780> across<00:02:11.140> there<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.830> then<00:02:12.370> you

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
pulled that across there and then you

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.510 
pulled that across there and then you
get<00:02:12.760> your<00:02:12.910> scissors<00:02:13.240> and<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:14.170> cut<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.650> seduced

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
get your scissors and you cut it seduced

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.190 
get your scissors and you cut it seduced
your<00:02:15.730> cast<00:02:16.030> because<00:02:16.420> when<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.780> comes<00:02:17.020> to

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
your cast because when it comes to

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.510 
your cast because when it comes to
threading<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.710> needle<00:02:17.740> which<00:02:18.070> is<00:02:18.250> what<00:02:18.370> we're

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
threading the needle which is what we're

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.860 
threading the needle which is what we're
going<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.730> do<00:02:18.850> in<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.000> moment<00:02:19.360> it's<00:02:19.510> best<00:02:19.780> to

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
going to do in a moment it's best to

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.720 
going to do in a moment it's best to
know<00:02:20.050> how<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.230> do<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:20.590> right<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.430> next<00:02:21.580> thing

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
know how to do that right the next thing

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.970 
know how to do that right the next thing
is<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.210> goes<00:02:22.480> into<00:02:22.870> there<00:02:23.050> like<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:23.680> and

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
is this goes into there like that and

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.040 
is this goes into there like that and
then<00:02:24.550> it's<00:02:24.820> got<00:02:25.000> this<00:02:25.180> little<00:02:25.420> wheat<00:02:25.750> groove

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
then it's got this little wheat groove

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.750 
then it's got this little wheat groove
that<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.350> put<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.860> into<00:02:27.100> there<00:02:27.370> like<00:02:27.400> that

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
that you put that into there like that

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.090 
that you put that into there like that
and<00:02:27.970> then<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.450> pull<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:28.960> around<00:02:29.440> until<00:02:29.740> it

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
and then you pull it around until it

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.090 
and then you pull it around until it
locks<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.670> then<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.540> will<00:02:31.990> pull<00:02:32.350> away<00:02:32.620> and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
locks and then that will pull away and

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.000 
locks and then that will pull away and
nicely<00:02:33.850> like<00:02:34.210> so<00:02:34.630> then<00:02:35.470> you've<00:02:35.620> got<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.800> little

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
nicely like so then you've got a little

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.410 
nicely like so then you've got a little
weak<00:02:36.160> thing<00:02:36.400> here<00:02:36.580> that<00:02:36.610> little<00:02:36.880> lever<00:02:37.180> you

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
weak thing here that little lever you

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.290 
weak thing here that little lever you
lift<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.020> up<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.350> then<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.040> push<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.670> into

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
lift that up and then you push that into

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.230 
lift that up and then you push that into
there<00:02:40.990> until<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:42.010> locks<00:02:42.310> into<00:02:42.550> place<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:43.060> you

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
there until it locks into place and you

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.730 
there until it locks into place and you
know<00:02:43.450> it's<00:02:43.630> in<00:02:43.720> place<00:02:43.900> okay<00:02:44.140> because<00:02:44.470> it'll

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
know it's in place okay because it'll

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.860 
know it's in place okay because it'll
going<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.920> click<00:02:45.250> right<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.090> next<00:02:46.390> thing<00:02:46.690> is

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
going to click right the next thing is

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.770 
going to click right the next thing is
to<00:02:47.080> thread<00:02:47.830> up<00:02:48.040> your<00:02:48.340> machine<00:02:48.790> now<00:02:49.000> this

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
to thread up your machine now this

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.199 
to thread up your machine now this
particular<00:02:49.959> model<00:02:50.500> goes<00:02:50.770> from<00:02:51.040> there<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.700> goes

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
particular model goes from there it goes

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.650 
particular model goes from there it goes
down<00:02:52.690> there<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.980> goes<00:02:54.220> up<00:02:54.550> there<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.150> there's

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
down there it goes up there and there's

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.300 
down there it goes up there and there's
this<00:02:55.780> little<00:02:56.020> thing<00:02:56.170> up<00:02:56.620> here<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:56.950> has<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.190> go

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
this little thing up here it has to go

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.610 
this little thing up here it has to go
around<00:02:57.340> there<00:02:58.209> and<00:02:58.480> then<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.080> needs<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.440> go

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
around there and then it needs to go

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.070 
around there and then it needs to go
down<00:02:59.650> there<00:03:00.130> if<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.490> get<00:03:00.670> stuck<00:03:01.120> just<00:03:01.360> to

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
down there if you get stuck just to

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.110 
down there if you get stuck just to
refer<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.380> your<00:03:02.620> instruction<00:03:03.250> manual<00:03:03.280> there's

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
refer to your instruction manual there's

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.520 
refer to your instruction manual there's
a<00:03:04.180> little<00:03:04.630> thing<00:03:04.870> around<00:03:04.959> there<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.440> it

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
a little thing around there that it

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.040 
a little thing around there that it
needs<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.920> go<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.670> then<00:03:07.209> I<00:03:07.480> always<00:03:07.690> put<00:03:07.930> the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
needs to go to and then I always put the

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.920 
needs to go to and then I always put the
foot<00:03:08.260> down<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.830> this<00:03:09.610> is<00:03:09.820> why<00:03:10.390> it's<00:03:10.660> really

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
foot down and this is why it's really

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.630 
foot down and this is why it's really
important<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.590> cut<00:03:11.860> your<00:03:12.010> thread<00:03:12.250> because<00:03:12.520> you

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
important to cut your thread because you

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.160 
important to cut your thread because you
don't<00:03:12.820> have<00:03:13.000> any<00:03:13.209> because<00:03:13.510> if<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.810> do<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.050> like

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
don't have any because if you do it like

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.780 
don't have any because if you do it like
this<00:03:14.440> like<00:03:14.680> sometimes<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.370> get<00:03:15.489> these<00:03:15.640> little

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
this like sometimes you get these little

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.199 
this like sometimes you get these little
weak

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
weak

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.370 
weak
you<00:03:16.300> might<00:03:16.480> not<00:03:16.630> be<00:03:16.750> able<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.930> see<00:03:17.110> that<00:03:17.260> but

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
you might not be able to see that but

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.110 
you might not be able to see that but
see<00:03:17.530> all<00:03:17.590> those<00:03:17.769> was<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:18.010> wee<00:03:18.160> bits<00:03:18.370> there<00:03:18.610> we<00:03:18.820> do

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
see all those was a wee bits there we do

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.640 
see all those was a wee bits there we do
not<00:03:19.390> want<00:03:19.630> those<00:03:19.780> because<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.170> makes<00:03:20.500> it

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
not want those because that makes it

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.620 
not want those because that makes it
difficult<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.340> thread<00:03:21.880> your<00:03:22.090> needle<00:03:22.120> right

that goes into there

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.740 
that goes into there
I<00:03:24.700> was<00:03:25.360> just<00:03:25.540> give<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.840> away<00:03:25.930> wit<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.709> then

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
I was just give it away wit and then

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.440 
I was just give it away wit and then
with<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.959> magic<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.680> eyes<00:03:30.010> or<00:03:30.640> goodness<00:03:31.060> of<00:03:31.360> me

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
with the magic of eyes or goodness of me

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.300 
with the magic of eyes or goodness of me
I<00:03:31.480> might<00:03:31.780> be<00:03:31.840> able<00:03:32.019> to<00:03:32.110> give<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.350> a<00:03:32.410> go<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.100> go

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
I might be able to give it a go and go

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.250 
I might be able to give it a go and go
and<00:03:33.340> go<00:03:33.519> up<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.750> then<00:03:34.989> it<00:03:35.080> goes<00:03:35.230> through

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
and go up and and then it goes through

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.100 
and go up and and then it goes through
there<00:03:36.070> and<00:03:36.280> then<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.850> pull<00:03:37.269> it<00:03:37.420> through<00:03:37.930> to

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
there and then you pull it through to

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.500 
there and then you pull it through to
that<00:03:38.290> side<00:03:38.620> then<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.489> get<00:03:39.700> this<00:03:39.850> little<00:03:40.060> army

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
that side then you get this little army

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.050 
that side then you get this little army
little<00:03:40.780> wheel<00:03:41.140> here<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:42.250> just<00:03:42.489> go<00:03:42.670> down

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
little wheel here and you just go down

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.840 
little wheel here and you just go down
like<00:03:43.330> that<00:03:43.690> until<00:03:44.110> it<00:03:44.260> catches<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:45.550> bit

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
like that until it catches the bit

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.990 
like that until it catches the bit
underneath<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:47.019> then<00:03:47.769> that<00:03:48.160> should<00:03:48.760> come

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
underneath and then that should come

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.100 
underneath and then that should come
through<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.269> you<00:03:49.330> get<00:03:49.450> this<00:03:49.540> little<00:03:49.840> loop

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
through and you get this little loop

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.729 
through and you get this little loop
here<00:03:50.140> so<00:03:50.530> there<00:03:50.950> we<00:03:51.370> have<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:52.060> set<00:03:52.750> up<00:03:52.780> now<00:03:53.470> cut

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
here so there we have it set up now cut

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.140 
here so there we have it set up now cut
those<00:03:53.920> excess<00:03:54.310> threads<00:03:54.700> off<00:03:54.880> because<00:03:55.000> you

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
those excess threads off because you

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.090 
those excess threads off because you
don't<00:03:55.180> need<00:03:55.480> those<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:56.080> then<00:03:56.560> you've<00:03:56.739> got<00:03:56.769> on

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
don't need those and then you've got on

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.090 
don't need those and then you've got on
your<00:03:57.130> foot<00:03:57.550> here<00:03:57.820> you've<00:03:58.269> got<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> little<00:03:59.290> slit

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
your foot here you've got a little slit

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.790 
your foot here you've got a little slit
let<00:04:00.640> both<00:04:01.510> of<00:04:01.570> those<00:04:01.870> threads<00:04:02.320> have<00:04:02.530> to<00:04:02.680> go

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
let both of those threads have to go

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.490 
let both of those threads have to go
through<00:04:03.190> there<00:04:03.400> then<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:04.209> close<00:04:04.870> it<00:04:04.900> up<00:04:05.290> and

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
through there then you close it up and

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.560 
through there then you close it up and
this<00:04:05.980> is<00:04:06.040> running<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:06.579> little<00:04:06.850> wee<00:04:06.940> free<00:04:07.209> and<00:04:07.389> I
