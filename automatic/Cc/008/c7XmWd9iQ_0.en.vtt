00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hi girls today I find 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.220
 for a video so on march is from 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.330
 milk chocolate chip cookies 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.000
 I told you about 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.400
 so it's a special recipe 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.309
 since it is without them and without butter 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.080
 so she is good for people 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.400
 that are based allergies d 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.920
 intolerance or so for people 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.810
 who wish to eat a little less fat 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.460
 so that's gone I go up every 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.279
 ingredients you need so 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.320
 firstly about 140 g of flour 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.910
 I would say 80 grams of icing sugar and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.550
 function of if you prefer very sweet 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.950
 or not me it's moderately sweet 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.820
 of which 80 g of sugar is then used 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.890
 of your preferences 50 to 100 g of nuggets 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.250
 of milk chocolate people but about 70 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.850
 g 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:53.760
 for my part salt and 10 centilitres of 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.530
 therefore of fluids or crem and weighs little 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.899
 matter of the world that it is whole 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.329
 it is possible of the cream and 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.530
 finally a packet of baking powder 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.489
 finally it will be a teaspoon I 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.150
 will show you and 2 sachet of sugar 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.100
 vanilla 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.890
 so no matter what the marks are we 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.700
 record and so it's gone I'm showing you 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.700
 immediately as in fact 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.060
 asier you come for your sugar so 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.310
 it can be cane sugar and 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.439
 sugar red sugar end how you 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.579
 games price normal white sugar but 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.280
 to give a little more taste could 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.860
 take a different sugar then you 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.759
 so add about 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.409
 I want to put because 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.850
 that there are 20 centilitres but about 10 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.850
 whole creams 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:49.479
 then you mix and a 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.479
 fork of a shark 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.570
 once it's done you come 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:05.170
 add your flour so I put 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:07.930
 about 140 to 150 grams and there comes 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:19.510
 just to be that everything is always good 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:21.430
 homogeneous so if see your dough is a 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.910
 not too sandy as these pass and 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.319
 fluid 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.819
 finally he addresses a pressed dough 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.100
 passes for a cost that did not hesitate to 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.840
 add a little cream because as 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.830
 I told you finally the balance for 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.209
 dosing is not terrible so I had to 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.470
 put a little pitch too much flour no 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:54.580
 I will add a little cream for the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:56.140
 all a little more fluid stop you 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.720
 when you hold this question there so 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.250
 you see it's very compact but this 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.269
 is no longer a kind of low cream like 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.079
 just now so here is the 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.299
 texture that you must have next 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.799
 you just add your paper so 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.750
 I finally add there is a pack of 100 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.079
 grams I nibbled some 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.390
 years so that shows you these are 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.630
 those in vahine nuggets 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.540
 milk chocolate so there is 120 me is 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.590
 so I think it stays 80 I do not know 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.640
 if I'm going to put everything because I like 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:32.860
 well feel you shen cake 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:34.870
 pragmatic and of what think that match to 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.579
 see what it gives 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.840
 so do not hesitate to pass your dough 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.310
 because honestly it really helps 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.160
 the prince ca really appears them 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.570
 better finally a lot more homogeneous 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.570
 and offered the most beautiful shots that is 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.480
 to this type of paste impossible 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.470
 your cookie dough and ready when 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.629
 she looks like that and so we all go 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:15.519
 go to the low lightning step so then 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:19.359
 you form small balls 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:21.190
 of dough in you show prequel what 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:26.229
 size or first little bits of 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.430
 bosses like these and you flat 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.460
 hoist finally I explained to you it is 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.350
 because there's no egg and it's for 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.900
 be sure that it is true that she is 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.830
 really a nice form of cookies 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.410
 it's not in a ball as usual 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.289
 rather liked a little like these and 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.090
 you spread them on your plate in 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.410
 spacing them slightly a few 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.610
 centimeters since it's still ok 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.380
 curly and you renew the operation 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.180
 if you have a big heat oven 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.280
 rotating metella preheated to about 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.449
 160 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.470
 if you have a small oven like mine 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:03.610
 and knowing that they heat everything from 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:05.860
 it will be preheated it's gone 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.199
 so I made 8 cookies because I 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.260
 put a little trick and so it's gone 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.550
 my example we have about 160 degrees so 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.570
 I will tell you in the name of cooking 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.800
 to show you when do they 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.940
 are beautiful lots how much time and 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.720
 if you want more crisp 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.849
 after how much time so I 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.250
 come from the east so here I come from them 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.729
 get out of the oven so after 8 9 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.070
 minutes 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.039
 so here it is if you want cookies 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.360
 really - the and so my oven as it 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.410
 heats very fast and very strong but that 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.620
 it's a little crazy I started to 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.880
 juggle between 140 and 160 degrees so me 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.440
 I prefer them crispy so there I 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.820
 it's fabulous for my boyfriend and I 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.169
 want to do it if you want a batch 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.789
 so a little more crisp I want 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.030
 surround me with results after that 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:48.760
 better to juggle between 140 and 160 summer 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:53.470
 left about 13 minutes instead of 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.490
 nine which tell me that's such love 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.840
 as you can see behind the scenes 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.729
 are finished so those who are a little 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.070
 more golden marooning these are 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.060
 crispy and of course they come out 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.320
 when they come out they are still a little 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.550
 better but once they have broken 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.960
 two liters more crisp and so 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.440
 that will stay much more fluffy 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.850
 so it's on 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.830
 taste I advise you to keep them 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.710
 in a metal box for and the 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.930
 keep for several days otherwise 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.700
 for the ovens so even though I have you 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.080
 given the duration so by emptying rather 15 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.180
 minutes for the rather crunchy 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.560
 8.9 for months and check it out when 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.890
 even because each time different 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.060
 look that blow they do not burn 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:29.150
 and do not hesitate to adjust the 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.460
 temperature is also in the case that 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.410
 I wanted to tell you something else 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.810
 and they were of course in the middle of 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.560
 oven it must be that I am doing 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.780
 uniformly 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.580
 so here are the girls I hope this 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.330
 recipe will please you and I make you 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.330
 lots of kisses
