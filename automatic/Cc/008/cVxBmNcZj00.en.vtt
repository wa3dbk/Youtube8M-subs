00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
for the parenting role I guess I think

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.980 
for the parenting role I guess I think
Kate<00:01:53.690> more<00:01:54.049> so<00:01:54.290> yeah<00:01:55.000> so<00:01:56.000> she's<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.479> actual

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
Kate more so yeah so she's the actual

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.260 
Kate more so yeah so she's the actual
mom<00:01:57.890> but<00:01:59.560> yeah<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.590> mean<00:02:00.740> I<00:02:00.979> think<00:02:01.090> when<00:02:02.090> you

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
mom but yeah I mean I think when you

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.670 
mom but yeah I mean I think when you
have<00:02:02.509> a<00:02:02.619> kid<00:02:03.619> especially<00:02:04.399> with<00:02:04.580> women<00:02:04.789> I<00:02:05.180> think

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
have a kid especially with women I think

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.820 
have a kid especially with women I think
mostly<00:02:06.680> you<00:02:06.979> just<00:02:07.039> have<00:02:07.460> this<00:02:07.670> innate<00:02:08.090> like

mostly you just have this innate like

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.290 
mostly you just have this innate like
motherly<00:02:09.830> thing<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:10.610> just<00:02:10.789> learn<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.060> and

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
you do it there's no you know learning I

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.410

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
the fun one and so is Kate she she's a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.150 
the fun one and so is Kate she she's a
fun<00:02:31.910> mom<00:02:32.150> but<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.510> think<00:02:32.810> yeah<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:33.799> think<00:02:33.950> it

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
fun mom but I think yeah I think it

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.949 
fun mom but I think yeah I think it
works<00:02:34.310> out<00:02:34.489> yeah<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.060> think<00:02:35.239> they<00:02:35.480> complement

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
works out yeah I think they complement

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.220 
works out yeah I think they complement
each<00:02:36.049> other<00:02:36.260> very<00:02:36.500> well<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.739> think<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:38.230> think

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
each other very well I think I think

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.289 
each other very well I think I think
certainly<00:02:40.930> there's<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:42.410> think<00:02:43.310> my<00:02:43.910> character

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
certainly there's I think my character

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.780 
certainly there's I think my character
provides<00:02:44.750> sort<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.519> craziness<00:02:46.519> and

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
provides sort of craziness and

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.710 
provides sort of craziness and
excitement<00:02:47.799> that<00:02:48.799> without<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:50.090> think<00:02:50.450> Kate's

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
excitement that without I think Kate's

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.199 
excitement that without I think Kate's
influence<00:02:51.290> would<00:02:51.470> be<00:02:51.620> probably<00:02:51.890> too<00:02:52.670> much<00:02:52.880> but

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
influence would be probably too much but

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.990 
influence would be probably too much but
it's<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.630> nice<00:02:53.810> balance<00:02:54.530> sort<00:02:55.160> of<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.489> way<00:02:55.820> they

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
it's a nice balance sort of the way they

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.140 
it's a nice balance sort of the way they
serve<00:02:56.299> raise<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:57.160> smart<00:02:58.160> little<00:02:58.519> girl

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
serve raise this smart little girl

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.150 
serve raise this smart little girl
I<00:02:59.180> shouldn't<00:02:59.750> say<00:02:59.870> little<00:03:00.170> right<00:03:00.380> I<00:03:00.620> should

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
I shouldn't say little right I should

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.110 
I shouldn't say little right I should
say<00:03:01.370> smart<00:03:02.260> grown-up<00:03:03.260> girl
