00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.779
 as everyone commented 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.159
 in this game video showed an alternative way 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:22.909
 and much easier for both 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:26.339
 carlos that is the time of mandate fishing them 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.970
 windows 7 years 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.769
 some time ago I like how to modify that 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.520
 how to purify the air opined 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.610
 but for that we have to 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.420
 build the center of many manually 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.420
 which can be a little dangerous 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.109
 on this occasion 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.730
 then many like her do exactly the same but much more 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.450
 now before starting tangible solutions the Ethiopian infarction the 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.950
 he was opinion is a function 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.180
 allows them to choose their friend 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.610
 check out hanescu 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.660
 easily if it seems just like going up yanes 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.380
 nor am I going to put my advice of the simas crime scam 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.970
 and how can you see that portal accept them and I can see what is the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.510
 Writer 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.840
 now the time of delay is the time that passes since childhood 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.530
 impulse over until one such arrested is now due 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.670
 he totally hides them chile gay weddings 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.540
 so well let's lose 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.409
 so for that we're going to use this application called text 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.870
 now before you start 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.630
 if you want to do it manually just see it the stick men lived and there 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.410
 there is going to be a summit link that I perceived as venues we took 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.380
 but for those who have not seen this little utility in free 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.550
 so we just execute it 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.410
 and here we have the controls first of all if you want disabled habita 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.330
 This function 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.540
 just labeling that ticket to escape 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.860
 in labels is detected and if I'm going to say that after these holidays 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.140
 here with this control then adjust the delay time 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.920
 the maximum this seconds 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.079
 Only force is observed 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.409
 so good we're going to be affected 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.739
 to see at the same time that this citation also works and we're just going to say that 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:16.869
 this vote 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.119
 now that we will look like this 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:21.779
 nor is he telling us that we have to 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:24.779
 close session so that's what I'm going to accept 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:31.569
 while the villarreal bc 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.879
 and remember that what we have just done is desirable 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:35.910
 the arid min 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.109
 now yes for his neighbors 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.429
 webber that absolutely nothing happened 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:44.529
 so this steel johnson activity you see that eating less disappeared 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.159
 Now what are we going to do that is 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.009
 up is the one that is 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:54.289
 I'm going to activate it again here 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:57.679
 I will not change the time has presented 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.939
 everything and that accepted dior abuya to close session 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.019
 come back easier come back 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.879
 nothing to do with what what you just did is enable the newspaper 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.409
 and after that the time of 4 12 months 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.409
 it's so let's see 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.979
 will come as you can see if 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.279
 see if it takes three 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:30.569
 in hiding the advantages so good that's been all for writing tutorial 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.269
 communicate is very easy to do using this application you no longer have 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.269
 that go to the bad record by the east 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.939
 so well that's all we see each other again I hope it's okay 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:42.999
 peak of years in a row
