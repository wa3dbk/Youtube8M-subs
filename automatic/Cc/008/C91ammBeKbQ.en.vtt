II mess when I do this or I do but it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.910 
II mess when I do this or I do but it
just<00:01:12.450> stays<00:01:12.630> inside<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.990> towel<00:01:15.680> when<00:01:16.680> I'll<00:01:16.770> do

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
just stays inside the towel when I'll do

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.010 
just stays inside the towel when I'll do
it<00:01:17.040> first<00:01:17.280> as<00:01:17.640> I'll<00:01:17.790> do<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> series<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.390> hopefuls

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it first as I'll do a series of hopefuls

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.929 
it first as I'll do a series of hopefuls
as<00:01:19.650> opposed<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.130> cranking<00:01:20.790> up<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
as opposed to just cranking up the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.580 
as opposed to just cranking up the
higher<00:01:21.210> letting<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.659> go<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.470> will

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
higher letting it go because this will

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.469 
higher letting it go because this will
actually<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:23.369> some<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> big<00:01:24.030> chunks<00:01:24.390> out

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
actually get some of the big chunks out

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.510 
actually get some of the big chunks out
of<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> way

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.530 

and

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.270 
and
pura<00:01:34.200> away

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.200 

you<00:01:39.280> don't<00:01:39.430> want<00:01:39.550> to<00:01:39.610> keep<00:01:39.730> it<00:01:39.820> in<00:01:39.910> one<00:01:40.030> spot

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
you don't want to keep it in one spot

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.000 
you don't want to keep it in one spot
because<00:01:40.720> then<00:01:41.080> you<00:01:41.170> won't<00:01:41.290> necessarily<00:01:41.500> get

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
because then you won't necessarily get

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.300 
because then you won't necessarily get
all<00:01:42.160> the<00:01:42.420> chunks<00:01:43.680> all<00:01:44.680> right<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.070> you<00:01:45.220> also

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
all the chunks all right and you also

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.380 
all the chunks all right and you also
you<00:01:45.520> don't<00:01:45.610> want<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.850> leave<00:01:45.940> it<00:01:46.060> just<00:01:46.150> sitting

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
you don't want to leave it just sitting

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.430 
you don't want to leave it just sitting
on<00:01:46.480> the<00:01:46.540> bottom<00:01:46.720> because<00:01:47.020> then<00:01:47.260> you<00:01:47.350> won't

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
on the bottom because then you won't

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.280 
on the bottom because then you won't
pull<00:01:47.680> any<00:01:47.710> large<00:01:48.100> chunks<00:01:48.160> into<00:01:48.550> it<00:01:48.700> either<00:01:49.290> all

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
pull any large chunks into it either all

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.580 
pull any large chunks into it either all
right<00:01:50.470> so<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:52.360> appears<00:01:52.660> to<00:01:52.780> be<00:01:52.930> pretty<00:01:53.410> well

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
right so that appears to be pretty well

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.050 
right so that appears to be pretty well
