00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
at the bottom to keep it there otherwise

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.270 
at the bottom to keep it there otherwise
it<00:01:57.750> feels<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.229> will<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.500> slip<00:01:59.040> so

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
it feels like it will just slip so

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.030 
it feels like it will just slip so
that's<00:01:59.460> one<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> downsides<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:01.649> suppose

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
that's one of the downsides I suppose

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.700 
that's one of the downsides I suppose
it's<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.310> plus<00:02:02.790> point<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:04.049> comes<00:02:04.350> with<00:02:04.530> a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
it's a plus point but it comes with a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.350 
it's a plus point but it comes with a
downside<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.490> that's<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.850> fact<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.180> it's

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
downside and that's the fact that it's

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.960 
downside and that's the fact that it's
hard<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.840> use<00:02:07.110> such<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> thin<00:02:08.190> device<00:02:08.520> are

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
hard to use such a thin device are

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.530 
hard to use such a thin device are
practically<00:02:09.810> um<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.550> having<00:02:11.819> said<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
practically um but having said that the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.309 
practically um but having said that the
screen

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
screen

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.099 
screen
is<00:02:13.499> really<00:02:14.249> really<00:02:14.819> good<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.359> this<00:02:15.569> device<00:02:15.840> I

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:16.109 
is really really good on this device I

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.309 
is really really good on this device I
find<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.280> curved<00:02:17.730> edges<00:02:18.049> really<00:02:19.049> help

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
find that the curved edges really help

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.640 
find that the curved edges really help
and<00:02:19.590> couple<00:02:20.069> with<00:02:20.189> iOS<00:02:20.609> 8.1<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:22.379> fact<00:02:22.560> that

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
and couple with iOS 8.1 the fact that

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.050 
and couple with iOS 8.1 the fact that
you<00:02:22.799> know<00:02:22.829> you<00:02:22.950> can<00:02:23.129> kind<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.340> want<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.819> slide

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
you know you can kind of want to slide

the<00:02:26.879> menu<00:02:27.269> bar<00:02:27.659> is<00:02:27.959> actually<00:02:28.590> really<00:02:29.099> useful

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
the menu bar is actually really useful

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.729 
the menu bar is actually really useful
to<00:02:29.969> have<00:02:30.060> those<00:02:30.359> curve<00:02:30.689> that<00:02:30.870> just<00:02:31.109> be<00:02:31.530> nice<00:02:31.680> to

now the other thing I'm going to talk

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.979 
now the other thing I'm going to talk
about<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.949> the<00:03:35.069> battery<00:03:35.549> if<00:03:35.729> you're<00:03:36.479> going<00:03:36.720> or

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
about is the battery if you're going or

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.670 
about is the battery if you're going or
considering<00:03:37.530> going<00:03:38.040> from<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.549> 55<00:03:39.239> s206<00:03:39.930> then

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
considering going from a 55 s206 then

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.969 
considering going from a 55 s206 then
for<00:03:40.859> me<00:03:40.979> the<00:03:41.189> battery<00:03:41.609> would<00:03:41.970> be<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.509> one

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:42.979 
for me the battery would be that one

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.379 
for me the battery would be that one
additional<00:03:43.979> reason<00:03:44.459> other<00:03:44.729> than<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.090> screen

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
additional reason other than the screen

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.689 
additional reason other than the screen
size<00:03:45.599> that<00:03:46.259> would<00:03:46.379> help<00:03:46.620> me<00:03:46.859> upgrade<00:03:47.189> because

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
size that would help me upgrade because
