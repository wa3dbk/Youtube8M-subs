00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.830
 but happy imagine with the tie 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.630
 especially because of the way he has 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.260
 arrived 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:24.440
 yes yes very very very happy why 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.660
 the effort that our 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.160
 players deserved 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.570
 something more than 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.570
 worthy defeat 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.880
 Marcelo's team has not lost faith 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.140
 in no time and has known 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.620
 recover from that break of the two 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.620
 consecutive goals 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.490
 and this 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.550
 the change in the score in so little 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.550
 weather 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.120
 it's so sudden this 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.120
 always presupposes a decay 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.690
 with a lot of industriousness we went 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.570
 trying to work out some balance and 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.070
 to approach the area of it and 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.070
 finally we find an answer 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.270
 of marcelo in his mother's house a 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.470
 point but you added value this 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.939
 point by the way it has been produced 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.380
 for the rival and for the football that has 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:32.860
 done and the team in san mamÃ©s 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.860
 if for us it is a step 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.490
 that fortifies 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.470
 the concept that we have of us 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.470
 same as a team 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.790
 while 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.430
 the only way that 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.960
 that we have to shorten distance with a 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.280
 team like Barcelona is 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.630
 make them worse through our 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.630
 defensive management and 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.219
 conserving is not 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.009
 qualities in attack and those two things to 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.709
 the time with a rival like this 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.569
 that has a capacity to get out of 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.319
 the 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.319
 of the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.450
 of the pressures of the pressures of 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.890
 harassment have a very technical quality 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.200
 very very high a physical exuberance 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:33.060
 important then good to make them worse 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:36.240
 without avoiding that aspects of our 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.920
 games are kept very difficult and for 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.750
 moments today we achieve it 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.180
 an hour of good game against Madrid 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.920
 the match against the match 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.420
 today especially the first part has been 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.700
 found himself late in the 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.870
 athletic this season 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.930
 obviously 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.739
 the 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.739
 you see what 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.140
 the best moments of the league have 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.830
 given two points about 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.440
 about 12 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.360
 this 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.670
 there were also other moments of 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.700
 different merits and that 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.720
 we got inside a dynamic that was 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.720
 with many ups and downs 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.629
 if marcelo has coincided leaves and messi and 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.300
 change the game beyond quality 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:31.239
 logically he has messi is also I think 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.880
 that there is a mental influence on their 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.220
 players to see messi 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.140
 not be afraid but have little more than 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.400
 reservations or that it activates a bit the 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.050
 open 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.230
 but not 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.240
 it's not what happens when you play messi 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.080
 in rivals is proportional to what 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.569
 the 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.689
 produces 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.739
 and rate whatever qualification 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.739
 that is given is 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.360
 valid but if a player has a 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.360
 similar power of imbalance 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.450
 can not 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.150
 do not generate precautions inhibition in 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.190
 who confront them what happens that he 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.680
 It does not have capacity imbalances because 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.750
 opponents and rivals that inhibit 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.840
 he has imbalance capacity that is 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.970
 different 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.340
 that is, it does not need any 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.730
 grant to unbalance or any 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.730
 variation 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.050
 available to the qualities of what 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.680
 that they face what they face what 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.810
 that face 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.020
 it's hard to find resources for 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.150
 such neutralizing capacity 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.920
 inventiveness 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.020
 can you explain why the 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.450
 substitution of mikel san jose and also 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.670
 because it has decanted and by aduriz as 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.940
 headline 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:58.320
 good the change of san jose wanted it what 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.160
 I wanted to do it 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.160
 since before 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.009
 when we went 1 to 0 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.009
 san jose that 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.100
 He had worked a lot by piecework and 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:18.580
 all right 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.580
 and obviously the relationship of 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.169
 the branch is a player that adapts 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:28.460
 much better branch hey maybe they 're light 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:30.600
 agile and explosive match better with 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.100
 messi 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.500
 in this case of san jose 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.780
 we in san jose gurpegui had 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.020
 had 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.389
 a very very important support and the 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.550
 party wore them down a lot and I thought 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.590
 what will happen what daring to do 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.960
 those changes saw 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.670
 with what the changes mean 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.930
 defensive when they are not essential 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:57.699
 are 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.699
 they are difficult to assume 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:05.570
 and good end 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.220
 when we put ourselves at a disadvantage 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:11.040
 I thought also that 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.870
 and it had to cover very large terrain and 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.330
 that the branch speed was going to be 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.430
 a help in that sense do not play with 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.300
 two central fast especially 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.300
 Quick 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:28.150
 a decision that sympathizes with what 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.840
 I've been doing for almost all 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.840
 season 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.780
 combine in this case moments of one 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.060
 and another one according to 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.670
 what I find most appropriate for the 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.970
 party as I always say 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:46.400
 I make decisions but it does not mean that 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:49.780
 are those that correspond to the appropriate 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:53.760
 the best means by 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.760
 what my intuition tells me and 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:07:00.740
 ability to have or not to guess 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.540
 normally marcelo will be employed 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.370
 blows as central oil advanced to 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.680
 midfield and the bet has come out 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.350
 well it has not been one of the best and 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.430
 blow and every time he always plays 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.430
 within the best 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:20.469
 rested well it is very difficult that not 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.469
 stand out 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.430
 to
