each<00:00:42.480> light<00:00:42.719> fixture<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.380> little<00:00:43.620> bit

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
each light fixture is a little bit

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.229 
each light fixture is a little bit
different<00:00:44.219> some<00:00:44.460> are<00:00:44.489> really<00:00:44.790> easy<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
different some are really easy to

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.959 
different some are really easy to
install<00:00:45.390> others<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.460> little<00:00:47.460> bit<00:00:47.550> more<00:00:47.730> tricky

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
install others a little bit more tricky

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.540 
install others a little bit more tricky
now<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.450> has<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> backing<00:00:49.290> plate<00:00:49.370> we've<00:00:50.370> got

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
now this has a backing plate we've got

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.420 
now this has a backing plate we've got
to<00:00:50.670> screw<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.120> first<00:00:52.100> then<00:00:53.100> we're<00:00:53.219> going

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
to screw that on first then we're going

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
to screw that on first then we're going
to<00:00:53.550> attach<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.690> then<00:00:55.789> the<00:00:56.789> old<00:00:57.030> wires

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
to attach that and then the old wires

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.090 
to attach that and then the old wires
here<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> existing<00:00:58.350> wires<00:00:58.559> come<00:00:58.860> through<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
here the existing wires come through a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.190 
here the existing wires come through a
hole<00:00:59.340> here<00:00:59.789> we're<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.020> have

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
hole here we're going to have to have

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.290 
hole here we're going to have to have
them<00:01:01.440> situated<00:01:01.770> out<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.579> top<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:05.300> every

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
them situated out on top of this every

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.010 
them situated out on top of this every
situated<00:01:06.930> my<00:01:07.080> wires<00:01:08.179> but<00:01:09.179> this<00:01:09.390> type<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.630> box

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
situated my wires but this type of box

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.020 
situated my wires but this type of box
here<00:01:12.080> allows<00:01:13.080> for<00:01:13.380> two<00:01:13.560> screws<00:01:14.009> on<00:01:14.399> both<00:01:14.700> sides

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
here allows for two screws on both sides

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.580 
here allows for two screws on both sides
we've<00:01:15.270> got<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.509> line<00:01:15.690> this<00:01:15.869> up<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.259> screw<00:01:16.530> it

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
we've got to line this up and screw it

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.430 
we've got to line this up and screw it
in<00:01:17.420> get<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.509> where<00:01:18.660> do<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.780> think<00:01:18.959> it<00:01:19.140> needs<00:01:19.289> to

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
in get it where do you think it needs to

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:36.560 
in get it where do you think it needs to
go<00:01:19.550> and<00:01:20.660> then<00:01:21.660> we're<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.020> Snug<00:01:22.349> this<00:01:22.590> up

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
and tight tight as I can make them by

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.170 
and tight tight as I can make them by
hand<00:01:52.830> at<00:01:53.830> this<00:01:54.010> point<00:01:54.280> you're<00:01:54.910> just<00:01:54.940> gonna

way<00:01:58.090> like<00:01:58.360> this<00:01:58.390> I<00:01:58.810> got<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:59.050> get<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.260> down<00:01:59.380> in

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
way like this I got to get it down in

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.910 
way like this I got to get it down in
there<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:01.330> this<00:02:01.780> one<00:02:01.990> can<00:02:02.140> go<00:02:02.260> over<00:02:02.500> here<00:02:02.680> and

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
there and this one can go over here and

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.970 
there and this one can go over here and
this<00:02:03.790> particular<00:02:04.120> light<00:02:04.480> fixture<00:02:05.050> goes<00:02:05.800> up

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
this particular light fixture goes up

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.860 
this particular light fixture goes up
like<00:02:06.160> this<00:02:06.220> there's<00:02:06.730> some<00:02:06.880> little<00:02:07.060> screws

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
like this there's some little screws

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.560 
like this there's some little screws
mounting<00:02:08.440> screws<00:02:08.679> that<00:02:08.830> go<00:02:08.890> in<00:02:09.250> right<00:02:09.490> here

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
mounting screws that go in right here

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.850 
mounting screws that go in right here
that's<00:02:10.570> why<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:10.810> had<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.080> get<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.440> all<00:02:11.680> nice

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
that's why I had to get this all nice

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.160 
that's why I had to get this all nice
and<00:02:12.100> straight<00:02:12.190> beforehand<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.960> there's

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
and straight beforehand and there's

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.620 
and straight beforehand and there's
small<00:02:14.710> little<00:02:14.740> set<00:02:15.250> screws<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.180> right<00:02:16.420> now

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
small little set screws to it right now

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.910 
small little set screws to it right now
and<00:02:16.900> there<00:02:17.020> this<00:02:17.380> one's<00:02:17.590> going<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.770> be<00:02:17.890> a

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
and there this one's going to be a

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.900 
and there this one's going to be a
little<00:02:18.190> tricky<00:02:18.750> but<00:02:20.190> I'll<00:02:21.190> be<00:02:21.280> patient<00:02:21.520> with

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
little tricky but I'll be patient with
