00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:08.860
 I welcome you to a video liza I want to ask 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.900
 yourself a little video question such here 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:16.810
 so my car is nissan primera in me 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:18.880
 and here in the spring I saw what it means 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.980
 may not know visible not visible here here 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.839
 start the wing a little bit of a blow up here 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.900
 like that pissed off 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:27.310
 when looked down here that's where it is 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.859
 here the edge wraps there 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.419
 turns to the side of the wheel 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.670
 then here's where and how exactly 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.820
 she had sulked here all rotten her 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.269
 I will try to show 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:45.070
 probably not seen from here to here 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:47.379
 you can literally buy with your finger 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.449
 although here in the beginning and in the middle here 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.339
 very good metal that is not rotten 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.160
 no one 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:57.420
 Here is a question I will advise you 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.390
 please do it yourself 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.609
 a long time is not necessary probably going to do 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.160
 but for now for half a year for a year if if 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.250
 You can of course make them and then before 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.770
 I will certainly do the sale as it should 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.770
 He is seen in his video tutorials as a thousand tow 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.170
 eat fiberglass here is so budget 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.750
 option and showed then we clean but 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.370
 farther away as usual as in yours 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.510
 lessons maybe i do here 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.180
 the only question is 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.850
 here is this box which is inside here 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.530
 rotted and and also somehow putty 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.080
 display need go maybe somehow cook 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.480
 her some shop can substitute here 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.650
 from here to here as a move tell me 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.920
 please and the second question on the threshold 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.920
 me 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.150
 the same here is the threshold that's sulked here and 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.240
 probably you see rubbed out 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.910
 also sulked here I look that's how it is 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.400
 that is, I think so if you take it off 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.790
 here this bump will be a hole rather 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.530
 just here, too, tell me not to cook 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.320
 cook or just too fiberglass 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.539
 close up handle properly withdraw 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.940
 edging here and so leave here but here 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.240
 such question to you thank you very much for 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.240
 answer
