00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.780
 hi my name is gabriel and consultant 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.010
 computer and implemented new 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.260
 technologies for companies and 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.410
 professionals now presented this new 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.180
 tutorial and progress in this class I'll go 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.520
 to teach how to connect a 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.490
 TV tuner in this case 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.380
 we have the abwehr media tv 29 I'm going to 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.600
 basically show the buttons and 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.220
 connections that this device has as 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.050
 you can see camps and on the button 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.289
 power that would be to learn to pay 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.570
 if it would be origin to select if 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:41.300
 one wants to watch television or play with 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.040
 the playstation or use the pc this new 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.899
 to raise and lower the volume and to 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.630
 change the channels here on the front 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.300
 we have a video audio input and 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.040
 also a super video entry and 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.070
 we have here a headphone output 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.899
 here the little light and here would be the receiver 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.870
 for the remote control in the part of 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.420
 back we have here the video output that 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.399
 says Austrian bladder says pga 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.219
 it would be the input of the tuner here 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.180
 we have the audio input and the output 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:10.900
 audio 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.310
 in this case we have the connector of 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.190
 cable here where to plug in the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.600
 antenna or your cable provider 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.790
 television for I have to show how 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.070
 connects to the computer with these 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.510
 tuner you come have this this 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.760
 cable that is video 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.660
 in the part of de gea this connects 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.490
 where vga says and that says vga out that 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.710
 would in this case plug in the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.930
 monitor that we have here sometimes depends 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.270
 the brand and model instead of having the 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.399
 same format as the monitor and the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.520
 Monitor plug has a connector 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.780
 round but the output is universal that 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.970
 it is standard to be able to connect 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.470
 any computer in this case we're going 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.080
 to plug in any of the two tips 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.720
 since they are equal now this extreme what 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.640
 let's plug in the pc in the output 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.040
 of the video plate as we can see 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.840
 here and here we have the monitor cable 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.390
 the monitor cable we have it 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.550
 plug where it says exit where there was 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.619
 said before that says auc spark plugs and the 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.179
 chufa moss here as we can see in a 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.070
 single position has one can not 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.830
 deform once we have plugged in 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.930
 the part 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.060
 we have to plug in the audio part 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.030
 normally this type of tuners 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.940
 come with a cable that on one side is 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.680
 green and the other side is blue but 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.570
 It depends on the brand sometimes because you have to 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.880
 be of the same color this does not influence 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.850
 then which is green what we can 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.700
 on the computer in the green hole 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.840
 and the other end we connect it where it says 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.430
 audio pc in or what would be the input 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.040
 we plugged in and this means that 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.800
 when the audio comes from here, it will enter 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.750
 to the tuner and then we have to 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.870
 plug in the speakers we can 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.790
 have a great speaker game like 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.340
 what we see here can be any 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.900
 another brand and we connect the connector 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.610
 green where it says audio output or author 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.530
 then another important thing that we have 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.709
 what to do is connect the transformer 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.510
 here has the current input of the 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.270
 tuners we plug it in and there and 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.010
 has electricity as we can see there 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.250
 we already have images on the monitor 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.340
 this diagram that arme to be able to check if 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.010
 connect be all right 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.019
 we can try the tuner first 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.300
 let's try to make the video work 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.430
 well for that we're going to press the button 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.200
 which says dels horts that would be origin 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.569
 first you have to undertake the apparatus a 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.010
 Once we turn on the device we can 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.440
 see that the tuner is 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.510
 working we have the little light that we 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.060
 indicates that it is on and if we press 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.280
 the source button or what it means 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.610
 origin we can change to the different 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.250
 tickets for example there we are already in 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.790
 the computer input if 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.549
 we press once again we could have the 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.019
 rc input here you can many for 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.060
 the playstation or whatever you want 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:00.650
 centers to go you're always back 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.510
 you have the super video outputs you have 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.150
 another entry more and there change the 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.610
 channels here as we can see squeezing 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.099
 the source key that would be origin 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.230
 we go back to the pc and we press back 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:15.360
 we go to the part that says video that 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.400
 we can plug in a VCR 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.380
 a playstation whatever if we squeeze 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.600
 back we enable another of the 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.150
 inputs of this device in this case 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.730
 would be the super video here would be a 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.280
 compound and here we return to television 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.320
 and if we want we can increase the volume or 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.660
 download it in this case we do not have cable nor 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.190
 connected antenna and we can change from 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.810
 channels as we can see here for 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.750
 back to the pc we squeeze sours 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.000
 again and that would be all this too 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.410
 can handle it from the remote control 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.680
 obviously now let's try the audio 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.050
 so you can see how the 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.240
 sound board computer 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.370
 also there how can we listen 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.310
 there the audio is working and 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.560
 obviously the television also squeezed 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.949
 return shorts we're going to in the part of 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.139
 television is the rain that there is no 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.940
 nothing connected I hope you have them 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.480
 served and anything not hesitate to
