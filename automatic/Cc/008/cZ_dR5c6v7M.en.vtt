00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 hello to all i hope you go 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.659
 Well today I am delighted to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.879
 find in this new video 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.280
 so today as promised is my 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.570
 purchase video at hema especially 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.670
 but also other articles of 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.139
 stationery that are in there I have everything 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.000
 in this little bag it's true that I 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.710
 find too cute at last I love them on 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.210
 will proceed like that I just dig it 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.830
 in my bag and show you what I have 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.289
 bought the first thing I bought 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.350
 at massey this then this is actually this 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.880
 are inking pads it's some 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.410
 something that is very often used in 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.849
 scrapbooking but also very 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.740
 practice actually if he wanted to 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.719
 decorate your notebooks your diaries by 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.790
 example I took this little kit with 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.040
 two stamps that cost 2 euros 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.020
 this 35th I kept clicking for 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.450
 to be able to tell you the prices 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.800
 so here is then I have a block 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.940
 notes like those who have his little ones and 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.930
 in fact it's a notepad 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.430
 stickers actually it's enough 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.770
 practice because this one he has the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.910
 particularity of being a list of things 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.770
 to do so in fact you have some 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.940
 little boxes next to you can tick 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.350
 gradually as you did 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.210
 things that can possibly 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.829
 also serve as a list of 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.020
 races if you want but I know 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.850
 that it's the mile also make it for the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.439
 course specially that's it does not cost 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.049
 very expensive plus it costs 2 euros 75 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.189
 so also frankly the products 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.170
 and match finds that they are really of 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.729
 quality and they are not too expensive so 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.600
 I also bought this I do not know 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.900
 if we will see 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.520
 in fact it's small stickers index 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.140
 it will allow you to create your 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.580
 own intercalated eyes if you have 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.070
 want the tabs a little more 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.930
 girly little more personalized or 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.460
 if he had a presentation sheet 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.979
 that you find more beautiful than a simple 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.509
 tabs sticks to you and this in 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.250
 index and that makes you a very very 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.570
 beautiful page it's really handy 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.460
 I find now even in 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.320
 diaries to be able to mark 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.030
 leaves or the most important pages 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.820
 for example I do not have the price of these 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.020
 on the ticket because in fact it was 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.880
 I have been several times schema so 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.100
 here but I will write somewhere here if 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.070
 I find the price I also 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.480
 bought this then his first things 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.830
 you've already seen it in my video this 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.880
 that there is in my bag because I had 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.010
 one and that's when I had bought 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.960
 I forgot to remove so here is 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.270
 does it are index clips that are in 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.470
 metal is the same it will allow you in 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.270
 marking the most pages 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.070
 important though this is they 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.110
 more suitable for your lessons for example 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.910
 because they are customized for 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.160
 their texts in English nitrates and the 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.490
 so understands you have to read to remember 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.020
 business after love it and like 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.990
 was not very expensive either 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.209
 drags caught somewhere here 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.709
 then I also bought this if those 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.420
 it does not come from a diagram but from a site 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.340
 internet that I discovered through a 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.840
 video on youtube actually because I 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.790
 also watched a lot of videos 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.950
 I received my order this morning and in 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.050
 is a pure brush or potted 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.370
 pencils that I bought on the bein website 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.900
 so sulk I would put you the 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.340
 reference in the info bar all 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.959
 like all references in this 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.590
 video either at hema or on the 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.870
 website be good 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.280
 so that's the little pot I do not know if 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.930
 we'll see because I have a background 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.070
 finally his part to you do what 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.570
 I have behind me this is really a 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.670
 very girly object that I find very 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.350
 suited whether it's on your vanity 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.540
 to put your brushes for example 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.070
 or on your desk to put some 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.930
 pencils your pens and so on 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.130
 or the soul as a gift to offer so 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.959
 it's a statement with knots and 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.060
 butterflies so I find this is 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.709
 really really nice it costs 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.000
 not very expensive because it's a site in 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.040
 made of a good that really costs 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.480
 really cheap it seems to me that the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.620
 shipping costs are free so that 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.640
 it's really great I advise you 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.900
 to make small orders for 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.620
 avoid customs fees I do not have any 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.450
 personally seen 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.880
 then always on bang august i 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.100
 ordered this little booklet of post it in 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.840
 so I love the possibilities because 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.160
 that jean-paul almost everywhere 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.700
 ideas and so on but it's empty and 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.380
 videos 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.090
 what I have to do for the costs but 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.860
 rendez-vous so these are 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.420
 post-it animals the little blanket in 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.980
 walk obviously you know 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.750
 now that I love pandas I 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.710
 I'm in love and so that 's me 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.450
 really more interior 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.890
 the posters and big vost here with 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.720
 a little horse that is really very 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.820
 very cute smaller post-it here they 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.010
 animals and still the Caribbean one 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.510
 little cub in post-it so small 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.700
 it's really very very nice 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.920
 I bought the same thing at home 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.020
 hema so in another style by cons 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.520
 so this is this then this was at 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.140
 child ray that I found is a 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.820
 little weird but they did not put in 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.440
 the stationery department so it's really 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.820
 by the way to go to the cashier that I 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.160
 I saw it and I'm really happy to 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.720
 to have seen it costs only 1 euros 75 that I 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.100
 believe it costs 1 dollar I know 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.630
 that you will see on the site but it 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.460
 not very expensive either you have 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.110
 different shapes and sizes of post-it 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.980
 rectangular squares 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.360
 I think it's really 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.190
 the equivalent because here you 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.540
 have a slip like that so here ya 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.040
 no post it a so normally it's 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.960
 just a slip like that 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.700
 two post it at the level of the quality of 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.460
 paper etc I still find that 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.440
 better email but post-it info I 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.630
 do not really know if if really 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.860
 quality matters but in any case that's it 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.060
 it also allows me to have 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.350
 very different possible one of the 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.400
 others but in any case know that the 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.120
 leaf quality is still 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.680
 best schema 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.090
 so here I am not hiding that I have 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.100
 also placed an order on a site 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.840
 a little more luxurious stationery which I 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.040
 will talk to you in a few weeks 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.110
 when my order arrives because 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.760
 does it's an international site but I 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.310
 you will talk about it if you're interested 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.020
 of course in this case I really have a 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.670
 favorite for this site I really 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.290
 look forward to having my order and you talk 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.000
 a little bit more of my organization so if 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.320
 I get it because it's really 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.210
 complement in celebration with all that I have 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.680
 bought all his purchases actually I have some 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.270
 done because I had to 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.190
 organizes me a little more for the courses seen 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.080
 that exams are approaching is at 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.360
 image also in adhesive tapes 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.130
 decorated in fact and this is great 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.600
 because it's glittery ribbons 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.790
 it's nice for the decorations of 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.890
 parties not to decorate pots to 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.770
 pencils to decorate the edges of 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.850
 shelves for example so that costs 2 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.430
 euros 75 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.200
 I also took a second one 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.730
 is like this then this one in 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.930
 does it's stamp patterns that I 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.270
 really, really, really cool 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.210
 also it serves more decoration have 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:34.170
 a calendar because it's better I 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.430
 think of sticking decorations stamp 3 a 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.170
 agenda as on a shelf for example 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.070
 but I find it nice or even 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.500
 when you describe a map 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.180
 birthday to a greeting card a 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.550
 letter to someone here I have also 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.500
 bought cleansing cottons from the 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.910
 mark and me so that's the effect this duo 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.170
 I do not know at all what it's worth 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.120
 what I usually buy from them 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.340
 crevasses it also does not cost much 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.200
 dear then I bought full of ink 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.580
 to be able to use the buffers 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.500
 inking so it comes up as those 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.390
 I have some balls and already four 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.890
 so I buy 3.7 actually I think that 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.450
 also costs 0.75 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.100
 I compared with the eye the prices in the 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.460
