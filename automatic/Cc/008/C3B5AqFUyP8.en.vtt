yourself or the recording sessions
pretty<00:01:22.420> by<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.659> book<00:01:22.870> stick<00:01:23.140> to<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.320> script

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
pretty by the book stick to the script

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.620 
pretty by the book stick to the script
that<00:01:24.250> was<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.400> script<00:01:24.760> I<00:01:25.000> wasn't<00:01:26.820> uh<00:01:27.820> know<00:01:28.420> of

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
that was a script I wasn't uh know of

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.870 
that was a script I wasn't uh know of
well<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.740> writing<00:01:30.070> is<00:01:30.130> so<00:01:30.190> good<00:01:30.580> for<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.850> show

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
well the writing is so good for the show

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.350 
well the writing is so good for the show
that<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:32.560> most<00:01:32.979> shows<00:01:33.340> i<00:01:33.549> will<00:01:33.790> improvise<00:01:34.210> a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
that in most shows i will improvise a

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.020 
that in most shows i will improvise a
lot<00:01:34.630> more<00:01:34.840> but<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.710> writing<00:01:36.010> is<00:01:36.100> so<00:01:36.130> stellar

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
lot more but the writing is so stellar

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.370 
lot more but the writing is so stellar
on<00:01:37.270> this<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.510> i<00:01:37.540> think<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.780> whole<00:01:37.930> cast<00:01:38.170> is

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
on this and i think the whole cast is

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.859 
on this and i think the whole cast is
concurred<00:01:38.799> on<00:01:38.950> that<00:01:39.130> that<00:01:39.369> we<00:01:39.970> stick<00:01:40.750> to<00:01:40.840> the

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
concurred on that that we stick to the

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.420 
concurred on that that we stick to the
script<00:01:41.080> pretty<00:01:41.440> closely<00:01:41.680> for<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.070> most<00:01:42.250> part

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
script pretty closely for the most part

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.820 
script pretty closely for the most part
and<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:43.150> only<00:01:43.330> time<00:01:43.540> i<00:01:43.600> will<00:01:43.960> add<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.560> little

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
and the only time i will add a little

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.760 
and the only time i will add a little
something<00:01:45.040> is<00:01:45.369> basically<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:46.060> embellish<00:01:46.330> as

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
something is basically to embellish as

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.830 
something is basically to embellish as
i'm<00:01:47.770> feeling<00:01:48.100> in<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.280> moment<00:01:48.400> but<00:01:48.820> i<00:01:49.150> don't

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
i'm feeling in the moment but i don't

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.600 
i'm feeling in the moment but i don't
really<00:01:50.080> feel<00:01:50.290> a<00:01:50.320> need<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.560> deviate<00:01:50.979> from<00:01:51.250> it

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
really feel a need to deviate from it

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.700 
really feel a need to deviate from it
too<00:01:51.700> much<00:01:51.880> it's<00:01:52.390> so<00:01:52.479> good<00:01:52.810> i<00:01:53.049> think<00:01:53.439> it'd<00:01:53.650> be
