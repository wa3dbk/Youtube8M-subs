00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.879
 hello friends how many times have we said 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.610
 that it is important to have quadriceps 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.070
 strong to protect your knees today 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.560
 we will learn a series of exercises that 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.349
 will help us improve the strength of 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.719
 this very important muscle if you want 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.759
 get more details about him or her 

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:32.910
 anatomy you can click on the image 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:35.610
 that appears on the top edge 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.250
 we divide its strengthening into three 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.500
 levels a first level indicated for 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.870
 very weak quadriceps as a consequence 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.180
 of knee operations or a long 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.430
 inactivity a second level for 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.920
 improve your strength when we start to 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.739
 have joint problems because of 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.080
 age and a third level indicated for 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.780
 young people who want to invest in 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.079
 health of your knees avoiding problems 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.870
 in the future 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.939
 in this video we will take care of the second 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.520
 level if you want to go to levels 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.890
 successive or previous you can do it 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.909
 clicking on the images that appear 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.909
 onscreen 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.630
 the exercises that we are going to carry out in 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.520
 combination with those of level 1 are 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.740
 indicated for all those people 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.350
 they begin to have problems of 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.649
 knee osteoarthritis and need a 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.990
 therapy to slow down your progress or as a 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.349
 progression for knee surgeries 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.299
 who have already practiced phase 1 in the 

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:38.099
 first exercise we placed ourselves 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.530
 back to a wall 

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:44.119
 we support our back on it and 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.219
 flexes the knees at 45 degrees 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.860
 we hold in the position between 45 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.950
 seconds and a minute and a half according to 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.890
 possibilities of each one doing 4 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.439
 Exercise series we will avoid supporting 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.450
 hands on knees performing 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.759
 so all the work with our 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.659
 quadriceps if you notice that you have left 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.670
 legs 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.039
 you can warm up the dinner on them 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.769
 as a reward this is an excellent 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.090
 indicator that the exercise is giving 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.920
 its fruits should be made between 3 to 5 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.769
 repetitions of the exercise maintaining 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.769
 the position between 40 and 90 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.319
 from the same position as the exercise 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.599
 earlier this time we have to go down and 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.330
 raise our buttocks sliding the 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.700
 back on the wall we owe everything 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.980
 moment get the knees from behind 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.519
 from the tip of your feet and in no 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.400
 now exceed 135 degrees 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.769
 Known knee flexion these 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.560
 limitations each one we should find 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.379
 our level going down to a height that 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.750
 we find challenging for example the 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.959
 Video character is only capable 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.660
 to get to 90 degrees in each repetition 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.849
 we must maintain the position the 5 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.489
 regulatory seconds of always 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.790
 sliding down and up from 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:13.790
 slow and controlled way we perform 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.790
 three sets of 10 repetitions each 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.380
 in the third exercise we need a 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.290
 elastic band which you can get in 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.330
 any sports store we lay down 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.970
 face up and place the band 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.459
 around our foot we select 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.950
 the leg as much as we can to greater 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.050
 Exercise travel greater benefit 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.570
 we print a tension to the band 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.230
 elastic to the consumer's taste and 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:50.209
 We extend the leg to 45 degrees 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.459
 slowly toward the toe 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.730
 us keeping the contraction 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:59.030
 muscle for 5 seconds at the end of the 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.700
 travel we must perform 3 series of 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.830
 12 repetitions of the exercise without 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.830
 never forget the toe 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.889
 the next exercise is the same as 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.320
 we do in level 1 except that in 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.870
 this time we must add a weight of 2 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.180
 kilos to our ankle if you do not have 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.850
 of adjustable weights is enough to be done 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.970
 with 2 kilos of rice and a belt for 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.010
 leave the weight well attached to the ankle we 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.620
 we sit on a table in such a way that 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.440
 our legs are hanging with nothing 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.940
 from the previous one, you can add 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.580
 resistance to exercise with the same 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.800
 elastic band from the previous exercise 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.680
 surrounding our ankle and tying the 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.180
 some object behind it as it is 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.180
 shows on screen 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.550
 from that position we extend our 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:57.740
 knee until it is 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.900
 completely straight leading as not the 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.990
 tip toe towards us at the end 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.120
 of the journey we count to 5 and 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.819
 we return the leg to its position 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.159
 initial we made 4 sets of 10 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:12.439
 repetitions each one fulfilling in each 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:15.050
 repeat with the 5 seconds of 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:18.580
 contraction of the quadriceps resting 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.580
 one minute between series 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.900
 in the last exercise the hardest of the 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.060
 series we must place one leg in front 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.550
 of the other separated at a distance 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.890
 considerable both feet should be 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.110
 throughout the exercise with the tip 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.690
 forward both the leg of 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.790
 forward as the one behind work from 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.670
 differently therefore is 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.370
 interesting to alternate the supports in each 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:49.250
 series to stimulate differently 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.850
 our quadriceps very well from this 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.800
 position 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.620
 we must descend the knee of the 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.600
 back leg towards the ground touch it 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.530
 and go back up as quickly 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.360
 possible as if the ground would burn us 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.550
 throughout the exercise we will try 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.420
 do not lean on our thighs with the 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.820
 hands 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.910
 this gesture would reduce intensity to 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.370
 We perform 6 sets of 10 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.070
 repetitions each alternating the 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.320
 supports in each series in such a way that 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.780
 In the end we will have made three series 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.940
 with the left leg in front and 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.360
 three series with the left leg by 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.360
 behind 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.330
 dosage we recommend the realization 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.419
 of the routine three days a week in 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.210
 alternate days at least a month to notice 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:44.520
 the results if you are so disciplined 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.009
 as to perform the routine during a 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.340
 month or two months if we have started from 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:52.800
 level 1 I personally congratulate you 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.080
 discipline and constancy spin the 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.720
 planet so if we reach this 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.139
 point we can go to the third level the 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.240
 which will be displayed soon gets
