00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
anyways um yeah the media portrays them

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.729 
anyways um yeah the media portrays them
as<00:03:15.870> some<00:03:16.560> nasty<00:03:17.069> snake<00:03:17.510> which<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.840> some<00:03:19.590> way

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
they are kind of correct as a general

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.890 
they are kind of correct as a general
rule<00:03:22.680> but<00:03:23.100> ketchup<00:03:23.910> here<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.329> probably<00:03:24.690> one<00:03:24.870> of

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
rule but ketchup here is probably one of

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.819 
rule but ketchup here is probably one of
the<00:03:25.079> most<00:03:25.260> if<00:03:26.100> not<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.489> most<00:03:26.910> docile<00:03:27.829> blood

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
all being a blood Python there were

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.569 
all being a blood Python there were
normally<00:03:48.030> short<00:03:48.329> and<00:03:48.480> stubby<00:03:48.720> um<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.010> she's

something<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:45.580> can<00:04:45.759> just<00:04:45.789> get<00:04:46.150> out<00:04:46.330> of

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
something that you can just get out of

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.029 
something that you can just get out of
nowhere<00:04:46.630> there's<00:04:47.080> definitely<00:04:47.590> a<00:04:47.620> lot<00:04:47.860> of

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
nowhere there's definitely a lot of

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.060 
nowhere there's definitely a lot of
thinking<00:04:48.370> even<00:04:48.729> for<00:04:48.940> someone<00:04:49.270> like<00:04:49.510> us<00:04:49.690> I<00:04:50.070> keep

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
thinking even for someone like us I keep

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.650 
thinking even for someone like us I keep
a<00:04:51.160> lot<00:04:51.340> of<00:04:51.460> snakes<00:04:51.729> in<00:04:52.000> a<00:04:52.090> large<00:04:52.300> collection

a lot of snakes in a large collection
it's<00:04:53.470> definitely<00:04:54.039> something<00:04:54.250> to<00:04:54.490> think<00:04:54.520> about

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
it's definitely something to think about

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.610 
it's definitely something to think about
before<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.300> purchase<00:04:55.539> it<00:04:55.870> there's<00:04:56.139> a<00:04:56.229> reason

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
before you purchase it there's a reason

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.600 
before you purchase it there's a reason
why<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:56.800> haven't<00:04:57.370> ever<00:04:57.940> had<00:04:58.479> a<00:04:58.889> large<00:04:59.889> snake<00:05:00.310> I

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
why I haven't ever had a large snake I

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.969 
why I haven't ever had a large snake I
would<00:05:00.910> say<00:05:01.090> out<00:05:01.240> of<00:05:01.389> my<00:05:01.510> whole<00:05:01.720> collection<00:05:01.979> my

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
you get bit it's not just going to be a

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.170 
you get bit it's not just going to be a
little<00:06:13.630> nip<00:06:14.400> but<00:06:15.400> also<00:06:15.580> they<00:06:15.820> don't<00:06:15.940> think

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
little nip but also they don't think

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.060 
little nip but also they don't think
