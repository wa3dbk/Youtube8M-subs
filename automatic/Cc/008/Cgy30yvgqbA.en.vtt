00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.460
 hello i'm happy to you 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.049
 find on the antenna full south tv where 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.600
 we will start again our chronicles 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.940
 garden then there we have another variety 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.400
 of orchid called the symbhi diom 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.289
 this variety of orchid at the faculty of 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.380
 to be able to spend the winter outside with us 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.140
 but still obviously in the shade it's 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.400
 to say morning sun or not this 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.230
 variety 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.230
 unlike others create 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.730
 species of bulbs so we will go out 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.290
 delicately the pot plant in relief 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.990
 obviously has the pellets separating 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.610
 a little bulbs and then we remove 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.250
 obviously the bulbs that are 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.900
 completely dead against those who 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.520
 are dry but still quite rigid and 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.260
 well it's better to keep them because 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.170
 that in rendering us they will transmit 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.670
 the energy to the other bulbs to be able to 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.560
 multiply 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.610
 and there you see the shoot that goes 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.350
 bloom next year so that's it 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.410
 always the same one gently shakes 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.930
 and we see the most 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.909
 damaged they will be removed but that by 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.730
 against we leave them that's very 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.130
 important to always leave old 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.750
 bulbs with the new ones and the device 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.750
 you have this year's shoot 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.820
 so we live delicately 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.520
 we try to go out we always look 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.240
 the roots some very nations 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.710
 damaged so we take them off 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.330
 here and there you have roots that 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.270
 are completely scene that it takes 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.240
 especially not cut it and well the goods 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:10.429
 protect them here you see there you have a 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.750
 bulb that is completely or the bull 's 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.310
 garlic completely we it is 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.330
 completely dead so he can 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.190
 remove 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.500
 on the other side will require 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.890
 keep them and there you have an old 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.610
 floral stems that similar is 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.410
 completely dried out and we will clean 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.030
 not too much of these parts there because 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.959
 that in fact it protects the bulbs or 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.959
 against insects 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.770
 that's the same 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.180
 here 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.130
 here we see that this bulb 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.390
 is completely dead in these words 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.709
 like that we take it off 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.390
 it can be cut here and there 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.920
 you already see the news 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:06.260
 roots it's the old flowers 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:07.970
 and there the new thrust on that side 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.220
 it's the same we see all the roots 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.209
 who are light brown and well we go 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.870
 go to cut to keep only 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.870
 beautiful roots 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.530
 then we usually do the 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.390
 potting orchids not every year 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.860
 unless she really grows very 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.440
 quickly but it's still quite rare 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.480
 repotting is usually done and 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.480
 oxidized every 2-3 years 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:46.660
 so obviously we do not keep the 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:50.260
 old potting soil we throw it out and then we 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.750
 may have the orchids then in 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.930
 do not put too much skins 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.280
 big you have to put skins just 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.280
 just big enough 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:07.150
 the plant must not be 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:09.130
 completely reviewed in the same pro 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.070
 the small ones we have them like that 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:26.620
 around and then we'll fill in 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:31.240
 soil then not need bubbles 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.850
 be completely buried either so 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.290
 we are careful to go back a little 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.290
 the plants 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.460
 here we have a little bit of it is the 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.480
 potting soil like that it's not very practical 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.730
 because since it is a 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.290
 potting soil that is very coarse 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.290
 bad to put everything in the pot 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:10.930
 we cup gently and always the same 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.820
 we will then very important when we do 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.930
 like that a transplant whatever 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.980
 is the plant that it is absolutely necessary 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:27.880
 do not forget to water so that's 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:29.440
 so here we water we look that the 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.420
 potting of the senses well and it is possible 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.580
 that within two to three days after the 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.770
 after this report when we watered 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.060
 sometimes we see that the potting soil is 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.730
 too tight at that moment we 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.740
 add a little bit then simbi 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.810
 dionne is the same as pellets 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.730
 all orchids thought very 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.190
 important especially from the month of 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.910
 June and until about the end of August in Bruz 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.910
 setting and foliage
