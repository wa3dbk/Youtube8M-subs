00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
wheel was all the way back for the

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.680 
wheel was all the way back for the
fender<00:00:12.990> at<00:00:13.049> one<00:00:13.200> time<00:00:13.969> was<00:00:14.969> all<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.360> way<00:00:15.480> back

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
fender at one time was all the way back

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.109 
fender at one time was all the way back
to<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.350> axle<00:00:16.949> ho<00:00:17.039> see<00:00:17.520> where<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:17.789> at<00:00:17.970> now<00:00:20.119> see

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
to the axle ho see where it's at now see

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.700 
to the axle ho see where it's at now see
we've<00:00:21.330> lost<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.869> lot<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.410> original<00:00:23.029> part<00:00:24.710> so

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
we've lost a lot of the original part so

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.609 
we've lost a lot of the original part so
one<00:00:25.949> time<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.519> was<00:00:26.689> clear<00:00:27.689> back<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> axle

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
one time it was clear back to the axle

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.420 
one time it was clear back to the axle
hope<00:00:29.810> when<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:30.960> added<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.560> plywood<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
hope when we added the plywood in the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.010 
hope when we added the plywood in the
inside<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.300> giveth<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.930> strength<00:00:34.350> and

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
inside that giveth the strength and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:44.200 
inside that giveth the strength and
stopped<00:00:37.020> us<00:00:37.260> from<00:00:37.290> sanding<00:00:38.300> all<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.570> away

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.060 

just<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.390> quick<00:00:45.719> little<00:00:46.520> trick<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:48.920> take<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
just a quick little trick to take the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.510 
just a quick little trick to take the
wheel<00:00:50.250> off<00:00:51.020> you<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.170> imagine<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.770> other<00:00:53.010> fit

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
wheel off you can imagine the other fit

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.569 
wheel off you can imagine the other fit
or<00:00:53.730> being<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:55.610> and<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.730> keep<00:00:56.940> them<00:00:57.000> even<00:00:58.579> he

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
or being on and to keep them even he

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.639 
or being on and to keep them even he
just<00:00:59.609> stands<00:01:00.090> across<00:01:00.449> both<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.350> them<00:01:01.469> at<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
just stands across both of them at the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.619 
just stands across both of them at the
same<00:01:01.710> time<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.640> way<00:01:02.789> they'll<00:01:03.030> both<00:01:03.210> come<00:01:03.239> out

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
same time that way they'll both come out

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:14.100 
same time that way they'll both come out
even

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.550 

anyway<00:01:15.110> I<00:01:15.140> think<00:01:15.530> that<00:01:16.150> should<00:01:17.150> be<00:01:17.560> should

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
anyway I think that should be should

any further until I get the other fender
office<00:02:19.220> at<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:19.940> can<00:02:20.270> sand<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.380> in<00:02:21.590> and

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
office at that so I can sand it in and

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.820 
office at that so I can sand it in and
get<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.459> same<00:02:22.959> same<00:02:23.959> shape<00:02:24.290> on<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.680> other

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
side and then I would at that point get

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.210 
side and then I would at that point get
serious<00:02:31.790> with<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:33.970> final<00:02:34.970> sanding<00:02:35.239> by<00:02:35.600> hand

you<00:03:28.510> have<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:29.380> is<00:03:29.770> a<00:03:31.320> setting<00:03:32.320> in<00:03:32.410> here<00:03:32.710> at<00:03:32.860> a

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
you have this is a setting in here at a

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.850 
you have this is a setting in here at a
90-degree<00:03:34.630> angle<00:03:34.660> your<00:03:35.170> bottom<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:35.710> your

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
90-degree angle your bottom of your

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.060 
90-degree angle your bottom of your
fender<00:03:36.510> you're<00:03:37.510> going<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.750> have<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:38.020> sand<00:03:38.890> an

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
fender you're going to have to sand an

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.690 
fender you're going to have to sand an
angle<00:03:39.490> into<00:03:39.790> that<00:03:40.000> so<00:03:40.450> it<00:03:40.690> will<00:03:40.810> ride<00:03:41.020> down<00:03:41.320> the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
angle into that so it will ride down the

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.310 
angle into that so it will ride down the
track<00:03:42.700> without<00:03:42.970> touching<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.780> center<00:03:44.110> rail

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
track without touching the center rail

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.630 
track without touching the center rail
which<00:03:44.920> will<00:03:45.100> slow<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.520> car<00:03:45.730> down<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:47.640> that's

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
which will slow the car down and that's

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.030 
which will slow the car down and that's
pretty<00:03:49.090> simple<00:03:49.390> by<00:03:49.840> just<00:03:50.080> coming<00:03:50.320> in<00:03:50.620> here<00:03:50.860> an

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
pretty simple by just coming in here an

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.870 
pretty simple by just coming in here an
angle<00:03:51.430> like<00:03:51.460> this<00:03:52.860> hope<00:03:53.860> you<00:03:54.070> can<00:03:54.250> see<00:03:54.520> that<00:03:54.550> on

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
angle like this hope you can see that on

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.470 
angle like this hope you can see that on
the<00:03:55.000> camera<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:57.100> only<00:03:57.400> takes<00:03:57.730> effect<00:04:00.480> make

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
the camera this only takes effect make

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.690 
the camera this only takes effect make
sure<00:04:01.510> he<00:04:02.140> lets<00:04:02.320> us<00:04:02.790> stop<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:04.000> clearest<00:04:05.700> see

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
sure he lets us stop the clearest see
