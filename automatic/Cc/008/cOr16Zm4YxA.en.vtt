at least a 24 set so you can have a lot

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.520 
at least a 24 set so you can have a lot
of<00:01:46.979> color<00:01:47.600> fairly<00:01:48.600> decent<00:01:48.960> amount<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.200> colors

to<00:01:49.770> blend<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.520> everything<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.210> wouldn't

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
to blend and everything I wouldn't

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.670 
to blend and everything I wouldn't
suggest<00:01:51.930> going<00:01:52.350> lower<00:01:52.770> than<00:01:53.009> 24<00:01:54.320> now<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.560> you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
suggest going lower than 24 now if you

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.649 
suggest going lower than 24 now if you
can't<00:01:55.920> afford<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.430> forget<00:01:57.000> what<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.119> said<00:01:57.210> and

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
can't afford it forget what I said and

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.160 
can't afford it forget what I said and
just<00:01:57.719> go<00:01:57.930> ahead<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.110> get<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> 12<00:01:58.680> set<00:02:00.079> but<00:02:01.079> if

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
just go ahead and get the 12 set but if

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.679 
just go ahead and get the 12 set but if
you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.500> at<00:02:01.890> least<00:02:02.219> get<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.700> 24<00:02:03.180> set<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.630> you

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
you can at least get the 24 set so you

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.289 
you can at least get the 24 set so you
have<00:02:03.960> enough<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.320> work<00:02:04.469> with<00:02:04.850> now<00:02:05.850> if<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.149> have

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
have enough to work with now if you have

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.749 
have enough to work with now if you have
enough<00:02:07.140> money<00:02:07.409> money<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:08.190> an<00:02:08.280> object<00:02:08.459> at

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
enough money money is not an object at

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.510 
enough money money is not an object at
all<00:02:09.080> then<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.110> would<00:02:10.349> suggest<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.979> go<00:02:11.190> what<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
all then I would suggest you go what it

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.640 
all then I would suggest you go what it
said<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:11.940> around<00:02:12.390> 72

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
said like around 72

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.970 
said like around 72
are<00:02:13.739> higher<00:02:14.519> or<00:02:14.939> somewhere<00:02:15.360> in<00:02:15.390> between<00:02:18.980> okay

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
are higher or somewhere in between okay

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.490 
are higher or somewhere in between okay
so<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.310> difference<00:02:20.489> between<00:02:20.790> artists

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
so the difference between artists

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.410 
so the difference between artists
