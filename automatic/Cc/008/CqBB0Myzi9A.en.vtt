00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:57.479 

I'm

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.950 

after<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.520> lot<00:00:58.730> of<00:00:58.790> practicing<00:00:59.270> and<00:00:59.570> just<00:00:59.780> going

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
after a lot of practicing and just going

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.660 
after a lot of practicing and just going
to<00:01:00.020> use<00:01:00.170> them<00:01:00.410> how<00:01:01.070> you<00:01:01.130> move<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:02.590> now<00:01:03.670> knowing

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
I think more about to watch is it be

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.080 
I think more about to watch is it be
like<00:01:06.320> once<00:01:06.950> you<00:01:07.010> start<00:01:07.280> something<00:01:07.490> exists<00:01:07.970> if

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
like once you start something exists if

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.770 
like once you start something exists if
we<00:01:08.180> just<00:01:08.390> don't<00:01:08.570> stop<00:01:09.310> getting<00:01:10.310> everything<00:01:10.780> in

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
we just don't stop getting everything in

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.450 
we just don't stop getting everything in
gear<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:12.550> it<00:01:13.550> is<00:01:13.700> six<00:01:13.940> that<00:01:14.210> way<00:01:14.560> that's<00:01:15.560> how

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
gear and it is six that way that's how

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:28.480 
gear and it is six that way that's how
we<00:01:16.490> can<00:01:16.760> join<00:01:17.000> in<00:01:18.040> Marshall<00:01:19.040> I<00:01:19.130> ways
