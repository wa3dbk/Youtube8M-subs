multiliner<00:00:19.310> they're<00:00:20.310> hard<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.580> find<00:00:20.640> in

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
multiliner they're hard to find in

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.900 
multiliner they're hard to find in
America<00:00:21.449> but<00:00:22.410> if<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.920> do<00:00:23.070> find<00:00:23.310> them<00:00:23.490> get<00:00:23.730> them

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
America but if you do find them get them

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.290 
America but if you do find them get them
they're<00:00:24.359> worth<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.689> price<00:00:25.760> Japan<00:00:26.760> make<00:00:27.000> them

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300

we<00:00:32.369> get<00:00:32.489> started<00:00:34.460> pretty<00:00:35.460> much<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.730> sea<00:00:36.000> has

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
we get started pretty much the sea has

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.150 
we get started pretty much the sea has
the<00:00:36.660> basic<00:00:37.140> letter<00:00:37.380> form<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.980> goes<00:00:38.190> up<00:00:40.160> because

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the basic letter form it goes up because

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.490 
the basic letter form it goes up because
up<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.820> little<00:00:42.090> bit<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.660> could<00:00:42.960> go<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.410> little

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
up a little bit it could go up a little

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.290 
up a little bit it could go up a little
more<00:00:43.800> or<00:00:44.070> if<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.309> go<00:00:44.460> down<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.059> did<00:00:45.090> here

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
more or if you go down like I did here

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.600 
more or if you go down like I did here
and<00:00:45.719> then<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.320> starts<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.739> head<00:00:46.890> down<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.460> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
and then it starts to head down to a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.580 
and then it starts to head down to a
loop<00:00:47.969> which<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.750> really<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:49.410> both

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
loop which is not really but they both

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.360 
loop which is not really but they both
straight<00:00:49.950> out<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.340> then<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
straight out and then in up that's the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.470 
straight out and then in up that's the
basic<00:00:53.879> letter<00:00:54.090> almost<00:00:54.420> everyone<00:00:55.020> uses<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:56.480> so

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
basic letter almost everyone uses it so

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.900 
basic letter almost everyone uses it so
don't<00:00:57.719> say<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> bit<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.980> off<00:00:59.070> someone<00:00:59.550> because

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
don't say I bit it off someone because

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.200 
don't say I bit it off someone because
it's<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> same<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.500> here<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.739> go

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.790 

two

my<00:01:10.400> whole<00:01:10.700> style<00:01:11.150> for<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.690> tutorials<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:12.680> not

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
my whole style for the tutorials and not

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.320 
my whole style for the tutorials and not
my<00:01:13.010> real<00:01:13.250> style<00:01:13.690> I<00:01:14.690> like<00:01:15.410> I<00:01:15.860> like<00:01:16.730> this<00:01:17.090> style

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
my real style I like I like this style

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.300 
my real style I like I like this style
though<00:01:17.570> it's<00:01:18.140> pretty<00:01:18.380> good<00:01:18.560> if<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:18.860> combine

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
though it's pretty good if you combine

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.740 
though it's pretty good if you combine
it<00:01:19.340> all<00:01:19.550> it<00:01:19.820> will<00:01:20.120> look<00:01:20.360> good<00:01:22.480> however<00:01:23.480> I<00:01:23.660> do

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
it all it will look good however I do

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.890 
it all it will look good however I do
add<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.230> long<00:01:24.560> extensions<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:25.640> my<00:01:25.790> letters<00:01:26.120> but

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
add a long extensions to my letters but

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.340 
add a long extensions to my letters but
that<00:01:27.110> may<00:01:27.290> be<00:01:27.320> because<00:01:27.620> um<00:01:28.870> there's<00:01:29.870> only<00:01:30.050> one

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
that may be because um there's only one

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.490 
that may be because um there's only one
letter<00:01:30.530> if<00:01:31.220> it<00:01:31.790> was<00:01:31.970> a<00:01:32.000> piece<00:01:32.450> i<00:01:32.720> would<00:01:32.930> not<00:01:33.140> add

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
letter if it was a piece i would not add
