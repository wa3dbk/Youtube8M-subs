00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
little bit creative but as long as you

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.420 
little bit creative but as long as you
can<00:02:52.810> just<00:02:52.960> move<00:02:53.110> your<00:02:53.290> finger<00:02:53.710> you<00:02:53.980> can<00:02:54.130> create

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
can just move your finger you can create

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.330 
can just move your finger you can create
different<00:02:54.520> things<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.620> play<00:02:56.620> around<00:02:56.770> with<00:02:57.070> it

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.830 

so<00:03:00.340> let's<00:03:00.580> try<00:03:01.000> each<00:03:01.240> pattern<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:05.320> that's<00:03:05.530> the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
so let's try each pattern so that's the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:15.510 
so let's try each pattern so that's the
that's<00:03:07.840> too<00:03:11.730> it's<00:03:12.730> pretty<00:03:12.940> obvious<00:03:13.360> it<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:15.250> it

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
that's too it's pretty obvious it you it

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.910 
that's too it's pretty obvious it you it
is<00:03:15.730> going<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.120> create<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:17.380> pattern<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:17.890> see

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
is going to create the pattern you see

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.640 
is going to create the pattern you see
at<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.220> top<00:03:18.280> right<00:03:18.670> here<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:18.970> small<00:03:19.240> ones

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
at the top right here the small ones

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.520 
at the top right here the small ones
just<00:03:21.510> mix<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.720> match<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:23.140> create

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
just mix and match it to create

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:35.090 
just mix and match it to create
something<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.980> works<00:03:24.580> for<00:03:24.820> you

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.260
