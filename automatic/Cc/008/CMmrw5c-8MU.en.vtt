00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
howdy doodly Doo this is some free for

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.019 
howdy doodly Doo this is some free for
all<00:00:03.600> gameplay<00:00:03.870> on<00:00:04.170> an<00:00:04.290> invasion<00:00:04.609> first<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:05.850> got

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
all gameplay on an invasion first I got

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.579 
all gameplay on an invasion first I got
a<00:00:06.060> couple<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.359> days<00:00:06.509> ago<00:00:06.540> actually<00:00:07.049> it's<00:00:07.440> more

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
a couple of days ago actually it's more

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.780 
a couple of days ago actually it's more
than<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:07.770> because<00:00:07.980> this<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.429> from<00:00:08.639> when<00:00:08.730> I

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
than that because this is from when I

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.610 
than that because this is from when I
was<00:00:08.970> doing<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.420> request<00:00:09.780> game<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.260> vector

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
was doing the request game of the vector

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.320 
was doing the request game of the vector
and<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.550> one<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.849> game<00:00:11.969> players<00:00:12.210> I

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
and this is one of the game players I

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.789 
and this is one of the game players I
was<00:00:12.450> going<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.660> use<00:00:12.690> but<00:00:13.049> then<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.290> decided<00:00:13.590> to

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
was going to use but then I decided to

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.860 
was going to use but then I decided to
use<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> other<00:00:14.040> one<00:00:14.250> instead<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:14.870> similar

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
use the other one instead so similar

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.390 
use the other one instead so similar
setups<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.379> last<00:00:16.560> one<00:00:16.800> it's<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.100> vector

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
setups in the last one it's a vector

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.040 
setups in the last one it's a vector
with<00:00:17.490> holographic<00:00:17.910> math<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.720> lightweight

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
with holographic math and lightweight

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.410 
with holographic math and lightweight
and<00:00:19.140> steady<00:00:19.410> aim<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.939> yeah<00:00:20.939> just<00:00:21.150> run<00:00:21.300> around

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
and steady aim and yeah just run around

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.090 
and steady aim and yeah just run around
a<00:00:21.570> free-for-all<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.020> killing<00:00:22.830> people<00:00:22.859> and

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
a free-for-all and killing people and

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.849 
a free-for-all and killing people and
picking<00:00:23.880> up<00:00:23.970> other<00:00:24.090> guns<00:00:24.330> as<00:00:24.449> well<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:25.439> what

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
picking up other guns as well and what

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.839 
picking up other guns as well and what
I'm<00:00:25.920> going<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.189> from<00:00:26.369> now<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.670> you'll<00:00:26.820> see

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
I'm going to do from now on you'll see

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.400 
I'm going to do from now on you'll see
the<00:00:27.090> title<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.480> different<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.900> normal<00:00:28.019> instead

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
the title is different to normal instead

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.470 
the title is different to normal instead
of<00:00:28.560> saying<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> normal<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:29.939> warfare<00:00:30.300> two

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
of saying the normal one warfare two

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.930 
of saying the normal one warfare two
free-for-all<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.590> or<00:00:31.890> whatever<00:00:32.099> I'm<00:00:32.730> gonna

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
free-for-all to or whatever I'm gonna

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.549 
free-for-all to or whatever I'm gonna
just<00:00:33.090> give<00:00:33.239> them<00:00:33.360> titles<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:34.320> each

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
just give them titles like each

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.130 
just give them titles like each
individual<00:00:35.070> titles<00:00:35.750> not<00:00:36.750> for<00:00:36.870> any<00:00:37.020> particular

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
individual titles not for any particular

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.229 
individual titles not for any particular
reason<00:00:37.530> other<00:00:37.890> than<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.460> don't<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.000> look

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
reason other than I don't like to look

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.930 
reason other than I don't like to look
at<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> generic<00:00:40.230> title<00:00:41.190> format<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.790> just

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
at the generic title format it just

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.250 
at the generic title format it just
looks<00:00:42.090> kind<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.270> boring<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.809> figured<00:00:43.110> you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
looks kind of boring so I figured you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.319 
looks kind of boring so I figured you
know<00:00:43.680> I'll<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.190> give<00:00:44.430> more<00:00:44.610> unique<00:00:44.910> titles

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
know I'll just give more unique titles

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.930 
know I'll just give more unique titles
just<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.309> think<00:00:47.700> that'd<00:00:47.820> be

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
just because I can and I think that'd be

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.360 
just because I can and I think that'd be
the<00:00:48.000> best<00:00:48.149> idea<00:00:48.800> but<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> content<00:00:50.250> itself

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the best idea but the content itself

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.549 
the best idea but the content itself
will<00:00:50.700> not<00:00:50.730> change<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:52.020> need<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.410> worry<00:00:52.530> about

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
will not change so I need to worry about

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.930 
will not change so I need to worry about
that<00:00:52.739> because<00:00:53.699> if<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.149> would<00:00:54.329> put<00:00:55.079> sir<00:00:55.940> yeah

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that because if you would put sir yeah

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.299 
that because if you would put sir yeah
vector<00:00:57.300> holographic<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:58.350> holographic<00:00:59.010> is

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
vector holographic now holographic is

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.729 
vector holographic now holographic is
got<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.820> best<00:01:00.059> site<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.660> don't<00:01:01.649> really

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
got to be the best site I don't really

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.229 
got to be the best site I don't really
like<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> iron<00:01:02.129> sights<00:01:02.430> although<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.940> said<00:01:03.210> I

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
like the iron sights although I said I

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.870 
like the iron sights although I said I
did<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.840> mean<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:04.949> them<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.339> don't<00:01:05.610> have

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
did I mean I like them but I don't have

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.640 
did I mean I like them but I don't have
much<00:01:06.090> success<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.659> them<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.900> what<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.260> really

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
much success for them is what I really

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.640 
much success for them is what I really
mean<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.490> pawn<00:01:09.360> holographic<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.350> may<00:01:10.500> do

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
mean so pawn holographic and you may do

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.140 
mean so pawn holographic and you may do
better<00:01:10.680> that's<00:01:11.250> what<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.549> found<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:12.000> my

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
better that's what I found for my

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.969 
better that's what I found for my
experience<00:01:12.510> even<00:01:13.380> that's<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.860> little

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
experience even that's just a little

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.460 
experience even that's just a little
difference<00:01:14.460> really<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.240> don't<00:01:16.229> know<00:01:16.380> if

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
difference really just I don't know if

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.560 
difference really just I don't know if
it<00:01:16.530> actually<00:01:16.560> changes<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.460> way<00:01:17.670> hit

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
it actually changes the way hit

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.929 
it actually changes the way hit
detection<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:20.159> will<00:01:20.280> always<00:01:20.520> hit<00:01:20.700> within

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
detection like so will always hit within

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.969 
detection like so will always hit within
the<00:01:21.180> holographic<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.990> within<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.590> red<00:01:22.740> dot

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the holographic and within the red dot

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.499 
the holographic and within the red dot
and<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.580> seems<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> kind<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.000> stupid<00:01:24.360> thing

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and it seems the kind of stupid thing

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.820 
and it seems the kind of stupid thing
really<00:01:24.689> because<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.140> still<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> same<00:01:25.439> gun

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
really because it's still the same gun

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.300 
really because it's still the same gun
all<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.880> an<00:01:27.770> aesthetic<00:01:28.770> change<00:01:29.070> really

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
all it is is an aesthetic change really

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.399 
all it is is an aesthetic change really
isn't<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> different<00:01:29.820> site<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.140> think<00:01:31.320> it

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
isn't it a different site but I think it

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.440 
isn't it a different site but I think it
actually<00:01:31.500> changes<00:01:31.790> whereabouts<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.150> so

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
actually changes whereabouts you here so

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.740

the<00:05:01.349> point<00:05:01.469> I<00:05:01.620> was<00:05:01.710> making<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.340> they<00:05:02.580> took<00:05:02.969> it

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
the point I was making and they took it

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.209 
the point I was making and they took it
the<00:05:03.150> wrong<00:05:03.180> way<00:05:03.330> so<00:05:03.539> I<00:05:04.050> thought<00:05:04.710> well<00:05:04.949> okay

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
the wrong way so I thought well okay

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.430 
the wrong way so I thought well okay
clearly<00:05:06.150> I<00:05:06.180> didn't<00:05:06.479> make<00:05:06.569> it<00:05:06.629> clear<00:05:07.169> what<00:05:07.409> I

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
clearly I didn't make it clear what I

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.649 
clearly I didn't make it clear what I
was<00:05:07.590> doing<00:05:07.860> in<00:05:07.979> the<00:05:08.069> game<00:05:08.250> so<00:05:08.639> i'll<00:05:09.270> take<00:05:09.569> it

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
was doing in the game so i'll take it

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.209 
was doing in the game so i'll take it
down<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.020> maybe<00:05:10.139> reupload<00:05:10.710> it<00:05:10.740> another<00:05:11.009> time

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:11.219 
down and maybe reupload it another time

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:12.589 
down and maybe reupload it another time
with<00:05:11.460> different<00:05:11.759> commentary<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:12.389> a

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
with different commentary and a

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.779 
with different commentary and a
different<00:05:13.349> gameplay<00:05:14.159> just<00:05:14.370> to<00:05:14.460> show<00:05:14.580> what<00:05:14.610> i

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
different gameplay just to show what i

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.330 
different gameplay just to show what i
really<00:05:15.060> meant<00:05:15.180> so<00:05:15.509> I'll<00:05:15.960> just<00:05:16.190> put<00:05:17.190> that<00:05:17.219> to

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
really meant so I'll just put that to

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.269 
really meant so I'll just put that to
the<00:05:17.460> side<00:05:17.580> for<00:05:17.819> the<00:05:18.090> time<00:05:18.270> being<00:05:18.569> and<00:05:19.379> you'll

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:20.279 
the side for the time being and you'll

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:22.070 
the side for the time being and you'll
see<00:05:20.460> here<00:05:20.639> I<00:05:20.669> have<00:05:20.819> an<00:05:21.060> f<00:05:21.180> 2000<00:05:21.719> with<00:05:21.870> the

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
see here I have an f 2000 with the

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.570 
see here I have an f 2000 with the
infamous<00:05:22.409> new<00:05:22.620> tubes<00:05:22.919> and<00:05:23.219> I've<00:05:23.310> already<00:05:23.430> used

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
infamous new tubes and I've already used

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.969 
infamous new tubes and I've already used
them<00:05:23.759> both<00:05:23.939> to<00:05:24.300> get<00:05:24.449> kill<00:05:24.659> it's<00:05:25.560> kind<00:05:25.740> of<00:05:25.770> funny

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
them both to get kill it's kind of funny

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.709 
them both to get kill it's kind of funny
I<00:05:26.039> never<00:05:26.340> used<00:05:26.639> noob<00:05:26.879> tubes<00:05:27.120> myself<00:05:27.539> in<00:05:27.659> a

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719 
I never used noob tubes myself in a

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:29.390 
I never used noob tubes myself in a
class<00:05:27.930> but<00:05:28.199> I<00:05:28.229> always<00:05:28.680> seem<00:05:28.889> to<00:05:29.009> end<00:05:29.039> up<00:05:29.219> using

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
class but I always seem to end up using

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.089 
class but I always seem to end up using
them<00:05:29.639> in<00:05:29.669> a<00:05:29.759> gameplay<00:05:30.120> we<00:05:30.840> noticed<00:05:31.169> that<00:05:31.229> kind

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
them in a gameplay we noticed that kind

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.659 
them in a gameplay we noticed that kind
of<00:05:32.159> funny<00:05:32.370> but<00:05:33.620> f2000<00:05:34.620> I<00:05:34.860> wouldn't<00:05:35.430> recommend

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
of funny but f2000 I wouldn't recommend

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.339 
of funny but f2000 I wouldn't recommend
it<00:05:35.789> with<00:05:35.909> the<00:05:36.000> iron<00:05:36.150> sights<00:05:36.360> that<00:05:36.539> the

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
it with the iron sights that the

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:38.839 
it with the iron sights that the
ancestor<00:05:37.770> pretty<00:05:37.949> bad<00:05:38.129> in<00:05:38.310> my<00:05:38.430> opinion<00:05:38.669> but

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
ancestor pretty bad in my opinion but

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:39.890 
ancestor pretty bad in my opinion but
although<00:05:39.090> a<00:05:39.210> lot<00:05:39.330> of<00:05:39.389> people<00:05:39.449> you'd<00:05:39.719> like<00:05:39.750> to

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
although a lot of people you'd like to

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.240 
although a lot of people you'd like to
use<00:05:40.080> it<00:05:40.169> with<00:05:40.289> a<00:05:40.349> science<00:05:40.650> so<00:05:40.800> just<00:05:41.009> for<00:05:41.129> the

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
use it with a science so just for the

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.730 
use it with a science so just for the
reduced<00:05:41.610> recoil<00:05:41.879> and<00:05:42.330> I<00:05:42.509> guess<00:05:42.750> you<00:05:43.560> have<00:05:43.680> to

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
reduced recoil and I guess you have to

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.339 
reduced recoil and I guess you have to
use<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:44.009> ice<00:05:44.129> ice<00:05:44.339> there<00:05:44.580> so<00:05:45.169> unless<00:05:46.169> use

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
use the ice ice there so unless use

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.170 
use the ice ice there so unless use
bling<00:05:46.650> but<00:05:46.889> scavengers<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:47.819> best<00:05:48.000> choice

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
bling but scavengers the best choice

opinion the guillotines rush you've

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:10.040 
opinion the guillotines rush you've
really<00:06:09.089> hard<00:06:09.210> to<00:06:09.300> control<00:06:09.539> with<00:06:09.779> longer

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
really hard to control with longer

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.619 
really hard to control with longer
ranges<00:06:10.409> the<00:06:11.099> pp<00:06:11.370> 2k<00:06:11.729> is<00:06:11.789> pretty<00:06:12.029> solid<00:06:12.240> in<00:06:12.479> any

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:12.629 
ranges the pp 2k is pretty solid in any

range<00:06:12.900> although<00:06:13.469> they<00:06:13.680> don't<00:06:13.830> have<00:06:13.919> much<00:06:14.099> ammo

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430

range although they don't have much ammo
which<00:06:14.610> is<00:06:14.789> their<00:06:14.969> downfall<00:06:15.509> really<00:06:15.889> but<00:06:16.889> see

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:17.279 
which is their downfall really but see

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:19.519 
which is their downfall really but see
here<00:06:17.400> i<00:06:17.699> also<00:06:18.000> have<00:06:18.150> an<00:06:18.240> l<00:06:18.389> 86<00:06:18.659> at<00:06:19.110> some<00:06:19.289> point

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:19.529 
here i also have an l 86 at some point

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:21.260 
here i also have an l 86 at some point
which<00:06:19.740> is<00:06:20.009> one<00:06:20.460> of<00:06:20.490> the<00:06:20.610> best<00:06:20.789> light<00:06:21.000> machine

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
which is one of the best light machine

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.779 
which is one of the best light machine
guns<00:06:21.479> in<00:06:21.599> the<00:06:21.659> game<00:06:21.870> hi<00:06:22.830> rectifier<00:06:23.370> combined

guns in the game hi rectifier combined

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.309 
guns in the game hi rectifier combined
with<00:06:23.909> high<00:06:24.089> damage<00:06:24.389> it's<00:06:24.930> actually<00:06:25.199> the<00:06:25.289> same

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 
with high damage it's actually the same

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.559 
with high damage it's actually the same
damage<00:06:25.710> of<00:06:25.919> the<00:06:25.949> rpd<00:06:26.400> but<00:06:27.120> a<00:06:27.150> higher<00:06:27.360> rate<00:06:27.539> of

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:27.569 
damage of the rpd but a higher rate of

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:28.690 
damage of the rpd but a higher rate of
fire<00:06:27.930> so

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
fire so

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.610 
fire so
technically<00:06:29.210> it<00:06:29.480> kills<00:06:29.720> faster<00:06:30.050> but<00:06:30.500> in

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
technically it kills faster but in

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.130 
technically it kills faster but in
return<00:06:30.770> you<00:06:31.310> have<00:06:31.790> high<00:06:31.970> recoil<00:06:32.390> so<00:06:32.720> it's<00:06:33.020> up

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
return you have high recoil so it's up

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.030
