that you have one up beam zerona sarona
Zerona<00:02:01.710> was<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.189> first<00:02:02.460> non-invasive

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
Zerona was the first non-invasive

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.170 
Zerona was the first non-invasive
procedure<00:02:03.719> for<00:02:04.380> eliminating<00:02:05.189> fat<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:06.119> it

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
procedure for eliminating fat and it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.059 
procedure for eliminating fat and it
does<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.719> we<00:02:07.079> measure<00:02:07.290> its<00:02:07.500> success<00:02:07.829> in

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
does just that we measure its success in

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.889 
does just that we measure its success in
the<00:02:08.369> number<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.700> inches<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.270> lose<00:02:09.450> okay

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
the number of inches that you lose okay

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.540 
the number of inches that you lose okay
and<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.319> thing

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
and the thing

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.160 
and the thing
about<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:10.970> is<00:02:11.210> that<00:02:11.240> it's<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.930> said

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
about that is that it's you said

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.830 
about that is that it's you said
non-invasive<00:02:12.710> in<00:02:13.280> 40<00:02:14.030> minutes<00:02:14.210> is<00:02:14.450> how<00:02:14.600> long<00:02:14.780> a

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
non-invasive in 40 minutes is how long a

you're done ok and a little bit of this

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.260 
you're done ok and a little bit of this
we're<00:02:21.980> looking<00:02:22.220> at<00:02:22.340> some<00:02:22.520> before<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.880> after

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
we're looking at some before and after

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.630 
we're looking at some before and after
pictures<00:02:23.570> yearly<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:24.560> we<00:02:24.710> have<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:24.890> before<00:02:25.460> on

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
pictures yearly so we have a before on

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.690 
pictures yearly so we have a before on
the<00:02:25.760> left<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.090> after<00:02:26.540> on<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:27.770> on<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.430> right

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
the left and after on the on the right

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.550 
the left and after on the on the right
uh-huh<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.420> can<00:02:29.570> tell<00:02:29.750> there's<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.080> decrease

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
uh-huh you can tell there's a decrease

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.520 
uh-huh you can tell there's a decrease
there<00:02:30.800> in<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.040> size<00:02:31.720> this<00:02:32.720> procedure<00:02:32.960> we<00:02:33.380> also

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
there in the size this procedure we also

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.620 
there in the size this procedure we also
combine<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.040> with<00:02:34.070> weight<00:02:34.310> loss<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:35.270> that<00:02:35.510> you

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
combine it with weight loss so that you

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.810 
combine it with weight loss so that you
can<00:02:35.810> have<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:36.140> in<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.530> decrease<00:02:37.130> in<00:02:37.160> inches<00:02:37.640> as

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
can have it in a decrease in inches as

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.150 
can have it in a decrease in inches as
well<00:02:38.150> as<00:02:38.360> decrease<00:02:38.990> in<00:02:39.140> weight<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.500> this<00:02:39.770> uses

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
well as decrease in weight and this uses

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.910 
well as decrease in weight and this uses
a<00:02:40.190> laser<00:02:40.640> explain<00:02:41.450> how<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.660> works<00:02:42.200> exactly

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
a laser explain how that works exactly

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.550 
a laser explain how that works exactly
we<00:02:43.220> we<00:02:43.550> utilize<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.300> light<00:02:44.480> energy<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.110> target

results<00:02:58.550> well<00:02:59.210> the<00:02:59.390> entire<00:02:59.480> protocol<00:03:00.230> is<00:03:00.440> six

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
results well the entire protocol is six

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.710 
results well the entire protocol is six
treatments<00:03:00.860> so<00:03:01.520> you<00:03:01.580> get<00:03:01.880> results<00:03:02.030> within<00:03:02.450> two

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
treatments so you get results within two

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.350 
treatments so you get results within two
to<00:03:02.840> three<00:03:02.870> weeks<00:03:03.020> very<00:03:03.680> very<00:03:04.040> fast<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.550> that's

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
to three weeks very very fast and that's

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.270
