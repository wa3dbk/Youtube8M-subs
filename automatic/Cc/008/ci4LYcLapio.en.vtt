00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
gonna have a problem with it but

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.999 
gonna have a problem with it but
apparently<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:03.119> few<00:02:03.299> people<00:02:03.569> do<00:02:03.749> now<00:02:04.530> there's

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
apparently a few people do now there's

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.739 
apparently a few people do now there's
ways<00:02:05.249> to<00:02:05.280> counter<00:02:05.789> it<00:02:05.880> half<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.329> time

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:06.749 
ways to counter it half the time

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:09.949 
ways to counter it half the time
sometimes<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:08.130> have<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.550> slight<00:02:09.450> second

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
sometimes you have that slight second

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.390 
sometimes you have that slight second
where<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.350> pull<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> trigger<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.100> get

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
where you can pull the trigger and get

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.309 
where you can pull the trigger and get
the<00:02:11.520> kill<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:12.510> not<00:02:12.630> gonna<00:02:12.780> be<00:02:12.870> all<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.110> time

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
the kill it's not gonna be all the time

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.560 
the kill it's not gonna be all the time
on<00:02:13.530> parent<00:02:13.830> like<00:02:14.010> half<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.370> time<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.700> get<00:02:15.330> set

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
on parent like half the time you get set

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.060 
on parent like half the time you get set
automatically<00:02:16.020> on<00:02:16.290> half<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.470> time<00:02:16.590> you'll<00:02:16.920> be

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
automatically on half the time you'll be

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.490 
automatically on half the time you'll be
able<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.280> kill<00:02:17.370> them

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
able to kill them

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.920 
able to kill them
I'm<00:02:19.500> not<00:02:19.650> sure<00:02:19.860> if<00:02:19.980> people<00:02:20.850> want<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.810> be

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
I'm not sure if people want that to be

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.050 
I'm not sure if people want that to be
passed<00:02:22.170> maybe<00:02:22.440> what<00:02:22.860> they<00:02:22.950> could<00:02:23.130> do<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.580> give

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
passed maybe what they could do is give

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.000 
passed maybe what they could do is give
a<00:02:24.090> little<00:02:24.240> bit<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.960> delay<00:02:25.200> for<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.590> second

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
a little bit of a delay for the second

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.430 
a little bit of a delay for the second
Mele<00:02:26.310> because<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:27.060> first<00:02:27.270> Mele<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.690> fast<00:02:28.110> and

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
Mele because the first Mele is fast and

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.020 
Mele because the first Mele is fast and
the<00:02:28.500> second<00:02:28.830> male<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.100> can<00:02:29.250> come<00:02:29.460> right<00:02:29.730> after

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
the second male it can come right after

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.240 
the second male it can come right after
the<00:02:30.120> first<00:02:30.330> Mele<00:02:30.690> it's<00:02:31.080> like<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.470> quick<00:02:31.800> second

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
the first Mele it's like a quick second

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.950 
the first Mele it's like a quick second
dad<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:33.780> could<00:02:35.300> hit<00:02:36.300> him<00:02:36.390> again<00:02:36.600> with<00:02:36.840> another

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
dad you could hit him again with another

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.830 
dad you could hit him again with another
Mele<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.920> what<00:02:38.040> they<00:02:38.130> could<00:02:38.250> do<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.610> give<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.450> a

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
Mele so what they could do is give it a

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.200 
Mele so what they could do is give it a
delay<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.620> guess<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.400> could<00:02:41.520> somewhat<00:02:42.000> patch

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
delay I guess that could somewhat patch

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.240 
delay I guess that could somewhat patch
it<00:02:42.390> up<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:44.540> mean<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.140> adapted<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:47.040> as

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
it up I mean I just adapted to it as

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.220 
it up I mean I just adapted to it as
much<00:02:47.430> as<00:02:47.580> possible<00:02:47.760> if<00:02:48.210> I<00:02:48.360> get<00:02:48.540> malate<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.990> start
