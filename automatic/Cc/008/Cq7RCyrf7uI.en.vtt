bottle to Cup they're actually have to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.470 
bottle to Cup they're actually have to
face<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.130> challenge<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.699> actually<00:00:24.060> learning

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
face the challenge of actually learning

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.349 
face the challenge of actually learning
how<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.840> pick<00:00:25.050> up<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.350> cup<00:00:25.560> which<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.099> adults<00:00:26.519> we

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
how to pick up a cup which is adults we

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.210 
how to pick up a cup which is adults we
have<00:00:27.480> an<00:00:27.570> advantage<00:00:27.900> because<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.590> know<00:00:28.980> how<00:00:29.160> to

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
have an advantage because we know how to

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.460 
have an advantage because we know how to
rotate<00:00:29.460> from<00:00:29.910> our<00:00:30.029> wrist<00:00:30.269> pivot<00:00:31.199> from<00:00:31.289> our

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
rotate from our wrist pivot from our

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.620 
rotate from our wrist pivot from our
elbow<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.009> rotate<00:00:32.489> our<00:00:32.700> shoulder<00:00:33.120> which<00:00:33.480> is

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
elbow and rotate our shoulder which is

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.970 
elbow and rotate our shoulder which is
why<00:00:33.780> we're<00:00:33.960> able<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.260> get<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> cup<00:00:34.680> straight

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
why we're able to get the cup straight

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.750 
why we're able to get the cup straight
into<00:00:35.219> our<00:00:35.250> mouth

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
into our mouth

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.910 
into our mouth
little<00:00:36.270> ones<00:00:36.450> however<00:00:36.840> have<00:00:37.260> only<00:00:37.530> developed

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
little ones however have only developed

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.459 
little ones however have only developed
the<00:00:37.980> motor<00:00:38.160> skills<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:39.030> rotate<00:00:39.450> from<00:00:40.260> their

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the motor skills to rotate from their

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.220 
the motor skills to rotate from their
elbow<00:00:41.250> which<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.090> why<00:00:42.300> when<00:00:42.899> they're<00:00:43.020> picking

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
elbow which is why when they're picking

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.080 
elbow which is why when they're picking
up<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.530> cup<00:00:43.739> they<00:00:44.070> tend<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.370> hit<00:00:44.489> their<00:00:44.670> chin<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
up a cup they tend to hit their chin and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.060 
up a cup they tend to hit their chin and
hit<00:00:45.539> their<00:00:45.719> nose<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.620> first<00:00:46.829> thing<00:00:47.039> that

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
hit their nose so the first thing that

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.610 
hit their nose so the first thing that
we<00:00:47.219> do<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.910> actually<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> cup<00:00:48.899> leaning

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
we do is actually have the cup leaning

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.860 
we do is actually have the cup leaning
towards<00:00:50.550> little<00:00:50.789> one<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.570> when<00:00:51.719> they<00:00:51.840> are

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
towards little one so that when they are

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.020 
towards little one so that when they are
pivoting<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.710> from<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> elbow<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.699> cup<00:00:53.910> is

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
pivoting just from the elbow the cup is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.580 
pivoting just from the elbow the cup is
actually<00:00:54.329> far<00:00:54.539> more<00:00:54.690> likely<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.199> go<00:00:55.320> straight

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
actually far more likely to go straight

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.709 
actually far more likely to go straight
into<00:00:55.890> their<00:00:56.039> mouth<00:00:56.210> you'll<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.539> also

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
into their mouth you'll see that we also

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.500 
into their mouth you'll see that we also
give<00:00:58.079> nice<00:00:58.739> big<00:00:59.039> chunky<00:00:59.460> handles<00:00:59.850> much<00:01:00.090> easier

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
give nice big chunky handles much easier

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.389 
give nice big chunky handles much easier
for<00:01:00.660> little<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.199> hold<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.949> you'll

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
for little one to hold on to and you'll

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.280 
for little one to hold on to and you'll
also<00:01:02.579> notice<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.120> compared<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> other

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
also notice that compared to other

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.830 
also notice that compared to other
trainer<00:01:04.619> cups<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.460> actually<00:01:05.939> quite<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> bit

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
trainer cups it's actually quite a bit

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.660 
trainer cups it's actually quite a bit
smaller<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.409> smaller<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.100> better<00:01:08.130> when

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
smaller and smaller is better when

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.670 
smaller and smaller is better when
little<00:01:09.210> ones<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.510> learning<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.900> use<00:01:10.080> cups<00:01:10.560> of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
little ones are learning to use cups of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.590 
little ones are learning to use cups of
the<00:01:10.740> first<00:01:10.920> time<00:01:11.189> because<00:01:11.670> smaller<00:01:12.360> means

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the first time because smaller means

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.350 
the first time because smaller means
lighter<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> make<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.490> transition<00:01:14.790> from

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
lighter so to make that transition from

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.210 
lighter so to make that transition from
the<00:01:15.600> bottle<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.170> cup<00:01:16.500> there<00:01:16.799> are<00:01:16.920> four

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the bottle to the cup there are four

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
the bottle to the cup there are four
different<00:01:17.610> ways<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.360> little<00:01:18.659> one<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.990> use<00:01:19.229> it

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
different ways the little one can use it

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.679 
different ways the little one can use it
one<00:01:19.979> way<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.520> keep<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.790> handles<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
one way is to keep the handles on and

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.620 
one way is to keep the handles on and
the<00:01:22.290> soft<00:01:22.500> silicon<00:01:22.860> teton<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:24.390> works

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the soft silicon teton and this works

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.810 
the soft silicon teton and this works
what<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:24.990> call<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> slip<00:01:25.500> valve<00:01:25.740> whereby<00:01:26.430> little

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
what we call a slip valve whereby little

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.080 
what we call a slip valve whereby little
one<00:01:26.939> puts<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.509> their<00:01:27.659> mouth<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
one puts this in their mouth and the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.340 
one puts this in their mouth and the
squeezing<00:01:30.090> effect<00:01:30.420> actually<00:01:30.780> opens<00:01:31.079> up<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
squeezing effect actually opens up the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.260 
squeezing effect actually opens up the
valves<00:01:31.710> making<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.280> very<00:01:32.490> easy<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.850> drink<00:01:33.030> from

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
valves making it very easy to drink from

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.100 
valves making it very easy to drink from
yet<00:01:33.720> still<00:01:34.020> being<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.590> non<00:01:35.520> spill<00:01:35.939> cup<00:01:36.210> very

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
yet still being a non spill cup very

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.960 
yet still being a non spill cup very
good<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.470> moms<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.770> dads<00:01:37.950> another<00:01:38.729> way<00:01:38.909> to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
good for moms and dads another way to

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.580 
good for moms and dads another way to
use<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.750> take<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> handles<00:01:40.409> off

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
use it is just to take the handles off

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.920 
use it is just to take the handles off
you've<00:01:41.579> still<00:01:41.850> got<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> teat<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.630> now

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
you've still got the teat and now

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.480 
you've still got the teat and now
there's<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.200> little<00:01:43.409> bit<00:01:43.530> closer<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> bottle

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
there's a little bit closer to a bottle

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.300 
there's a little bit closer to a bottle
so<00:01:45.149> might<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.960> an<00:01:46.140> easier<00:01:46.530> way<00:01:46.710> for<00:01:46.950> some

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
so might be an easier way for some

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.520 
so might be an easier way for some
little<00:01:47.520> ones<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.909> start<00:01:48.119> another<00:01:48.990> way<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.200> use

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
little ones to start another way to use

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.469 
little ones to start another way to use
it<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.979> actually<00:01:50.280> replace<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.790> teeth<00:01:51.000> with

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
it is to actually replace the teeth with

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.300 
it is to actually replace the teeth with
a<00:01:51.509> sipper<00:01:51.869> ring<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.680> cipa<00:01:52.890> ring<00:01:53.130> has<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
a sipper ring and the cipa ring has a

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.609 
a sipper ring and the cipa ring has a
nice<00:01:53.610> big<00:01:53.939> chunky<00:01:54.390> lip<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.720> here<00:01:54.930> making<00:01:55.560> it

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
nice big chunky lip on here making it

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.289 
nice big chunky lip on here making it
much<00:01:55.770> easier<00:01:56.009> for<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.340> little<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:57.119> learn

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
much easier for a little one to learn

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.690 
much easier for a little one to learn
how<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.600> make<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.990> transition<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> cup<00:01:59.520> and

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
how to make that transition to a cup and

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.520 
how to make that transition to a cup and
another<00:02:00.329> way<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.570> use<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.110> taking<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
another way to use it is taking the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.859 
another way to use it is taking the
handles<00:02:01.950> off<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.880> having<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.540> cipa

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
handles off and just having the cipa

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.980 
handles off and just having the cipa
ring<00:02:04.049> on<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.409> finally<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:06.000> lid<00:02:06.780> which

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
ring on and finally we have a lid which

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.830 
ring on and finally we have a lid which
is<00:02:07.170> very<00:02:07.409> easy<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.740> take<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.250> off<00:02:08.660> but<00:02:09.660> not

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
is very easy to take on and off but not

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.290 
is very easy to take on and off but not
so<00:02:10.080> easy<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:11.340> actually<00:02:11.580> comes<00:02:11.849> off<00:02:12.000> in

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
so easy that it actually comes off in

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.780 
so easy that it actually comes off in
your<00:02:12.599> bag
