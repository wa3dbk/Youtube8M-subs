 Well, twice as Norway's superstar already won with a sovereignty 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.579

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.250
 As she develops his sda an athlete trimmed off on great achievements 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.550
 like one percent 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.640

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.460

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.580
 but despite the rapper polarity this time with Jürgen Seitz on the ground 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.240
