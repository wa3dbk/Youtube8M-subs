00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:22.530
 so well, that very briefly wanted 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:27.190
 tell a little bit here in such a knife 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:38.170
 which is called cavity will this 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:40.239
 your version is basically my first 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.190
 the knife that I always leave for 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.260
 pocket 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.260
 pretty big for indie 7 moves 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:56.380
 so I will not torture all the parameters well 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.489
 the handle is of course rather big 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:04.049
 big but 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.969
 his arm is very cool blade 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.229
 conscience is normal so very expensive 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:15.969
 Russia and I like here means well, 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.840
 what can i say about you 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:21.249
 strong 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:25.950
 Axial general power handle comfortable different 

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:31.709
 grip well here's my hand so uncomfortable 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:35.399
 keep the knife very comfortable lock and a block 

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:38.939
 tight horrible habits people can't 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.939
 open close it 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.570
 only positive emotions 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.570
 besides beautiful steel aus-8 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.880
 I know one can see the district of the streets but I do not do anything 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.729
 made a knife like this 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.360
 here is interesting 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:11.000
 This I did not do where I had time 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.000
 hook only 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.200
 such a thing and daus 8 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:22.020
 Well, now hovering 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.819
 the most interesting thing is that not dragged him 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:32.130
 mean sharper all we need to 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:34.230
 does mean street funeral 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.110
 bones all he after this is no longer 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:41.850
 I don't shave steel 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:47.700
 something i'm glad outwardly understood castle class yes 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:52.350
 the castle is just awesome and one more thing 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:56.760
 which is also not very clear knife 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:04.350
 pretty wide folded here 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:05.840
 but it is not clear that when you hold it here 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.090
 So 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.200
 open well here I don't know how 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.670
 it opens to me uncomfortable I miss 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.269
 fingers it further 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.670
 zaspe is inactive if it is to keep and here in 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:24.769
 this recess fingers deliver it first 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:29.030
 once and there apparently in the east you are not otherwise 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:31.700
 and you need to fully control 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.170
 go here to climb and then because 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:39.920
 this distance is of course very serious 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.340
 Well, in general, that's all great 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.140
 account 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.420
 You'll get a hole in the cheap here 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.660
 under a lanyard 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:54.319
 the clip become 2 should be but me he 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:58.510
 already got only 1 for you here to me 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:07.879
 represented here is such a knife 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:11.200
 nice wide course but i'm pretty 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:17.870
 Still conveniently stupidly stupid 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:22.570
 no awkward yes on steel me not 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:30.700
 requested aus-8 mind or something like that 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:30.700
 what old woman is not very 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.770
 gloss Well, in general, that all starts 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.810
 sight 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:45.900
 well, and how much he used but not 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.740
 knows a couple of months here is erased 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:54.750
 the inscription is for you to be here 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.699
 written qualities before kayfovo no 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.349
 there is nothing backlash but not to be 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:10.919
 can naturally such 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:16.159
 beautiful go. the castle is very serious then 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.159
 so probably all thanks bye
