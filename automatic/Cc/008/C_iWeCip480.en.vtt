00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 Sunday afternoon yesterday but when you get there 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.620
 that is no longer 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.350
 yes he left a note that says he is loved 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.670
 massive I was kiwis three thousand year phase 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:14.980
 unfortunately we are here but that a note of how agile we are 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.009
 instructions that will ask for forest to live with the rest of your life 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:24.289
 there is a school of thought scene although it says that this phenomenon is so 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.119
 overwhelming and that the odds that if this happened by chance area 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.199
 minimum to 0 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.300
 and is that a reasonable human being would be that that is not there by chance and 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.840
 that there had to be a 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.270
 of not being divine you made those codes and that we can only say more 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.480
 that happens 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.920
 just for that reason this is something that was 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.429
 created by a very powerful factor boudou 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.340
 invoice and left because very powerful is what we call 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.930
 palaces 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.070
 I make my life I personally believe 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.530
 at the other end he 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.860
 but it moves away from the people if one follows their will and from wines feed their 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.720
 wisdom to him will help us in the future if I'm sure a person 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.659
 that had lived six thousand years ago the bio would have been allowed to develop 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.930
 thoroughly the bible code I think that that would have to do it manually 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.680
 the award 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.150
 but despite the great accuracy of the code 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.150
 skeptics deny their existence 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.060
 predicted the bible key historical events 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.210
 because the code is essentially just a statistical anomaly 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.150
 we said hello 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.980
 p 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.980
 the great debate 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.550
 although the bible code revealed precisely past sayings 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.670
 some skeptics believe that predictions coded in 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.610
 by extension similar to the virgin 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.280
 many scholars took on the challenge of refloating the bible code 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.280
 trying to scientifically invalidate the evidence of existence 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.029
 I live from the bible 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:10.409
 an exam already classic 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.289
 the movement 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:14.839
 revealed a message of Diana's death in her text 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:20.659
 although the opposition to the existence of the code is based on studies and 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.689
 solid experiments 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:27.680
 they do not explain how some events were predicted there before 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.199
 occur 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:33.109
 the forecast that the big advocates of the penal code as a test of the 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.449
 existence of the code 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:37.819
 was discovered by distinguished researchers 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:38.840
 music 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.629
 there are no quotas 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.629
 that was the assassination of the Israeli prime minister 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.719
 a murderer 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.419
 murder 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:54.010
 that's why there have been cases where some future events are 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.619
 chuchi were predicted with great prestige success 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:01.070
 time of the most famous case 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.450
 was and is a prediction of the assassination psoe the Israeli Prime Minister ynet 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.200
 racing managed the raids and that's why in May of 2005 there vallejos 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.719
 two 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.969
 this was at the time it happened sabatia isaac rabbi was the first 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.059
 Minister of Israel 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:24.059
 in this case they put the name of God to bugle 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:28.719
 they chose the verse that talks about what will happen to a murder something that 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:30.999
 someone commits a homicide 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:35.659
 in the current edition has run very serious of the stage and they two of 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.759
 they were very alarmed and sent letters to the security people 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:44.079
 the day to the office buenos aires na the prime minister 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:50.299
 resisted and are hopeful that they will be taken in the cause r cautions 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.379
 Additional Sanchez Actions to prevent this from happening 16 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.559
 Cuernavaca 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:00.559
 but it did happen 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.319
 despite the attempt to alert the rabbi about the attack 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.520
 he was murdered 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.520
 995 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:16.189
 but some code advocates debate whether that notice was a 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.859
 alert not just a message from one 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.169
 many possible results 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.570
 you did this is a very basic question 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.680
 well we do not know that if that was a warning 25 only one thing that is 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.080
 necessarily would happen that way to become again was one of the 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.680
 possible variants of the future that are discussed in the Torah 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.069
 a confident distiller of the penal code only that the prediction of the 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.569
 rabbin murder eliminated any doubt about the provisions of the code and 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.559
 launched a public challenge 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.849
 find the forecast of the murder of a prime minister in Nashville 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.409
 the teacher by mmg the one who is the main figure of the opposition to the 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:00.469
 legitimacy of the code 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:03.669
 and has thoroughly researched the subject accepted the challenge 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.919
 I heard that I was made to take the mobile book said and start looking 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.310
 murders since - ministers and other famous people and there are many 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.960
 josé moreno valle for example the one of indira gandhi sky lion trotsky martín 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.499
 martín irigoyen 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:23.469
 the gradualness in 1 806 days can be seen today and the president's assassination 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:24.900
 kennedy 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.210
 two of the vertical letters in the presence of the word kennedy 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.080
 the cost intensive country bankruptcy we eat the words on the roof they say that 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.789
 this murder 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.449
 amazing the green letters that is not like that 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.689
 elena oxchuc but I think it's a phrase that relates concretely 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.300
 these kennedy murder accept 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.710
 are then those of good humor misfortune when it showed photographs of codes 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.380
 predictions and murders and other things the mobile and allow 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:58.369
 the two people who visit the website of the Madridista president as well 

00:05:58.369 --> 00:05:59.180
 what will they do 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.319
 it was also written by god koxkorron his set 

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:07.279
 he came to a conclusion of his investigations 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.939
 juan monzón all that is nonsense 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:14.370
 the treasure managed that you wish to give you a massive response of the debate passes 

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:18.149
 for a huge amount of time are our pride we try muddy and their 

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:22.159
 nth his successor moments and that we have spent so far not 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:25.479
 we have seen that there is some evidence that the codes of the bible have been 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:31.649
 finally reduced year and are favorites of the statistic one with a suture 

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:35.189
 university students running into toxic assets of the bible 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:37.180
 but to the defender 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.669
 I do not say they say the odds that certain canada 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:43.789
 In addition, this matter will also be installed 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.809
 viatri not only the soldiers ignore 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:49.219
 final minutes of statistics 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:53.330
 in a day just a small chance that the works of and 

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:55.449
 a great chance of suffering 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:00.020
 so that does not mean anything the net this is not an experiment it's just a 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.819
 trick 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:03.149
 esteem that only bad vices 

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:06.659
 we have both found so many codes are insurmountable in the aspect 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:10.610
 statistic that we already showed that there is water and that it could not be done in 

00:07:10.609 --> 00:07:11.619
 casual 

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:13.199
 the land 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:16.649
 to everything and I think we got to a point where 

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:21.119
 muse the idea code is real and we did it developing more says it's very 

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:26.209
 advanced with sentences that surpass the chances of chance in 

00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:29.929
 the universe we have done once you do is a year then you have tried the 

00:07:29.929 --> 00:07:32.929
 Bible code and I think we got to that point 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:37.999
 but other experts say that leaving aside the statistical probabilities 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.990
 recognize the validity of the code otherwise eight important codes 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.320
 I do not know if they are right or not if it is not a possibility of their existence 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.559
 Spanish social 

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:54.199
 but I would not say yes x and you think that all code is right and it worked 

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:58.359
 perfection since you can predict facts until then you're a fool this 

00:07:58.359 --> 00:07:58.710
 is it
