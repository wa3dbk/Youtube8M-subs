00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.600
 in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.340
 to reverse is a little action 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.049
 strange for the horse of the horses 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.280
 they are not so used either but 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.480
 well the truth is that in the end if 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.090
 you practice little and do not miss much 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.529
 to do it what you have to do is 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.699
 do as a bit if we were to slow down 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.740
 the horse in another video we have 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.910
 taught and at the same time hit him 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.009
 but not hit what back but 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.020
 hit it a little here in the center and 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.449
 we stretch giving a little bit of bumps that 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.060
 we want you to march not only straight 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:38.410
 but playing a little with the mouth 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.540
 the position that we have to have is to 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.460
 we take the lives to the concrete point 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.810
 and not much strength only that the 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.380
 horse note 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.380
 a little bit of strength 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.750
 As you can see, I 'm not only hitting 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.520
 support the feet 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.610
 and if we do here maybe also what 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.610
 will do 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.730
 d 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.070
 therefore what we are indicating 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.979
 is that we want him to march but 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.680
 a slightly different way I repeat hands 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.250
 here the straight body we hit and play 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.250
 a bit with the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.450
 we do not put any pressure on his mouth 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.450
 we leave you free and 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.770
 hit 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.820
 good and here a little I taught you how to 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.010
 taught the horse to reverse 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.360
 you have to practice having patience 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.710
 with horses especially having a lot 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.080
 patience especially when you educate them 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.760
 if a horse does not have to do something and 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.710
 teaches is wrong in the end you never want it 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.030
 do and then if one day you want 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.330
 correct it you will have to do it very 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.330
 slowly 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.510
 nothing very many thanks for watching this 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:16.010
 video let's hope it 's a 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.010
 you already know how to share it 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.780
 and if more thanks and until the next
