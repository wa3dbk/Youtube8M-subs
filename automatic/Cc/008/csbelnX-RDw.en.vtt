okay<00:00:03.540> here's<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.840> great<00:00:04.140> system<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.890> be<00:00:05.250> able<00:00:05.370> to

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
okay here's a great system to be able to

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.940 
okay here's a great system to be able to
make<00:00:05.580> shots<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.569> if<00:00:07.350> you've<00:00:07.500> been<00:00:07.620> poking

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
make shots and if you've been poking

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.290 
make shots and if you've been poking
around<00:00:07.980> YouTube<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.670> probably<00:00:08.940> see<00:00:09.090> some

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
around YouTube you probably see some

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.749 
around YouTube you probably see some
videos<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:09.929> are<00:00:10.290> referring<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:11.099> Saturday

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
videos that are referring to Saturday

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.629 
videos that are referring to Saturday
edge<00:00:12.000> or<00:00:12.540> 90<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.049> 90<00:00:13.410> well<00:00:14.219> what<00:00:14.400> they're<00:00:14.519> not

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
edge or 90 and 90 well what they're not

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.860 
edge or 90 and 90 well what they're not
really<00:00:14.880> telling<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.330> both<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.630> these

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
really telling is that both of these

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.960 
really telling is that both of these
systems<00:00:16.109> are<00:00:16.500> very<00:00:16.980> close<00:00:17.369> they're<00:00:17.699> pretty

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
systems are very close they're pretty

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.880 
systems are very close they're pretty
much<00:00:18.029> use<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.420> same<00:00:18.600> math<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.260> I'm<00:00:19.770> not

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
much use in the same math but I'm not

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.109 
much use in the same math but I'm not
going<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.160> do<00:00:20.250> any<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> math<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.939> really

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
going to do any of the math you really

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.250 
going to do any of the math you really
don't<00:00:21.270> even<00:00:21.330> know<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.750> all<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.020> need<00:00:22.140> to

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
don't even know that all you need to

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.050 
don't even know that all you need to
know<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.529> how<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.740> perform<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.490> technique<00:00:23.699> of

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
know is how to perform the technique of

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.870 
know is how to perform the technique of
doing<00:00:24.150> these<00:00:24.390> shots<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.099> I<00:00:26.099> know<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.730> it's

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
doing these shots and I know that it's

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.040 
doing these shots and I know that it's
pretty<00:00:27.060> much<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> best<00:00:27.510> way<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.689> do<00:00:27.930> it

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
pretty much the best way to do it

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.599 
pretty much the best way to do it
because<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.380> see<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> lot<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.800> tour<00:00:29.099> pros<00:00:29.369> doing

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
because I see a lot of tour pros doing

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.880 
because I see a lot of tour pros doing
this<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.199> if<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.320> don't<00:00:31.500> believe<00:00:31.650> me<00:00:31.769> just

tournament<00:00:36.300> matches<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.870> you'll<00:00:37.440> notice

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
tournament matches and you'll notice

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.619 
tournament matches and you'll notice
that<00:00:38.010> when<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> pros<00:00:38.579> line<00:00:38.879> up<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> shot

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
that when the pros line up to a shot

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.720 
that when the pros line up to a shot
will<00:00:39.989> always<00:00:40.260> see<00:00:40.410> them<00:00:40.590> queuing<00:00:41.160> up<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.340> one

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
will always see them queuing up to one

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.270 
will always see them queuing up to one
side<00:00:42.090> or<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.450> other<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> cue<00:00:43.170> ball<00:00:43.280> but

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
side or the other of the cue ball but

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.350 
side or the other of the cue ball but
then<00:00:44.399> you'll<00:00:44.550> notice<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.030> your<00:00:45.149> last

then you'll notice that on your last

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.240 
then you'll notice that on your last
stroke<00:00:45.870> they<00:00:46.079> always<00:00:46.320> come<00:00:46.530> right<00:00:46.770> back<00:00:46.920> into

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
stroke they always come right back into

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
stroke they always come right back into
the<00:00:47.370> middle<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.760> cue<00:00:48.000> ball

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the middle of the cue ball

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.209 
the middle of the cue ball
you<00:00:48.600> watch<00:00:48.809> them<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.559> promise<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.190> a

cutting<00:00:59.579> we're<00:00:59.760> pretty<00:00:59.969> straight<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.390> here

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
cutting we're pretty straight in here

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.779 
cutting we're pretty straight in here
but<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.930> will<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.260> for<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.039> five<00:01:02.460> ball<00:01:02.640> would

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
but this will go for the five ball would

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.280 
but this will go for the five ball would
be<00:01:02.940> back<00:01:03.120> here<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.750> here<00:01:03.780> doesn't<00:01:04.170> really

be back here up here doesn't really

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.130 
be back here up here doesn't really
matter<00:01:04.640> all<00:01:05.640> right<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:06.810> I'm<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.049> do

going<00:03:06.740> to<00:03:06.830> give<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.010> that<00:03:07.130> consistency<00:03:07.730> that

going to give you that consistency that

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.040 
going to give you that consistency that
you<00:03:07.940> didn't<00:03:08.150> have<00:03:08.300> if<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.570> didn't<00:03:08.810> know<00:03:08.870> this

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
you didn't have if you didn't know this

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.930 
you didn't have if you didn't know this
knowledge<00:03:09.440> before<00:03:09.800> all<00:03:10.730> right

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
knowledge before all right

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.260 
knowledge before all right
so<00:03:11.570> for<00:03:11.900> your<00:03:12.020> steeper<00:03:12.410> cuts<00:03:12.620> like<00:03:12.830> this<00:03:13.270> I'm

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
so for your steeper cuts like this I'm

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.730 
so for your steeper cuts like this I'm
now<00:03:14.630> going<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.930> hit<00:03:15.080> I'm<00:03:15.290> always<00:03:15.470> going<00:03:15.680> to

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
now going to hit I'm always going to

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.110 
now going to hit I'm always going to
start<00:03:15.890> off<00:03:16.010> on<00:03:16.190> my<00:03:16.250> right<00:03:16.430> edge<00:03:16.640> of<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.820> queue

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
start off on my right edge of the queue

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.360 
start off on my right edge of the queue
because<00:03:17.450> I'm<00:03:17.690> cutting<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.230> right<00:03:18.410> iris

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
because I'm cutting to the right iris

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.520 
because I'm cutting to the right iris
set<00:03:19.520> over<00:03:19.730> here<00:03:19.970> might<00:03:20.810> be<00:03:20.840> starting<00:03:21.260> off<00:03:21.380> on

the left edge be careful all right the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.070 
the left edge be careful all right the
only<00:03:24.020> difference<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.590> for<00:03:24.620> your<00:03:24.830> steeper<00:03:25.250> cuts

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
only difference is for your steeper cuts

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.150 
only difference is for your steeper cuts
I'm<00:03:27.080> going<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.320> start<00:03:27.470> off<00:03:27.560> on<00:03:27.740> the<00:03:27.800> so<00:03:28.010> he's

I'm going to start off on the so he's

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.230 
I'm going to start off on the so he's
the<00:03:28.250> same<00:03:28.400> side<00:03:28.640> of<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.730> queue<00:03:28.970> but<00:03:29.120> not

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
of going on edge to edge here

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.930 
of going on edge to edge here
don't<00:03:33.980> lean<00:03:34.130> this<00:03:34.280> straight<00:03:34.520> on<00:03:34.640> as<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.820> can

don't lean this straight on as you can

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.900 
don't lean this straight on as you can
see<00:03:35.180> instead<00:03:36.080> of<00:03:36.140> going<00:03:36.440> edge<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.920> edge<00:03:37.100> I'm

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
see instead of going edge to edge I'm

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.870 
see instead of going edge to edge I'm
now<00:03:38.180> going<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.450> be<00:03:38.540> going<00:03:38.890> right<00:03:39.890> edge<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.580> cue

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
now going to be going right edge the cue

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.530 
now going to be going right edge the cue
to<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.870> middle<00:03:42.380> of<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.730> two<00:03:43.910> ball<00:03:44.120> see<00:03:44.720> that

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
to the middle of the two ball see that

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.880 
to the middle of the two ball see that
so<00:03:47.540> I've<00:03:47.660> met<00:03:47.900> technique<00:03:48.380> now<00:03:48.560> it's<00:03:48.710> going<00:03:48.830> to

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890
