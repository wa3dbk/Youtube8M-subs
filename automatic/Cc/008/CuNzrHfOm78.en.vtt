review and today we're doing a man
called<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.879> super<00:00:06.120> flat<00:00:06.629> options<00:00:07.259> now<00:00:07.830> this

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
called the super flat options now this

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.520 
called the super flat options now this
does<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.670> when<00:00:09.389> you're<00:00:09.540> making<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.929> world<00:00:10.170> and

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
does is when you're making the world and

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.379 
does is when you're making the world and
you<00:00:10.920> want<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.160> make<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.280> super<00:00:11.670> flat<00:00:11.880> world<00:00:12.090> it

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
you want to make a super flat world it

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.749 
you want to make a super flat world it
adds<00:00:12.900> another<00:00:13.259> button<00:00:13.620> down<00:00:13.830> here<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.549> adds

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
adds another button down here that adds

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.150 
adds another button down here that adds
more<00:00:15.120> options<00:00:15.660> now<00:00:16.379> as<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.920> can<00:00:17.010> see<00:00:17.070> right

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
more options now as you can see right

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.870 
more options now as you can see right
now<00:00:17.369> there's<00:00:18.270> bedrock<00:00:18.810> goes<00:00:19.140> from<00:00:19.289> 0<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.650> 0<00:00:19.880> but

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
now there's bedrock goes from 0 to 0 but

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.759 
now there's bedrock goes from 0 to 0 but
we<00:00:21.090> can<00:00:21.210> actually<00:00:21.510> add<00:00:21.660> layers<00:00:22.109> onto<00:00:22.560> our

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
we can actually add layers onto our

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.089 
we can actually add layers onto our
super<00:00:23.010> super<00:00:23.580> flat<00:00:23.789> world<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.390> customize<00:00:24.930> them

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
super super flat world to customize them

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.980 
super super flat world to customize them
so<00:00:26.099> let's<00:00:26.340> do<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.970> don't<00:00:27.210> know<00:00:27.300> um<00:00:27.830> let's<00:00:28.830> do

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
so let's do I don't know um let's do

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.049 
so let's do I don't know um let's do
what'm<00:00:30.990> planks<00:00:31.439> are<00:00:31.590> 5<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.340> let's<00:00:32.640> do<00:00:32.880> that

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
what'm planks are 5 and let's do that

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.639 
what'm planks are 5 and let's do that
from<00:00:33.420> let's<00:00:33.630> say<00:00:33.870> layer<00:00:34.290> 1<00:00:34.649> layer<00:00:35.120> 10<00:00:36.649> save

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
from let's say layer 1 layer 10 save

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.979 
from let's say layer 1 layer 10 save
block<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.309> then<00:00:38.879> let's<00:00:39.120> add<00:00:39.300> another<00:00:39.329> layer

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
block and then let's add another layer

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.900 
block and then let's add another layer
and<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.309> white<00:00:41.940> wall<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.329> 35<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.910> enter

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and on a white wall is 35 and enter

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.319 
and on a white wall is 35 and enter
bottom<00:00:45.239> layer<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.140> 11<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.149> 11<00:00:49.370> c<00:00:50.370> block<00:00:50.550> you're

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
bottom layer so 11 and 11 c block you're

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.930 
bottom layer so 11 and 11 c block you're
going<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.539> accept<00:00:52.160> then<00:00:53.160> you're<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.879> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
going to accept then you're going to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.040 
going to accept then you're going to
create<00:00:54.660> world<00:00:56.300> and<00:00:57.300> once<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.570> generates<00:00:57.899> your

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
create world and once it generates your

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.770 
create world and once it generates your
world<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.620> go<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:59.520> are<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.000> super<00:01:00.539> flat

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
world here we go we are in a super flat

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.469 
world here we go we are in a super flat
world<00:01:02.090> that<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.239> actually<00:01:03.979> like<00:01:05.210> custom<00:01:06.210> built

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
world that is actually like custom built

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.330 
world that is actually like custom built
you<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.290> wool<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.770> top<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.220> then

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
you can see we have wool on top and then

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.800 
you can see we have wool on top and then
planks<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.560> then<00:01:10.560> bedrock<00:01:11.600> there<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:12.659> go

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
planks and then bedrock there we go

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.990 
planks and then bedrock there we go
there's<00:01:12.990> two<00:01:13.140> void<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.400> mean<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.970> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
there's two void so I mean this is a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.760 
there's two void so I mean this is a
really<00:01:15.570> cool<00:01:15.750> mod<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.259> should<00:01:16.409> really<00:01:16.560> check

doing<00:01:22.439> redstone<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.070> super<00:01:23.520> flat<00:01:23.729> worlds

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
doing redstone on super flat worlds

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.060 
doing redstone on super flat worlds
because<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.930> know<00:01:24.990> when<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.350> read<00:01:25.619> some<00:01:25.799> super

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
because I know when I do read some super

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.230 
because I know when I do read some super
flat<00:01:26.250> world<00:01:26.430> sometimes<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.970> want<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.180> go

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
flat world sometimes I want to go

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.690 
flat world sometimes I want to go
underground<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:29.100> there's<00:01:29.430> only<00:01:29.549> like

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
underground and like there's only like

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.359 
underground and like there's only like
three<00:01:29.970> layers<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.930> normal<00:01:31.200> superflat<00:01:31.950> worlds

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
three layers in normal superflat worlds

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.819 
three layers in normal superflat worlds
so<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.479> build<00:01:33.750> my<00:01:33.900> own<00:01:33.930> layers<00:01:34.439> in

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
so I have to build my own layers in

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.550 
so I have to build my own layers in
order<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.310> go<00:01:35.520> underground<00:01:36.140> this<00:01:37.140> way<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.409> can

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
order to go underground this way you can

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.859 
order to go underground this way you can
pretty<00:01:37.799> much<00:01:37.860> customize<00:01:38.579> your<00:01:38.850> world<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
pretty much customize your world so it

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.719 
pretty much customize your world so it
fits<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.350> also<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:41.159> you're<00:01:41.280> doing<00:01:41.520> big

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
fits you and also if you're doing big

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.910 
fits you and also if you're doing big
buildings<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.450> for<00:01:43.049> example<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.740> you

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
buildings and for example like this you

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.440 
buildings and for example like this you
want<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.159> white<00:01:44.369> background<00:01:44.729> instead<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.390> all

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
want a white background instead of all

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.660 
want a white background instead of all
grass<00:01:45.840> well<00:01:46.680> then<00:01:46.799> there<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.040> go<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.399> set

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
grass well then there you go you can set

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.819 
grass well then there you go you can set
everything<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.060> wool<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.649> just

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
everything to wool and this is just

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.830 
everything to wool and this is just
really<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.490> know<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.850> think<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.270> really<00:01:51.509> cool

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
really I know I think it's a really cool

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.770 
really I know I think it's a really cool
