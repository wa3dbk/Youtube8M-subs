are using a base coat make sure that it
dries<00:01:17.270> 100%<00:01:18.270> before<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.110> move<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.710> the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
thin it will look like a lollipop and

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.250 
thin it will look like a lollipop and
you<00:02:38.610> don't<00:02:38.760> want<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:39.990> just<00:02:40.080> kind

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
you don't want that so you can just kind

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.780 
you don't want that so you can just kind
of<00:02:40.320> go<00:02:40.410> back<00:02:40.560> in<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:41.100> thicken<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.460> up<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.670> little

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
of go back in and thicken it up a little

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.940 
of go back in and thicken it up a little
bit<00:02:41.970> mainly<00:02:42.390> towards<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.900> end<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.620> string

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
bit mainly towards the end of the string

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.500 
bit mainly towards the end of the string
so<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.490> looks<00:02:44.640> more<00:02:44.880> like<00:02:45.030> it's<00:02:45.150> dripping<00:02:45.480> down
