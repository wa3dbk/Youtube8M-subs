00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 how about faith nicolÃ¡s peaceman de supra 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.189
 pixel and today we are going to do the analysis of 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.150
 the sennheiser momentum or bare jr 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.530
 I take advantage and give them around 10 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.210
 seconds to see how they are 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.910
 put in the head notice that they are not 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.650
 gigantic are quite normal 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.720
 size are not even very giants with any 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.789
 little if they go totally on the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.189
 ear so let's see a little more 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.810
 up close here we have the sennheiser more 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.910
 up close where we see that we have 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.599
 premium materials and a very design 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.460
 Care is all very well designed in 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.120
 the sense that it's all very attractive to me 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.980
 they loved 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.260
 I loved the design we have metal leather 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.079
 Well made seams no burrs 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.420
 Crazy things that come out are cut 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.800
 all very nice and very well done so 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.210
 I said this the design that after 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.770
 show a little more in detail let's 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.390
 to see what we have in the box where we 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.620
 let's find with a cable 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.120
 directly to connect it to 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.949
 smartphone or whatever it is saying 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.230
 only the cable with nothing and then 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.059
 we also have the 4- pole cable with 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.920
 the free manual is that here I was 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.329
 approach it a little bit we are 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.219
 with the camera we will see that we have the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.480
 middle button to stop a song or 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.040
 resume laws then to change the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.360
 volume on android at least in the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.980
 devices that I tried 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.990
 the volume control does not work such 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.820
 time in iphones yes but the stop and 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.260
 follow song if after the other side 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.760
 we have the little hole that is the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.910
 microphone so if we connect it 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.040
 we will be able to receive and speak for 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.680
 phone when we receive a call and 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.990
 after we have here a connector that 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.030
 It is not the 35 mm plus 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.920
 small and less I was 2 as something 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.900
 I do not remember exactly size this 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.550
 it's good because if they had to 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.630
 replace later later this 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.729
 it's going to be a problem because you have to 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.880
 get a connector to others less 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.430
 known but what we have occupied is 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.380
 that this enters here in state but a 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.470
 once you click there is 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.240
 we turn if for one side and we can not 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.009
 take out is to say for more that we throw not what 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.930
 we will be able to remove it because it is there 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.600
 work we have to pull towards the other 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.310
 side to get it out and then good 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.560
 is of the other connector that this one follows 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.700
 3.5 mm standard for smartphones 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.009
 tablets or whatever they feel like 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.930
 player 93 and tacos said this of the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.910
 cables let's see now if a little bit 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.860
 more closely this with the cups by 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.479
 luck can move freely is 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.289
 say they are going to have a fit on their head 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.959
 very 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.790
 very appropriate they will not stay rigid 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.200
 we can of course move the ones above 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.359
 down so we have the head of 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.340
 jalkh we can pull everything down and 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.409
 we have headphones 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.689
 for giant heads let's throw 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:27.450
 a little bit more up we see that the 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:29.159
 cable is here floating so eyes 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.019
 they do not have heavy pollution to cut and 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.060
 were they have to get to solder the 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.459
 channel quilombo and he likes and well we have 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.950
 here glasses very very nice but not without 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.659
 design but what an eye after a session 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.819
 long listening music at least 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.459
 of an hour and a half hour up 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.670
 to begin to realize they squeeze 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.530
 a little hard on the ears and can 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.139
 be that your ears hurt 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.669
 hurt a lot not a little bit that's not 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.980
 good still is a nice fit and 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:58.319
 Ergonomically they are well designed they are 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.090
 a little hard the cups for the ears 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.049
 at least in my case and in another 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.909
 person more than I was testing 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.040
 also so that it was not only my 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.810
 head my skull we had the same 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.909
 problem so I figure it's going to be 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.230
 something more or less generalized above that 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.519
 yes it can get to bother a little 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.290
 also on top of the 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.150
 head is not very fluffy could have 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.829
 been a little bit softer 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.819
 It can also bother after 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.829
 for a time this is always 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.510
 considering more or less an hour to 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.010
 up we are talking about short time 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.319
 for example a short collective trip 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.610
 not to hold it drama there, it is not a 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.140
 problem because it's not that it's going to hurt 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.819
 in the first five minutes I do not know 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.290
 worry let's talk then about the 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.930
 sound quality because if they listen to us 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.180
 well so we want them very very very good 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.319
 important what I'm going to tell you 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.189
 they listen very well 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.709
 yes very well but they are hard to say 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:47.379
 we need power to be able 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.819
 move them accordingly 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.379
 corresponds means so that you can 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.409
 listen at its maximum potential not 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.120
 potential volume is to say if we are going to 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.769
 use them all the time with our 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.230
 smartphone what will happen is that it 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:02.109
 they will listen well but for example the 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.959
 bass response is going to notice how 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.760
 it lacks a little power this 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.469
 it's because I told you again that they are 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.019
 hard are still in the specifications 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:13.269
 they say they are quite sensitive to me 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.849
 they are hard when I always heard them with 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.789
 my amplifier belt here in my house 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.930
 they listened perfect and you listen very 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.699
 very well we are talking about what is 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.030
 quality of a headphone sound 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:27.310
 high-end wifi is calculus that is 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.229
 very similar if I'm not mistaken the 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.090
 original moments really 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.599
 they listen very very well with a level of 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.550
 very appreciable detail a definition in 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.020
 what is mid frequencies which is what 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.990
 more important just everything that is 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.280
 sound and music very very good a sound 6 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.500
 Excellent 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.760
 it's a little bit more of the sweeter sound and 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.310
 this is more American is a little bit 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.660
 Apenitas more strident but really 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.639
 again the sound quality is 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.710
 remarkable only that they have in 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.360
 account are hard and we will see 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.520
 only with smartphones know that no 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.070
 they are going to take out their maximum potential and this 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.139
 do not trust is independent of 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.180
 volume to which they put them if they can be 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.070
 lie a bit raising the volume but 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.440
 they will not achieve what I tell them is 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.910
 putting then with a synthesizer applicator if 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.919
 they are from those successive people by the 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.450
 mobile audio can buy your mini 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.250
 amplifier cited and with this they will be 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.350
 alright so I said all this about the subject 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.060
 of oromia calz on the head sound and 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.160
 designs of these things we're going to talk about 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.330
 the conclusions as a conclusion are 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.820
 a very good headphones good 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.530
 designed very solid cute because 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.169
 they really are very attractive apart 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.880
 several color options with a very 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.160
 good sound quality if I am a 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.060
 bit hard as I told you but 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.620
 the only one is really good 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.630
 topic to consider is the theme of the 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.860
 portability be consider that they can 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.110
 buy the biggest ones or these that are 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.880
 more compact to go on the street and the subject 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.080
 of the price are quite expensive but good 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.520
 consider that we have materials 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.740
 premium and also sound quality 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.419
 quite 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.919
 So now you tell me touch them 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.360
 down in the comments that they thought if 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.069
 they would buy them or not or if they already 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.590
 they have or if they prefer the bigger ones and 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.590
 why and see you in upcoming videos 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.440
 you know why did not come nicolÃ¡s 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:12.370
 miley you did not subscribe 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.370
 If only one is wrong, we are all wrong
