 this topic we put the biggest and 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.190
 we play in the following way below 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.590
 we make this plas type sound that 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.440
 consists of covering all the strings and 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.120
 play them making this sound type plas 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.590
 down plas 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:40.970
 we touch up I repeat down back 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.650
 up now we remove the middle finger and 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.440
 the ring finger and we played the fifth and 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.740
 fourth rope 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.720
 and once we play we put the fingers 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.190
 doing a hammer 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.190
 I repeat everything we wear 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:06.090
 now we make a plan again and we play 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:06.090
 up and we repeat 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.260
 Y 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.040
 all right 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.610
 it's a very simple rhythm that also 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.610
 repeated in a 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.209
 i 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.400
 in the case in which only the 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.790
 index finger and the hammer is done with the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.790
 index finger 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.170
 we change the king would be the same rhythm and 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.709
 with the index finger we remove it and we do 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.709
 the hammer 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.610
 Y 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.660
 all right 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.660
 I repeat in slow motion 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.120
 Y 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.390

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.400
