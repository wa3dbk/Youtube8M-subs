00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.290 
can also use this scrub I think as I
think<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.190> spot<00:02:18.520> treatment<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:19.060> if<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.210> have

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
think a spot treatment so if you have

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.240 
think a spot treatment so if you have
just<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.600> one<00:02:19.780> random<00:02:20.230> pimple

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
just a one random pimple

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.880 
just a one random pimple
I<00:02:21.280> would<00:02:21.700> scrub<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.090> with<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.690> then<00:02:23.140> you

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
I would scrub it with that and then you

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:24.990 
I would scrub it with that and then you
don't<00:02:24.040> have<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.250> use<00:02:24.340> it<00:02:24.460> on<00:02:24.520> your<00:02:24.670> whole<00:02:24.790> face

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
don't have to use it on your whole face
