goals Montreal scored and based on that

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.250 
goals Montreal scored and based on that
assessment<00:02:28.510> how<00:02:28.599> does<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:28.810> affect<00:02:29.140> your

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
assessment how does that affect your

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.960

for<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.360> next<00:02:31.569> two<00:02:31.660> games<00:02:31.750> haven't<00:02:32.050> really

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
for the next two games haven't really

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.350 
for the next two games haven't really
thought<00:02:33.700> about<00:02:33.760> who's<00:02:34.150> playing<00:02:34.450> monday<00:02:34.720> yet

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.720 
thought about who's playing monday yet
but<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.390> mean<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:38.290> was<00:02:38.530> more<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:39.069> deflating

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
but I mean it was more of a deflating

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.940 
but I mean it was more of a deflating
thing<00:02:40.000> on<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.270> on<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.690> bench<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.890> I

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
thing on that on the bench that I

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.130 
thing on that on the bench that I
thought<00:02:42.250> we<00:02:42.400> needed<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.849> change<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.870> first

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
thought we needed to change the first

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.960 
thought we needed to change the first
one<00:02:44.290> was<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.500> knuckleball<00:02:45.099> and<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.580> was<00:02:45.700> really

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
one was a knuckleball and it was really

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.559 
one was a knuckleball and it was really
it<00:02:46.930> was<00:02:46.959> for<00:02:47.530> your<00:02:47.620> first<00:02:47.890> shot<00:02:48.069> on<00:02:48.280> goal<00:02:48.880> it

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
it was for your first shot on goal it

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.690 
it was for your first shot on goal it
was<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.750> tough<00:02:50.050> one<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.500> thought<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.980> mean<00:02:51.550> we

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
was a tough one and I thought I mean we

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.400 
was a tough one and I thought I mean we
made<00:02:51.880> such<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.150> bad<00:02:52.390> play<00:02:52.660> in<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.870> second<00:02:53.290> one

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
made such a bad play in the second one

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.410 
made such a bad play in the second one
Coast<00:02:53.620> itson<00:02:53.980> is<00:02:54.130> in<00:02:54.280> between<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.790> circles

with a wrist shot I mean so I don't know
in<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.930> real<00:02:58.959> world<00:02:59.380> of<00:02:59.620> feel<00:02:59.890> had<00:03:00.130> much

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
in the real world of feel had much

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.460 
in the real world of feel had much
chance<00:03:00.970> on<00:03:01.270> either<00:03:01.599> one<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:01.989> them<00:03:02.170> but<00:03:02.349> I<00:03:02.380> do

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
chance on either one of them but I do

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.800 
chance on either one of them but I do
know<00:03:02.860> that<00:03:03.099> we<00:03:03.670> had<00:03:03.760> expended<00:03:04.180> an<00:03:04.390> awful<00:03:04.720> lot

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
know that we had expended an awful lot

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.990 
know that we had expended an awful lot
of<00:03:04.870> energy<00:03:05.110> in<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.530> first<00:03:05.800> eight<00:03:06.400> minutes<00:03:06.700> of

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
of energy in the first eight minutes of

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.120 
of energy in the first eight minutes of
the<00:03:07.090> game<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.510> we<00:03:07.599> were<00:03:07.690> down<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:08.170> nothing<00:03:08.590> so

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
the game and we were down to nothing so

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.179 
the game and we were down to nothing so
I<00:03:09.160> thought<00:03:09.520> that<00:03:09.909> might<00:03:10.120> be<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.569> lift<00:03:11.560> from<00:03:12.010> the

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
I thought that might be a lift from the

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.530 
I thought that might be a lift from the
crowd<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.730> be<00:03:13.420> lift<00:03:13.780> on<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.079> bench

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
crowd and be lift on the bench

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.649 
crowd and be lift on the bench
and<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:16.700> know<00:03:16.819> I<00:03:16.849> don't<00:03:16.939> know<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.239> work<00:03:17.450> door

and you know I don't know the work door

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.599 
and you know I don't know the work door
if<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.870> didn't<00:03:18.140> work<00:03:18.290> but<00:03:18.500> we<00:03:19.370> ended<00:03:19.459> up

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
if it didn't work but we ended up

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.959 
if it didn't work but we ended up
winning<00:03:19.790> Bruce<00:03:20.750> what<00:03:21.709> affected<00:03:22.250> Tom<00:03:22.700> Poti

when he took on golf Gomez I thought it

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.280

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.099 
was great first time I seen Tom in a
fight<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:31.069> I<00:03:31.790> think<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.180> players<00:03:32.599> rallied

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
fight and I think the players rallied

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.630 
fight and I think the players rallied
around<00:03:33.230> it<00:03:33.590> everybody<00:03:33.980> patted<00:03:34.430> him<00:03:34.549> on<00:03:34.579> the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
around it everybody patted him on the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.580 
around it everybody patted him on the
back<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:34.909> we<00:03:35.780> don't<00:03:35.870> have<00:03:36.019> a<00:03:36.109> lot<00:03:36.140> of<00:03:36.319> fights

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
back and we don't have a lot of fights

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.210 
back and we don't have a lot of fights
anyway<00:03:36.980> but<00:03:38.140> it<00:03:39.140> did<00:03:39.560> build<00:03:39.769> us<00:03:39.980> something

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
anyway but it did build us something

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.629 
anyway but it did build us something
about<00:03:40.459> how<00:03:40.609> much<00:03:40.939> you<00:03:41.120> wanted<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.450> win<00:03:41.659> and<00:03:42.639> and

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
about how much you wanted to win and and

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.119 
about how much you wanted to win and and
and<00:03:44.329> I<00:03:44.599> thought<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:45.230> you<00:03:45.469> know<00:03:45.680> after<00:03:45.859> that

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
and I thought that you know after that

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.030 
and I thought that you know after that
you<00:03:46.879> know<00:03:46.909> even<00:03:47.120> though<00:03:47.299> our<00:03:47.329> power<00:03:47.629> play<00:03:47.930> is

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
you know even though our power play is

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.099 
you know even though our power play is
struggling<00:03:49.040> beyond<00:03:49.639> struggling<00:03:50.180> that<00:03:50.359> that

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
struggling beyond struggling that that

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:56.199 
struggling beyond struggling that that
it<00:03:51.980> gave<00:03:52.220> us<00:03:52.400> life<00:03:53.169> or<00:03:54.169> more<00:03:54.409> life<00:03:54.730> Bruce<00:03:55.730> Mike

front of a net tonight it was more
congestion<00:05:28.580> you<00:05:29.090> know<00:05:29.240> and<00:05:29.419> I<00:05:29.509> mean<00:05:29.659> it's<00:05:29.870> it's

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
congestion you know and I mean it's it's

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.320 
congestion you know and I mean it's it's
something<00:05:30.740> that<00:05:30.860> both<00:05:30.979> teams<00:05:31.250> are<00:05:31.520> working<00:05:31.969> at

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
something that both teams are working at

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.110 
something that both teams are working at
and<00:05:32.509> I<00:05:32.690> think<00:05:32.930> all<00:05:33.680> 16<00:05:34.490> teams<00:05:34.699> in<00:05:34.879> the<00:05:34.940> playoffs

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
and I think all 16 teams in the playoffs

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.600 
and I think all 16 teams in the playoffs
all<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:36.020> coaches<00:05:36.169> are<00:05:36.500> saying<00:05:36.740> go<00:05:37.219> to<00:05:37.280> the<00:05:37.460> net

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
all the coaches are saying go to the net

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.760 
all the coaches are saying go to the net
create<00:05:37.969> traffic<00:05:38.300> and<00:05:38.719> and<00:05:38.870> I<00:05:39.379> think<00:05:39.620> you've

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
create traffic and and I think you've

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.320 
create traffic and and I think you've
seen<00:05:40.009> in<00:05:40.340> the<00:05:40.370> playoffs<00:05:40.789> so<00:05:40.969> far<00:05:41.000> an

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
seen in the playoffs so far an

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.080 
seen in the playoffs so far an
inordinate<00:05:41.719> amount<00:05:41.889> of<00:05:42.889> high-scoring<00:05:43.789> games

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
inordinate amount of high-scoring games

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.230 
inordinate amount of high-scoring games
and<00:05:44.419> I<00:05:45.110> think<00:05:45.319> it's<00:05:45.469> because<00:05:45.849> every<00:05:46.849> team<00:05:47.060> is

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
and I think it's because every team is

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.730 
and I think it's because every team is
going<00:05:47.449> to<00:05:47.539> the<00:05:47.750> net<00:05:47.930> with<00:05:48.139> reckless<00:05:48.409> abandon

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
going to the net with reckless abandon

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.209 
going to the net with reckless abandon
type<00:05:49.400> thing<00:05:49.699> and<00:05:49.729> and<00:05:50.740> in<00:05:51.740> getting<00:05:52.039> loose

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:52.219

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:55.279 
pucks Bruce the second third and fourth

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:57.580 
pucks Bruce the second third and fourth
