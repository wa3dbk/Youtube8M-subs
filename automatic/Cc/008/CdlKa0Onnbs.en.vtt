 that is, no artist is 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.440
 excluded that everyone comes 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.840
 speak to Ivorians who all 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.460
 the artesians to talk about the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.140
 conciliation that there is no 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.530
 of artists rhdp apice lmp we do not 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.859
 are more campaigning it's 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.239
 ended the elections are over there are 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.250
 a president who was elected 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.590
 we have to do everything today during 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.240
 in any case the next five years 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.680
 everything must be done so that the coast 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.229
 of ivory regains its instability 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.860
 then and that the Ivorians could 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.510
 put to work 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.380
 so here we have 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.689
 the rendering to the president that in any case 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.130
 we will try to contact all 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:33.000
 the artists would not be 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.890
 concerts or tours of support to 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.380
 one camp or the other or another when 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.679
 it's not support advice 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.710
 to a particular person and social 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.630
 concert to tell the Ivorians that he 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.420
 it's time to get to work 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.950
 it's time to talk to each other 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.880
 time that the Ivory Coast in any case 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.530
 of come here this country that all the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.610
 world liked it so that's a little bit 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.229
 of why we are not being 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.209
 president as an artist do you have 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.119
 projects to support the business of 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:06.030
 reconciliation actually we have 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.170
 projects but I think me 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.750
 personally I do not want to be 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.000
 front of this project I think this 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.890
 together with the artists it's 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.519
 together we could put a project 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.519
 in place try to do a tour 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.010
 who will leave the yams colo who will do the 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:27.540
 tour of the country and who will take his 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.569
 apotheosis abidjan with some 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:35.830
 footballers who just dreamed pass 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:38.650
 messages but also with 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.240
 here I think those who are with 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.340
 me for two meetings and also 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.630
 with party representatives 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.720
 policies in the cities where we 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.090
 are going to pass who would come to pass 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.340
 messages about reconciliation that's 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.530
 very important it is absolutely necessary that the 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.690
 ivory coast and wines absolutely 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.730
 we all have interest that the coast 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.370
 ivory rises today we did well 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.100
 given the difference between the Ivory Coast 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.570
 sick and the one we knew before 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.700
 she does not get sick 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.800
 so we absolutely have to find it 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.480
 this Ivory Coast that was not 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.320
 sick and I think we have the 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.360
 solution 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.240
 the solution is in the unit it is 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.830
 in justice the solution its in the 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.560
 truth we need to tell the truth 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.770
 also and there have been a lot of 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.420
 manipulations it is imperative that the 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.840
 Ivorians on the finds that they are 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.810
 talk 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.340
 if they tell the truth and I think he 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.250
 there is no reason that this country does not stick 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.830
 not we have everything to take off the 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.170
 ivory coast everything to be a country 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.250
 standing up and so we have to stop 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.240
 upside down 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.580
 from the cd 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.580
 I want to say art and samaa and art 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.660
 unnecessarily so that when you go 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.080
 in countries today like the 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.140
 burkina the burkina where the mali that 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.870
 less economic potential we 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.190
 find that you will find that 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.590
 beginnings the past ten years these are 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.590
 countries that have developed and curan
