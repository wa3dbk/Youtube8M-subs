that you hadn't heard you've done it so

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.690 
that you hadn't heard you've done it so
you<00:02:20.540> can<00:02:21.320> just<00:02:21.470> unscrew<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.160> from<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:25.280> adapter

you can just unscrew it from the adapter

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:47.610 
you can just unscrew it from the adapter

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
of the way so you can see how it's

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.140 
of the way so you can see how it's
locked<00:03:04.510> in<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:06.489> just<00:03:06.670> straight<00:03:07.060> into<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:08.380> PCIe
