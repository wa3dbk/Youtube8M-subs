00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
actually wanted to try and get himself a

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.059 
actually wanted to try and get himself a
double<00:03:48.510> DNA<00:03:48.989> bomb<00:03:49.200> but<00:03:49.380> he<00:03:49.500> ends<00:03:49.739> up<00:03:49.799> failing

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
double DNA bomb but he ends up failing

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.280 
double DNA bomb but he ends up failing
on<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.549> little<00:03:50.790> bit<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.299> unfortunately<00:03:52.200> he

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
on that a little bit so unfortunately he

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.840

does<00:03:52.440> not<00:03:52.590> get<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.859> double<00:03:53.010> DNA<00:03:53.370> bomb<00:03:53.579> but<00:03:53.760> he

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
does not get the double DNA bomb but he

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.580 
does not get the double DNA bomb but he
does<00:03:54.090> actually<00:03:54.329> get<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.690> ton<00:03:55.019> of<00:03:55.049> kills<00:03:55.380> in<00:03:55.500> his

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
pick up a few more kills here I was fast

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.699 
pick up a few more kills here I was fast
forward<00:04:00.870> here<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.109> is<00:04:01.230> where<00:04:01.349> he<00:04:01.500> actually

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
forward here this is where he actually

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.410 
forward here this is where he actually
starts<00:04:02.459> getting<00:04:02.670> close<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.209> you'll<00:04:03.329> be

seeing<00:04:03.660> he's<00:04:03.840> actually<00:04:04.019> gonna<00:04:04.230> be<00:04:04.410> going<00:04:04.440> on<00:04:04.859> I

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
seeing he's actually gonna be going on I

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.620 
seeing he's actually gonna be going on I
believe<00:04:05.220> another<00:04:05.459> 20<00:04:05.940> kill<00:04:06.150> streak<00:04:06.420> right

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630

there<00:04:06.780> he<00:04:06.840> gets<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.079> 20<00:04:07.319> kill<00:04:07.500> streak<00:04:07.680> marker

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
there he gets the 20 kill streak marker

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.589 
there he gets the 20 kill streak marker
but<00:04:08.370> he<00:04:08.430> ends<00:04:08.609> up<00:04:08.670> dying<00:04:08.880> because<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.540> know

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
but he ends up dying because you know

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.300 
but he ends up dying because you know
the<00:04:09.720> guns<00:04:09.870> not<00:04:10.019> that<00:04:10.169> good<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.620> he<00:04:10.980> had<00:04:11.099> stuff
