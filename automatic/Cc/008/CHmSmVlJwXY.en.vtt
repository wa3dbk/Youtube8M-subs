00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.490
 today we are going to prepare a delicious Monaco 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.890
 with another putin or next you 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.800
 I share the ingredients you are going to 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.320
 need grated coconut 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.359
 chocolate sprinkles this is optional 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.689
 but it seems to me that it gives a very 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.640
 delicious to the chinese rag espresso coffee 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.160
 I am particularly using the most 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.960
 dark of the coffee but you can use the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.769
 coffee of your preference the one you have 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.400
 hand 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:42.980
 coconut circus 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.300
 chocolate syrup whipped cream in my 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.740
 channel you will see a video of how 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.180
 preparing whipped cream is very easy 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.210
 I particularly like to use milk 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.100
 coconut but you can use your milk 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.750
 preference can be cow's milk 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.400
 almond milk the one that you prefer me 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.890
 I use coconut milk because I think that 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.130
 it gives a delicious taste ok on paper 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.110
 aluminum you are going to place the grated coconut and 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.369
 you 're going to take it to the oven no more than 5 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.740
 minutes until you see that it is 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:18.400
 golden ok in the blender you are going to place 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.400
 2 cups of ice 1 cup of milk 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.609
 now it's time for three quarters of 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.609
 espresso cup 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.220
 you are going to add the sparkles of 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.649
 chocolate the amount you want is to 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.479
 your taste and as I said is optional to 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.479
 same as grated coconut 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.450
 now it's time for a third cup 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.280
 of chocolate ciro 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.829
 It is he who is also going to give him the 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.350
 taste and the combination between coffee with 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.829
 chocolate is the moment of the syrup of 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.829
 coconut 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.470
 good and now he is joining all the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.189
 ingredients and it's becoming 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.189
 frappuccino 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.120
 I really drink Chinese fuck 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.730

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.370

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.069
 It has many calories, but it's worth it 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.430
 worth it ok now we are going to add the
