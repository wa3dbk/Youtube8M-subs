00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.890
 those battles of jumps and tucumÃ¡n returned 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.340
 buenos aires - he was a very man 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.940
 controversial a very innovative man who 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.890
 he lived only 27 years 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.520
 clear died in exile died in chile 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.130
 in 1824 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.750
 had been exiled was the first 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.840
 exiled intellectual who had the 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.840
 Argentina 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.950
 of care for your ideas 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.960
 and advanced will be those advanced ideas 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.240
 we know that he worked all his life in the 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.800
 secularization of the teaching of 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.660
 good philosophy that was an aspect 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.100
 urticante of his teachings and others 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.190
 because he joined the schools 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.720
 Castilian new teaching methods 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.530
 the berkeley sensualism 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.010
 in a whole new European philosophy that 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.100
 was ahead of traditional philosophy 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.940
 and ecclesiastical that integrated in the country 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.890
 and that I wanted to have hegemony that has been 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.600
 very questioned why that's how 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.180
 purpose and from that questioning 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.160
 I wanted to ask you there 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.650
 to your guest who is not talking a 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.750
 little of this entity I do if a gustavo 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.530
 I wanted to ask him why they were delayed 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.140
 183 years since death for his for 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.110
 be repatriated in health and there was talk 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.600
 precisely the province because both 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.100
 I imagine I imagine that something must 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.090
 have to see this this being a 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.400
 figure that wants controversy for the time 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.160
 because it is rotating in being repatriated 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.470
 from Chile where he died to here where 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.940
 currently his remains are not a 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.019
 good question has never been easy 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.790
 repatriate the remains that cost 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.700
 very much to get to find them 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.430
 locate these because there were earthquakes 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.019
 in the middle jean-louis recognizes the 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.580
 finul as the first poet of his 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.470
 story of the letters 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.510
 and he recognized them from the beginning of 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.190
 century there is the national school the 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.290
 most important school put them their 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.950
 name there are streets that bear his name 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.010
 here in this place 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.130
 an important sign said but in the 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.770
 2007 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.560
 decided to make a tribute more 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.860
 important was able to bring the remains of 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.160
 lafinur and the museum of the 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.110
 poetry that today is a monument 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.430
 commemorative than in carolina that is 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:50.220
 visited by many tourists is a 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.400
 property of cultural historical value that 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.970
 we are proud of the contents that are 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.910
 radiates and people come to visit 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.590
 with a lot of love because I was 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.870
 he said before starting this note to 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.380
 borges is present and masters in all this 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.150
 place feels clearer because when 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.940
 look at the property it's actually a property 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.190
 in a landscape in a beautiful little canada 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.810
 that you have shown her where she is 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.660
 the reconstruction of the ruins of the 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.670
 Lafinur's birthplace museum 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.490
 the poetry proper that houses 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:27.990
 manuscripts more than a thousand manuscripts 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.150
 books is the tomb that represents a 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.249
 chess according to the poem that borges you 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.159
 wrote to the finesse 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:36.599
 is the labyrinth that a symbol 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:39.089
 borgiano and last year opened 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:41.519
 something more modern and technological too 

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:43.199
 in the same context that is a center of 

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:45.899
 interpretation where the visitor 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.719
 enter a room for 20 minutes and 

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:51.119
 there is a movie where the figure of a 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:53.309
 actor embodies finesse the presence of 

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:56.189
 borges clear was always because 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:58.889
 within the ancestors of Borges the 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:05:00.809
 figure was a most beloved in the one 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.679
 that it was not military that was a thinker that 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:06.479
 he was a poet so marÃ­a kodama that 

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:09.209
 right now it is coming to san 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:12.059
 Luis to offer two lectures this 

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:14.610
 accepted to be the godmother of this place and in 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:16.529
 the let's say cultural map of Maria Kodama 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.989
 Carolina and Russia - occupying a place 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.699
 very very deep and genuine very 

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:23.219
 interesting the story of this poet 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.019
 soldier than in moments where not many 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:27.299
 they were encouraged at least in this part 

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:30.239
 of the world to separate let's say teaching 

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:31.529
 philosophical theology divide that 

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:32.939
 for that moment we are talking 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:35.459
 where we are located in time 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:37.199
 historic it was not easy guys 

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:38.940
 we come back to you when you want 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.050
 We still know the carolina 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.050
 here in san luis
