00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.620
 two more turtles that I wanted 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:10.500
 would you show this fishies and darkhan 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.610
 after all this is modern bebop and 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.780
 Rokstedi probably SchrÃ¶der assistants 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.520
 mutants and 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.560
 they are now paid quite a lot 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.449
 attention and generally not these characters 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.580
 like i love like a new universe 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:46.190
 turtles and old so let's 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:48.840
 open and see this time no 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.960
 procrastination 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.090
 unwind for them dope from here there is on 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.789
 kamik there is no delay in the Russian version 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.309
 called unfortunately saber-tooth it is not 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.439
 so cool in my translated as it could 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.820
 would be a fish so he would not be more visible with 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.930
 mechanical legs because the guy 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.369
 really became a fish without any 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:17.400
 limbs though with arms 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.799
 there are no legs of its original form and legs 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.750
 have already been made by u'm not mistaken 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:29.549
 baxter stockman and thanks to that 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.960
 this mutant was not useless as well 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.960
 insert his weapon into his arm 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.700
 another knife is such a figure also 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.850
 rubberized pretty nice here on 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.300
 the legs of all the figures on the legs are not at all 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.910
 only a turtle many such here 6 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.830
 squares for what they are needed and write 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.840
 in the comments for sure in order to 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.050
 secure the figure in some position 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.390
 put but how is it done where people 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.190
 take all these things for which no 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.110
 attached simply to many of the figures 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.070
 such holes are provided but 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.680
 they do not come with any 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.490
 platforms platforms and now dock pound 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.490
 translated as sharply tooth too 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.140
 also a strange translation is obtained 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.280
 saber tooth and a rhinestone 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:36.920
 although in the original chips riders pawn ok 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:43.520
 we open the biggest figure which 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:54.940
 at the moment here is the wire here 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:54.940
 there are two things 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:06.560
 This character is interesting because he has 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:10.880
 huge anthropomorphic hand huge 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.550
 sizes more than 2 here look to you 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.600
 it's a great idea 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:20.269
 look his hollow legs wonder why 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.940
 so did the first figure in this series 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.870
 with such legs I see 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:29.380
 faces of a very funny month can 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.500
 outweigh completely stupid will 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.660
 look well and your back is a huge hole you 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.560
 You can probably use it as 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:43.400
 piggy bank but you should not do a comet because 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.889
 what's such a great nape I'm not 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.319
 I know how to call it here 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:53.900
 click and doggy dick 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:57.040
 dog tail here and the figure has become 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:03.769
 more beautiful and interesting 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:12.739
 arm hinges spin in different 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:16.280
 directions like this 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:20.180
 always everything is very cool and high quality and 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:26.000
 the tail fell off sooner because i'm his 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:28.669
 without letting me say everything for now while I am more 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.220
 I did not see the new figures, although I did see 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:35.120
 photos already sent me what 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:41.419
 new figures come across in the children's world 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:45.889
 with a crocodile who already forgot his head 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:48.490
 as he is in English called there is 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:52.100
 Baxter Stockman 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.850
 but of these, I probably have to collect everything 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.450
 I will not be a lot of places do not take 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.400
 there will be only some basic ones to collect 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.740
 but I have n't seen at least yet 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:08.360
 I want to see them again in life 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.870
 To decide whether I need it or not 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.250
 guys can already put on the shelf and 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.320
 the collection will be even more complete 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.440
 almost fully assembled first 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.310
 two series of figures on this for today all 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.729
 bye everyone 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.729
 Immediately everything is screwed up, how can I take it off 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.840
 I spilled everything
