opportunity that's first copy two
biggest<00:00:30.170> editing<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.230> combination<00:00:31.740> or<00:00:31.859> go

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
biggest editing the combination or go

have<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.669> notified<00:00:32.940> together<00:00:33.739> I<00:00:35.390> think<00:00:36.390> it

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
have you notified together I think it

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.360 
have you notified together I think it
should<00:00:37.020> be<00:00:37.079> good<00:00:37.230> i<00:00:37.380> think<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.860> only<00:00:38.010> real

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
should be good i think the only real

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.690 
should be good i think the only real
difference<00:00:38.579> i<00:00:38.910> suppose<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.140> actual

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
difference i suppose is is the actual

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.190 
difference i suppose is is the actual
program<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.879> quote<00:00:42.210> will<00:00:42.329> be<00:00:42.420> 10<00:00:42.629> mile<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:42.960> 12

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
program that quote will be 10 mile be 12

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.950 
program that quote will be 10 mile be 12
I<00:00:44.129> think<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> way<00:00:44.789> we've<00:00:44.969> played<00:00:45.000> previously

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
I think the way we've played previously

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.200 
I think the way we've played previously
on<00:00:46.079> tour<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:47.100> training<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.670> far<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.090> know

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
on tour and training so far you know

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.170 
on tour and training so far you know
that<00:00:48.420> said<00:00:48.600> piece<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.960> obviously<00:00:49.230> quite

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
that said piece is obviously quite

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.490 
that said piece is obviously quite
here's<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> 10<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.690> mean<00:00:51.989> even<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> two

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
here's a 10 I mean even on the two

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.040 
here's a 10 I mean even on the two
little<00:00:52.710> times<00:00:52.949> when<00:00:53.129> he<00:00:53.219> was<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.370> tensor<00:00:54.050> you

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
little times when he was a tensor you

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.119 
little times when he was a tensor you
know<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:55.320> me<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.530> feel<00:00:55.739> really<00:00:55.949> comfortable

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
know for me I feel really comfortable

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.880 
know for me I feel really comfortable
the<00:00:56.910> way<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.320> hopefully<00:00:58.320> quote<00:00:58.530> feels<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the way it is hopefully quote feels the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.740 
the way it is hopefully quote feels the
same<00:00:59.039> but<00:00:59.280> yeah<00:00:59.789> it's<00:01:00.059> pretty<00:01:00.210> much<00:01:00.449> were<00:01:00.570> just

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
same but yeah it's pretty much were just

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.959 
same but yeah it's pretty much were just
at<00:01:00.840> times<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.289> mix<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.010> out<00:01:02.129> especially

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
at times the mix in and out especially

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.509 
at times the mix in and out especially
the<00:01:03.059> way<00:01:03.180> we've<00:01:03.329> been<00:01:03.359> trying<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.750> fly<00:01:04.519> case

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the way we've been trying to fly case

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.609 
the way we've been trying to fly case
you<00:01:05.640> obviously<00:01:05.790> played<00:01:06.240> another<00:01:06.479> problem<00:01:06.930> in

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
you obviously played another problem in

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.350 
you obviously played another problem in
the<00:01:07.740> past<00:01:07.770> there<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.880> must<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.090> fairly

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the past there so it must be fairly

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.090 
the past there so it must be fairly
comfortable<00:01:09.869> for<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.409> then<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.680> put<00:01:10.920> a

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
comfortable for you and then you put a

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.340 
comfortable for you and then you put a
majority<00:01:11.580> during<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.909> National<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.140> sacred

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
majority during the National in a sacred

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.550 
majority during the National in a sacred
energy<00:01:14.100> yeah<00:01:14.490> yeah<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
energy yeah yeah so it is it's a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.249 
energy yeah yeah so it is it's a
position<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.979> feel<00:01:17.159> very<00:01:17.250> comfortable<00:01:18.229> as<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
position I feel very comfortable as a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.749 
position I feel very comfortable as a
certainty<00:01:19.619> yes<00:01:19.860> sir<00:01:19.979> i<00:01:20.009> think<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.460> it's

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
certainty yes sir i think it's it's

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.570 
certainty yes sir i think it's it's
easier<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.180> move<00:01:21.330> from<00:01:21.570> 10<00:01:22.040> after<00:01:23.040> 12<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.460> me

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
easier to move from 10 after 12 for me

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.910 
easier to move from 10 after 12 for me
than<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.909> go<00:01:24.060> 12<00:01:24.540> back<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> tensor<00:01:25.380> yeah<00:01:25.890> i

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
than to go 12 back in the tensor yeah i

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.740 
than to go 12 back in the tensor yeah i
feel<00:01:26.250> comfortable<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.790> seek<00:01:27.000> ways<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.570> some

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
feel comfortable if seek ways in some

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.469 
feel comfortable if seek ways in some
red-hot<00:01:28.380> form<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.130> good<00:01:29.250> running<00:01:29.430> off<00:01:29.579> in

wasn't<00:01:54.170> buying<00:01:54.530> what<00:01:55.220> should<00:01:55.700> happen<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:56.030> be

wasn't buying what should happen to be
able<00:01:56.210> time<00:01:56.510> I<00:01:56.890> guess<00:01:57.890> it's<00:01:58.070> like<00:01:58.190> what<00:01:58.370> gets

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
able time I guess it's like what gets

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.550 
able time I guess it's like what gets
gets<00:01:59.030> here<00:01:59.240> before<00:01:59.360> they<00:01:59.660> lock<00:01:59.900> on<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.350> tool

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
gets here before they lock on the tool

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.500 
gets here before they lock on the tool
we<00:02:00.740> switched<00:02:01.010> in<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:01.370> out<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:02.000> was<00:02:02.180> just<00:02:02.390> a

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
we switched in and out and was just a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.050 
we switched in and out and was just a
matter<00:02:02.840> of<00:02:02.900> where<00:02:03.140> we're<00:02:03.290> starting<00:02:04.060> the

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
matter of where we're starting the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.090 
matter of where we're starting the
runner<00:02:05.510> play<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.780> guess<00:02:06.080> so<00:02:06.290> once<00:02:06.770> we're<00:02:06.920> out<00:02:07.010> in

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
runner play I guess so once we're out in

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.469 
runner play I guess so once we're out in
the<00:02:07.160> field<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:07.580> something<00:02:08.090> might<00:02:08.300> happen

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
the field and something might happen

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.150 
the field and something might happen
right<00:02:08.929> in<00:02:08.990> front<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.380> you<00:02:09.500> just<00:02:09.770> got<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:09.950> take

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
right in front and you just got to take

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160 
right in front and you just got to take
take<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.670> opportunity<00:02:11.240> and<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:11.480> really<00:02:11.959> enjoy

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
take the opportunity and I really enjoy

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.250 
take the opportunity and I really enjoy
the<00:02:12.320> game<00:02:12.500> we<00:02:12.940> expecting<00:02:13.940> everything<00:02:15.490> you<00:02:16.490> can

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
the game we expecting everything you can

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.800 
the game we expecting everything you can
I<00:02:18.260> guess<00:02:18.740> yeah<00:02:18.890> they're<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.340> big<00:02:19.550> side<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:20.120> lot<00:02:20.690> of

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
I guess yeah they're a big side a lot of

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.970 
I guess yeah they're a big side a lot of
speed<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.320> they're<00:02:21.560> going<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.709> be<00:02:21.800> very

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
speed and they're going to be very

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.680 
speed and they're going to be very
physical<00:02:22.490> so<00:02:22.670> it's<00:02:23.120> going<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.300> have<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.450> try

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
physical so it's going to have to try

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.360 
physical so it's going to have to try
and<00:02:23.750> run<00:02:23.930> them<00:02:24.050> around<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.380> tie<00:02:24.530> them<00:02:24.709> out<00:02:24.890> but

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
and run them around and tie them out but

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.160 
and run them around and tie them out but
don't<00:02:25.610> fall<00:02:25.880> into<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.180> trap<00:02:26.570> of<00:02:26.810> playing

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
don't fall into the trap of playing

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.520 
don't fall into the trap of playing
sevens<00:02:27.620> which<00:02:27.770> is<00:02:27.950> their<00:02:28.520> comfort<00:02:28.880> zone<00:02:29.090> again

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530

yeah<00:02:46.220> back<00:02:46.550> when<00:02:46.850> he<00:02:46.940> was<00:02:47.000> playing<00:02:47.150> for

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
yeah back when he was playing for

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.140 
yeah back when he was playing for
Oakland<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:47.780> planning<00:02:48.050> a<00:02:48.290> few<00:02:48.950> times<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:52.340> just

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
Oakland I planning a few times I just

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.410 
Oakland I planning a few times I just
think<00:02:53.299> he's<00:02:53.450> strong<00:02:54.110> he's<00:02:54.799> very<00:02:55.010> quick<00:02:55.420> but

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
think he's strong he's very quick but

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.390 
think he's strong he's very quick but
he's<00:02:56.540> very<00:02:56.600> strong<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.200> his<00:02:57.320> hips<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:58.130> reckon

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
he's very strong to his hips so reckon

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.580 
he's very strong to his hips so reckon
that's<00:02:58.750> deceptively<00:02:59.750> strong<00:03:00.049> and<00:03:00.350> I<00:03:00.380> think

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
that's deceptively strong and I think

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.289 
that's deceptively strong and I think
you<00:03:01.220> know<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.340> feel<00:03:01.850> like<00:03:01.970> you're<00:03:02.090> in<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.209> good

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
you know you feel like you're in a good

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.900 
you know you feel like you're in a good
position<00:03:02.420> at<00:03:02.750> times<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:04.070> he's<00:03:04.459> able<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.790> get

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
position at times and he's able to get

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.789 
position at times and he's able to get
out<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.090> it<00:03:05.209> so<00:03:05.450> yeah<00:03:05.930> defensively<00:03:06.470> it's<00:03:06.650> going

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
out of it so yeah defensively it's going

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.430 
out of it so yeah defensively it's going
to<00:03:06.860> be<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:06.950> huge<00:03:07.130> ask<00:03:07.510> for<00:03:08.510> not<00:03:08.720> only<00:03:08.870> myself<00:03:09.170> but

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
to be a huge ask for not only myself but

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.670 
to be a huge ask for not only myself but
quite<00:03:09.769> as<00:03:09.950> well<00:03:10.100> so<00:03:10.340> yeah<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.299> think<00:03:11.540> whether<00:03:12.470> he

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
quite as well so yeah I think whether he

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.990 
quite as well so yeah I think whether he
spit<00:03:12.920> or<00:03:13.040> not<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:13.220> still<00:03:13.370> think<00:03:13.730> he's<00:03:13.820> going<00:03:13.940> to

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
spit or not I still think he's going to

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.740 
spit or not I still think he's going to
be<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.150> handful<00:03:16.120> matter<00:03:17.120> in<00:03:17.299> the<00:03:17.360> middle<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.570> a

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
be a handful matter in the middle of a

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.720 
be a handful matter in the middle of a
free<00:03:18.320> new<00:03:18.560> look<00:03:18.709> back

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
free new look back

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.030 
free new look back
has<00:03:20.730> been<00:03:20.970> killing<00:03:21.360> train<00:03:21.680> yeah<00:03:22.680> good<00:03:22.860> running

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040

there's<00:03:23.370> too<00:03:23.520> many<00:03:23.640> people<00:03:24.030> out<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.180> position

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
there's too many people out of position

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.780 
there's too many people out of position
