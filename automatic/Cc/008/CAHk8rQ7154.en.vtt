00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.719
 Eleventh September the village disaster home also committed 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.170
 a heavy storm with gusts leaves high mountains 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.049
 Hailstones and devastated the place 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.700
 Salzlandkreis saxony-anhalt last week 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.480
 a tornado raged here 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.480
 roofs covered destroyed facades and cars 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:24.579
 Tendency on the Mosel a heavy hail storm has in the idyllic winemakers 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.699
 first raging good three weeks have passed since then how devastating the 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.010
 Devastation here is only now the estimated damage at least 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.450
 30 million euros 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.990
 almost all rooftops smashed by hail just covered with plan 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.810
 the occupants of this house have hit the attic floor particularly hard 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.230
 is uninhabitable added the family has no insurance 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.340
 do not call there 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.410
 a white spot next money 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.490
 So I can not sleep only one but the thought change I know you 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.490
 yes in the head around 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.290
 SchÃ¶ber 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.370
 Sunday night is facing an uncertain future as to how high the damage is and how 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.310
 I do not know how to pay you 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.350
 who keeps off the two plan imitating winter over 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.070
 and so that it is dry 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.659
 Hochtief stubbornly defends itself against this plan 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.090
 one year ago 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.060
 but the little ones are not cheap 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 it rains into the house 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.480
 Even the many winemakers in Moselort has the storm to occupy as well as for 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.710
 Achim curves is viticulture for the most livelihood 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.430
 Now almost a quarter of the grapes rotted on the ground is the rest 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.710
 damaged had to be traded two weeks earlier than planned 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.289
 Accident it is damage sitting 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.230
 in terms of quantity we get implemented for ecologists 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.020
 But that can not only be the one who will produce bottles of wine and will 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.560
 I can hang on for a long time and the military men have become more closed 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.320
 as they are now 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.230
 We have to make the best of it first 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.130
 heavy storms like in rhineland-palatinate hessen and sachsen-anhalt in the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.270
 past weeks 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.069
 are it for due accumulations or we always get in Germany 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.369
 more fathers 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.989
 The meteorologist Dr. Karsten Brandt has been dealing with this question for a long time 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.159
 We are well over 50 years old in this year's thunderstorms 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.349
 think and year end was not just so much to come can be 52-54 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.860
 Percent in the nineties stay awake at around 44 to 46 so 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.159
 it is the fracture so you can tell it is bad weather in 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.389
 Germany is increasing 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.969
 individual areas in Germany appear to be particularly at risk 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.549
 These include above all regions with landscapes 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.909
 mainly the areas from the cologne basin until March 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.069
 affected by land 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.799
 In addition, Hessian mountain country to the Black Forest and the Alpine foothills 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.419
 "Germany is in terms of storm zone not comparable to endangering Suman 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.489
 as in the US 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.960
 we have thank God and will not experience that their children 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.360
 then we have a large area in Sweden before stuff in Haiti can deep 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.550
 It is said that in Germany there is a certain storm probability 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.249
 there is no place in or can exclude 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.049
 also Christoph Konrad of Australia has hit it 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.689
 Hailstones in tennis ball size have battered his car especially bitterly 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:17.760
 for the apprentice 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.930
 The car was meanwhile deregistered and is not insured 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:22.400
 basically taken 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.149
 On the other hand, who here is a total loss 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:26.529
 what author 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:29.899
 which city Dalian "I have to sell it that way 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:33.479
 as an action adventure 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:37.009
 Christoph Konrad is lucky that he is not in the trade during the trade 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.830
 Car was sitting 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.850
 the impact of the hailstones and splinters of the rear window would make him heavy 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.219
 can hurt 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.919
 what destructive power hail has white Marko Kashuba 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.629
 he is a meteorologist 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.299
 with a simulator time for Planetopia which damages a three 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.790
 Centimeters of hailstone on a car can leave that title 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.909
 Marcus Nispel of roughly 100 km / h 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.829
 and that's not exactly what one of the previous eleven was on the one hand 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.759
 Copenhagen 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.749
 Solis her that beautiful 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:14.919
 that's about them 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:18.789
 pretty distinct dent Antifa had hit the Leyens Auto Sheet Metal 13 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.340
 been recognized in the situation 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.230
 after what damage in the car experiment 2 left a four 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.800
 Centimeter is Google with 110 Kaymer the whole course comes with 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.260
 extremely violent 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.230
 That's why we're going to get it here on the 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.230
 Car deck first 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.050
 the result is an even deeper one 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.760
 On the left in the picture the damage to three centimeters of trade comes to the right 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.349
 Damage of four centimeters had bullet 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.490
 but compared to the hailstones intelligence are the small shield 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.490
 in strong gusts of wind around the 100 km / h 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.349
 Such a barely has it with over one hundred 60 km / h impact 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.610
 who is surprised by such a heavy storm in the car 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.759
 should definitely be right tray 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.539
 If the storm is already announced in advance you can take action 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.819
 to protect his car from hail 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:16.639
 If you do not have a garage, you can at least cover your car and pack it 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:17.400
 cover 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.960
 Car shows are available from 35 euros to cover and 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.059
 Fix divisions 

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:28.369
 important for the financial protection of hab and good is the right one 

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:30.620
 insurance 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.669
 their author has a part comprehensive insurance 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.129
 then there are the elemental damage such as storm WHG but also like flood 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.680
 insured 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.219
 That's why everyone should 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:45.399
 Car owners in addition to the liability also a partial comprehensive insurance 

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:48.399
 For homeowners and tenants is worth a home insurance 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.730
 she assures furnishing and household items for example against 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:53.949
 hailstorm 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.830
 the homeowner is 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.830
 should definitely take out a homeowners insurance 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.540
 they are protected by the driven fire tap storm hail 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:08.840
 and additionally who in endangered areas and rivers or even mountain 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.650
 be led endangered region or even in the Alps where a lot of snow 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.210
 falls in all cases in addition to a basic insurance 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.550
 but beware the insurance companies 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.479
 have their very own divisions regarding risk areas 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.969
 who according to insurance lives in a risk zone often can not 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:29.830
 insure against such storms 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.279
 the majority 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:32.969
 Sonja Kaup out of tendency 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:35.589
 could have completed a homeowners insurance 

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:38.379
 that she did not regret it today 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:40.669
 how to pay the damage now 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:43.150
 I dont know 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.370
 Godfather storms and tornadoes they are now increasingly in Germany too 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.130
 our weather
