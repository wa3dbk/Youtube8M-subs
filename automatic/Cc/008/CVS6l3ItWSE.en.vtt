matina to hide the edge and in order to
create<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:19.000> gradient<00:05:19.390> I'm<00:05:19.540> gonna<00:05:19.720> use

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
create the gradient I'm gonna use

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.960 
create the gradient I'm gonna use
photoshop<00:05:21.540> so<00:05:22.540> have<00:05:22.720> this<00:05:22.840> square<00:05:23.820> even<00:05:24.820> is

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
photoshop so have this square even is

photoshop so have this square even is
I'm<00:05:25.150> going<00:05:25.330> to<00:05:25.390> use<00:05:25.540> a<00:05:25.570> gradients<00:05:26.200> and<00:05:26.410> I

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
I'm going to use a gradients and I

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.900 
I'm going to use a gradients and I
needed<00:05:26.980> Freddie<00:05:27.310> in<00:05:27.520> three<00:05:29.400> color<00:05:30.400> gradients

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
needed Freddie in three color gradients

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.630 
needed Freddie in three color gradients
in<00:05:31.030> order<00:05:31.600> to<00:05:31.750> create<00:05:31.960> my<00:05:32.200> mind<00:05:32.710> mapping<00:05:32.890> i'm

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
in order to create my mind mapping i'm

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.870 
in order to create my mind mapping i'm
going<00:05:33.820> to<00:05:33.910> use<00:05:34.000> from<00:05:34.270> black<00:05:34.600> to<00:05:34.960> white<00:05:35.880> where

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
going to use from black to white where

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.690 
going to use from black to white where
the<00:05:37.120> black<00:05:37.480> area<00:05:37.930> is<00:05:37.990> going<00:05:38.080> to<00:05:38.169> be<00:05:38.370> opaque<00:05:39.370> and

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
the black area is going to be opaque and

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.170 
the black area is going to be opaque and
the<00:05:41.100> white<00:05:42.100> area<00:05:42.520> it's<00:05:42.820> going<00:05:43.000> to<00:05:43.030> be

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
the white area it's going to be

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.690 
the white area it's going to be
transparency<00:05:44.140> in<00:05:44.350> terms<00:05:44.380> of<00:05:44.620> my<00:05:44.860> of<00:05:45.220> be<00:05:45.460> free

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
transparency in terms of my of be free

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.360 
transparency in terms of my of be free
so<00:05:46.570> if<00:05:47.200> i<00:05:47.350> went<00:05:47.530> here<00:05:47.830> and<00:05:48.010> apply<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:50.050> same

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
so if i went here and apply the same

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.020 
so if i went here and apply the same
text<00:05:51.370> i<00:05:51.550> create

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:01.800 

so<00:05:55.660> Claire<00:05:55.900> gradient<00:05:58.080> so<00:05:59.080> now<00:06:00.510> as<00:06:01.510> you<00:06:01.660> can<00:06:01.750> see

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
so Claire gradient so now as you can see

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
so Claire gradient so now as you can see
in<00:06:01.990> the<00:06:02.110> material<00:06:04.110> the<00:06:05.110> center<00:06:05.590> of<00:06:05.620> my

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
in the material the center of my

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.280 
in the material the center of my
material<00:06:06.340> is<00:06:06.490> going<00:06:06.670> to<00:06:06.730> be<00:06:06.880> opaque<00:06:07.510> and<00:06:07.780> the

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
material is going to be opaque and the

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.370 
material is going to be opaque and the
outside<00:06:08.830> or<00:06:09.070> the<00:06:09.130> border<00:06:09.670> of<00:06:09.700> my<00:06:10.380> materials

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
outside or the border of my materials

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.440 
outside or the border of my materials
going<00:06:11.530> to<00:06:11.590> be<00:06:11.650> transparency<00:06:12.190> but<00:06:12.850> because<00:06:13.300> we

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
going to be transparency but because we

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.960 
going to be transparency but because we
have<00:06:13.630> a<00:06:13.710> reflection<00:06:14.710> layer<00:06:14.920> I<00:06:15.250> need<00:06:15.820> to

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
have a reflection layer I need to

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.000 
have a reflection layer I need to
control<00:06:16.330> the<00:06:16.600> reflection<00:06:17.170> in<00:06:17.320> those<00:06:17.530> areas

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
control the reflection in those areas

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.340 
control the reflection in those areas
well<00:06:18.310> so<00:06:18.940> I<00:06:19.150> don't<00:06:19.360> want<00:06:19.540> to<00:06:19.690> have<00:06:19.810> reflection

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
well so I don't want to have reflection

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.980 
well so I don't want to have reflection
a<00:06:20.440> little<00:06:20.710> Paris<00:06:21.040> is<00:06:21.190> law<00:06:21.450> in<00:06:22.450> order<00:06:22.600> to<00:06:22.780> avoid

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
a little Paris is law in order to avoid

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.840 
a little Paris is law in order to avoid
the<00:06:23.140> reflection<00:06:23.620> in<00:06:23.710> the<00:06:23.830> transparency<00:06:24.340> area

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
the reflection in the transparency area

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.290 
the reflection in the transparency area
have<00:06:25.510> to<00:06:25.720> apply<00:06:26.050> the<00:06:26.080> same<00:06:26.560> texture<00:06:27.300> mapping

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
have to apply the same texture mapping

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.400 
have to apply the same texture mapping
in<00:06:29.200> the<00:06:29.530> finals<00:06:29.920> effect<00:06:30.670> right<00:06:31.540> now<00:06:32.140> I'm

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
in the finals effect right now I'm

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.120 
in the finals effect right now I'm
telling<00:06:32.650> billy<00:06:33.070> I<00:06:33.280> don't<00:06:33.880> want<00:06:34.830> to<00:06:35.830> have<00:06:35.920> to

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
telling billy I don't want to have to

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.910 
telling billy I don't want to have to
invert<00:06:36.400> this<00:06:36.610> money<00:06:36.960> so<00:06:37.960> I'm<00:06:38.290> telling<00:06:38.470> really

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:38.920 
invert this money so I'm telling really

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.150 
invert this money so I'm telling really
i<00:06:39.280> don't<00:06:39.940> want<00:06:40.150> x<00:06:40.420> reflections<00:06:41.230> in<00:06:41.440> the<00:06:41.500> black

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
i don't want x reflections in the black

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.250 
i don't want x reflections in the black
area<00:06:42.550> cause<00:06:42.760> black<00:06:43.150> internal<00:06:43.720> reflection

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
area cause black internal reflection

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.210 
area cause black internal reflection
means<00:06:44.440> opaque<00:06:45.010> and<00:06:45.330> white<00:06:46.330> means<00:06:47.220> reflection

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
means opaque and white means reflection

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.070 
means opaque and white means reflection
so<00:06:48.400> I<00:06:48.550> don't<00:06:48.730> want<00:06:48.880> reflection<00:06:49.690> on<00:06:49.810> the<00:06:49.900> back

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
so I don't want reflection on the back

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.710 
so I don't want reflection on the back
area<00:06:50.320> and<00:06:50.590> the<00:06:51.010> reflection<00:06:51.520> in<00:06:51.730> the<00:06:51.880> in<00:06:52.630> the

area and the reflection in the in the

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.990 
area and the reflection in the in the
white<00:06:52.990> area<00:06:55.170> so<00:06:56.170> now

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 
white area so now

today so hopefully we can achieve this
kind<00:07:51.250> of<00:07:51.370> weather<00:07:51.520> and<00:07:51.820> have<00:07:52.810> another<00:07:53.020> teach

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:53.710 
kind of weather and have another teach

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.910 
kind of weather and have another teach
to<00:07:54.100> plan<00:07:54.370> the<00:07:54.940> floor<00:07:55.210> with<00:07:55.960> the<00:07:56.170> background

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:56.920 
to plan the floor with the background

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.820 
to plan the floor with the background
bye<00:07:57.700> bye
