towards<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.100> western<00:00:44.460> suburbs<00:00:44.730> what<00:00:45.149> I'm

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
towards the western suburbs what I'm

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.639 
towards the western suburbs what I'm
going<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.719> put<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.899> storm<00:00:46.230> analysis

going to do is put the storm analysis

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.430 
going to do is put the storm analysis
machine<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.309> one<00:00:47.610> hour<00:00:48.170> Futurecast<00:00:49.170> mode

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
machine in the one hour Futurecast mode

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.590 
machine in the one hour Futurecast mode
so<00:00:49.649> you'll<00:00:49.770> see<00:00:49.950> within<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.280> next<00:00:50.430> hour<00:00:50.610> snow

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.150 
is in the aurora area in the western
suburbs<00:00:54.120> also<00:00:54.809> into<00:00:55.050> central<00:00:55.500> will<00:00:55.680> county

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
suburbs also into central will county

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.040 
suburbs also into central will county

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
we're also tracking heavy snow this is

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.260 
we're also tracking heavy snow this is
the<00:00:58.289> snow<00:00:58.559> machine<00:00:58.949> which<00:00:59.399> isolates<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the snow machine which isolates the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.450 
the snow machine which isolates the
heaviest<00:01:00.539> bands<00:01:01.140> which<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.559> now<00:01:01.739> well<00:01:02.100> south

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
heaviest bands which are now well south

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.219 
heaviest bands which are now well south
of<00:01:02.640> Chicago<00:01:03.210> making<00:01:03.420> their<00:01:03.690> way<00:01:03.719> into<00:01:03.930> peoria

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
of Chicago making their way into peoria

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.530 
of Chicago making their way into peoria
so<00:01:04.589> when<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> snow<00:01:05.339> gets<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.150> will<00:01:06.360> be

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
so when the snow gets going it will be

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.480 
so when the snow gets going it will be
light<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:07.020> first<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.500> those<00:01:07.650> heavier<00:01:08.010> bands

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
light at first but those heavier bands

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.450 
light at first but those heavier bands
making<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> early<00:01:10.409> dawn<00:01:10.619> hours<00:01:11.159> so

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460

commutes on both in the colder the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
surfaces the harder it is to treat and

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.770

so<00:03:10.380> they<00:03:11.010> will<00:03:11.190> be<00:03:11.250> doing<00:03:11.519> double-duty<00:03:12.120> around

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
so they will be doing double-duty around

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.660 
so they will be doing double-duty around

but once it gets here there's another

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.860 
but once it gets here there's another
storm<00:03:52.920> system<00:03:53.220> that's<00:03:53.880> pushing<00:03:54.329> back<00:03:54.569> and

that force will keep the storm over us

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.390 
that force will keep the storm over us
even<00:03:57.840> longer<00:03:58.139> than<00:03:58.290> thursday<00:03:58.889> night<00:03:59.099> probably

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
area one of the tools we use to find out

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.069 
area one of the tools we use to find out
the<00:04:02.849> heavy<00:04:03.060> snow<00:04:03.359> we<00:04:03.540> call<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.810> snow

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
the heavy snow we call it the snow

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.710 
the heavy snow we call it the snow
machine<00:04:04.200> on<00:04:04.560> storm<00:04:04.919> analysis<00:04:05.639> and<00:04:05.849> the<00:04:06.299> areas

machine on storm analysis and the areas

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.990 
machine on storm analysis and the areas
in<00:04:06.750> pink<00:04:07.410> are<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.950> heaviest<00:04:08.160> bands<00:04:08.579> of<00:04:08.849> snow

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
in pink are the heaviest bands of snow

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.879 
in pink are the heaviest bands of snow
so<00:04:09.660> right<00:04:09.900> now<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.109> heavy<00:04:10.380> bands<00:04:10.709> are

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
so right now the heavy bands are

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.979 
so right now the heavy bands are
tracking<00:04:11.280> over<00:04:11.489> Peoria<00:04:11.970> but<00:04:12.299> we're<00:04:12.419> expecting

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
tracking over Peoria but we're expecting

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.080 
tracking over Peoria but we're expecting
this<00:04:13.169> part<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.620> storm<00:04:13.859> system<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.639> come<00:04:14.910> in

this part of the storm system to come in
overnight<00:04:15.480> tonight<00:04:15.959> as<00:04:16.200> it<00:04:16.739> does<00:04:16.979> so<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.489> couple

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
overnight tonight as it does so a couple

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.130 
overnight tonight as it does so a couple
inches<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:18.180> snow<00:04:18.390> on<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.599> ground<00:04:18.720> when<00:04:19.109> you

once again pink heavier bands of snow

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.180 
once again pink heavier bands of snow
watch<00:04:25.750> what<00:04:26.050> happens<00:04:26.440> once<00:04:26.650> we<00:04:26.860> get<00:04:26.980> into

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
watch what happens once we get into

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.950 
watch what happens once we get into
Thursday<00:04:27.610> night<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:27.850> Friday<00:04:27.910> morning<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:28.720> few

that's<00:04:31.630> where<00:04:31.900> we're<00:04:32.110> expecting<00:04:32.680> it<00:04:32.800> to

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
that's where we're expecting it to

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.430 
that's where we're expecting it to
really<00:04:33.220> stack<00:04:33.670> up<00:04:33.970> so<00:04:34.330> just<00:04:34.960> because<00:04:35.170> the
