00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.460 
this board really accentuates you might
feel<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.479> some<00:01:45.689> other<00:01:45.840> boards<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.320> this

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
feel it in some other boards but this

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.670 
feel it in some other boards but this
one<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.610> teeter-totter

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
one is a teeter-totter

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.120 
one is a teeter-totter
so<00:01:49.680> torsionally<00:01:51.439> well<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.590> board<00:01:52.860> feels

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
so torsionally well this board feels

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.350 
so torsionally well this board feels
like<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:54.829> wet<00:01:55.829> noodle<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.970> board<00:01:57.270> is

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
like it's just wet noodle this board is

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.920 
like it's just wet noodle this board is
torsionally<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:59.600> looking<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.810> almost

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
torsionally just looking I can almost

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.569 
torsionally just looking I can almost
show<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.470> graphic<00:02:01.710> with<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.280> foot

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
show you the graphic with that foot

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.289 
show you the graphic with that foot
touching<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> ground<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.000> board<00:02:06.240> just

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
touching the ground so this board just

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.160 
touching the ground so this board just
wants<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.720> Bend<00:02:06.960> anywhere<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:08.899> that's<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
wants to Bend anywhere and that's the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.050 
wants to Bend anywhere and that's the
max<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.860> room<00:02:12.140> well<00:02:13.140> right<00:02:13.769> there<00:02:14.610> Rome

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
max on the room well right there Rome
