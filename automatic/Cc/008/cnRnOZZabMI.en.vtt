 daughter of French father and Brazilian mother 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.829
 she made a lot of shuttle from brazil and france 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.969
 but ended up staying where you write 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.710
 your novels 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.170
 The book follows the story of jack 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.480
 clevers a couple of twins who 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.120
 to complete two and a half years lose their mother 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.620
 and begins to develop strange powers 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.750
 paranormal 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.059
 But the book just starts there. 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.450
 when he is ten years old a little bit 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.880
 they mother sally kanda a fenced village 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.430

 walks old being these three places 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.570
 created after the great catastrophe of 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.700
 times before an event that has changed to 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.740
 always the history of the world 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.049
 rights are not the protagonists of the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.479
 book for sale other characters who have 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.790
 his own individual plays where 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.729
 discovered clues where not because 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.680
 where he talks about the place where he 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.380
 discover clues to what happened to us 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.520
 times before and what are the roles in the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.619
 battle to come 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.770
 I honestly felt like this book 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.899
 makes a great control just because 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.210
 because we know a lot about it 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.220
 from the old days and we learn 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.280
 a lot about the thinking of the characters 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.560
 but the story itself is what advances 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.719
 Then you know when you finish the war. 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.880
 of thrones and you realize that 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.250
 that 's just one had more bag 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.430
 I really felt it during this reading 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.560
 but despite the negatives and b in slow 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.119
 This helped a lot 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.860
 Environmental world who these 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.789
 characters live and what are their 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.620
 mores 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.959
 the revitalization work that the author 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.750
 employed during writing is fantastic 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.090
 is very interesting also in a year of 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.250
 dystopias and theories at the end of the world a 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.349
 a book that deals precisely with the 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.720
 of the samba year after an event that 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.069
 more than half of the population and 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.150
 forever changed the course of our 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.720
 story 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.110
 but if you do not fool yourself the twins is not a 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.450
 dystopia knows where the author sins 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.850
 characters that only 10 years and sometimes 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.250
 act in attitudes that nothing consistent with the 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.569
 society showing convictions of 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.090
 hundreds of all they want to 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.370
 life but as much as reality is 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.470
 another I find it very difficult to 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.290
 assimilate and this is an evil that plagues 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.650
 several authors including our beloved 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.819
 george rr martin from his fire 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:05.799
 saga trade name is and only 14 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.970
 years and daniele only 13 believe in 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.370
 books counterpart as harry potter 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.799
 dadc lone a little brother of 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.060
 candidature or have been able to 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.140
 characters compatible with the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.609
 your age but together getting out of the subject 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.739
 returning the book in question is to 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.900
 problems the two characters only with ten 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.680
 years then in my head are much more 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.720
 old photos 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.269
 Another problem I had was the collision 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.560
 end so doing a comparison is 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.920
 like it was a movie from the quartet 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.049
 fantastic knows it can 90% of the time 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.569
 explaining how to gain the powers and 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.639
 making tests no final destination they 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.940
 finally we are the driver of style and 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:45.380
 It's fun, so it's basically 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.120
 the same black thing when things 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.959
 begin to happen is the story goes 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.350
 to engage 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.299
 It ends in the iuni because the 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.799
 first book is to be bigger 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.230
 so they had to divide into two errors 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.940
 but frankly they could have 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.160
 chosen a better point to finish 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.490
 not have because if we see in the edition 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.830
 as well as some words exchanged 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.940
 a translation was produced by the 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.500
 own author 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.140
 but I found it curious that in the original 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.780
 French the name of the first book is sale 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.500
 cane while the name on the ax itself is 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.989
 Isabeli is something like the alarm clocks if 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.840
 the viewer is not an electronic object and yes 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.850
 someone who highlights others to brasÃ­lia 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.190
 very beautiful but does not compare with the 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.630
 French covers that look super 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.600
 clean and more consistent with reality 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.460
 written the book and there are excerpts from 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.280
 books that are from a book inside the 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.700
 book it uses a source that super 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.320
 does not help in reading so is is a level 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.160
 very cool but confirmed the lousy 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:49.720
 then from the news board the book and two 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.130
 bus at the end with an average of 33 years 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.600
 he was not obliged to follow here
