 is genuine high-grade forward 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.299
 neither is 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.730
 rather, it is a mixture of several genres that

 at the end creates an amazing world 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.970
 autoevolution 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.099
 assets master of his friend 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.210
 others have so far received it 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.079
 vitality only st 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.079
 get his skills 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.350
 cell 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.360
 and when it begins with the birth of a new life 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.680
 on selected panic 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.070
 first stage of your life 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.360
 you start in the metropolitan area where 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.480
 the rest who would prefer to do 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.110
 transporting them 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.880
 manageability were prepared 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.680
 if you are forced to eat 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.230
 microorganisms that way through 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.840
 several education your 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.840
 the answers will turn into land creatures 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.410
 did not exist 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.570
 as opposed to building a cage house for 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.640
 creating some parts limited 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.930
 with ten different specialists 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.980
 the next step being follows 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.460
 many different of unusual legs and legs 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.780
 that is, you can create 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.080
 being completely unlike already 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.080
 created by 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.890
 ha 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.030
 m 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.850
 suddenly 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.850
 g 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.590
 In principle, at this stage lies the main 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.150
 part of this project 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.800
 you play as one of your substances 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.510
 baby 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.260
 your key task is finding others 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.070
 bird species bread consumption 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.110
 understanding by the way you will 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.140
 find various sources put forward 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.340
 for further transformations through 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.850
 wap 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.850
 will be completed 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.270
 instead of a kind of inventory for each 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.140
 subject give various 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.020
 amber capacity governments 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.640
 speak conservative 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.179
 track 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:13.679
 you will be available as an attacking lunch 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:16.000
 such a measure of his contacts 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.560
 Let it be so for example illness 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.850
 will be able to file friendly 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.680
 creating a party after all even we want so 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.149
 got a question 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:26.919
 like secret characters in the game 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:28.869
 there are existed 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:31.319
 who have plenty of time to 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.789
 entrepreneurship 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:34.999
 what performances could help 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.999
 some huge monster 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.669
 money 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:47.169
 right part 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.169
 I don't want him to rest 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:54.779
 as soon as you read these lines 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:58.330
 existing network of osh cities and creation 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.310
 no match now counts and means 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.749
 components 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.329
 if you are driving up to 12 years of existence 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.799
 but his dismissal will affect others 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.039
 time 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:10.699
 instead of Adilov he will be in service 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.019
 Italian navy 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.150
 also on your abilities 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.150
 businesses your support 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.129
 civilization 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.439
 the name of this stage speaks for itself 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.239
 the game starts a joke taking place on stage 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.029
 mayor civilization 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.729
 your order will go away 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:46.269
 ground-based air and marine technology in 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.129
 whichever you finished 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.879
 the previous stage you can choose 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.950
 orientation economy religion 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.479
 either vainakh 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.619
 depends on how easily you can 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:04:00.029
 overcome the rest of the state on this 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:02.749
 times your forge palace can be 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:05.819
 create tanks technique to create ships to 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.789
 Sorry now money is not affected 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.819
 nothing on the technique itself only reflects on 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.209
 speed ratio previously none of 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.209
 heroines

 using a communication transmitter 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:25.300
 but they have nothing to say 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.030
 the only problem on this 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.690
 stage is the impossibility 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.860
 having ceased three stages so be 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.789
 be careful not to save there if 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.789
 not sure further beaten 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.050
 according to 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.889
 but she changes she 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.819
 position 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.879
 questioned 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:51.080
 space 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.250
 capture the planet your empire 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.659
 existing from the conquest of space 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.649
 you will become the money pledged nameless 

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:01.559
 captain of her time with it so 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:03.559
 turns into likeness 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:05.469
 you will be given tasks you can 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:07.329
 see trade colonize 

00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:09.469
 other planets and research 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.699
 resources searching for another time to excel
