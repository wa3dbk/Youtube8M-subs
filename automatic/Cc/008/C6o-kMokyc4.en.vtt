that this much or before using the mod I
mean<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.490> ridiculous<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.479> taken<00:01:33.750> out

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810

something of that sort yet we're getting

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.319 
something of that sort yet we're getting
close<00:01:46.409> now<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.189> -<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.850> diamond<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
close now to the - of the diamond and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.789 
close now to the - of the diamond and
you<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.540> also<00:01:48.659> see<00:01:48.930> all<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.049> lava<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.680> can

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
you can also see all the lava so you can

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.950 
you can also see all the lava so you can
make<00:01:49.979> sure<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.369> don't<00:01:50.460> die<00:01:50.729> by<00:01:51.090> by<00:01:51.600> lava

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
make sure that you don't die by by lava

make sure that you don't die by by lava
which<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.350> pretty<00:01:52.680> damn<00:01:52.950> nice<00:01:53.220> as<00:01:53.430> well<00:01:53.700> now<00:01:54.240> I

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
which is pretty damn nice as well now I

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.510 
which is pretty damn nice as well now I
believe<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:55.049> right<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.219> now<00:01:56.399> we're

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
believe it's right here so now we're

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.980 
believe it's right here so now we're
just<00:01:56.579> going<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.820> put<00:01:56.939> torch<00:01:57.270> down<00:01:57.479> it's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
just going to put torch down it's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.800 
just going to put torch down it's
convenient<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.740> let's<00:01:59.670> just<00:01:59.939> turn<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.420> this

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
convenient and let's just turn this this

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.929 
convenient and let's just turn this this
off<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.320> there<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:01.680> are<00:02:01.710> there's<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.700> diamond

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
off and there we are there's the diamond

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.670 
off and there we are there's the diamond
right<00:02:03.270> there<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.630> that's<00:02:03.750> proof<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.530> this

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
right there so that's proof that this

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.499 
right there so that's proof that this
definitely<00:02:05.040> does<00:02:05.280> work<00:02:05.310> okay<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.119> there<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.479> go

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
definitely does work okay so there we go

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.510 
definitely does work okay so there we go
now<00:02:06.840> let's<00:02:07.020> go<00:02:07.290> back<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.649> surface<00:02:08.069> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
now let's go back to the surface and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.040 
now let's go back to the surface and
I'll<00:02:08.970> show<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.209> some<00:02:09.450> other<00:02:09.569> features<00:02:10.020> that

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.910 
don't have too many items mod or
anything<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:00.690> can<00:03:00.840> just<00:03:00.870> press<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.320> L<00:03:01.470> key<00:03:01.769> on

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
anything you can just press the L key on

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.590 
anything you can just press the L key on
your<00:03:02.010> keyboard<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.580> that'll<00:03:03.090> bring<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.390> back

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
your keyboard and that'll bring you back

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.960 
your keyboard and that'll bring you back
to<00:03:03.630> daytime<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.010> basically<00:03:05.190> acts<00:03:05.700> as<00:03:05.910> a

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
to daytime so it basically acts as a

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.840 
to daytime so it basically acts as a
light<00:03:06.269> l<00:03:06.570> for<00:03:07.050> light<00:03:07.260> yeah<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.040> then<00:03:08.459> next<00:03:08.640> up

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
light l for light yeah and then next up

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.820 
light l for light yeah and then next up
there's<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.269> R<00:03:09.600> key<00:03:09.900> now<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.380> our<00:03:10.560> key

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
there's the R key now that our key

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.610 
there's the R key now that our key
basically<00:03:11.730> shows<00:03:12.000> only<00:03:12.360> lava<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:13.140> there's

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
basically shows only lava so there's

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.830 
basically shows only lava so there's
usually<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:14.070> lot<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.430> redstone<00:03:14.760> around<00:03:15.150> lava<00:03:15.480> so

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
usually a lot of redstone around lava so

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.270 
usually a lot of redstone around lava so
I<00:03:15.870> guess<00:03:16.260> it's<00:03:16.440> kind<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.769> indicate<00:03:17.130> where

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
I guess it's kind of to indicate where

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.220 
I guess it's kind of to indicate where
redstone<00:03:17.820> is<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.299> also<00:03:18.480> may<00:03:18.720> be<00:03:18.780> other<00:03:18.989> other

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
redstone is and also may be other other

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.380 
redstone is and also may be other other
ores<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:19.799> especially<00:03:20.459> lava<00:03:20.910> so<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.239> just

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
ores but especially lava so it just

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.569 
ores but especially lava so it just
shows<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.840> well<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.260> lava<00:03:22.500> is<00:03:22.769> maybe<00:03:23.310> if<00:03:23.459> you

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
shows you well the lava is maybe if you

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.009 
shows you well the lava is maybe if you
guys<00:03:23.670> want<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.060> go<00:03:24.299> down<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.690> collect<00:03:24.780> some

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
guys want to go down and collect some

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.750 
guys want to go down and collect some
lava<00:03:25.260> for<00:03:25.560> whatever<00:03:25.739> reason<00:03:26.250> I'm<00:03:26.430> not<00:03:26.489> too

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
lava for whatever reason I'm not too

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.520 
lava for whatever reason I'm not too
sure<00:03:26.970> but<00:03:27.540> yeah<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.750> can<00:03:27.959> do<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.260> at<00:03:28.500> your

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
sure but yeah you can do that at your

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.970 
sure but yeah you can do that at your
pleasure<00:03:29.489> so<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.329> then<00:03:31.170> for<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.410> last<00:03:31.590> one<00:03:31.829> we

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
pleasure so and then for the last one we

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.120 
pleasure so and then for the last one we
just<00:03:32.190> have<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.910> coordinates<00:03:33.750> which<00:03:34.110> is<00:03:34.380> C<00:03:34.739> now

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
just have the coordinates which is C now

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.560 
just have the coordinates which is C now
if<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.459> press<00:03:35.670> C<00:03:35.880> on<00:03:35.970> your<00:03:36.030> keyboard<00:03:36.120> you'll

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
if you press C on your keyboard you'll

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.360 
if you press C on your keyboard you'll
get<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.780> load<00:03:37.110> of<00:03:37.140> coordinates<00:03:37.739> as<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.250> guys

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
get a load of coordinates as you guys

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.250 
get a load of coordinates as you guys
can<00:03:38.519> see<00:03:38.579> in<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.820> top<00:03:39.000> left<00:03:39.030> hand<00:03:39.329> screen<00:03:39.989> of

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
can see in the top left hand screen of

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.530 
can see in the top left hand screen of
this<00:03:40.739> video<00:03:41.010> it's<00:03:41.280> just<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.610> nicer<00:03:41.880> format<00:03:42.390> of

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
this video it's just a nicer format of

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.110 
this video it's just a nicer format of
coordinates<00:03:43.170> unlike<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:44.040> usual<00:03:44.400> coordinates

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
coordinates unlike the usual coordinates

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.850 
coordinates unlike the usual coordinates
and<00:03:45.239> it'll<00:03:45.390> show<00:03:45.420> you<00:03:45.570> exactly<00:03:45.989> where<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:46.829> are

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
and it'll show you exactly where you are

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.979 
and it'll show you exactly where you are
and<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.670> can<00:03:47.820> give<00:03:48.269> them<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.450> your<00:03:48.660> friend<00:03:48.870> to

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
and you can give them to your friend to

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.170 
and you can give them to your friend to
find<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.380> or<00:03:49.560> whatever<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:50.670> it's<00:03:50.850> just<00:03:51.030> a

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
find you or whatever and it's just a

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.180 
find you or whatever and it's just a
much<00:03:51.329> more<00:03:51.390> convenient<00:03:51.930> way<00:03:52.170> of<00:03:52.590> looking<00:03:53.010> at

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
much more convenient way of looking at

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.039 
much more convenient way of looking at
coordinates<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.850> guess<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.360> this<00:03:54.840> mod

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
coordinates I guess and this mod

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.110 
coordinates I guess and this mod
unfortunately<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.040> doesn't<00:03:56.220> work<00:03:56.370> with<00:03:56.790> opti

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
unfortunately it doesn't work with opti

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.150 
unfortunately it doesn't work with opti
finds<00:03:57.329> so<00:03:57.720> you'll<00:03:58.200> have<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.470> choose<00:03:58.650> one<00:03:58.950> one

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
finds so you'll have to choose one one

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.289 
finds so you'll have to choose one one
from<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.459> other<00:03:59.579> they<00:03:59.760> are<00:03:59.850> fairly<00:04:00.090> different

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
from the other they are fairly different

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.240 
from the other they are fairly different
mods<00:04:00.660> I<00:04:00.810> guess<00:04:00.989> but<00:04:01.290> yeah<00:04:01.890> you'll<00:04:02.040> have<00:04:02.070> to
