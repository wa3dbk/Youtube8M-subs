00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
didn't even complete it they failed 16

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.299 
didn't even complete it they failed 16
hours<00:00:56.699> into<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.350> 16<00:00:58.890> hours<00:00:58.980> they

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
hours into it so in in 16 hours they

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.709 
hours into it so in in 16 hours they
fail<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.789> raid<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.239> they're<00:01:00.480> i'm<00:01:00.690> pretty

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
fail the raid and they're i'm pretty

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.389 
fail the raid and they're i'm pretty
sure<00:01:00.930> they're<00:01:01.020> playing<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.440> legend<00:01:01.800> i<00:01:01.980> think<00:01:02.160> is

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
sure they're playing a legend i think is

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.529 
sure they're playing a legend i think is
what<00:01:02.550> they<00:01:02.640> were<00:01:02.699> saying<00:01:02.969> I'm<00:01:03.120> not<00:01:03.149> exactly

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
what they were saying I'm not exactly

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.280 
what they were saying I'm not exactly
sure<00:01:03.799> so<00:01:05.090> if<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.299> takes<00:01:06.420> 16<00:01:06.720> hours<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.229> they

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
sure so if it takes 16 hours and they

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.840 
sure so if it takes 16 hours and they
still<00:01:07.530> fail<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.950> means<00:01:08.100> they<00:01:08.280> probably<00:01:08.310> want

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
still fail that means they probably want

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.580 
still fail that means they probably want
to<00:01:08.880> failed<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> final<00:01:09.659> boss<00:01:09.780> or<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.229> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
to failed in the final boss or so so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.859 
to failed in the final boss or so so
maybe<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.220> raid<00:01:11.670> itself<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.150> actually<00:01:12.360> 16

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
maybe the raid itself is actually 16

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.539 
maybe the raid itself is actually 16
hours<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:13.770> if<00:01:13.890> there<00:01:14.010> were<00:01:14.040> some<00:01:14.250> points

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
hours but if there were some points

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.090 
hours but if there were some points
being<00:01:14.670> made<00:01:14.760> we're<00:01:15.210> actually<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.710> 16

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
being made we're actually in the 16

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.130 
being made we're actually in the 16
hours<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.580> took<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.880> long<00:01:17.939> because<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.990> know

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140
