00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.660 
annihilation and we're gonna be going
over<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.170> few<00:00:10.230> concepts<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.070> controls<00:00:11.429> that

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
over a few concepts and controls that

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.280 
over a few concepts and controls that
really<00:00:11.910> helped<00:00:12.120> me<00:00:12.240> gain<00:00:12.450> edge<00:00:12.750> when<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.019> first

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
choked up a lot more players I know

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.759 
choked up a lot more players I know
that's<00:00:23.760> when<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:23.970> started<00:00:24.390> all<00:00:24.810> right<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.650> here

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
that's when I started all right so here

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.830 
that's when I started all right so here
we<00:00:25.800> go<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.849> first<00:00:27.060> tip<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.390> have<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.810> today

we go the first tip I have for you today
is<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.170> activate<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.800> pole<00:00:29.189> lock<00:00:29.490> option<00:00:30.060> in

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
is to activate the pole lock option in

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.089 
is to activate the pole lock option in
the<00:00:30.269> camera<00:00:30.570> control<00:00:30.900> menu<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.679> locks<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
the camera control menu this locks the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.560 
the camera control menu this locks the
pole<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> top<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.120> bottom<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.540> screen

pole to the top and bottom of the screen
making<00:00:34.500> maneuvering<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> map<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.550> keeping

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
making maneuvering the map and keeping

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.290 
making maneuvering the map and keeping
yourself<00:00:36.300> oriented<00:00:36.660> much<00:00:36.899> easier<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:38.300> second

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
yourself oriented much easier a second

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.090 
yourself oriented much easier a second
tip<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.750> use<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.989> continuous<00:00:40.260> build<00:00:40.710> mode

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
tip is to use the continuous build mode

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.100 
tip is to use the continuous build mode
available<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.670> factories<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.570> allows<00:00:42.870> you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
available in factories this allows you

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.750 
available in factories this allows you
to<00:00:43.290> select<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.680> specific<00:00:43.890> unit<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.670> be

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
to select a specific unit to be

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.430 
to select a specific unit to be
constantly<00:00:45.210> fabricated<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.050> deployed

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
constantly fabricated and deployed

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.740 
constantly fabricated and deployed
instead<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.340> manually<00:00:47.820> selecting<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> amount

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
instead of manually selecting the amount

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.670 
instead of manually selecting the amount
and<00:00:48.960> frequency<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.649> construction<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:52.440> third

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
and frequency of construction the third

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.439 
and frequency of construction the third
tip<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.280> click<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.730> drag<00:00:53.760> your<00:00:54.149> metal

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
tip is to click and drag your metal

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.600 
tip is to click and drag your metal
extractors<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.649> creates<00:00:56.010> an<00:00:56.100> expandable

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
extractors this creates an expandable

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.760 
extractors this creates an expandable
circle<00:00:57.149> where<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.510> fabricator<00:00:58.140> will

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
circle where your fabricator will

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.830 
circle where your fabricator will
construct<00:00:59.250> extractors<00:00:59.910> anywhere<00:01:00.390> inside<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
construct extractors anywhere inside the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.020 
construct extractors anywhere inside the
circle<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.770> adds<00:01:02.100> another<00:01:02.250> aspect<00:01:02.940> of

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
circle this adds another aspect of

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.520 
circle this adds another aspect of
automation<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.840> will<00:01:04.049> allow<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.409> get

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
less micromanaging next be sure to use

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.429 
less micromanaging next be sure to use
what<00:01:11.729> resources<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.540> sky<00:01:12.930> your<00:01:13.110> enemy

never<00:01:26.430> stop<00:01:26.850> expanding<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.470> think<00:01:28.680> of

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
never stop expanding I like to think of

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.440 
never stop expanding I like to think of
it<00:01:28.860> as<00:01:28.950> gathering<00:01:29.460> wood<00:01:29.670> when<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.180> think<00:01:30.360> you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it as gathering wood when you think you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.450 
it as gathering wood when you think you
have<00:01:30.630> enough<00:01:30.930> double<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.680> after<00:01:32.340> that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
have enough double it and after that

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.490 
have enough double it and after that
double<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.090> again<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.079> an<00:01:34.140> extremely

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
double it again this is an extremely

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.950 
double it again this is an extremely
hectic<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.220> fast-paced<00:01:35.610> game<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.570> even<00:01:36.840> with

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
hectic and fast-paced game and even with

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.200 
hectic and fast-paced game and even with
tons<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.320> building<00:01:37.740> resources<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.520> units<00:01:38.850> you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
tons of building resources and units you

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.819 
tons of building resources and units you
can<00:01:39.240> still<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:39.750> annihilated<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> drop<00:01:40.799> of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
can still be annihilated at the drop of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:41.569 
can still be annihilated at the drop of
a<00:01:41.070> hat

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
a hat

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.639 
a hat
so<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.180> sure<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.420> keep<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.720> energy<00:01:42.930> plant<00:01:43.409> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
so be sure to keep this energy plant and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.469 
so be sure to keep this energy plant and
metal<00:01:43.979> factories<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.729> keep<00:01:45.270> building

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
metal factories going keep building

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.330 
metal factories going keep building
factories<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.259> keep<00:01:46.409> producing<00:01:46.649> units<00:01:47.189> until
