00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
it starts like fluffing up and come

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.480 
it starts like fluffing up and come
together<00:03:28.700> these<00:03:29.700> like<00:03:29.970> kinks<00:03:30.710> and<00:03:31.710> not<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.220> get

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
together these like kinks and not I get

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.180 
together these like kinks and not I get
created<00:03:33.030> will<00:03:33.240> help<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.720> say<00:03:33.870> together<00:03:34.190> so

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
created will help it say together so

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.880 
created will help it say together so
it'll<00:03:35.610> be<00:03:35.810> reinforced<00:03:36.810> not<00:03:37.020> only<00:03:37.320> by<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.560> heat

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
it'll be reinforced not only by the heat

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.120 
it'll be reinforced not only by the heat
but<00:03:38.160> also<00:03:38.280> by<00:03:38.610> this<00:03:39.350> tangles<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.680> has<00:03:40.890> in

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
but also by this tangles that it has in

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.890 
but also by this tangles that it has in
it<00:03:42.410> doesn't<00:03:43.410> look<00:03:43.740> too<00:03:44.010> tangled<00:03:44.550> because<00:03:45.000> this

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
it doesn't look too tangled because this

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.650 
it doesn't look too tangled because this
isn't<00:03:46.260> like<00:03:46.350> an<00:03:46.470> HD<00:03:46.770> camera<00:03:46.800> but<00:03:47.450> it's<00:03:48.450> like

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
flat iron it's great I said like a two

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.100 
flat iron it's great I said like a two
and<00:05:18.540> a<00:05:18.630> half<00:05:19.130> inch<00:05:20.130> thick<00:05:20.640> one<00:05:20.910> I<00:05:21.240> like<00:05:21.870> white

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
and a half inch thick one I like white

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.190 
and a half inch thick one I like white
one<00:05:22.380> um<00:05:23.450> they<00:05:24.450> gave<00:05:24.600> it<00:05:24.750> away<00:05:26.300> so<00:05:27.300> I<00:05:27.630> only<00:05:27.900> have

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
one um they gave it away so I only have

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.340 
one um they gave it away so I only have
this<00:05:28.350> really<00:05:28.650> thin<00:05:28.920> one<00:05:29.840> the<00:05:30.840> only<00:05:30.990> difference

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
this really thin one the only difference

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.840 
this really thin one the only difference
between<00:05:31.500> this<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.130> using<00:05:32.370> boiling<00:05:32.670> water

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
between this and using boiling water

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.940 
between this and using boiling water
would<00:05:33.090> be<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.420> after<00:05:34.200> you<00:05:34.320> twist<00:05:34.620> it<00:05:34.800> and

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
would be that after you twist it and

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.920 
would be that after you twist it and
you're<00:05:35.070> holding<00:05:35.220> it<00:05:35.520> you<00:05:36.180> submerge<00:05:36.720> the

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
you're holding it you submerge the

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.150 
you're holding it you submerge the
entire<00:05:36.960> thing<00:05:38.030> into<00:05:39.030> boiling<00:05:39.420> water<00:05:40.070> so<00:05:41.070> you

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
entire thing into boiling water so you

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.540 
entire thing into boiling water so you
can<00:05:41.370> see<00:05:41.580> how<00:05:41.700> somebody<00:05:41.970> could<00:05:42.390> get<00:05:42.570> burned

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
can see how somebody could get burned

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.260 
can see how somebody could get burned
and<00:05:44.550> that<00:05:44.670> wouldn't<00:05:44.910> be<00:05:45.000> too<00:05:45.210> fun<00:05:47.270> we're

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
and that wouldn't be too fun we're

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.930 
and that wouldn't be too fun we're
losing<00:05:48.630> her<00:05:48.810> but<00:05:49.020> it's<00:05:49.470> hot

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.249 

you<00:05:55.940> know<00:05:57.729> and<00:05:58.729> there<00:05:59.539> you<00:05:59.629> have<00:05:59.660> your<00:05:59.810> tread<00:06:00.110> I

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:00.259 
you know and there you have your tread I

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:01.809 
you know and there you have your tread I
didn't<00:06:00.500> steal<00:06:00.680> the<00:06:00.830> end<00:06:01.009> too<00:06:01.250> well<00:06:01.280> as<00:06:01.580> you<00:06:01.669> can

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:01.819 
didn't steal the end too well as you can

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.059 
didn't steal the end too well as you can
see<00:06:02.030> that's<00:06:02.780> how<00:06:02.930> it<00:06:03.020> ends<00:06:03.319> if<00:06:03.409> you<00:06:03.440> end<00:06:03.740> up<00:06:03.889> not

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:04.069 
see that's how it ends if you end up not

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:08.320 
see that's how it ends if you end up not
heating<00:06:04.550> it<00:06:04.669> well<00:06:04.789> enough<00:06:06.039> but<00:06:07.039> this<00:06:07.370> should

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
heating it well enough but this should

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.920 
heating it well enough but this should
