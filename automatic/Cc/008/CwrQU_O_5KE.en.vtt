00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.940 
talking about now if you guys are Wi-Fi
the<00:02:22.110> way<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.650> do<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.660> UM<00:02:24.660> do<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.590> sign<00:02:25.800> on

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
the way to do it is to UM do the sign on

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.110 
the way to do it is to UM do the sign on
with<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.220> which<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.460> basically<00:02:26.580> do<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.000> same

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
with it which you basically do the same

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.330 
with it which you basically do the same
thing<00:02:27.570> but<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.230> sign<00:02:28.530> out<00:02:28.710> right<00:02:28.980> before<00:02:29.130> it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
thing but you sign out right before it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.640 
thing but you sign out right before it
goes<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.640> logo<00:02:30.000> I'm<00:02:30.870> gonna<00:02:31.350> show<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.500> guys

the line Cape away and for the sign up
method<00:02:34.080> it's<00:02:34.230> basically<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.950> same<00:02:35.010> thing

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
method it's basically the same thing

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.010 
method it's basically the same thing
just<00:02:35.400> sign<00:02:35.820> out<00:02:35.850> whether<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:36.900> through

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
just sign out whether it's through

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.570 
just sign out whether it's through
connect<00:02:37.470> whether<00:02:37.830> it's<00:02:38.220> through<00:02:38.430> your

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580
