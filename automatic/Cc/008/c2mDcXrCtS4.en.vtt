00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
think Sprint is not supported yet also

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.639 
think Sprint is not supported yet also

does<00:01:00.510> come<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.870> Roma<00:01:01.289> installer<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
does come with a Roma installer so you

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.920 
does come with a Roma installer so you
can<00:01:02.219> install<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.579> couple<00:01:03.180> different<00:01:03.570> kernels

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
can install a couple different kernels

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.289 
can install a couple different kernels
but<00:01:04.589> as<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.369> exactly<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.119> same

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
but as you can see it's exactly the same

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.280 
but as you can see it's exactly the same
now<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.600> coolest<00:01:07.140> thing<00:01:07.530> about<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:09.780> Galaxy

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
now the coolest thing about the Galaxy

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.890 
now the coolest thing about the Galaxy
s6<00:01:11.030> is<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.470> ROM<00:01:13.680> also<00:01:14.070> has<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.900> ability

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
s6 is that this ROM also has is ability

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.450 
s6 is that this ROM also has is ability
to<00:01:16.080> change<00:01:16.350> your<00:01:16.530> grid<00:01:16.710> size<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
to change your grid size just like a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.120 
to change your grid size just like a
galaxy<00:01:17.909> s6<00:01:18.330> I've<00:01:18.540> got<00:01:18.689> here<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:18.960> my<00:01:19.080> left<00:01:19.320> also

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
galaxy s6 I've got here on my left also

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.190 
galaxy s6 I've got here on my left also
you<00:01:20.189> do<00:01:20.400> get<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.850> bunch<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.600> different<00:01:21.990> themes

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
you do get a bunch of different themes

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
you do get a bunch of different themes
for<00:01:22.710> example<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.430> want<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.970> change<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.659> to

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
for example if you want to change it to

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.530 
for example if you want to change it to
Avengers<00:01:26.220> theme<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.939> go<00:01:27.060> ahead<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
Avengers theme you can go ahead and

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.319 
Avengers theme you can go ahead and
download<00:01:28.170> different<00:01:28.829> themes<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.220> change<00:01:30.180> it

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
download different themes and change it

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.760 
download different themes and change it
and<00:01:30.450> there's<00:01:30.630> actually<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> ton<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.290> different

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and there's actually a ton of different

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.460 
and there's actually a ton of different
themes<00:01:31.950> right<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.600> see<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.140> speed

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
themes right now you can see this speed

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.319 
themes right now you can see this speed
is<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> little<00:01:34.770> bit<00:01:35.189> slower<00:01:35.520> than<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.850> galaxy

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
is a little bit slower than the galaxy

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.020 
is a little bit slower than the galaxy
s6<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.110> get<00:01:37.350> all<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.920> same<00:01:38.159> features<00:01:38.790> but

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
s6 but you get all the same features but

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.520 
s6 but you get all the same features but
I'm<00:01:39.509> going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> go<00:01:39.810> ahead<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.079> switch<00:01:40.200> this

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
I'm going to go ahead and switch this

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.120 
I'm going to go ahead and switch this
back<00:01:41.180> just<00:01:42.180> because<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.780> show<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.070> but<00:01:44.070> you

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
back just because to show you but you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.530 
back just because to show you but you
can<00:01:44.189> play<00:01:44.460> with<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.640> there's<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.119> ton<00:01:45.509> of

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
can play with it there's like a ton of

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.649 
can play with it there's like a ton of
themes<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:47.040> theme<00:01:47.340> alone<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:48.030> definitely

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
themes so theme alone is definitely

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.719 
themes so theme alone is definitely
worth<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.930> upgrade<00:01:49.399> now<00:01:50.399> as<00:01:50.520> far<00:01:50.670> as

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
worth the upgrade now as far as

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.630 
worth the upgrade now as far as
performance<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.829> you<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:53.070> three<00:01:53.520> different

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
performance I you have three different

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.550 
performance I you have three different
kernels<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.420> said<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.259> install<00:01:55.500> a

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
kernels like I said you can install a

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.459 
kernels like I said you can install a
stock<00:01:55.950> or<00:01:56.820> k<00:01:57.360> Tweaker<00:01:57.780> kernel<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.259> there's

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
stock or k Tweaker kernel and there's

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.030 
stock or k Tweaker kernel and there's
one<00:01:58.649> other<00:01:58.799> kernel<00:01:59.540> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.810> overclock<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.649> if

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
one other kernel you can overclock it if

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.350 
one other kernel you can overclock it if
you<00:02:02.219> want<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.640> actually<00:02:02.759> does<00:02:03.180> come

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
you want it actually does come

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.249 
you want it actually does come
overclocked<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.130> 2.7<00:02:05.299> 2<00:02:06.299> gigahertz<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.990> think

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
overclocked to 2.7 2 gigahertz I think

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.229 
overclocked to 2.7 2 gigahertz I think
but<00:02:07.860> I've<00:02:07.979> got<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.190> under<00:02:08.459> clock<00:02:08.849> right<00:02:09.090> now

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
but I've got it under clock right now

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.839 
but I've got it under clock right now
just<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:10.140> save<00:02:10.349> more<00:02:10.560> battery<00:02:10.860> life

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
just to save more battery life

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.149 
just to save more battery life
alright<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:12.930> go<00:02:13.079> ahead<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.950> should

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
alright you can go ahead and it should

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.949 
alright you can go ahead and it should
be<00:02:14.249> enable<00:02:14.640> when<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.879> install<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.359> and<00:02:15.599> that

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
be enable when you install it and that

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.739 
be enable when you install it and that
should<00:02:16.139> be<00:02:16.230> around<00:02:16.469> 2.7<00:02:17.129> something<00:02:17.749> alright

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:18.749 
should be around 2.7 something alright

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:20.720 
should be around 2.7 something alright
obviously<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.829> get<00:02:19.920> overclocking<00:02:20.549> if<00:02:20.639> you

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
obviously you get overclocking if you

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.030 
obviously you get overclocking if you
want<00:02:21.030> if<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.540> don't<00:02:21.719> have<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.109> I<00:02:22.139> didn't<00:02:22.889> see

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
want if you don't have to I didn't see

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.190 
want if you don't have to I didn't see
any<00:02:23.389> performance<00:02:24.389> improvements<00:02:24.989> with

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
any performance improvements with

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.690 
any performance improvements with
overclocking<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:25.950> that's<00:02:26.099> why<00:02:26.249> I<00:02:26.280> clocked<00:02:26.549> it

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
overclocking so that's why I clocked it

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.849 
overclocking so that's why I clocked it
down<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:27.060> little<00:02:27.749> bit<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.260> might<00:02:28.409> actually<00:02:28.530> run

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
down a little bit it might actually run

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.910 
down a little bit it might actually run
faster<00:02:29.310> without<00:02:29.430> overclocking<00:02:30.620> but<00:02:31.620> looking

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
faster without overclocking but looking

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.959 
faster without overclocking but looking
very<00:02:32.310> good<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.299> this<00:02:34.139> is<00:02:34.200> exactly<00:02:34.819> poured<00:02:35.819> it

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:35.969 
very good and this is exactly poured it

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.899 
very good and this is exactly poured it
off<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.150> galaxy<00:02:36.780> s6<00:02:37.139> so<00:02:38.099> you<00:02:38.159> get<00:02:38.400> pretty<00:02:38.790> much

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
off a galaxy s6 so you get pretty much

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.759 
off a galaxy s6 so you get pretty much
exactly<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.510> same<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.810> mean<00:02:40.079> there<00:02:40.260> are<00:02:40.469> some

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
exactly the same I mean there are some

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.179 
exactly the same I mean there are some
differences<00:02:41.249> like<00:02:41.489> Wi-Fi<00:02:42.090> says<00:02:42.450> while<00:02:42.919> W<00:02:43.919> land

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
differences like Wi-Fi says while W land

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.449 
differences like Wi-Fi says while W land
there<00:02:44.459> instead<00:02:45.590> but<00:02:46.590> most<00:02:46.829> of<00:02:46.919> the<00:02:47.040> menus<00:02:47.310> are

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
there instead but most of the menus are

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.890 
there instead but most of the menus are
actually<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:47.969> same<00:02:48.000> now<00:02:48.540> one<00:02:48.719> thing<00:02:48.840> that's

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
actually the same now one thing that's

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.149 
actually the same now one thing that's
missing<00:02:49.379> is<00:02:49.859> the<00:02:50.430> s6<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:51.329> fingerprints<00:02:52.159> that's

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
missing is the s6 of fingerprints that's

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.429 
missing is the s6 of fingerprints that's
because<00:02:53.669> it's<00:02:54.000> not<00:02:54.120> compatible<00:02:54.480> with<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.049> s5

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
because it's not compatible with the s5

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.349 
because it's not compatible with the s5
so<00:02:55.709> you'll<00:02:55.889> not<00:02:56.069> have<00:02:56.219> ability<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:57.000> use<00:02:57.209> your

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
so you'll not have ability to use your

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.809 
so you'll not have ability to use your
fingerprint<00:02:57.810> anymore<00:02:58.139> but<00:02:59.099> that's<00:02:59.400> kind<00:02:59.730> of

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
fingerprint anymore but that's kind of

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.869 
fingerprint anymore but that's kind of
sad<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.780> really<00:03:01.079> cool<00:03:01.379> part<00:03:01.650> about<00:03:01.709> this<00:03:02.159> I'll

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
sad but really cool part about this I'll

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.729 
sad but really cool part about this I'll
show<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.120> in<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.239> second<00:03:03.629> you<00:03:04.379> get<00:03:04.469> the<00:03:04.590> latest

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
show you in a second you get the latest

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.670 
show you in a second you get the latest

Android 502 lollipop all right or

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.990

they're<00:03:07.949> actually<00:03:08.069> running<00:03:08.489> both<00:03:08.730> Kay

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
they're actually running both Kay

they're actually running both Kay
Tweaker<00:03:09.359> I've<00:03:09.480> been<00:03:09.750> soaked<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:10.139> tweak<00:03:10.349> on<00:03:10.530> my

ethics here you can go ahead and open an

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.300 
ethics here you can go ahead and open an
app<00:03:16.199> and<00:03:16.579> make<00:03:17.579> it<00:03:17.729> small<00:03:18.169> there<00:03:19.169> we<00:03:19.259> go<00:03:19.439> there

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
app and make it small there we go there

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.339 
app and make it small there we go there
we<00:03:20.340> go<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.609> can<00:03:20.759> have<00:03:20.909> floating<00:03:21.389> windows<00:03:21.810> just

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
we go you can have floating windows just

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.240 
we go you can have floating windows just
like<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> galaxy<00:03:22.889> s6<00:03:23.370> ah<00:03:23.810> there<00:03:24.810> we<00:03:24.930> go<00:03:25.250> so

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
like a galaxy s6 ah there we go so

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.710 
like a galaxy s6 ah there we go so
that's<00:03:26.370> really<00:03:26.639> nice<00:03:26.849> that's<00:03:27.120> one<00:03:27.509> feature

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
that's really nice that's one feature

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.979 
that's really nice that's one feature
that's<00:03:28.079> missing<00:03:28.709> with<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:28.979> galaxy<00:03:29.430> s5<00:03:29.989> this

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
that's missing with the galaxy s5 this

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.629 
that's missing with the galaxy s5 this
is<00:03:31.139> awesome<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.680> can<00:03:31.859> go<00:03:31.979> ahead<00:03:32.159> and<00:03:32.280> open<00:03:32.370> up

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
is awesome you can go ahead and open up

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.469 
is awesome you can go ahead and open up
multiple<00:03:32.939> windows<00:03:33.599> if<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.900> want<00:03:35.209> hope<00:03:36.209> this

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
multiple windows if you want hope this

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.559 
multiple windows if you want hope this
one<00:03:36.659> doesn't<00:03:36.870> support<00:03:37.229> it<00:03:37.699> but<00:03:38.699> many<00:03:39.299> other

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
one doesn't support it but many other

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.890 
one doesn't support it but many other
apps<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.769> does<00:03:40.979> support<00:03:41.159> and<00:03:41.759> also<00:03:42.269> for<00:03:42.689> root

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900

do<00:03:43.079> you<00:03:43.139> have<00:03:43.290> supersu<00:03:44.120> alright<00:03:45.120> other<00:03:45.810> than

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
do you have supersu alright other than

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.559 
do you have supersu alright other than
that<00:03:46.319> everything<00:03:46.859> is<00:03:47.009> an<00:03:47.189> s6<00:03:47.639> app<00:03:47.909> it's<00:03:48.239> from

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
that everything is an s6 app it's from

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.780 
that everything is an s6 app it's from

everything<00:03:51.449> should<00:03:51.840> be<00:03:52.019> from<00:03:52.290> this<00:03:52.470> 6<00:03:52.739> so<00:03:53.430> you

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
everything should be from this 6 so you

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.429 
everything should be from this 6 so you

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
should have that full s6 experience

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.979 
should have that full s6 experience
without<00:03:55.799> upgrading<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.759> galaxy<00:03:57.239> s6<00:03:57.810> the

real galaxy s6 of course the only thing
you're<00:04:00.120> missing<00:04:00.389> is<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:03.019> fingerprint<00:04:04.019> sensor

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
you're missing is the fingerprint sensor

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.469 
you're missing is the fingerprint sensor
of<00:04:04.409> course<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.739> new<00:04:04.859> fingerprint<00:04:05.340> sensor<00:04:05.699> but

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
of course the new fingerprint sensor but
