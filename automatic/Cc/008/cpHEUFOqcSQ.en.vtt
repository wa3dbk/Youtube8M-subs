and tarrano new zealand I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:05.549> on<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.330> testing<00:00:07.109> table<00:00:07.529> the

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
demonstrate on a testing table the

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.200 
demonstrate on a testing table the
difference<00:00:08.040> between<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.580> two<00:00:08.760> types<00:00:09.059> of

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
difference between the two types of

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.680 
difference between the two types of
bowls<00:00:09.480> balanced<00:00:10.440> sole<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.070> unbalanced<00:00:11.700> salt

the<00:00:15.690> first<00:00:15.990> ball<00:00:16.260> going<00:00:16.470> down<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.920> table<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.430> a

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
the first ball going down the table is a

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.870 
the first ball going down the table is a
balance<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.029> roll<00:00:18.890> the<00:00:19.890> second<00:00:20.340> ball<00:00:20.520> going

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
balance of roll the second ball going

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:36.160 
balance of roll the second ball going
down<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.330> an<00:00:21.600> unbalanced

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.680 

as<00:00:36.739> you<00:00:36.950> can<00:00:37.070> see<00:00:37.340> both<00:00:37.700> of<00:00:37.730> these<00:00:38.030> models<00:00:38.510> of

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
as you can see both of these models of

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.560 
as you can see both of these models of
across<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.170> yellow<00:00:39.440> part<00:00:39.860> slide<00:00:40.220> and<00:00:40.570> appear

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
across the yellow part slide and appear

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.920 
across the yellow part slide and appear
to<00:00:41.600> have<00:00:41.899> exactly<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.500> same<00:00:42.559> box<00:00:46.660> this<00:00:47.660> time

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
to have exactly the same box this time

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.650 
to have exactly the same box this time
I'm<00:00:48.110> going<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.440> subject<00:00:48.980> both<00:00:49.190> balls<00:00:49.579> to<00:00:50.480> what

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
I'm going to subject both balls to what

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.110 
I'm going to subject both balls to what
we<00:00:50.809> call<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.140> level<00:00:51.500> or<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:51.829> contest<00:00:52.370> this

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
we call the level or the contest this

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.970 
we call the level or the contest this
was<00:00:53.330> the<00:00:53.510> test<00:00:53.720> that<00:00:53.960> we<00:00:54.110> used<00:00:54.350> to<00:00:54.500> do<00:00:54.650> about<00:00:54.949> a

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
was the test that we used to do about a

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.150 
was the test that we used to do about a
decade<00:00:55.400> ago<00:00:55.460> but<00:00:56.360> we<00:00:56.540> no<00:00:56.750> longer<00:00:56.780> do<00:00:57.350> due<00:00:58.010> to

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
decade ago but we no longer do due to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.119 
decade ago but we no longer do due to
the<00:00:58.250> decision<00:00:58.760> taken<00:00:58.940> by<00:00:59.150> the<00:00:59.329> administration

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
the decision taken by the administration

the decision taken by the administration
here<00:01:01.129> is<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.400> first<00:01:01.610> model<00:01:01.940> again<00:01:02.239> I've<00:01:02.480> done

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
here is the first model again I've done

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.219 
here is the first model again I've done
on<00:01:02.839> soil<00:01:03.110> ball<00:01:03.430> now<00:01:04.430> wobbled<00:01:05.030> at<00:01:05.600> an<00:01:05.780> angle<00:01:06.110> of

seven degrees here is the second bowl as
you<00:01:16.280> can<00:01:16.460> see<00:01:16.670> these<00:01:16.880> two<00:01:17.149> balls<00:01:17.420> now<00:01:17.780> display

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
you can see these two balls now display

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.090 
you can see these two balls now display
completely<00:01:18.920> different<00:01:19.280> bias

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.830 

and<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.939> show<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:29.330> there<00:01:30.330> are<00:01:30.360> many

and just show you that there are many

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.380 
and just show you that there are many
things<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.979> unbalanced<00:01:32.610> soil<00:01:32.909> ball

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
things on the unbalanced soil ball

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.520 
things on the unbalanced soil ball
I<00:01:33.420> will<00:01:33.689> put<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.930> third<00:01:34.170> bulb<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:35.690> this<00:01:36.690> also<00:01:37.080> is

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
I will put a third bulb in this also is

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:47.080 
I will put a third bulb in this also is
an<00:01:37.710> unbalanced<00:01:38.250> old

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.970 

in<00:01:48.090> fact<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.630> ball<00:01:49.820> is<00:01:50.820> actually<00:01:51.120> showing<00:01:51.690> up

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
in fact this ball is actually showing up

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.910 
in fact this ball is actually showing up
under<00:01:52.980> this<00:01:53.190> upright<00:01:53.820> test<00:01:54.260> to<00:01:55.260> actually<00:01:55.680> have

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
under this upright test to actually have

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.600 
under this upright test to actually have
more<00:01:56.220> buyers<00:01:56.520> than<00:01:56.760> either<00:01:57.660> of<00:01:57.960> these<00:01:58.140> two

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
more buyers than either of these two

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.100 
more buyers than either of these two
I'll<00:01:59.610> put<00:01:59.940> this<00:02:00.120> here<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.870> show<00:02:00.900> you

where it me now I walk this bowl with
the<00:02:06.090> same<00:02:06.420> can't<00:02:06.780> test<00:02:16.910> as<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:17.970> can<00:02:18.360> see<00:02:18.570> this

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
the same can't test as you can see this

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.900 
the same can't test as you can see this
bowl<00:02:19.050> has<00:02:19.290> gone<00:02:19.440> dramatically<00:02:19.920> straight<00:02:20.310> it's
