00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.009
 the stock exchange square was transformed on Wednesday 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.960
 to wind farm in Amsterdam 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.550
 square are temporarily a thousand modems 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.440
 posted by eneco 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.490
 well just come cycling and i see already 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.320
 those men are standing 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.960
 looks very cool wow I find one 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.420
 nice action actually people have to 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.740
 becoming more aware of the fact that 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.289
 different options are available 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.970
 to generate energy and because of this 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.490
 way to do and everyone to me 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.920
 involve that is yes i like one 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.840
 action is fantastic I just think 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.399
 nice it is nice 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.260
 nice way to do it the more 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.360
 to be aware of it I think it is 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.120
 important of course with all 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.170
 fossil fuels are running out 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.579
 given moment must really be that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.680
 transfer to 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.940
 so i think a great importance is that 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.289
 everyone is aware of what the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.399
 possibilities therein are the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.410
 energy company a lot with it 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.239
 wind farm encourage people to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.460
 investing in renewable energy 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.320
 the company tries to cross that threshold 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.760
 make customers as low as possible 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.559
 we want as many people as possible 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.690
 participating in renewable energy is possible 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.039
 for example by purchasing sustainably 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.719
 that can be done by solar panels, for example 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.670
 but that is not possible now too 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.659
 by investing in in 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.189
 windmills 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.530
 you can with hollandsewind certificates 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.460
 very accessible participation in 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.650
 wind 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.270
 you can board from 25 euros 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.259
 total you can buy the 100 want 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.670
 leave as many people as possible 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.810
 benefit from it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.400
 and that can be customers but we 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.840
 we also can't be customers 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.890
 stock market square is what gives me the financial 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.360
 heart of the Netherlands 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.979
 then very suitable for a 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.229
 financial product here too 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.970
 Introducing see the energy supplier 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.369
 the introduction of the Hollandsewind 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.960
 certificates as a nice first step 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.280
 to introduce the whole of the Netherlands 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.930
 with wind energy 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.119
 so people can participate via our site 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.350
 eneco point en slash wind certificate and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.030
 people can actually read everything there 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.810
 about the wind certificate 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.729
 and the nice thing about it is that 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.600
 interest rate at least two and half 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.799
 percent 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.020
 and depending on the wind force can 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.259
 up to 300 percent yes sure or 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.790
 I take a good action as the return 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.729
 somewhat good is the nice alternative 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.380
 put it in your bank account for money 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.810
 the proceeds from the certificates 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.390
 in eco in new wind energy projects 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.250
 investing they wanted an energy supplier 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.250
 build more sustainable energy
