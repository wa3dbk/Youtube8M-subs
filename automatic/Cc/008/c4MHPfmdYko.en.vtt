hey everybody its LAN Simon and I'm here

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.749 
hey everybody its LAN Simon and I'm here
with<00:00:10.790> the<00:00:10.940> tascam<00:00:11.570> 2x<00:00:12.380> TM<00:00:12.920> 2<00:00:13.190> X<00:00:13.400> this<00:00:13.580> is<00:00:13.730> a

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
with the tascam 2x TM 2 X this is a

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.940 
with the tascam 2x TM 2 X this is a
little<00:00:14.570> microphone<00:00:14.870> external<00:00:15.500> microphone

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
little microphone external microphone

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.740 
little microphone external microphone
that<00:00:16.129> you<00:00:16.160> can<00:00:16.369> use<00:00:16.550> with<00:00:16.789> your<00:00:16.820> digital<00:00:17.420> SLR

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
that you can use with your digital SLR

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.870 
that you can use with your digital SLR
and<00:00:18.230> presumably<00:00:18.800> your<00:00:18.980> video<00:00:19.250> camera<00:00:19.580> now

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
and presumably your video camera now

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.550 
and presumably your video camera now
before<00:00:20.210> you<00:00:20.300> even<00:00:20.510> take<00:00:20.779> the<00:00:20.900> plunge<00:00:21.170> you<00:00:21.320> want

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
before you even take the plunge you want

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.990 
before you even take the plunge you want
to<00:00:21.619> make<00:00:21.740> sure<00:00:21.859> that<00:00:22.010> your<00:00:22.130> camera<00:00:22.460> does<00:00:22.760> have

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
to make sure that your camera does have

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.300 
to make sure that your camera does have
an<00:00:23.269> audio<00:00:23.930> input<00:00:24.199> on<00:00:24.590> it<00:00:24.619> I<00:00:24.800> might<00:00:24.920> get<00:00:25.070> input

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
an audio input on it I might get input

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.009 
an audio input on it I might get input
on<00:00:25.430> it<00:00:25.460> a<00:00:25.609> lot<00:00:25.789> of<00:00:25.910> cameras<00:00:26.300> don't<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:26.840> you<00:00:26.929> may

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
on it a lot of cameras don't so you may

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.509 
on it a lot of cameras don't so you may
want<00:00:27.170> to<00:00:27.199> this<00:00:27.289> double<00:00:27.890> check<00:00:28.070> and<00:00:28.220> make<00:00:28.279> sure

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
want to this double check and make sure

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.220 
want to this double check and make sure
that<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:29.269> can<00:00:29.390> support<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:29.869> little<00:00:30.080> eighth

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
that you can support the little eighth

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.779 
that you can support the little eighth
inch<00:00:30.439> adapter<00:00:30.920> here<00:00:31.130> because<00:00:31.400> if<00:00:31.519> you<00:00:31.550> don't

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
inch adapter here because if you don't

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.610 
inch adapter here because if you don't
have<00:00:31.970> that<00:00:32.240> you're<00:00:32.930> not<00:00:33.050> going<00:00:33.170> to<00:00:33.230> have<00:00:33.380> much

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
have that you're not going to have much

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.330 
have that you're not going to have much
use<00:00:33.650> for<00:00:33.860> this

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
use for this

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.850 
use for this
basically<00:00:35.090> it's<00:00:35.270> a<00:00:35.390> 2<00:00:35.720> cardioid<00:00:36.350> microphone

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
basically it's a 2 cardioid microphone

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.920 
basically it's a 2 cardioid microphone
device<00:00:37.310> here<00:00:37.670> so<00:00:37.880> the<00:00:38.420> microphone<00:00:38.750> is<00:00:38.870> very

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
device here so the microphone is very

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.780 
device here so the microphone is very
directional<00:00:39.470> so<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.220> does<00:00:40.430> allow<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:40.700> to

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
directional so it does allow you to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.490 
directional so it does allow you to
rotate<00:00:41.180> it<00:00:41.330> up<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:41.630> down<00:00:41.780> so<00:00:41.840> you<00:00:42.050> can<00:00:42.200> get<00:00:42.350> the

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
rotate it up and down so you can get the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.500 
rotate it up and down so you can get the
best<00:00:42.680> angle<00:00:43.400> for<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:43.790> sound<00:00:44.030> it<00:00:44.240> likes<00:00:44.390> to

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
best angle for the sound it likes to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.350 
best angle for the sound it likes to
pick<00:00:45.290> up<00:00:45.440> pretty<00:00:45.650> much<00:00:45.800> dead<00:00:46.070> on<00:00:46.250> so<00:00:46.700> you'll

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
pick up pretty much dead on so you'll

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.820 
pick up pretty much dead on so you'll
want<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:47.540> be<00:00:47.660> aware<00:00:47.690> of<00:00:48.020> that<00:00:48.290> when<00:00:48.560> you<00:00:48.650> get

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
want to be aware of that when you get

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.830 
want to be aware of that when you get
going<00:00:49.040> there<00:00:49.640> are<00:00:49.730> two<00:00:49.910> switches<00:00:50.360> on<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.600> side

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
going there are two switches on the side

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.960 
going there are two switches on the side
there's<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.430> sensitivity<00:00:52.430> switch<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:52.910> this

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
there's a sensitivity switch and this

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.910 
there's a sensitivity switch and this
basically<00:00:53.390> does<00:00:53.570> lowers<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.140> volume<00:00:54.590> that<00:00:54.620> it

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
basically does lowers the volume that it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.070 
basically does lowers the volume that it
picks<00:00:55.160> up<00:00:55.400> so<00:00:56.120> I<00:00:56.150> have<00:00:56.300> it<00:00:56.390> set<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.660> high<00:00:56.840> right

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
picks up so I have it set the high right

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.810 
picks up so I have it set the high right
now<00:00:57.110> but<00:00:57.470> if<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:57.620> go<00:00:57.740> too<00:00:57.800> low<00:00:58.070> it'll<00:00:58.700> be<00:00:58.790> a

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
now but if you go too low it'll be a

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.340 
now but if you go too low it'll be a
little<00:00:59.030> bit<00:00:59.150> more<00:00:59.270> forgiving<00:00:59.870> especially<00:01:00.260> if

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
little bit more forgiving especially if

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.650 
little bit more forgiving especially if
you're<00:01:00.440> in<00:01:00.560> a<00:01:00.620> loud<00:01:00.800> environment<00:01:01.270> it<00:01:02.270> also<00:01:02.360> has

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
you're in a loud environment it also has

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.380 
you're in a loud environment it also has
a<00:01:02.800> low-cut<00:01:03.800> filter<00:01:03.860> here<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:04.820> right<00:01:05.030> now<00:01:05.180> it's

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
a low-cut filter here so right now it's

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.780 
a low-cut filter here so right now it's
set<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:05.600> flat<00:01:05.960> but<00:01:06.620> if<00:01:06.710> you<00:01:06.800> go<00:01:06.950> too<00:01:07.010> low<00:01:07.280> cut<00:01:07.520> it

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
set to flat but if you go too low cut it

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.620 
set to flat but if you go too low cut it
will<00:01:07.970> prevent<00:01:08.870> you<00:01:09.260> know<00:01:09.470> kind<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:09.800> buzzes<00:01:10.220> and

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
will prevent you know kind of buzzes and

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.570 
will prevent you know kind of buzzes and
hums<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.960> low<00:01:12.410> frequency<00:01:12.890> sound<00:01:13.160> from<00:01:13.370> being

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
hums and low frequency sound from being

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.680 
hums and low frequency sound from being
picked<00:01:13.760> up<00:01:13.850> on<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.060> microphone<00:01:14.510> but

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
picked up on the microphone but

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.750 
picked up on the microphone but
generally<00:01:15.050> you'll<00:01:15.770> want<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:15.980> leave<00:01:16.130> it<00:01:16.280> there

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
generally you'll want to leave it there

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.670 
generally you'll want to leave it there
it<00:01:17.180> also<00:01:17.330> has<00:01:17.540> kind<00:01:17.600> of<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.840> shock<00:01:18.080> mount<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:18.530> it

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
it also has kind of a shock mount to it

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.800 
it also has kind of a shock mount to it
as<00:01:18.770> well<00:01:18.980> so<00:01:19.010> it<00:01:19.310> doesn't<00:01:19.490> doesn't<00:01:20.450> pick<00:01:20.600> up<00:01:20.630> a

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
as well so it doesn't doesn't pick up a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.090 
as well so it doesn't doesn't pick up a
lot<00:01:20.930> of<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.110> sounds<00:01:21.500> like<00:01:21.650> you<00:01:21.830> know<00:01:21.920> getting

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
lot of the sounds like you know getting

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.770 
lot of the sounds like you know getting
bumped<00:01:22.430> around<00:01:22.670> might<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.150> it's<00:01:23.330> got<00:01:23.480> some

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
bumped around might so it's got some

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.540 
bumped around might so it's got some
limits<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.410> it<00:01:24.650> but<00:01:24.830> it's<00:01:24.980> you<00:01:25.310> know<00:01:25.340> from

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
limits to it but it's you know from

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.820 
limits to it but it's you know from
walking<00:01:26.000> around<00:01:26.300> and<00:01:26.570> that<00:01:26.660> sort<00:01:26.900> of<00:01:26.960> thing<00:01:27.200> it

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
walking around and that sort of thing it

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.290 
walking around and that sort of thing it
should<00:01:28.040> remain<00:01:28.340> pretty<00:01:28.670> quiet<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.150> won't

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
should remain pretty quiet you won't

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.880 
should remain pretty quiet you won't
hear<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.720> bumps<00:01:30.230> along<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.500> way

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
hear the bumps along the way

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.620 
hear the bumps along the way
it<00:01:31.220> also<00:01:31.400> has<00:01:31.640> for<00:01:31.909> your<00:01:32.000> camera<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.480> little

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
it also has for your camera a little

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.720 
it also has for your camera a little
mounting<00:01:33.110> bracket<00:01:33.470> here<00:01:33.680> to<00:01:33.920> get<00:01:34.610> the

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
mounting bracket here to get the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.030 
mounting bracket here to get the
microphone<00:01:35.180> far<00:01:35.450> away<00:01:35.810> from<00:01:35.870> the<00:01:36.350> camera<00:01:36.770> lens

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
microphone far away from the camera lens

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.340 
microphone far away from the camera lens
because<00:01:37.520> these<00:01:38.180> lenses<00:01:38.570> make<00:01:38.750> a<00:01:38.780> lot<00:01:39.020> of<00:01:39.050> noise

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
because these lenses make a lot of noise

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.680 
because these lenses make a lot of noise
I<00:01:39.530> know<00:01:39.590> on<00:01:39.770> my<00:01:39.920> Nikon<00:01:40.370> when<00:01:41.030> I'm<00:01:41.120> out<00:01:41.240> shooting

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
I know on my Nikon when I'm out shooting

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.330 
I know on my Nikon when I'm out shooting
just<00:01:42.170> using<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.470> internal<00:01:42.860> microphone<00:01:43.010> on

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
just using the internal microphone on

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.740 
just using the internal microphone on
the<00:01:43.370> camera<00:01:43.790> you'll<00:01:43.940> hear<00:01:44.360> that<00:01:44.540> lens

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
the camera you'll hear that lens

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.660 
the camera you'll hear that lens
movement<00:01:45.200> quite<00:01:45.350> a<00:01:45.409> bit<00:01:45.680> and<00:01:45.890> I<00:01:46.100> did<00:01:46.310> find<00:01:46.550> that

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
movement quite a bit and I did find that

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.340 
movement quite a bit and I did find that
this<00:01:46.880> does<00:01:47.270> make<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.540> difference<00:01:48.050> it's<00:01:48.200> not<00:01:48.320> a

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
this does make a difference it's not a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.960 
this does make a difference it's not a
you<00:01:48.920> know<00:01:48.979> it's<00:01:49.100> not<00:01:49.190> completely<00:01:49.700> silent

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
you know it's not completely silent

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.399 
you know it's not completely silent
unless<00:01:50.390> you<00:01:50.540> know<00:01:50.630> I'm<00:01:50.720> still<00:01:50.990> hearing<00:01:51.290> this

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
unless you know I'm still hearing this

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.350 
unless you know I'm still hearing this
lens<00:01:51.680> making<00:01:52.070> noise<00:01:52.250> but<00:01:52.580> it<00:01:53.210> is

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
lens making noise but it is

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.240 
lens making noise but it is
significantly<00:01:53.990> reduced<00:01:54.200> depending<00:01:55.130> on<00:01:55.190> the

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
significantly reduced depending on the

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.980 
significantly reduced depending on the
lens<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:55.520> have<00:01:55.640> you'll<00:01:56.630> have<00:01:56.690> different

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
lens you have you'll have different

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.350 
lens you have you'll have different
degrees<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.760> satisfaction<00:01:58.760> with<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.330> I

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
degrees of satisfaction with that I

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.210 
degrees of satisfaction with that I
suppose<00:01:59.810> so<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.320> big<00:02:00.440> question<00:02:00.560> is<00:02:00.920> how<00:02:01.100> does

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
suppose so the big question is how does

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.219 
suppose so the big question is how does
the<00:02:01.340> microphone<00:02:01.760> sound<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.330> actually<00:02:02.780> as<00:02:03.020> you

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
the microphone sound and actually as you

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.080 
the microphone sound and actually as you
can<00:02:03.260> hear<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.560> turned<00:02:03.920> off<00:02:04.100> my<00:02:04.130> lavell<00:02:04.640> ear<00:02:04.790> and

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
can hear I turned off my lavell ear and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.570 
can hear I turned off my lavell ear and
we're<00:02:05.540> just<00:02:05.840> using<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.830> tascam<00:02:07.250> right<00:02:07.460> now

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
we're just using the tascam right now

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.340 
we're just using the tascam right now
it's<00:02:07.880> going<00:02:08.270> through<00:02:08.390> my<00:02:08.569> Nikon<00:02:08.990> this<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.259> an

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
it's going through my Nikon this is an

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.380 
it's going through my Nikon this is an
unpowered<00:02:09.740> microphone<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:10.610> sounds<00:02:11.090> really

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
unpowered microphone it sounds really

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.360 
unpowered microphone it sounds really
good<00:02:11.600> I'm<00:02:11.750> actually<00:02:11.900> really<00:02:12.800> impressed<00:02:12.980> with

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
good I'm actually really impressed with

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.700 
good I'm actually really impressed with
the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.710 
the
of<00:02:13.980> audio<00:02:14.280> that's<00:02:14.490> coming<00:02:14.820> out<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.240> you'll

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
of audio that's coming out of it you'll

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.270 
of audio that's coming out of it you'll
see<00:02:15.870> though<00:02:16.050> as<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.200> turn<00:02:16.500> up<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.830> microphones

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
see though as I turn up the microphones

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.740 
see though as I turn up the microphones
move<00:02:17.460> them<00:02:17.610> away<00:02:17.790> from<00:02:17.940> my<00:02:18.090> face<00:02:18.300> here

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
move them away from my face here

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.900 
move them away from my face here
the<00:02:19.200> pickup<00:02:19.710> goes<00:02:19.890> down<00:02:20.130> because<00:02:20.340> it's<00:02:20.670> very

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
the pickup goes down because it's very

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.700 
the pickup goes down because it's very
directional<00:02:21.300> he's<00:02:21.570> our<00:02:21.690> cardioid<00:02:22.200> microphone

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
directional he's our cardioid microphone

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.710 
directional he's our cardioid microphone
so<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.400> pickup<00:02:23.700> pattern<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.150> usually<00:02:24.300> right

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
so the pickup pattern is usually right

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.750 
so the pickup pattern is usually right
in<00:02:24.840> front<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.170> them<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:26.130> want<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.400> be<00:02:26.490> aware

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
in front of them so you want to be aware

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.190 
in front of them so you want to be aware
of<00:02:26.820> that<00:02:27.060> when<00:02:27.120> you're<00:02:27.420> recording<00:02:27.720> with<00:02:28.050> it

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
of that when you're recording with it

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.960 
of that when you're recording with it
the<00:02:28.590> same<00:02:28.800> can<00:02:28.980> be<00:02:29.010> said<00:02:29.100> if<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.490> point<00:02:29.790> the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
the same can be said if I point the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.300 
the same can be said if I point the
microphones<00:02:30.480> away<00:02:30.810> from<00:02:31.050> me<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.800> picks<00:02:32.100> up<00:02:32.190> a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
microphones away from me it picks up a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.610 
microphones away from me it picks up a
little<00:02:32.400> bit<00:02:32.640> behind<00:02:32.760> me<00:02:33.030> but<00:02:33.180> not<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.390> lot<00:02:33.750> so<00:02:34.050> it

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
little bit behind me but not a lot so it

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.800 
little bit behind me but not a lot so it
is<00:02:34.710> a<00:02:34.740> bit<00:02:35.010> directional<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.700> how<00:02:35.820> it<00:02:36.000> wants<00:02:36.570> to

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
is a bit directional and how it wants to

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.660 
is a bit directional and how it wants to
get<00:02:36.960> its<00:02:37.080> audio<00:02:37.380> but<00:02:37.560> I've<00:02:37.680> not<00:02:37.920> had<00:02:38.130> good<00:02:38.460> luck

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
get its audio but I've not had good luck

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.280 
get its audio but I've not had good luck
with<00:02:38.730> these<00:02:38.970> plug-in<00:02:39.420> microphones<00:02:39.900> before

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
with these plug-in microphones before

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.200 
with these plug-in microphones before
the<00:02:40.770> sound<00:02:40.980> quality<00:02:41.370> on<00:02:41.460> this<00:02:41.610> one<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:41.970> really

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
the sound quality on this one is really

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.540 
the sound quality on this one is really
good<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.690> me<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:42.840> mean<00:02:43.050> this<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.350> this<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:43.980> decent

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
good to me I mean this is this is decent

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.120 
good to me I mean this is this is decent
and<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:45.210> have<00:02:45.480> not<00:02:46.230> say<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.560> same<00:02:46.740> thing<00:02:46.950> about

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
and I have not say the same thing about

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.680 
and I have not say the same thing about
a<00:02:47.190> lot<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.430> other<00:02:47.580> microphones<00:02:48.210> I've<00:02:48.390> tried

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
a lot of other microphones I've tried

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.200 
a lot of other microphones I've tried
out<00:02:48.720> over<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.200> years<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.520> little<00:02:50.760> shock

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
out over the years the the little shock

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.030 
out over the years the the little shock
mount<00:02:51.480> also<00:02:52.140> does<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.350> pretty<00:02:52.500> nice<00:02:52.680> job<00:02:52.890> I'm

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
mount also does a pretty nice job I'm

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.290 
mount also does a pretty nice job I'm
shaking<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.460> right<00:02:53.580> now<00:02:53.700> I'm<00:02:53.850> not<00:02:53.940> hearing<00:02:54.270> too

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
shaking it right now I'm not hearing too

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.660 
shaking it right now I'm not hearing too
much<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:55.500> know<00:02:55.620> jostling<00:02:56.160> there<00:02:56.340> as<00:02:56.460> well<00:02:56.640> so

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
much you know jostling there as well so

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.520 
much you know jostling there as well so
overall<00:02:57.390> it's<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.810> really<00:02:57.840> nicely<00:02:58.290> designed

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
overall it's a really nicely designed

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.740 
overall it's a really nicely designed
little<00:02:59.010> microphone<00:02:59.430> it's<00:02:59.580> rather<00:03:00.000> pricey<00:03:00.360> so

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
little microphone it's rather pricey so

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.780 
little microphone it's rather pricey so
you<00:03:00.810> know<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:01.140> should<00:03:01.320> probably<00:03:01.680> perform<00:03:02.160> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
you know it should probably perform the

what they call it in the business which

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.050 
what they call it in the business which
will<00:03:10.290> muffle<00:03:10.530> sounds<00:03:11.040> out<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.430> wind<00:03:11.670> as<00:03:11.880> well
