00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.220
 all people here are again a report 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 Today is new information again 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.150
 to the zombie mode of black ops 3 and 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.099
 though, because I'm in this video again 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.660
 Exactly to the comic con 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.430
 Reform is two weeks old 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.470
 and there he became, among others, the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.420
 Two trailer of wine and shadows on 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.039
 eternal time and then, too 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.990
 even the collector's edition so the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.180
 digital deluxe edition then the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.260
 tradition and the edition have that 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.580
 I have also been in one 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.199
 video would be mentioned again 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.550
 want to watch can do so now in 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.899
 video I linked this and 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.579
 of course in the description for 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.260
 the smartphone user and as I said there 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.820
 want all these things presented 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.190
 and, among other things, there were also there 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.040
 a cool that is question answer 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.379
 the audience there or the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.329
 people in this room was the people 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.250
 Ask on the stage 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.410
 syndicate was the host 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.059
 and then Jason Blundell the leader 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.440
 of the story mode death and then the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.059
 whole actor now at the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.890
 Map shadows of evil join in 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.870
 they were there too and we have them 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.039
 There a few questions answered and the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.480
 were actually pretty interesting 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.920
 this today I wanted my this 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.840
 watch the video and just have a look 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.820
 go through with you first there was 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.979
 the question if it was a jux to remake in 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.869
 black ops will be and so will you 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.540
 just answered we have to wait 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.460
 and continue watching so it was quite nei 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.840
 that again is not really 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.490
 the departure as well as there was not 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.130
 already a few pictures and so hinweise 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.470
 on another remake in white 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.990
 I do not think it's a remake 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.400
 in zombie mode will give because that gave 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.930
 It looks to the white and I believe 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.610
 not that it is repeated in black 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.470
 ops three but that we then the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.640
 young party multiplayer will be because 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.380
 that's already meanwhile 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.100
 had been stood there were already black ops 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.450
 1 and then there was a plus 20 22 25 and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.159
 maybe it will be in the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.670
 multiplayer again a newtown map 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.710
 give 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.630
 Further, it was then planned by Jason 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.850
 nor the development system in the league 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.560
 and shadows of evil that is mentioned in 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.810
 every game and every player can through 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.130
 Sounds different somehow that sounds like 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.380
 I have my last videos over 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.880
 shadows of evil also already told and 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.140
 I guess the whole somehow 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.180
 it means that maybe every one 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.070
 something new can find or 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.750
 I do not think that's just from the 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.700
 Build up changes like for example 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.590
 with harry potter kicking that would be 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.060
 knows is just so casually said 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.500
 but that maybe different 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.090
 paths give the map too late 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.860
 with different easter eggs maybe 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.450
 also different two easter eggs like 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.400
 at black ops 2 as I would be stupid and 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.410
 max there was such a threat as different 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.240
 easter eggs and maybe that's it 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.500
 meant further was then also 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.270
 mention the black ops three 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.280
 storyline with the original zombie 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.050
 history is connected and I think 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.400
 times that will thus seem meant 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.260
 because it seems he is pretty 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.450
 to the original black ops 10 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.250
 involved that means the whole finds 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.620
 her short night in the dispute of the two 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.900
 Doctors city ​​so after dr max it 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.670
 was teleported away from dr richthofen 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.290
 there it goes then also in with 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.030
 this cat in that one there has it all 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.980
 already noticed and I guess 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.630
 that is the whole thing and the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.850
 next question which was then asked 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.739
 is then a question which the pc mods and 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.690
 the custom maps petric like for example 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.970
 I already have custom zombies 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.220
 often played with another 22 or 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.630
 at effectively and yes there was just times 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.950
 asked if it was something like that 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.959
 maybe the look in the country will give 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.790
 and this question became very simple 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.739
 maybe just answered maybe 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.239
 We did that later so it was there again 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.040
 not really said no it was too 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.510
 not said yes but I mean it is 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.670
 pretty interesting that there is not 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.350
 No, I said mine directly 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.570
 next advantage or yes already 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.100
 said that it will give despite and 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.420
 maybe it will be black too 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.769
 ops ramos I was pretty 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.720
 find interesting and also pretty 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.489
 cool find if it then suddenly in 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.720
 Black ops three different zombie mods 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.519
 would definitely give 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.320
 be pretty cool and I will 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.880
 finally a change that is needed 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.620
 because it was pretty much synonymous of 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.420
 the community finally called that 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.580
 koller studio or activision mods 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.720
 Baum is in call of duty and I think so 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.340
 that will be the community too 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.930
 somehow you just rejoice that you yourself 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.640
 can create any things there 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.690
 as is the case with all call of 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.010
 Duty part was the case 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.660
 then next again 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.430
 chase and blundell water wen and he has 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.170
 never say never for market three 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.209
 weapons I do not know exactly how he does 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.739
 I meant the whole thing because I have you 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.760
 ever heard of a song by 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.140
 long sensation 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.970
 he meant that maybe 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.470
 now twice becker panic gives that 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.510
 is the first time peter industries 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.860
 that everyone had known in black ops 2 was 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.750
 it also so that we have some weapons 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.130
 So the new weapons also several times 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.570
 you could just mess around with it 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.130
 got different towers 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.720
 can and i already have a caste 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.450
 Mikado played where you just go directly 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.100
 all the weapons two Japanese could and 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.539
 maybe that's what it means 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.900
 could also just meant it 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.130
 his 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.790
 maybe directly 3 dennis kpn black ops 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.590
 12 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.870
 and maybe there is now 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.370
 here directly 3 and I could me 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.830
 actually pretty well imagine that 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.180
 there could be a ray 3 for me 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.380
 we should let her open this now 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.970
 once not continue 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.310
 then it was also asked if it was 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.440
 will be other remakes such example is 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.090
 seems to have been great, but there 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.040
 Ladder track said it is actually 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.890
 not in planning the further remakes in the 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.930
 black ops three come for the time being 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.160
 only ticket planned and that should 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.930
 actually probably like that 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.370
 I have also read a lot 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.050
 when a subscriber that it is 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.580
 somehow thought so if now 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.590
 introduces remake will come 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.060
 probably other remakes with it 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.320
 but I continue this storyline 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.510
 have ever mentioned that mine 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.100
 Theory only then is that also becomes one 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.990
 where the origin of the story was 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.450
 just the time is changed or 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.980
 the future is changed and that was 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.360
 maybe not on jungle now 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.310
 come next or on other cards 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.660
 next is that but now 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.340
 because the story is also ended 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.290
 that you land on other cards now 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.060
 I imagine that he is before then 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.530
 you already changed the future then 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.690
 probably also the cards or 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.460
 the journey in the cards somehow 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.200
 changed and last was then still 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.300
 Asked if there are any 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.160
 give information on origins end 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.960
 so the track will be there somehow 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.600
 what exactly took place there or 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.760
 any explanation out there but skin because 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.930
 just this question was denied 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.560
 that somehow they have nothing to do there 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.630
 say 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.400
 I think someday will someday 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.830
 track time somehow be a book on 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.930
 or just tell everything exactly how 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.670
 which is supposed to expire but I guess 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.170
 we are still far away from this 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.940
 had unfortunately is far from over yet 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.740
 if only now the future 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.720
 is changed and I look forward to it 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.340
 just a black ops 3 yes that was it 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.420
 Now for the first time to the comic-con me 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.980
 think now is slowly the 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.290
 comic-con ticked off and I have everything 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.910
 what I wanted to report about it now 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.320
 brought out I guess I have 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.180
 still a few videos in the near future in 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.860
 petto but there I have to look when 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.240
 I knock it out and I have it 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.160
 actually also my abo special in 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.840
 petto look na times when all 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.620
