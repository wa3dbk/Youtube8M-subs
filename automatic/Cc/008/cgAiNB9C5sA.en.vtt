it's a it means a lot of things but I'm

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.260 
it's a it means a lot of things but I'm
going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.019> put<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:05.159> word<00:01:05.460> it's

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
going to put it in one word it's

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.789

probably<00:01:06.630> going<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.840> difficult<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.619> is

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
probably going to be difficult but it is

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.350 
probably going to be difficult but it is
a<00:01:07.830> celebration<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.760> poetry<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:11.360> it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and for the pianist it's such a pleasure

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.679 
and for the pianist it's such a pleasure
because<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.810> lies<00:01:16.020> well<00:01:16.320> under<00:01:16.890> your<00:01:16.920> hands

difficult to just say it in few words it
because<00:02:55.650> it's<00:02:56.000> challenges<00:02:57.170> basically<00:02:58.170> every

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
because it's challenges basically every

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.200 
because it's challenges basically every
aspect<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.280> the<00:03:00.530> peon<00:03:01.530> ISM<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.550> technique

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
aspect of the peon ISM and the technique

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.160 
aspect of the peon ISM and the technique
that<00:03:03.690> has<00:03:04.020> to<00:03:04.200> go<00:03:04.350> with<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:06.030> probably<00:03:06.630> the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
that has to go with it and probably the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.730 
that has to go with it and probably the
most<00:03:07.860> difficult<00:03:08.070> part<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:09.450> once<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:10.170> mastered

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
most difficult part is once you mastered

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.660 
most difficult part is once you mastered
all<00:03:11.070> that<00:03:11.280> technical<00:03:12.620> challenges<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.920> then

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
all that technical challenges and then

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.790 
all that technical challenges and then
to<00:03:15.090> sit<00:03:15.330> down<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.810> express<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:17.010> freedom<00:03:17.690> free

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
to sit down and express the freedom free

know and everything it's in stages first

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.150 
know and everything it's in stages first
I<00:03:42.750> suppose<00:03:43.080> must<00:03:43.560> drink<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.430> technical

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
I suppose must drink the technical

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.380 
I suppose must drink the technical
difficulties<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.190> challenges<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:48.180> then

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
difficulties and challenges and then

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.630 
difficulties and challenges and then
express<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.110> freely<00:03:49.680> at<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.070> keyboard<00:03:50.520> so

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.420
