00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
what's up guys this is schism we are

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.619 
what's up guys this is schism we are
back<00:00:02.370> with<00:00:02.580> another<00:00:02.610> building<00:00:03.300> tutorial

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
back with another building tutorial

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.900 
back with another building tutorial
let's<00:00:04.470> get<00:00:04.680> into<00:00:05.040> it

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
let's get into it

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.220 
let's get into it
last<00:00:06.330> episode<00:00:06.540> we<00:00:06.810> talked<00:00:07.020> about<00:00:07.109> arcs<00:00:07.620> and

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
last episode we talked about arcs and

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.450 
last episode we talked about arcs and
you<00:00:10.230> know<00:00:10.349> anytime<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.740> want<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.040> build<00:00:11.219> some

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
you know anytime you want to build some

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.060 
you know anytime you want to build some
sort<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.730> sloped<00:00:12.179> shape<00:00:13.040> in<00:00:14.059> Minecraft

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
sort of sloped shape in Minecraft

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.990 
sort of sloped shape in Minecraft
anytime<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.190> want<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.369> have<00:00:17.490> some<00:00:17.699> sort<00:00:17.880> of

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
anytime you want to have some sort of

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.760 
anytime you want to have some sort of
you<00:00:18.150> know<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.449> curvature<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> wall<00:00:19.740> or

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
you know like curvature to a wall or

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.000 
you know like curvature to a wall or
building<00:00:20.369> we<00:00:21.210> were<00:00:21.390> taking<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.050> principle<00:00:22.769> of

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
building we were taking the principle of

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.269 
building we were taking the principle of
the<00:00:23.550> arch<00:00:23.850> where<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:25.080> some<00:00:25.980> sort<00:00:26.130> of

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
the arch where you have some sort of

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.490 
the arch where you have some sort of
decreasing<00:00:26.939> number<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.630> blocks<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.199> have<00:00:28.230> one

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
decreasing number of blocks we have one

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.089 
decreasing number of blocks we have one
two<00:00:28.650> three<00:00:28.680> four<00:00:29.609> five<00:00:29.990> one<00:00:30.990> two<00:00:31.019> three<00:00:31.560> two

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
two three four five one two three two

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.240 
two three four five one two three two
one<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.940> then<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.390> increase<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.350> as<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.950> go

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
one and then you increase it as you go

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.740 
one and then you increase it as you go
back<00:00:35.430> down<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:36.320> three<00:00:37.320> five<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:39.000> guy<00:00:39.239> was<00:00:39.450> one

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
back down to three five this guy was one

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.069 
back down to three five this guy was one
two<00:00:40.110> three<00:00:40.530> one<00:00:40.950> two<00:00:40.980> one<00:00:41.520> two<00:00:41.790> three<00:00:42.510> one<00:00:43.050> two

two three one two one two three one two
three<00:00:43.770> yep<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.270> when<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.020> have<00:00:46.140> something

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
three yep so when you have something

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.440 
three yep so when you have something
like<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.890> creates<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.190> nice<00:00:47.309> arch<00:00:47.579> we're

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
like that it creates a nice arch we're

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.029 
like that it creates a nice arch we're
taking<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.809> same<00:00:49.020> principle<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.710> applying

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
taking the same principle and applying

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.760 
taking the same principle and applying
it<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> arc<00:00:51.140> what<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.170> call<00:00:52.410> an<00:00:52.500> arc<00:00:52.649> at

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
it to the arc what I call an arc at

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.500 
it to the arc what I call an arc at
least<00:00:52.949> where<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.460> have<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:54.090> start<00:00:54.329> either

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
least where you have you start either

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.060 
least where you have you start either
indented<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.350> ground<00:00:55.559> or<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.829> start

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
indented in the ground or you start

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.189 
indented in the ground or you start
above<00:00:56.250> ground<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.690> work<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> same

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
above ground and you work with the same

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.979 
above ground and you work with the same
idea<00:00:58.500> where<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.820> two<00:01:00.120> three<00:01:00.149> one

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
idea where you have one two three one

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.899 
idea where you have one two three one
two<00:01:01.020> one<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.210> two<00:01:03.210> one<00:01:03.539> two<00:01:04.140> three<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:05.010> what

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
two one one two one two three and what

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.719 
two one one two one two three and what
that<00:01:06.060> does<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.450> gives<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> nice<00:01:06.900> slope

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
that does is it gives you a nice slope

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.740 
that does is it gives you a nice slope
but<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.210> guys<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.540> comments

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
but one of you guys in the comments

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.740 
but one of you guys in the comments
mentioned<00:01:10.439> something<00:01:10.799> very<00:01:11.310> cool<00:01:11.750> something

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
mentioned something very cool something

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.870 
mentioned something very cool something
that<00:01:12.900> I've<00:01:13.020> known<00:01:13.170> about<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.590> while<00:01:13.880> but

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
that I've known about for a while but

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.910 
that I've known about for a while but
something<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:16.200> haven't<00:01:16.380> really<00:01:16.500> applied

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
something that I haven't really applied

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.280 
something that I haven't really applied
in<00:01:17.310> Minecraft<00:01:17.909> too<00:01:18.030> much<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.600> watched<00:01:18.900> my

some some old mathematician don't just

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.569 
some some old mathematician don't just
just<00:01:49.470> google<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:52.740> Fibonacci<00:01:53.220> sequence

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
just google it the Fibonacci sequence

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.780 
just google it the Fibonacci sequence
goes<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.390> take<00:01:55.490> will<00:01:56.490> do<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.700> here

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
goes like this you take will do it here

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.870 
goes like this you take will do it here
you<00:01:56.969> take<00:01:57.270> 0<00:01:58.189> 0<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.310> represented<00:01:59.399> by<00:01:59.790> this

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
you take 0 0 is represented by this

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.020 
you take 0 0 is represented by this
block<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> ground<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.219> one<00:02:02.460> is

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
block in the ground and you have one is

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.160 
block in the ground and you have one is
the<00:02:03.240> first<00:02:03.450> two<00:02:03.600> numbers<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.020> sequence

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the first two numbers in the sequence

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.709 
the first two numbers in the sequence
zero<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.920> then<00:02:05.009> one<00:02:05.219> what<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.240> do<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.540> add

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
zero and then one what you do is you add

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.999 
zero and then one what you do is you add
those<00:02:06.899> two<00:02:07.140> numbers<00:02:07.170> 0<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.369> 1<00:02:08.610> gives<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.179> 1

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
those two numbers 0 and 1 gives you 1

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.220 
those two numbers 0 and 1 gives you 1
and<00:02:10.099> then<00:02:10.819> what<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:11.180> do<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.629> always<00:02:11.659> add

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
and then what you do is you always add

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.160 
and then what you do is you always add
the<00:02:12.439> previous<00:02:12.920> two<00:02:13.159> numbers<00:02:13.549> so<00:02:14.209> 0<00:02:14.540> &amp;<00:02:14.720> 1<00:02:14.750> gives

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
the previous two numbers so 0 &amp; 1 gives

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.929 
the previous two numbers so 0 &amp; 1 gives
you<00:02:15.260> 1<00:02:15.470> 1<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.970> 1<00:02:17.030> gives<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.540> 2<00:02:17.950> 1<00:02:18.950> &amp;<00:02:19.220> 2<00:02:19.430> gives

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
you 1 1 and 1 gives you 2 1 &amp; 2 gives

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:24.759 
you 1 1 and 1 gives you 2 1 &amp; 2 gives
you<00:02:20.060> 3<00:02:20.439> 2<00:02:21.439> &amp;<00:02:21.709> 3<00:02:21.739> gives<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.370> 5<00:02:22.930> 3<00:02:23.930> &amp;<00:02:24.110> 5<00:02:24.349> gives<00:02:24.680> you

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
you 3 2 &amp; 3 gives you 5 3 &amp; 5 gives you

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.149 
you 3 2 &amp; 3 gives you 5 3 &amp; 5 gives you
8<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:25.909> on<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:27.170> we're<00:02:27.319> working<00:02:27.440> with<00:02:27.799> we<00:02:28.040> go

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
8 and so on so we're working with we go

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.530 
8 and so on so we're working with we go
up<00:02:28.310> here<00:02:28.340> we<00:02:28.549> get<00:02:28.760> 3<00:02:29.030> 5<00:02:29.390> 8<00:02:30.079> next<00:02:30.590> number<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:30.950> 13

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
up here we get 3 5 8 next number is 13

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.599 
up here we get 3 5 8 next number is 13
that's<00:02:32.540> 5<00:02:32.900> plus<00:02:33.140> 8<00:02:33.319> is<00:02:33.440> 13<00:02:33.860> 8<00:02:34.610> plus<00:02:34.940> 13<00:02:35.329> is<00:02:35.360> 21<00:02:36.609> 13

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609 
that's 5 plus 8 is 13 8 plus 13 is 21 13

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:43.180 
that's 5 plus 8 is 13 8 plus 13 is 21 13
plus<00:02:37.760> 21<00:02:38.150> is<00:02:38.359> 34<00:02:39.189> 21<00:02:40.189> plus<00:02:40.340> 34<00:02:40.819> is<00:02:41.260> 55<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:42.950> on

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
plus 21 is 34 21 plus 34 is 55 and so on

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.119 
plus 21 is 34 21 plus 34 is 55 and so on
and<00:02:43.489> what<00:02:44.120> this<00:02:44.269> does<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.959> gives<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.500> look

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
and what this does is it gives you look

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.660 
and what this does is it gives you look
at<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.340> look<00:02:46.909> at<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.030> shape<00:02:47.480> from<00:02:47.930> up<00:02:48.139> here

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
at that look at that shape from up here

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.300 
at that look at that shape from up here
what<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.700> did<00:02:49.879> was<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.060> continued<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.629> down

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
what I did was I continued it down

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.460 
what I did was I continued it down
sloping<00:02:52.310> in<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.609> opposite<00:02:53.209> direction<00:02:53.470> it

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
sloping in the opposite direction it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.930 
sloping in the opposite direction it
gives<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.889> an<00:02:55.450> incredible<00:02:56.799> looking<00:02:57.799> arc<00:02:58.099> a

the Fibonacci sequence is pretty cool I

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.150 
the Fibonacci sequence is pretty cool I
just<00:03:17.930> put<00:03:18.169> this<00:03:18.230> little<00:03:18.410> divider<00:03:18.739> line<00:03:18.949> in<00:03:19.099> the

if you guys not all of you guys will

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.720 
if you guys not all of you guys will
know<00:03:22.970> this<00:03:23.120> but<00:03:23.359> there's<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.569> movie<00:03:23.810> called<00:03:23.930> pi

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
know this but there's a movie called pi

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.930 
know this but there's a movie called pi
where<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.760> guy<00:03:26.349> goes<00:03:27.349> a<00:03:27.379> little<00:03:27.859> crazy<00:03:28.010> trying

where a guy goes a little crazy trying

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.180 
where a guy goes a little crazy trying
to<00:03:29.030> find<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:30.470> meaning<00:03:30.829> of<00:03:30.949> this

numerical pattern and the Fibonacci

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.349 
numerical pattern and the Fibonacci
sequence<00:03:35.780> was<00:03:36.139> in<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.349> movie<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:37.359> the

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
sequence was in that movie and the

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.119 
sequence was in that movie and the
coolest<00:03:38.989> implementation<00:03:39.680> that<00:03:39.769> I've<00:03:39.949> ever

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
coolest implementation that I've ever

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.770 
coolest implementation that I've ever

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.979 
seen of it was in the tool song
lateralis<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:43.370> lyrics<00:03:43.849> that<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.810> lead

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
lateralis the lyrics that the lead

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.839 
lateralis the lyrics that the lead

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
singer Maynard uses and the song are

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.949 
singer Maynard uses and the song are
black<00:03:49.849> and<00:03:50.150> white<00:03:51.139> are<00:03:51.410> all<00:03:51.739> I<00:03:52.010> see<00:03:52.430> in<00:03:53.000> my

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
black and white are all I see in my

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.119 
black and white are all I see in my
infancy<00:03:55.000> red<00:03:56.000> and<00:03:56.269> yellow<00:03:56.870> then<00:03:57.470> came<00:03:57.829> to<00:03:58.099> me

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
infancy red and yellow then came to me

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.599 
infancy red and yellow then came to me
and<00:03:58.870> then<00:03:59.870> the<00:04:00.049> rest<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.829> line<00:04:00.980> goes<00:04:01.190> but

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
and then the rest of the line goes but

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.879 
and then the rest of the line goes but
it's<00:04:01.730> awesome<00:04:01.909> because<00:04:02.209> it<00:04:02.690> is<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.500> Fibonacci

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
it's awesome because it is the Fibonacci

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.369 
it's awesome because it is the Fibonacci
sequence<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.900> you<00:04:06.169> know<00:04:06.260> I'm<00:04:06.349> just

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
sequence the and you know I'm just

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.990 
sequence the and you know I'm just
saying<00:04:06.919> the<00:04:07.010> words<00:04:07.190> he's<00:04:07.370> singing<00:04:07.639> I'm<00:04:07.729> very

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
saying the words he's singing I'm very

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.189 
saying the words he's singing I'm very
cool<00:04:08.269> and<00:04:08.389> there's<00:04:08.540> also<00:04:08.659> music<00:04:08.900> in<00:04:09.139> the

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
cool and there's also music in the

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.559 
cool and there's also music in the
background<00:04:09.620> but<00:04:10.549> uh<00:04:10.609> yeah<00:04:11.150> yeah<00:04:11.449> it's

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
background but uh yeah yeah it's

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.140

Fibonacci sequence in music form but I

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.879 
Fibonacci sequence in music form but I
just<00:04:14.389> wanted<00:04:14.599> to<00:04:14.690> show<00:04:14.810> you<00:04:14.870> this<00:04:15.079> so<00:04:15.650> that<00:04:15.680> you

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
just wanted to show you this so that you

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.129 
just wanted to show you this so that you
can<00:04:16.010> maybe<00:04:16.370> apply<00:04:16.729> this<00:04:16.789> it<00:04:17.090> really<00:04:17.570> because

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
can maybe apply this it really because

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.289 
can maybe apply this it really because
of<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.320> scale<00:04:18.650> it<00:04:19.010> very<00:04:19.430> quickly<00:04:19.729> gets<00:04:20.000> very

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
of the scale it very quickly gets very

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.250 
of the scale it very quickly gets very
large

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
large

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.190 
large
and<00:04:21.350> it<00:04:22.190> goes<00:04:22.310> on<00:04:22.490> from<00:04:22.640> here<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.840> can<00:04:23.930> only<00:04:24.080> do

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
and it goes on from here you can only do

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.750 
and it goes on from here you can only do
a<00:04:24.260> couple<00:04:24.530> more<00:04:25.120> runs<00:04:26.120> of<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.450> pattern<00:04:26.780> before

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
a couple more runs of the pattern before

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.940 
a couple more runs of the pattern before
you<00:04:28.760> know<00:04:28.880> before<00:04:28.910> you'd<00:04:29.270> run<00:04:29.420> out<00:04:29.510> of<00:04:29.600> room

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
you know before you'd run out of room

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.860 
you know before you'd run out of room
you<00:04:31.430> hit<00:04:31.850> the<00:04:31.940> build<00:04:32.150> limit<00:04:32.420> I<00:04:32.510> think<00:04:32.690> what

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
you hit the build limit I think what

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.490 
you hit the build limit I think what
it's<00:04:33.410> in<00:04:33.500> build<00:04:33.650> them<00:04:33.740> in<00:04:33.830> 256<00:04:34.220> now<00:04:34.550> yeah<00:04:35.500> but

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
it's in build them in 256 now yeah but

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.640 
it's in build them in 256 now yeah but
it's<00:04:36.860> very<00:04:37.100> very<00:04:37.430> cool<00:04:37.670> it<00:04:38.420> gives<00:04:38.660> you<00:04:38.810> awesome

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
it's very very cool it gives you awesome

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.500 
it's very very cool it gives you awesome
looking<00:04:39.920> structure<00:04:40.370> just<00:04:40.580> come<00:04:41.060> back<00:04:41.180> up<00:04:41.360> here

looking structure just come back up here

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
looking structure just come back up here
and<00:04:41.600> look<00:04:41.720> at<00:04:41.840> this<00:04:41.930> thing<00:04:42.140> looks<00:04:42.380> like<00:04:42.440> the

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
and look at this thing looks like the

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.440 
and look at this thing looks like the
bow<00:04:42.740> of<00:04:42.920> a<00:04:43.010> ship<00:04:43.040> you<00:04:43.520> could<00:04:43.880> lay<00:04:44.000> this<00:04:44.150> out<00:04:44.330> on

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
bow of a ship you could lay this out on

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.480 
bow of a ship you could lay this out on
the<00:04:44.540> side<00:04:44.870> on<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.080> ground<00:04:45.410> go<00:04:45.950> forever<00:04:46.160> with

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
the side on the ground go forever with

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.590 
the side on the ground go forever with
it

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600
