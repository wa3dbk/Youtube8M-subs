the year one is Mario Williams of course
when<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.670> did<00:01:47.820> these<00:01:47.970> things<00:01:48.000> earlier<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.750> think

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
when I did these things earlier I think

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.139 
when I did these things earlier I think
one<00:01:49.890> time<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.070> got<00:01:50.130> big<00:01:50.460> ben<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.700> one<00:01:50.939> time<00:01:51.090> I

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
one time I got big ben and one time I

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.850 
one time I got big ben and one time I
got<00:01:51.180> Jordy<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.960> that's<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.380> only<00:01:52.470> two<00:01:52.680> times

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
got Jordy and that's the only two times

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.649 
got Jordy and that's the only two times
i<00:01:52.979> did<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.280> i<00:01:53.399> showed<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.850> now<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.420> we<00:01:54.540> get

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
i did it i showed it now here we get

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.810 
i did it i showed it now here we get
Mario<00:01:54.960> Williams<00:01:55.170> 96<00:01:56.009> overall<00:01:56.399> he's<00:01:56.490> not<00:01:56.579> going

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
Mario Williams 96 overall he's not going

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.219 
Mario Williams 96 overall he's not going
for<00:01:56.969> much<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.450> mean<00:01:57.659> that's<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.079> good

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
for much but I mean that's a really good

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.690 
for much but I mean that's a really good
right<00:01:58.409> end<00:01:58.590> when<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> best<00:01:59.070> ones<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.460> game

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
right end when the best ones in the game

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.880 
right end when the best ones in the game
so<00:02:00.479> that's<00:02:00.960> not<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.380> could<00:02:01.500> definitely<00:02:01.619> have

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
so that's not we could definitely have

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.350 
so that's not we could definitely have
worst<00:02:02.070> poles<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.549> think<00:02:02.820> that's<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
worst poles and I think that's in the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.780 
worst poles and I think that's in the
top<00:02:03.600> half<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.170> cards<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.979> got<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> top

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
top half of cards you got like the top

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.789 
top half of cards you got like the top
holes<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.119> can<00:02:06.180> get<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.930> card<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.469> going<00:02:07.740> to

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
holes you can get this card is going to

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.720 
holes you can get this card is going to
definitely<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.090> top<00:02:09.270> hat<00:02:09.599> because

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 
definitely be in the top hat because

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.380 
definitely be in the top hat because
