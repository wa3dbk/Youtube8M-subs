been sitting for a long time only has

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.960 
been sitting for a long time only has
34,000<00:00:23.039> miles<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:23.699> it's<00:00:24.140> hard<00:00:25.140> telling

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
34,000 miles on it but it's hard telling

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.670 
34,000 miles on it but it's hard telling
actually<00:00:26.970> from<00:00:27.750> looking<00:00:28.050> at<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.380> tell

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
actually from looking at it you can tell

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.529 
actually from looking at it you can tell
that<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.949> hasn't<00:00:29.160> been<00:00:29.369> ran<00:00:29.609> all<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.359> much

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
that it hasn't been ran all that much

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.170 
that it hasn't been ran all that much
everything<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.140> just<00:00:31.320> dusty<00:00:31.800> but<00:00:32.180> doesn't

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
everything is just dusty but doesn't

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.560 
everything is just dusty but doesn't
have<00:00:33.360> any<00:00:33.620> it<00:00:34.620> doesn't<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> whole<00:00:35.250> lot<00:00:35.280> of

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
have any it doesn't have a whole lot of

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.450 
have any it doesn't have a whole lot of
grease<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.780> oil<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.290> even<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.890> block

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
grease and oil on it even the block

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.280 
grease and oil on it even the block
itself<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:39.120> clean<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.510> cylinder<00:00:39.899> heads<00:00:40.140> are

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
itself is clean the cylinder heads are

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.900 
itself is clean the cylinder heads are
clean<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:42.230> i<00:00:43.230> bet<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.160> probably<00:00:44.700> pretty

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
clean so i bet you it's probably pretty

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.420 
clean so i bet you it's probably pretty
correct<00:00:45.379> with<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> amount<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.829> mileage<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
correct with the amount of mileage and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.930 
correct with the amount of mileage and
stuff<00:00:48.350> but<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.770> been<00:00:49.890> sitting<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.370> long<00:00:50.550> I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
stuff but it's been sitting so long I

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.310 
stuff but it's been sitting so long I
don't<00:00:51.210> know<00:00:51.390> if<00:00:51.480> water<00:00:51.690> got<00:00:51.840> inside<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
don't know if water got inside the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.529 
don't know if water got inside the
Chamber's<00:00:52.739> or<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.489> can't<00:00:54.090> turn<00:00:54.480> it

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
Chamber's or not but I can't turn it

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.860 
Chamber's or not but I can't turn it
over<00:00:54.750> by<00:00:54.989> hand<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:57.770> anyway<00:00:59.420> there's<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.660> thing

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
over by hand so anyway there's the thing

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.359 
over by hand so anyway there's the thing
that<00:01:01.020> came<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.410> right<00:01:01.739> there<00:01:07.189> we've<00:01:08.189> got

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
that came out of right there we've got

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.859 
that came out of right there we've got
done<00:01:08.549> taking<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> parts<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.689> that

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
done taking all the parts out of it that

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.340 
done taking all the parts out of it that
we<00:01:09.990> need<00:01:10.880> rear<00:01:11.880> axel<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:15.350> engine

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
we need rear axel and engine

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.499 
we need rear axel and engine
transmission<00:01:17.250> transfer<00:01:17.790> case<00:01:18.000> didn't<00:01:18.390> have

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
transmission transfer case didn't have

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.820 
transmission transfer case didn't have
the<00:01:18.630> front<00:01:18.810> axle<00:01:18.990> when<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.350> bought<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:21.830> it's

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the front axle when we bought it it's

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.910 
the front axle when we bought it it's
going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> go<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.960> since<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.020> 73<00:01:25.710> I'm

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
going to go in that since that 73 I'm

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.270 
going to go in that since that 73 I'm
not<00:01:26.070> sure<00:01:26.220> exactly<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:28.770> 73<00:01:31.009> has<00:01:32.009> any

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
not sure exactly if the 73 has any

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.030 
not sure exactly if the 73 has any
cavitation<00:01:33.000> yet<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.619> haven't<00:01:34.619> tested<00:01:34.829> that

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
cavitation yet so haven't tested that

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.800 
cavitation yet so haven't tested that
out<00:01:35.280> still<00:01:35.460> got<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.759> pull<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> block<00:01:36.210> out<00:01:36.420> to

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
out still got to pull the block out to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.350 
out still got to pull the block out to
find<00:01:36.990> out<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.530> need<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.829> find<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.369> once

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
find out so I need to find that out once

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.660 
find out so I need to find that out once
i<00:01:39.479> find<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:39.900> then<00:01:40.310> we'll<00:01:41.310> actually<00:01:41.400> have

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
i find that out then we'll actually have

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.380 
i find that out then we'll actually have
a<00:01:41.820> spare<00:01:42.150> engine<00:01:42.770> if<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:43.950> need<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.250> but<00:01:45.240> that

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
a spare engine if we need it but that

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.480 
a spare engine if we need it but that
Jeep<00:01:45.570> oissed<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.140> surely<00:01:46.680> working<00:01:46.860> good<00:01:47.189> there

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
Jeep oissed is surely working good there

00:01:47.490 --> 00:02:12.900 
Jeep oissed is surely working good there
isn't<00:01:47.970> it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.970 

Oh
