00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
know thanks ID so pretty much the three

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.030 
know thanks ID so pretty much the three
years<00:00:42.719> old<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.050> guess<00:00:43.260> I've<00:00:43.469> dropped<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.920> so

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
years old I guess I've dropped it so

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.860 
years old I guess I've dropped it so
many<00:00:44.160> times<00:00:44.219> at<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> battery<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.809> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
many times at the battery that I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.830 
many times at the battery that I
actually<00:00:46.079> dies<00:00:46.730> twice<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:47.879> fast<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.300> actually

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
actually dies twice as fast and actually

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.459 
actually dies twice as fast and actually
should<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:50.390> that's<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> problem<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.260> use

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
should so that's the problem and I use

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.950 
should so that's the problem and I use
my<00:00:52.590> laptop<00:00:52.800> usually<00:00:53.640> six<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.329> eight<00:00:54.480> hours<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
my laptop usually six to eight hours a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.560 
my laptop usually six to eight hours a
day<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.190> not<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.550> very<00:00:56.699> good<00:00:56.820> thing<00:00:57.149> so

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
day but that's not a very good thing so

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.770 
day but that's not a very good thing so
I<00:00:58.340> always<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.730> plug<00:01:00.059> into<00:01:00.239> my<00:01:00.449> charger

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
I always have to plug into my charger

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.029 
I always have to plug into my charger
you<00:01:00.899> know<00:01:01.050> when<00:01:01.320> I'm<00:01:01.379> session<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.800> working

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
you know when I'm session one working

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.250 
you know when I'm session one working
the<00:01:02.129> Home<00:01:02.219> Videos<00:01:02.520> does<00:01:02.899> editing<00:01:03.899> stuff<00:01:04.080> like

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the Home Videos does editing stuff like

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.670 
the Home Videos does editing stuff like
that<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:05.010> requires<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.420> lot<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.780> power<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.439> my

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that it requires a lot of power for my

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.160 
that it requires a lot of power for my
laptop<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.630> always<00:01:09.810> keep<00:01:10.020> it

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
laptop to do that so I always keep it

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.109 
laptop to do that so I always keep it
charged<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.400> what<00:01:11.549> actually<00:01:11.640> happened

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
charged in and so what actually happened

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.399 
charged in and so what actually happened
was<00:01:12.150> he<00:01:14.060> besides<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.240> laptop<00:01:15.840> charger<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
was he besides the laptop charger and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.800 
was he besides the laptop charger and
the<00:01:16.500> laptop<00:01:16.740> itself<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.909> two<00:01:18.030> years<00:01:18.210> old<00:01:18.450> and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the laptop itself is two years old and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.080 
the laptop itself is two years old and
so<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:20.130> charge<00:01:20.460> had<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.640> lot<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> wear<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so that charge had a lot of wear and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.960 
so that charge had a lot of wear and
tear<00:01:21.240> all<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> wires<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.729> wires

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
tear all in the wires in it so the wires

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.940 
tear all in the wires in it so the wires
have<00:01:24.270> messed<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.560> day<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.920> just

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
have messed up and then one day it just

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.429 
have messed up and then one day it just
decided<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.880> charge<00:01:27.150> at<00:01:27.810> all<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> was

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
decided not to charge at all so I was

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.800
