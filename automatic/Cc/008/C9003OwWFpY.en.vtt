00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.550
 if you liked the December test 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.039
 of the jeep renegade well this is not me 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.960
 you can really miss us again 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.489
 mountain this time in a wooden bridge 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.570
 to try his cousin medi the melfi 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:32.219
 the long-awaited 500 hicks for the truth 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.829
 before arriving here in val camonica 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.020
 with this new fiat we have already done 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.030
 a rather long test from his 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.399
 region of origin the basilicata 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.430
 we arrived up to our track of 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.670
 vairano proved to be a good one 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.559
 road racer is a good climber e 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.899
 this despite the trial version 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.690
 is equipped with front-wheel drive only 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.339
 but no it is all this was not enough e 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.649
 so here we are in the mountains 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.949
 Lombard to try this 1600 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:06.170
 turbodiesel with 120 horses that almost 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.170
 surely it will be the most sold version 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.040
 there's no denying that much 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.040
 500 hicks goes up without the slightest problem 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.150
 it's also the asphalt holes are fine 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.850
 absorbed 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.860
 the driver's seat is comfortable and spacious 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.930
 welcomes the driver much better 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.330
 than we have in the past with 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.580
 other crossovers also of premium brands 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.290
 but let's stop for a moment because I want to 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.570
 take a good look at the interiors 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.890
 so at first sight the feeling that 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.890
 are really well done 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.340
 let's start from the bridge everyone does it in 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.930
 plastic but this white to match 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.700
 the bodywork and the softness of the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.039
 top and accuracy of 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.590
 assembly are to pay you both for it 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:59.509
 even intact look is a lot 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.049
 in style 500 the touchscreen is 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.750
 positioned at the top 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.939
 which certainly helps distract you 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.310
 less from the guide responds well to the touch 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.440
 the fingers and the menu are not too much 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.019
 complex among other things contains the 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.930
 classic navigator you connect present 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.799
 on most of the fiat and the camera 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.930
 of reversing 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.510
 unfortunately there is a sore point here 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.849
 just dear and light or in case of rain 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.130
 in fact the images are not images 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.709
 better then when you maneuver 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.049
 always keep your eyes open i 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.450
 Radio controls on the steering wheel are not visible 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.610
 immediately because they are placed back here 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.980
 the wheel but once found 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.319
 they are very practical because they are 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.450
 right under your fingertips but now 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.730
 let's start driving again because discover 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.579
 these mountains are a real pleasure too 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.769
 in the rain and with the 500 hicks 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.549
 going along these roads is as easy as 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.549
 drink a glass of water 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.970
 the initial shot is good for the 500 hicks 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.150
 120 hp turbodiesel indeed 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.540
 takes just under 11 seconds for the 0 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.860
 100 from the track our testers 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.180
 they report that in this test 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.790
 there is a wheel spin 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.920
 fronts quite marked coming 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.080
 immediately damped by controls 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.209
 good news also for security la 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.000
 dynamic is always under easy control 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.280
 as for braking instead i 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.680
 detected data is not a record 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.080
 it takes in fact 44 meters per 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.770
 stop from 100 per hour and the pitch 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.350
 it's a bit pronounced and now let's talk about 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.540
 consumption is almost certain who will consume 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.060
 less than the renegade with the same engine 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.540
 but compared to competitors as captor 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.030
 juke and 2008 is a bit behind the average 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.680
 taken from our 16 test center 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.900
 kilometers with a liter 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.900
 some competitors also arrive 19 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.560
 we arrived in the evening and it's time to 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.440
 return to the newsroom with the new fiat 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.390
 500 hicks within a few weeks I have 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.610
 led leila renegade the cousins 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.459
 Italians and now you know about them 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.650
 defects and numbers the choice between the two 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.720
 I leave it to you but for once I want 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.910
 tell you my opinion 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.430
 I prefer the sinuous and fine lines of the 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.130
 500 hicks compared to militaresche 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.169
 forms of the renegade on the number of 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.540
 February that awaits you on newsstands 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.850
 test of the 500 hicks is our top 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.980
 in fact you will find the proof 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.650
 complete with three engines in addition to 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:37.090
 this 1600 multijet you will know all of the 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:40.140
 1400 t jet and 2000 multijet 4x4 e 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.140
 enjoy the reading 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.510
 the turbo script for how long since 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.880
 we saw on small cars vi 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.170
 remember it was fashionable in the eighties 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.690
 and ninety when the supercharged engines 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.760
 which were a real rarity and there was 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.440
 even those who pretended the truth 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.660
 difference you can see if 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.460
 look from the front you see it is you 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.280
 enlarged by the increase in roadways 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.850
 he did very well he transformed the 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.310
 his guide 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.310
 today more reactive pleasant
