00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
I thought it was gonna be a lot more

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.089 
I thought it was gonna be a lot more
than<00:00:13.230> what<00:00:13.349> they<00:00:13.440> actually<00:00:13.740> came<00:00:13.889> out<00:00:14.040> with

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099

like the heroes get new abilities I

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.220

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
think like they made it so you can

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.929 
think like they made it so you can
upgrade<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.740> free<00:00:23.070> spell<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> little<00:00:23.609> bit<00:00:23.730> more

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
upgrade the free spell a little bit more

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.630 
upgrade the free spell a little bit more
and<00:00:24.420> there's<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.260> bunch<00:00:25.470> others<00:00:25.830> like<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
and there's a bunch others like the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.580 
and there's a bunch others like the
obstacles<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.630> remove<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.109> get<00:00:28.230> more<00:00:28.380> gems

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
obstacles you remove you get more gems

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.130 
obstacles you remove you get more gems
and<00:00:28.859> then<00:00:28.949> like<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> gem<00:00:29.429> box<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.939> all<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.210> so

the<00:01:29.100> graphic<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.670> bottom<00:01:29.970> there<00:01:30.120> so<00:01:30.470> I

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
the graphic on the bottom there so I

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.200 
the graphic on the bottom there so I
wait<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> little<00:01:32.940> while<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.300> click<00:01:33.510> it<00:01:33.690> and<00:01:35.210> I

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
wait a little while to click it and I

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.540 
wait a little while to click it and I
thought<00:01:36.630> at<00:01:36.930> first<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.070> click<00:01:38.370> him

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
thought at first like if you click him

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.250 
thought at first like if you click him
and<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.060> has<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.330> that<00:01:39.540> ring<00:01:39.810> around<00:01:39.930> him

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
and it has like that ring around him

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.960 
and it has like that ring around him
that<00:01:40.620> it<00:01:40.920> would<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.220> enrage<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.850> other

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
that it would like enrage the other

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.390 
that it would like enrage the other
troops<00:01:42.240> around<00:01:42.510> them<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.440> it<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:44.070> for

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
troops around them but it is just for

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.310 
troops around them but it is just for
the<00:01:44.640> barbarians<00:01:45.330> so<00:01:45.780> that's<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.260> of

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the barbarians so that's kind of

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.700 
the barbarians so that's kind of
unfortunate<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.610> makes<00:01:47.790> sense<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:49.140> so

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
unfortunate but it makes sense and so

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.469 
unfortunate but it makes sense and so
everybody<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:50.250> he<00:01:50.400> spawned<00:01:50.790> some<00:01:51.000> barbarians

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
everybody but he spawned some barbarians

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.820 
everybody but he spawned some barbarians
too<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:51.960> if<00:01:52.050> you<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.260> bunch<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.680> them<00:01:52.800> you

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
too so if you have a bunch of them you

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.950 
too so if you have a bunch of them you
can<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.280> drop<00:01:54.090> them<00:01:54.270> by<00:01:54.360> your<00:01:54.479> barbarian

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
can just drop them by your barbarian

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.719 
can just drop them by your barbarian
King<00:01:55.170> they'd<00:01:55.380> all<00:01:55.530> get<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.490> rage<00:01:56.700> spell

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
King they'd all get like the rage spell

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.530 
King they'd all get like the rage spell
-<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.619> don't<00:01:58.619> know<00:01:58.800> if<00:01:59.100> they'll<00:01:59.820> follow<00:02:00.119> him

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
- I don't know if they'll follow him

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.780 
- I don't know if they'll follow him
though<00:02:00.690> like<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.170> they<00:02:01.470> might<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:02.580> then<00:02:02.700> you

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
though like that they might and then you

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.210 
though like that they might and then you
can<00:02:02.910> see<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.240> archer<00:02:03.630> Queen<00:02:04.070> all<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.160> way

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
till she starts getting attacked here

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.960 
till she starts getting attacked here
and<00:02:06.750> use<00:02:06.900> her<00:02:07.080> ability<00:02:07.530> she<00:02:07.710> goes<00:02:08.429> invisible

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
and use her ability she goes invisible

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.729 
and use her ability she goes invisible
for<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> little<00:02:09.390> bit<00:02:09.509> or<00:02:09.690> cloaked<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.229> nothing

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
for a little bit or cloaked and nothing

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.070 
for a little bit or cloaked and nothing
attacks<00:02:11.100> her<00:02:11.310> but<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.090> only<00:02:12.180> lasted<00:02:12.720> for<00:02:12.959> like

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
attacks her but it only lasted for like

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.260 
attacks her but it only lasted for like
three<00:02:13.709> seconds<00:02:14.130> so<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.610> may<00:02:14.790> become<00:02:14.910> like

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
three seconds so that may become like

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.690 
three seconds so that may become like
critical<00:02:15.660> later<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.770> battles<00:02:17.160> but<00:02:17.400> that's

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
critical later in the battles but that's

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.030 
critical later in the battles but that's
