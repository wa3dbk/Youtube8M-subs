00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:36.830 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.909 

he's<00:07:37.430> not<00:07:37.639> even<00:07:37.909> breathing<00:07:38.330> her<00:07:38.830> you<00:07:39.830> know

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 
he's not even breathing her you know

he's not even breathing her you know
initially<00:07:40.129> I'm<00:07:40.580> sure<00:07:40.789> the<00:07:40.909> Blue<00:07:41.090> Bombers

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:41.449 
initially I'm sure the Blue Bombers

initially I'm sure the Blue Bombers
thought<00:07:41.659> they<00:07:41.840> got<00:07:41.990> a<00:07:42.050> bit<00:07:42.259> of<00:07:42.349> a<00:07:42.440> break<00:07:42.740> when

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 
thought they got a bit of a break when

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:45.730 
thought they got a bit of a break when
cameras<00:07:43.639> bad<00:07:43.940> kicked<00:07:44.449> instead<00:07:45.259> of<00:07:45.349> going<00:07:45.590> out

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:45.740 
cameras bad kicked instead of going out

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.060 
towards the rocket and then he picks it

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.480 
towards the rocket and then he picks it
up<00:07:51.180> on<00:07:51.419> the<00:07:51.539> way<00:07:51.660> he<00:07:51.840> goes<00:07:52.020> 75<00:07:52.710> yards<00:07:53.250> for<00:07:53.460> a
