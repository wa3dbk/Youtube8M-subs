00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 all right 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.120
 My friends as they are today, I am going to give them 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.269
 a recipe that has been much requested 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.830
 which is how to lighten the hair 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.619
 naturally now I want to tell you 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.380
 some things that are important 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.110
 understand before you start these 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.349
 clearance processes not for being 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.390
 natural not colored although we are 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.360
 using natural products we must 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.980
 take awesome care with 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.050
 our hair so as not to mistreat 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.390
 treatments you have to go piano pianito 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.239
 and of course go doing small 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.719
 tests because naturally it does not 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.999
 we know exactly how to discolor there 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.870
 who will always bleach more 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:55.120
 pulling reddish to red others 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.420
 people to blond and that's why it's so 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.950
 important to try and see if we 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.320
 like 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.260
 an American change or I'm not going to 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.370
 end up being the blonde girl truth 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.830
 it's not about that, it's about giving 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.680
 very beautiful natural highlights like 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.460
 that the sun kissed our hair and then 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.220
 let's start the amount we're going to 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.340
 use depends how much are we going to 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.670
 discolor a black tea or paint our 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.600
 true hair then let's start 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:35.650
 in this transit to put half of 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.729
 warm water I calculated that it's like average 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:43.869
 cup of warm water we will need 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.759
 a tablespoon of honey bee 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.680
 honey has peroxide 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.650
 hydrogen and this is what clarifies 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.930
 our hair if we want it clearer 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.080
 let's apply two tablespoons of honey 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.880
 of bee and so we are going to add but 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.560
 however without testing it if we are 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.560
 satisfied with a spoonful 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.880
 this first mix so that really 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:14.350
 work let's leave it like that 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.060
 saying storing about 30 minutes ok 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.150
 we're going to forget about her and we're going to 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.970
 leave 30 minutes for the peroxide to 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.980
 hydrogen give of itself and truly we 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.130
 of those lights in the hair that we're 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.130
 searching 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:36.870
 After half an hour we will add 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:39.630
 half a lemon to our mixture a quarter 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.950
 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.950
 Virgin or half teaspoon 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.710
 and finally half a teaspoon of cinnamon 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:55.530
 powder 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:59.670
 and now yes very carefully 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:03.150
 to start to stir our best that 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.790
 you off here as we see it in 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.100
 everything here is here because everything is 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.560
 natural here there is nothing that is 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.320
 let's put a little piece of red 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.700
 so it will be nicer not and you 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.910
 they're going to ask why are we 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.250
 using cinnamon oil 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.480
 olive because they are like we are going to say 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.750
 natural alarm triggers 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.450
 peroxide is precisely the cinnamon and the 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.490
 olive oil together with honey 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.460

 do it with a little brush or with your fingers 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.620
 they will return well to take a little 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.020
 of the mixture and they're going to apply it 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.770

 hair if you can leave one day 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.320
 complete better but remember between two 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.350
 hours and three hours can open it and see 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.720
 how is it going now this is going to be a change 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.310
 gradual this is not going to be a change of the 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.410
 overnight they are going to sunrise 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.140
 Blondes have to do it at the beginning 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.330
 two , three times a week until 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.600
 go having the color that you 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.600
 want 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.569
 there is another recipe that remains incredible 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.340
 also in men who want to have the 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:10.130
 hair as well as with a flash like that 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.169
 half ruby that does not like the 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.720
 thing and what they have to do is 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:18.139
 Mix equal parts of cinnamon for 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.240
 example a spoonful of cinnamon for a 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.320
 tablespoon 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.080

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.650
 list no longer keep quiet with a spoonful 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.780
 of conditioner this is going to stir 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.270
 and remember that depending on the amount 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:36.330
 of hair if they need 4 tablespoons of 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.100
 conditioner 4 tablespoons cinnamon if 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.250
 what you 're looking for is a lot change 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:45.210
 more radical to this mix are you going to 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:47.820
 Apply a small cup of hydrogen peroxide 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:51.090

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:57.540
 all our conditioner with the 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.580
 cinnamon with oxygenated water and we 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.650
 we put everything in everything the whole and everything 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:05.010
 in all the whole hair and we hope 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.750
 also like 24 hours we are going over the 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.570

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:12.450
