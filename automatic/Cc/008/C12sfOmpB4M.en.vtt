00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:13.240
 there are colleagues here who have together 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:15.370
 russell gamer we who gets someone 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.230
 there in the middle then where are we today 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.279
 let's go into a new mini-game 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.019
 also if we do not like to innovate 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.710
 in the minigames and others not always 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:29.289
 they bring the same ones and we are going to bring one that 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.940
 it is not well known and what is it like 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:36.990
 bomberman in minecraft 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.990
 it is certainly charming 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.850
 berman likes to lie 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.640
 now let's put bombs in the game 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.730
 I gained him real power from the nintendo or 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.420
 be the new super nintendo not the 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.100
 nintendo or flipar good so I 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.280
 I think we will now start not to 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.780
 so since you see it directly I do not know 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.839
 exactly you have to give it to be the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.630
 small box where it says that join arrives a 2 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.570
 3 , and and here are your son is 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.860
 See if these times are wood before 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.899
 we have touched glass and it is dawn 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.940
 so we will not be able to see it well and 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.130
 well he bomberman this exactly 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.479
 same in the majority of van berman you have 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.950
 to be destroying the walls that 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.430
 they can simply be destroyed with 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.170
 not all bombs and get objects that 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.210
 they allow you then more power when 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.860
 the bomb explodes and can run more 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.180
 fast more quantity of pumps at 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.190
 principle, it only starts with 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.220
 one and all that but as you well know quilá 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.110
 appears in the box on the right to 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.450
 same as the quiet account 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.580
 to die I'm going for you in this huge 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.550
 star that can not be assaulted to 22 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.740
 because because if I would not look and where is 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.780
 that sixth day in the egg to double bomb 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.280
 good but we're here but at 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.040
 principle the best be a little bit more 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.110
 boring because of course you have to be 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.180
 destroying the networks to be able to be 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.590
 discovering the objects for 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.880
 find enemy settlers 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.259
 it's also fun maybe it's not 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.450
 as frantic as other games but 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.229
 good always comes good innovate I think 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.140
 that one more called the help of those 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.130
 things that are in your smell is that 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.220
 we can doubt that I like josh sittón 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.470
 it's almost I explode myself god takes 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.420
 more speed more bombs god I'm 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.120
 placing I'm sharing killen the 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.760
 killing data related 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.549
 well, they exist, we have to give 15 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.130
 We can not use more than 15 months 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:38.610
 already but we saw and other things 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.260
 is that there is a virus that if you take it 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.890
 low 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:49.950
 yes I think I do think that if I have left 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.950
 down but I think that now that kills 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:58.130
 how do you enjoy Achilles in parts with 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.130
 a little bit evil you know I am one more 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:09.370
 I've seen but when I see you, you're not going to 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.190
 let go as there another one that I keep 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.160
 I stop the vase is dominating the 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.720
 heading like you've been looking at not 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.850
 I am the one who is dominating me 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.060
 a hand in the macaroni I will eat the 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:26.380
 macaroni rum rum good before I did not know 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:32.490
 remove one touched a game 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.490
 where today there are no sons of bitches 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.190
 and that's worse 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.190
 year 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.580
 leave me alone 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.530
 and the downside of this is that a 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.230
 commission time 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.540
 today fucking host fucking bomb to the 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.499
 filling the virus the virus the virus the 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:03.450
 I turn and hit that person 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:03.450
 and you better know 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.049
 names so I'm going over there 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:22.409
 Oh 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:27.949
 fuck and again the lame that his father 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:27.949
 Has killed 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.919
 we will give it all but I think longer 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.870
 I will win because already dead I do not know 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.729
 how many times do you see how many there are left 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.479
 with fast you have left and I have left 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.479
 I think there are three 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.659
 I only have a bomb when it dies 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.360
 remove all the objects will be in the 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:57.230
 site of people who die but the 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:01.780
 people can take advantage and go for them 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.780
 except the same 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.839
 yj 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.840
 and see you in it do not bother me 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.740
 it is possible not hassles is totally 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.740
 possible to me they have already killed me 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:33.750
 we were not in another fence but those 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.210
 we should do in some way to 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.060
 that you can create a game so that 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:44.229
 people can enter 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:46.240
 but I would be with subscribers what do you 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.189
 it seems to you man but the bad thing is that 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:54.990
 that if he's going to take us to another room but 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:54.990
 you can create a room yes no 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:05.310
 finally gallo something so good up here 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.349
 the game was short but I think 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.710
 what it has been like to teach you 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:15.569
 some milestones to reebok he went to tell us 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:18.690
 more or less how is the game does not give yes yes 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:21.530
 and I puchi a penguin I'm not going to put 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.530
 hallucinations 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:28.160
 Well I hope you liked it and even 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:33.720
 the next goodbye 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:37.380

 look all together to a friend
