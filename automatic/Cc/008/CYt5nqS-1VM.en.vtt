evolution of a product that was so right
in<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.590> many<00:00:25.619> ways<00:00:25.980> when<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.550> first<00:00:26.880> released

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
in so many ways when we first released

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:42.040 
in so many ways when we first released
it

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.819 

the<00:00:43.050> entire<00:00:43.789> front<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.149> new<00:00:45.269> iMac<00:00:45.829> he's

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the entire front of the new iMac he's

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.079 
the entire front of the new iMac he's
just<00:00:47.010> dominated<00:00:47.760> by<00:00:48.179> this<00:00:48.920> incredible<00:00:49.920> new<00:00:50.159> 16

by<00:00:51.239> 9<00:00:51.449> display<00:00:52.039> we<00:00:53.039> actually<00:00:53.399> figured<00:00:53.640> out<00:00:53.820> a

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
by 9 display we actually figured out a

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.450 
by 9 display we actually figured out a
way<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.269> taking<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.809> glass<00:00:55.140> right<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.339> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
way of taking the glass right to the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.060 
way of taking the glass right to the
very<00:00:56.609> perimeter<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:58.019> just<00:00:58.320> display<00:00:58.799> and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
very perimeter it's just display and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.700 
very perimeter it's just display and
there<00:00:59.399> no<00:00:59.579> display<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.659> I<00:01:00.809> mean<00:01:00.839> you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
there no display that's it I mean you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.660 
there no display that's it I mean you
are<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:01.890> completely<00:01:03.350> consumed<00:01:04.350> by<00:01:04.710> by<00:01:05.430> that

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
are just completely consumed by by that

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.410 
are just completely consumed by by that
image<00:01:06.350> there's<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.560> detail<00:01:08.189> there<00:01:08.520> that

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
image there's not a detail there that

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.690 
image there's not a detail there that
doesn't<00:01:09.750> need<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.049> there<00:01:10.380> there<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.399> no

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
doesn't need to be there there are no

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.999 
doesn't need to be there there are no

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
mouse it could not be any simpler but I

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.100 
mouse it could not be any simpler but I
love<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.670> way<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:15.030> scales<00:03:15.510> from<00:03:15.840> being

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
love the way that it scales from being

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.240 
love the way that it scales from being
something<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.770> is<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.820> apparently<00:03:18.210> simple

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
something that is that apparently simple

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.550 
something that is that apparently simple
to<00:03:20.250> actually<00:03:20.550> being<00:03:21.020> really<00:03:22.020> remarkably

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
to actually being really remarkably

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.220 
to actually being really remarkably
sophisticated<00:03:22.800> I<00:03:23.610> mean<00:03:23.760> we've<00:03:24.540> finally

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
sophisticated I mean we've finally

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.220 
sophisticated I mean we've finally
figured<00:03:25.530> out<00:03:25.680> how<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.190> take<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:27.510> multi-touch

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
figured out how to take the multi-touch

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.390 
figured out how to take the multi-touch
technology<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:29.570> implement<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.690> on<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.810> mouse

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
technology and implement it on a mouse

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.490 
technology and implement it on a mouse
it's<00:03:32.400> still<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.730> point<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.240> click<00:03:33.360> mouse<00:03:33.720> but

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
it's still a point and click mouse but

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.400 
it's still a point and click mouse but
now<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:35.280> entire<00:03:35.790> top<00:03:36.420> surface<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.200> mouse

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
now the entire top surface of the mouse

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.530 
now the entire top surface of the mouse
is<00:03:37.680> is<00:03:38.340> basically<00:03:38.610> it's<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.120> multi<00:03:39.390> touch

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
is is basically it's a multi touch

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.810 
is is basically it's a multi touch
sensor<00:03:40.110> this<00:03:40.770> is<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.070> smartest<00:03:41.430> Mouse<00:03:41.580> we've

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.940 
sensor this is the smartest Mouse we've
ever<00:03:41.970> made<00:03:42.180> there's<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:43.020> chip<00:03:43.350> inside<00:03:43.710> that

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
ever made there's a chip inside that

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.250 
ever made there's a chip inside that
acts<00:03:44.160> essentially<00:03:44.700> as<00:03:44.820> a<00:03:44.850> brain<00:03:45.150> as<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:46.080> put

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
acts essentially as a brain as you put

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.840 
acts essentially as a brain as you put
your<00:03:46.410> fingers<00:03:46.740> on<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.950> top<00:03:47.190> shelf<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.640> can

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
your fingers on the top shelf it can

your fingers on the top shelf it can
determine<00:03:48.420> where<00:03:49.080> they're<00:03:49.290> located<00:03:49.500> how<00:03:50.220> many

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
determine where they're located how many

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.030 
determine where they're located how many
you<00:03:50.730> have<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.300> through<00:03:51.900> your<00:03:52.110> gesture<00:03:52.650> your

in<00:04:42.750> a<00:04:42.870> consumer<00:04:43.560> computer<00:04:46.280> we're<00:04:47.280> really

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
in a consumer computer we're really

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.760 
in a consumer computer we're really
proud<00:04:47.850> of<00:04:47.910> this<00:04:48.180> imac<00:04:48.630> especially<00:04:49.440> in<00:04:49.560> terms

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
environmental story is it's never over

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.960 
environmental story is it's never over
because<00:04:55.260> as<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:55.620> learn<00:04:55.890> how<00:04:56.490> to<00:04:56.520> remove

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
because as you learn how to remove

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.630 
because as you learn how to remove
toxins<00:04:57.870> you<00:04:58.380> change<00:04:58.650> your<00:04:58.800> focus<00:04:58.980> from<00:04:59.340> doing

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
toxins you change your focus from doing

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.940 
toxins you change your focus from doing
that<00:04:59.850> too<00:05:00.600> how<00:05:01.230> do<00:05:01.290> we<00:05:01.470> build<00:05:01.680> this<00:05:01.890> thing

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
that too how do we build this thing

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.760 
that too how do we build this thing
really<00:05:02.660> energy-efficient<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:03.780> not<00:05:04.380> just<00:05:04.620> to

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
really energy-efficient and not just to

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.250 
really energy-efficient and not just to
meet<00:05:04.950> energy<00:05:05.190> star<00:05:05.760> but<00:05:06.480> to<00:05:06.570> go<00:05:06.690> way<00:05:06.900> beyond

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
meet energy star but to go way beyond

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.510 
meet energy star but to go way beyond
that<00:05:08.600> we<00:05:09.600> take<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:09.870> life<00:05:10.200> cycle<00:05:10.530> view<00:05:11.010> of<00:05:11.250> the

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
that we take a life cycle view of the

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.390 
that we take a life cycle view of the
carbon<00:05:11.850> footprint<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:12.540> you<00:05:13.410> find<00:05:13.680> that<00:05:13.800> the

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
carbon footprint and you find that the

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.670 
carbon footprint and you find that the
customers<00:05:14.880> use<00:05:15.060> of<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.360> computer<00:05:15.840> has<00:05:16.440> the

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
customers use of the computer has the

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.100 
customers use of the computer has the
biggest<00:05:16.920> impact<00:05:17.310> on<00:05:18.030> its<00:05:18.240> carbon<00:05:18.510> footprint

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
biggest impact on its carbon footprint

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.010 
biggest impact on its carbon footprint
and<00:05:19.290> so<00:05:20.070> in<00:05:20.340> this<00:05:20.760> product<00:05:21.300> we<00:05:21.480> really<00:05:21.750> drove

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
and so in this product we really drove

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.200 
and so in this product we really drove
at<00:05:22.230> energy<00:05:22.650> efficiency<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:23.460> that's<00:05:23.970> where<00:05:24.180> we

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
at energy efficiency and that's where we

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.360 
at energy efficiency and that's where we
have<00:05:24.420> a<00:05:24.450> tremendous<00:05:24.780> advantage<00:05:25.170> because<00:05:26.010> we

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
have a tremendous advantage because we

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.850 
have a tremendous advantage because we
not<00:05:26.820> only<00:05:26.880> build<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.840> hardware<00:05:28.020> but<00:05:28.560> we<00:05:28.680> also

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
not only build the hardware but we also

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.730 
not only build the hardware but we also
create<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.550> software<00:05:30.000> so<00:05:30.720> we're<00:05:31.380> able<00:05:31.470> to

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
create the software so we're able to

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.650 
create the software so we're able to
really<00:05:32.280> manage<00:05:32.490> power<00:05:32.880> and<00:05:33.150> throughout<00:05:33.419> the

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
really manage power and throughout the

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.380 
really manage power and throughout the
system<00:05:33.890> extensively<00:05:34.890> we<00:05:35.700> even<00:05:35.940> power<00:05:36.150> down

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
system extensively we even power down

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.440 
system extensively we even power down
processors<00:05:37.080> between<00:05:37.530> keystrokes<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.460> I

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
processors between keystrokes and I

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.810 
processors between keystrokes and I
think<00:05:39.720> we're<00:05:39.930> really<00:05:40.140> unique<00:05:40.710> and<00:05:40.980> how<00:05:41.520> far

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
think we're really unique and how far

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.909 
think we're really unique and how far
we've<00:05:42.180> pushed<00:05:42.540> that<00:05:43.110> hardware<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:43.740> software

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
we've pushed that hardware and software

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.559 
we've pushed that hardware and software
technology<00:05:44.760> to<00:05:44.880> do<00:05:45.060> that

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:48.569 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:50.899 

with<00:05:49.169> this<00:05:49.289> imac<00:05:49.679> we<00:05:50.069> took<00:05:50.219> everything<00:05:50.520> so

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:50.909 
with this imac we took everything so

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.540 
with this imac we took everything so
