00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
want to simply initially this week break

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.400 
want to simply initially this week break
down<00:00:12.960> what<00:00:13.889> pronation<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:15.000> not<00:00:15.809> necessarily

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
down what pronation is not necessarily

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
down what pronation is not necessarily
tennis<00:00:16.920> specific<00:00:17.550> but<00:00:18.420> pronation<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.230> guys

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
tennis specific but pronation you guys

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.759 
tennis specific but pronation you guys
is<00:00:20.430> really<00:00:20.880> just<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.210> idea<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
is really just the idea that the the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.880 
is really just the idea that the the
forearm<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> hand<00:00:24.140> make<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> move<00:00:25.529> where

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
forearm and the hand make a move where

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.200 
forearm and the hand make a move where
they<00:00:26.010> end<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.490> turning<00:00:26.820> downward<00:00:27.630> okay<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
they end up turning downward okay and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.519 
they end up turning downward okay and
specifically<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.570> tennis<00:00:30.960> which<00:00:31.170> we'll<00:00:31.349> get

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
specifically for tennis which we'll get

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.410 
specifically for tennis which we'll get
to<00:00:31.590> later<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:32.160> week<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.850> an<00:00:32.940> idea<00:00:33.239> we

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
to later this week this is an idea we

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.889 
to later this week this is an idea we
really<00:00:33.840> need<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.170> be<00:00:34.290> using<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.920> our<00:00:35.010> serves<00:00:35.899> so

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
that initial idea that we are trying to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.899 
that initial idea that we are trying to
pronate<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.700> all<00:01:30.060> serves<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.909> understand

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
pronate on all serves and understand

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.580 
pronate on all serves and understand
that<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.479> connection<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.290> forearm

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
that it's the connection of the forearm

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.569 
that it's the connection of the forearm
and<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.950> hand<00:01:35.420> turning<00:01:36.420> downward<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:38.340> make

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
and the hand turning downward as we make

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.819 
and the hand turning downward as we make
that<00:01:38.759> move<00:01:39.060> okay<00:01:39.420> hope<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.439> was<00:01:40.590> really

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that move okay hope that was really

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.410
