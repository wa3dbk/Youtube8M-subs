 in Buenos Aires 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:23.649
 this third post be germany we come from frankfurt with the fair 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.650
 berlin does the political and scientific part 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.759
 they integrate the third post in as much from the point of penal to the minute of which 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.140
 be 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.620

 Eclipse was talked a lot and be late 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.900
 surely I'm going to say that that talks too much about the tea party could 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.080
 join to act only superhuman 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.469
 but the region of murcia 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.040
 why 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.900
 what we signed today here

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.690
 between the bushes 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.690
 and another without music laces 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.070
 where 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.810
 they will contribute 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.860
 the funds and resources to invest 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.280
 technically and to develop techniques and for the first time 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.720
 time 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.950
 the country 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.670
 the race 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.290
 I want 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.770
 and because it is very important 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.810
 and it seems a lie and that they presented because in reality Argentina has had 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.220
 so long 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.040
 for a long time 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.630

 produces the best quality author in all canary cantina then 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.160
 came a process 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.730
 of large specialization 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.740
 the country 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.280
 and good happened what happened but we are 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.360
 here to remember what happened but for what we are doing what 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.249
 we go 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.019
 and today we just signed 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.930
 according to the university that will also take place in general pacheco 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.569
 where not only 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.180
 volkswagen with which 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.929

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.359
 in terms of knowledge as to what information 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:38.169
 this too 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:39.729
 I'm sorry a little 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:42.889
 one more thing between 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.289
 viktor klima me why why 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:48.229
 we three years ago 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:50.399
 just so 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.579
 the silver of the gulf 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.819
 ambitious volkswagen 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.879
 in germany in 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.249
 casually club rooms 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:01.329
 my partner on the plane 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.909
 accompanied in this plant 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.159
 the time if he is the president 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.680
 republic of germany and at that time it was that the minister-president of 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.609
 state 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.829
 is based 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.089
 the volcano 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:18.579
 the judge quick eta 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.009
 when it was presented to him that he remembered himself 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:23.049
 I must say no 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.319
 I did not drop the file right away with the man and he reminded me 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.629
 and the world has lost clear that they justify the plane with bilbao 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.319
 to the good plant 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.579
 Chivas as senators increase and theories and simple 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.289
 I found out just not but it was a little bit lower than presiding 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:43.509
 we have expressed in Monaco also Creole years of the president 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.990
 also in 3d 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.030
 so good 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.329
 and the truth 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.879
 that we find here to estimate that this idea was born on that day 

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:54.589
 three years ago 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:55.819
 percent 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.229
 the youngest son of martÃ­n was 13 years old and has 16 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.669
 it's a very special anecdote that we have here 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.669
 among the 35 of 13 years who do not 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.709
 that date nobody 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.489
 you have to keep growing percent 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.889
 and six years and between them it would have been impossible to stretch 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.259
 and in 13 years 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:15.259
 the kiss 

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:17.659
 three years ago 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:18.480
 where 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.529
 I said 

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:23.929
 VICTOR raised the need to train human resources a constant 

00:04:23.929 --> 00:04:24.569
 interests 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:25.680
 week 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.620
 this is argentina lucila vit argentina and that the cellist is ruled 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.169
 this time in china you need macitoeros tournaments 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.889
 that you need specialized people pretended that they had been closed 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.740
 during the 90's and that we 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.449
 came back to me because we need about destiny reach us' 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.689
 the people who leave the technical schools 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.360
 and also the people who leave qualified for example in mechanical engineering 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.499
 electric engineering 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:56.230
 the growing demand for jobs 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.979
 throughout the industrial sector 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:03.120
 and specifically the automotive sector that's why this loan is signing now 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.120
 that very important 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.900
 and do some matrix 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.490
 in productivity 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.759
 and educational 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.309
 there productive that it is essential that you ventilate doing things and such 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:20.289
 in the countries 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.099
 production the economy 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.169

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.650
 audi and we're doing it from the republic that you have and what 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.710
 you are really I found out 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:32.879
 third 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:35.389
 this thematic diversity to see what is going 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:36.610
 culminate with 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.740
 the meeting Latin America not the reverse Latin Americans 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.719
 I feel very happy 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.719
 can have specified what 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:49.439
 first a talk a dream 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:52.439
 and that today is a reality 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:56.529
 college 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.360
 cunning engineers accomplices 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.250
 left must be fundamentally what we need the 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.610
 training 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.759

 to those who did not have 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:33.789
 education knowledge 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:37.199
 opportunity in life better than I are doing 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.449
 from the state the private sector something that also 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:42.229
 I want my brand

 education 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:45.740
 that will provide 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.880
 There are those who, in order to develop them, curricula for the teaching sector and the 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.270
 private sector that puts all the infrastructure and technology infrastructure 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:57.360
 to take away 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.349

 thank you very much to the palate 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.499
 could meet 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:04.219
 this talk and tcb tourisms 

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:05.069
 three years ago
