[bird singing]

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.600
[bird singing]

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.920
[bird singing]

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.920
FEMALE: Yosemite is just one of those places where

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.700
we can go and have natural soundscape of birds

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.820
that we might not think about it since we're looking for bears, 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.900
 or looking for waterfalls, 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.140
and if it were missing we would definitely notice

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.060
It would be a pretty boring Yosemite

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.460
without the birdsong.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.240
[bird singing]

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.080
[bird singing]

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.640
They are using their sight and they are using sound

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.489
to defend their territory and to interact with other birds, 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.080
but song for them is so much more effective. 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.820
They can broadcast out
their song and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.660
other birds are tuning into that song and know

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.240
Ok, that's that birds territory

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.120
[bird singing]

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.580
I picture it like a fence around a birds' territory, 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.280
a fence
of sound though,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.360
and if you pay attention to where a bird is

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.840
you can almost picture that fence around them.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.060
[bird singing]

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.220
[bird singing]

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.060
What we hear as these beautiful

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.760
melodic tributes to morning

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.900
and we write poetry about the bird song

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.060
sometimes it can be violence, sometimes it can be

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.160
deep rooted "This is my territory!"

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.980
but it's powerful stuff that singing.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.040
[bird singing]

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.700
STOCK: They work it out. They duke it out with their songs

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.740
we should all do that

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.020
that would be a better, more melodious world.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.900
Nice. Bullock's Oriole.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.120
Males of most species have one distinct song that they use

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.220
Regardless of whether their defending their territory

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.420
or attracting a female.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.360
but in North America, when we hear song, it's almost always the males.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.120
[bird singing]

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.480
[bird singing]

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.180
Picture a Cassin's Finch, singing this song that is elaborate

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.600
and it brings in all these sounds that he's heard through his life,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.800
and it can just go on an on. The longer the song is

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.200
the more fitness that male bird is showing.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.820
He's showing that he's got lung capacity that can do this.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.480
That tells the female birds that this is going to be a good mate for her,

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.340
a good father for her offspring.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.280
[bird singing]

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.300
[bird chirping]

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.040
STOCK: I think the diversity of birdsong is surprising to people

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.940
when they can start separating out the different songs

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.060
and the different calls. Ah, Brown-headed Cowbird!

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.040
[bird call]

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.440
Yellow-rumped Warbler just sang from over hear again.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.600
Song Sparrow.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.340
Yellow-rumped.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.640
Black-headed Grosbeak

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.820
[bird singing]

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.940
[bird singing]

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.360
The Yellow Warbler is singing his heart out over here.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.580
[bird singing]

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.280
MacGillivray's Warbler, singing from over there.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.200
[bird singing]

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.860
The Junco's are definitely up to something.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.300
Most of the Junco's at this point are nesting

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.420
and that's why were not hearing quite as much singing

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.280
of Junco's anymore, because they're focused on nesting activities.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.320
Although the male, he will definitely bust out in song

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.000
if he hear's another Junco singing

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.780
because they're still defending their territories.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.920
[bird singing]

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.040
[bird singing]

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.820
[bird singing]

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.280
[bird singing]

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.560
AMSTUTZ: And the Hermit Thrush, maybe the most complex song.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.600
They use two notes at the same time.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.320
[bird singing]

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.260
and that's a song that literally seems to turn on

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.760
at the start of the breeding season in the high country

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.500
and then one day it's done

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.300
and you feel like "Ah, summer's over."

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.200
[bird singing]

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.180
[bird calling]

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.540
STOCK: Most birds do have like an agitation call.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.060
[bird calls]

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.040
So if somebody, like a predator or one of us humans gets too close to their nest

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.700
They'll give this little agitation call, it's usually like a single note that's kind of harsh.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.340
That's your warning, like "Get away from the nest!"

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.860
AMSTUTZ: When we tune into birds and we hear that emergency call

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.780
that a bird is doing in the forest, it makes us look

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.880
whether we're conscious of it or not.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.040
Maybe it's a primitive part of us that really gets to tune in

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.000
and once we do there's a level of excitement to experiencing

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.220
a natural or wild place like Yosemite that we'll feel

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.840
something deeper than we would otherwise.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.160
