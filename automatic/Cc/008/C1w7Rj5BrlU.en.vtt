00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.160
 Tell me, whats the beauty of youtube? 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.630
 plus a video of the tutorials channel and 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.980
 I'm going to make a video here a little. 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.020
 different today 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.830
 I'm going to use it to test the 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.100
 my new headphones I bought for 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.530
 improve the violas and clarify 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.610
 here there is doubt of a colleague who is the 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.140
 Christ 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:37.800
 he asked me the following question in the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.800
 Facebook 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.620
 then he saw my channel and how it has a 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.650
 video on windows 8 and is 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.220
 needing help to activate his 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:55.630
 which in the case is the previous release version 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:01:02.140
 8,400 good buddy unfortunately could not 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:05.040
 help because this version has no more 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.040
 she combative 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.120
 I did a search found here this 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:14.140
 site is a response community of the 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.150
 microsoft and has the same has one person 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.060
 that ask a question with that with that 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.500
 the same doubts of Christ, so that 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 I was able to take the windows 8 report 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.330
 previous 8400 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.729
 so the guy who gave the answer and he 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.700
 said that this version 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.590
 the beta version of windows 8 pro and no 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.840
 is more available at the moment 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.170
 then all the pounds in this version 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.159
 lose system functionality of 15 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.270
 of February 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.860
 today is February 20, 2013 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.549
 then that version lost its 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.590
 functionality is no longer combative 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.240
 sad beauty unfortunately i could not 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.340

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.420
 improvement in quality 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.700
