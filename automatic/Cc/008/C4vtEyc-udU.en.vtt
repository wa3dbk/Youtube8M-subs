00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
hi guys and this is my gravity team here

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.450 
hi guys and this is my gravity team here
and<00:00:03.840> yeah<00:00:06.200> it's<00:00:07.200> alright<00:00:07.950> team<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.250> suppose

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
them was worried I wanted to test out

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.730 
them was worried I wanted to test out
grab<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.940> easy<00:00:12.179> no<00:00:12.330> because<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> smoker<00:00:13.410> made<00:00:13.620> an

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
then when he switches on gravity or

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.029 
then when he switches on gravity or
still<00:00:49.440> fox<00:00:50.149> he<00:00:51.149> gets<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.539> first<00:00:52.500> time<00:00:52.680> wake<00:00:52.860> up

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.910 
still fox he gets a first time wake up
now<00:00:53.160> which<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.370> pretty<00:00:53.610> gay<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:54.920> I'm

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
just going to go and set up my gravity

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.340 
just going to go and set up my gravity
so<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.329> know<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.600> funner<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
so I know that funner is going to

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.819 
so I know that funner is going to

source<00:02:20.670> arts<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.180> mean<00:02:21.440> yes<00:02:22.440> or<00:02:22.620> science<00:02:22.920> but

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
source arts I mean yes or science but

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.890 
source arts I mean yes or science but
you<00:02:23.160> guys<00:02:23.250> for<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.459> iron<00:02:23.640> defense<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.240> when<00:02:24.870> I

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
you guys for the iron defense and when I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.170 
you guys for the iron defense and when I
mr.<00:02:25.140> mrs.<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.370> chose<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.790> go<00:02:26.880> for<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.120> again

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
mr. mrs. so I chose to go for it again

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.199 
mr. mrs. so I chose to go for it again
by<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:27.630> mrs.<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.640> that's<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.790> reason<00:02:29.910> why<00:02:30.180> I

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
by it mrs. and that's the reason why I

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.150 
by it mrs. and that's the reason why I
should<00:02:30.660> use<00:02:30.900> gravity<00:02:31.319> first<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.920> then<00:02:32.040> it

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
should use gravity first and then it

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.830 
should use gravity first and then it
misses<00:02:32.459> again<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:32.940> that's<00:02:33.060> three<00:02:33.330> times<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.750> a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
misses again so that's three times in a

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.040 
misses again so that's three times in a
row<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.739> was<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:34.920> like<00:02:35.130> oh<00:02:35.430> come<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:36.050> so

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
row and I was just like oh come on so

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.830 
row and I was just like oh come on so
yeah<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.380> finally<00:02:37.800> get<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.040> widow<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.430> off<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.000> he

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
yeah I finally get a widow is off and he

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.070 
yeah I finally get a widow is off and he
uses<00:02:40.140> an<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.440> ahead<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:40.920> doesn't<00:02:41.280> nothing

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
uses an I ahead and that doesn't nothing

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.470 
uses an I ahead and that doesn't nothing
i'm<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.140> going<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.500> go<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.000> sell<00:02:45.000> gravity

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
i'm just going to go and sell gravity

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.380 
i'm just going to go and sell gravity
now<00:02:46.100> finally<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:48.380> he's<00:02:49.380> going<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.400> don't

so yeah Georgie funders and yeah

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.460 
so yeah Georgie funders and yeah
seaking<00:03:38.310> dice<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:39.060> gravity<00:03:39.900> returns<00:03:40.200> to

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
seaking dice and gravity returns to

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.479 
seaking dice and gravity returns to
normal<00:03:40.680> it's<00:03:41.400> not<00:03:41.790> over<00:03:41.940> 9000<00:03:43.130> he<00:03:44.130> brings<00:03:44.340> it

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
normal it's not over 9000 he brings it

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.240 
normal it's not over 9000 he brings it
she<00:03:45.060> she<00:03:45.299> brings<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.660> Corsa<00:03:45.989> now<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.440> I'm<00:03:47.070> just

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
she she brings in Corsa now and I'm just

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.390 
she she brings in Corsa now and I'm just
going<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.519> go<00:03:47.640> pay<00:03:48.000> now<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:49.079> oh<00:03:49.350> my<00:03:50.010> god<00:03:50.250> I

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
going to go pay now that oh my god I

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.670 
going to go pay now that oh my god I
just<00:03:50.430> remembered<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:51.260> that's<00:03:52.260> an<00:03:52.380> excellent

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
just remembered that that's an excellent

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.920 
just remembered that that's an excellent
combo<00:03:53.160> course<00:03:53.519> along<00:03:53.760> with<00:03:53.820> that<00:03:54.209> wicket<00:03:54.840> to

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
combo course along with that wicket to

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.569 
combo course along with that wicket to
believe<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.320> ability<00:03:56.010> that<00:03:56.130> boosted's

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
believe that ability that boosted's

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.270 
believe that ability that boosted's
attack<00:03:56.910> but<00:03:57.359> reduces<00:03:58.049> it<00:03:58.200> its<00:03:58.620> accuracy<00:03:58.950> but

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
attack but reduces it its accuracy but

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.949 
attack but reduces it its accuracy but
with<00:03:59.430> gravity<00:03:59.790> and<00:03:59.910> play<00:04:00.060> they'll<00:04:00.720> make<00:04:00.930> it

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
with gravity and play they'll make it

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.289 
with gravity and play they'll make it
back<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.440> normal<00:04:01.769> so<00:04:02.400> figure<00:04:02.670> their<00:04:02.850> sexiness

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
back to normal so figure their sexiness

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.759 
back to normal so figure their sexiness
of<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.750> or<00:04:04.109> corsola<00:04:04.829> we<00:04:05.340> like<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:06.769> incredible

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
of that or corsola we like a incredible

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.650 
of that or corsola we like a incredible
attack<00:04:08.780> gravity<00:04:09.920> wow<00:04:11.090> that's<00:04:12.090> what<00:04:12.359> I've

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
attack gravity wow that's what I've

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.300 
attack gravity wow that's what I've
forgot<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.350> do<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.500> I'm<00:04:13.950> going<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.160> have<00:04:14.220> to

of<00:04:18.299> thoughts<00:04:18.479> and<00:04:19.260> I'm<00:04:19.440> going<00:04:19.650> with<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.799> camera

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
of thoughts and I'm going with a camera

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.790 
of thoughts and I'm going with a camera
so<00:04:20.840> yeah<00:04:21.840> I<00:04:22.080> just<00:04:22.229> go<00:04:22.500> for<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.770> gravity<00:04:23.430> again

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
so yeah I just go for the gravity again

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.270 
so yeah I just go for the gravity again
and<00:04:25.340> or<00:04:25.940> do<00:04:26.210> I<00:04:26.270> know<00:04:26.389> that<00:04:26.720> I<00:04:26.840> think<00:04:27.139> I<00:04:27.259> do<00:04:27.319> are

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
and or do I know that I think I do are

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.529 
and or do I know that I think I do are
you<00:04:28.490> turn<00:04:28.759> predicting<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:31.000> predicting<00:04:32.000> uh<00:04:32.180> I

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
you turn predicting the predicting uh I

you turn predicting the predicting uh I
don't<00:04:33.110> know<00:04:33.289> something<00:04:34.129> he<00:04:35.030> goes<00:04:35.060> by<00:04:35.300> amnesia

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:35.629 
don't know something he goes by amnesia

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.320 
don't know something he goes by amnesia
I<00:04:35.990> see<00:04:36.409> so<00:04:37.400> yeah<00:04:37.580> I'm<00:04:37.699> just<00:04:37.849> going<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.000> go<00:04:38.120> for

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
I see so yeah I'm just going to go for

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.350 
I see so yeah I'm just going to go for
my<00:04:38.360> stab<00:04:38.900> like<00:04:39.250> super<00:04:40.250> duper<00:04:41.319> Mike<00:04:42.319> and<00:04:43.360> yeah

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
my stab like super duper Mike and yeah

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.180 
my stab like super duper Mike and yeah
that<00:04:44.690> is<00:04:44.870> going<00:04:45.319> to<00:04:45.440> kill<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.889> swallow

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
that is going to kill the swallow

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.749 
that is going to kill the swallow
because<00:04:46.789> that<00:04:47.180> is<00:04:47.300> emitting<00:04:47.840> powerful<00:04:48.759> and

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
because that is emitting powerful and

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.909 
because that is emitting powerful and
yeah<00:04:50.419> he's<00:04:51.020> just<00:04:51.050> left<00:04:51.379> with<00:04:51.470> more<00:04:51.560> while<00:04:51.740> now

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
yeah he's just left with more while now

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.399 
yeah he's just left with more while now
and<00:04:52.190> I<00:04:52.610> was<00:04:53.120> quite<00:04:53.330> surprised<00:04:53.659> that<00:04:56.169> way<00:04:57.169> why

and I was quite surprised that way why
should<00:04:57.620> I<00:04:57.680> be<00:04:57.800> surprised<00:04:58.370> it<00:04:58.639> had<00:04:58.789> intimidate

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
should I be surprised it had intimidate

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.659 
should I be surprised it had intimidate
on<00:04:59.509> me<00:04:59.659> so<00:05:00.500> yeah<00:05:00.680> at<00:05:00.979> the<00:05:01.099> moment<00:05:01.250> in<00:05:01.430> time<00:05:01.520> was
