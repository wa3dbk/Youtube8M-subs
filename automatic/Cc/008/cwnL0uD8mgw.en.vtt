00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
there so as I go what I will do with

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.920 
there so as I go what I will do with
some<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.579> those<00:01:56.700> straight<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.479> probably

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
some of those straight here is probably

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.350 
some of those straight here is probably
most<00:01:58.170> likely<00:01:58.500> kind<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.070> trim<00:01:59.250> them<00:01:59.399> off<00:01:59.549> if<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
most likely kind of trim them off if the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.780 
most likely kind of trim them off if the
sister<00:02:00.719> lock<00:02:00.899> does<00:02:01.290> not<00:02:01.500> hold<00:02:01.799> up<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:02.549> however

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
sister lock does not hold up but however

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.969 
sister lock does not hold up but however
I<00:02:03.119> know<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.600> system<00:02:03.960> lock<00:02:04.110> will<00:02:04.350> hold<00:02:04.590> up<00:02:04.770> for

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
I know the system lock will hold up for

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.940 
I know the system lock will hold up for
that<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.460> um<00:02:06.240> if<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.049> notice<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.560> back<00:02:07.770> of

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
that and um if you notice the back of
