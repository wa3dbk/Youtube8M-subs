00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 in positive what we should have in 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.470
 our house that are small items 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.610
 that are simpler than one can have 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.410
 but that really is going to be an effect 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.700
 very positive also in your life in your 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.350
 home 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.680
 let's talk first about the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.320
 plants the plants are very important 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.300
 that one has them inside the house already 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.490
 we also speak in relation to you 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.619
 remember the castros and the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.009
 gomeros of the numbers that will be seen in 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.559
 the clear plant must have outside not 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.870
 inside the house this plant 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.910
 It is a very positive plant too 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.649
 then the plants are showing it 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.120
 that they must have that they should not have to the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.809
 street that campus 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.809
 dollar 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.930
 well taken care of as she is 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.660
 well maintained that has enough life that 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.570
 it also attracts prosperity to within 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.239
 of the home of truth of preference that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.210
 the entrance of the house or also in the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.170
 room already but 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.990
 It starts in the kitchen and the bathroom, not because 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.210
 one in the kitchen can change the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.210
 kitchen let's say in an environment that 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.800
 we consider very prosperous 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.200
 common environments where it's like where 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.270
 family meets or tea meets and 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.030
 where we say is generated more the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.149
 prosperity the bathrooms we seal well 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.000
 that this plant should not have 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.830
 let's say to inside the bathroom because the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.229
 intention is attracted that that kind of 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.690
 positive things we can find or 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.149
 can result from having for example a 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.030
 plant like this one of prologar looks at the 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.429
 positive that she absorbs the plant 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.060
 of absorbs always that transmutes the 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:50.340
 energy even when we have problems 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.080
 both in the office and at home and 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.659
 that you do not have how to solve 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.970
 Certain problems place the 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.920
 plants because they are going to alleviate the 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.140
 problem that can be is to say 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.300
 transmute because they transform the bad into 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.300
 good in recycling cycle actions 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.670
 let's also talk about the famous 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:17.400
 elephant and the elephant he has let's say 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.569
 many many functions the elephant the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.450
 protects families the telos the shelf 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.880
 a classic if he loses him front he has 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.670
 the idea that it protects the family very 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.709
 protector then brings protection to the 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.260
 family section in what way by 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.000
 care facility care 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.050
 family do not get robbed he wants 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.360
 show of having good relationship and of 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.160
 be attentive in the ies with armani not 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.100
 allows the danger 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.870
 I have an elephant but he is alone 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.130
 no contact is that I have always been 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.989
 said that the lens you have to have them 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.060
 looking north it is true he 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.680
 he has to be at the door for this 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.980
 I even had it backwards 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.870
 input input let's say for 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.380
 inside because all the symbology 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.840
 of the elephant and as well as the leather 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.060
 of the elephant that represents even 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.700
 protection against bad energy because 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.360
 as it is very thick or everything is slipping 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.770
 all 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.830
 for that we have to do it from the back 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.200
 I'm going back to the company to take the 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.880
 put elephant yes sure I've heard 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.010
 that you had to have him always watching 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.810
 towards the window north to the window 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.820
 of deer to say and let's say 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.420
 preference that he has not entered from 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.840
 the house with the little one for the door already 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.760
 the trunk for inside the house and 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.120
 preference when we want to work 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.370
 for the money we are going to take the ticket 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.180
 always in this position with the little face 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.580
 for the outside we doubled it in this sense 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.580
 then in the other direction and there 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.390
 the fatima ticket because the higher 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.300
 the amount of the ticket obviously the hand 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.030
 I'm attracting how much money is missing 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.510
 take away the crutch do well 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.640
 you can suddenly one take out and put another 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.160
 let's say as you go 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.769
 receiving and because the trap because it's going 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.000
 really in the ivory his teeth that 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.180
 it's never worth 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.230
 then family production parts 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.230
 spiritual and also
