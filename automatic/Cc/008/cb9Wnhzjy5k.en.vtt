00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.570
 debt the criteria applied 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.700
 I have% to 3 per year we hope per linear meter 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.580
 for now I'm in a period of transition it's to fuss this 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.849
 distress 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.050
 the famous mall at 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.580
 it's a lot of magic to believe coffee 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.769
 the prefect 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.349
 I never knew it was the best he could 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:26.300
 I also have crimes 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.739
 the same starting 27 years ago 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.510
 and for 110 kg 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.610
 really paid attention to my lifestyle I decided that I 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.720
 wanted 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.010
 all three this 3-1 ask for the following three months 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.720
 here are some clichÃ©s on the head and I ended up with a 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.040
 deputies every six months hillary clinton called the employees 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.690
 could then traces are right now 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.379
 for his part the president of c 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.859
 what to be proud of 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.219
 and now the merignac suicide he did not deserve he's all 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.909
 simply a group of miramas 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.130
 the return match 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.740
 dTC 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.240
 as soon as natural simply I think through blogs the 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.610
 moms at the clinic 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.610
 at the moment 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.350
 jerry leiber &amp; b 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.840
 it's not me 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.280
 percent he said on cafes like me 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.970

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.050
 ace hood i'm just going to gorgeous 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.790
 and certainly also to have a good abbas who made believe at retirement 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.030
 maintained hope for me that's how it's just not possible to have 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.100
 the hair 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.430
 culture 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.200
 g in slow motion 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.850

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.350

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.020
 you risk not special knowledge but percent 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.039
 and here it is it will be just the video the end 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.360
 you will allow me to quote a sawtooth evolution 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.680
 because 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.110
 p if the adventurous not in a dam is ready for the intimate moment and then 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.349
 for shooting 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.530
 I finished a circuit 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.820
 so here are the majority of the questions remains to know for 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.029
 % 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.279
 the bishop does m 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.349
 see to it that you did it the same way 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.279
 where is the mistake the people who threw stones 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:33.559
 is this the same effect for what you put in a living room if the four 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:36.299
 appliances per year 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.870
 on the other hand of he did 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.459

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.459
 the film had been advanced wauquiez 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:49.349
 from each other the question would be addressed each case what should a 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.479
 try is apparently killed next to the show 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:54.559
 where is the 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:57.059
 we see immediately after some advisers 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:01.680

 besides videos of people 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.259
