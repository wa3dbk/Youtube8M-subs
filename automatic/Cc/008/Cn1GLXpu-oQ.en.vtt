ah<00:02:23.080> what<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.070> again<00:02:24.310> call<00:02:24.880> it<00:02:25.030> instinct

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
ah what is it again call it instinct

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.200 
ah what is it again call it instinct
it's<00:02:26.110> also<00:02:26.320> hard<00:02:26.710> science<00:02:27.250> hmm<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
it's also hard science hmm the

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.970 
it's also hard science hmm the
accelerating<00:02:28.810> body<00:02:28.960> is<00:02:29.170> far<00:02:29.350> more<00:02:29.530> difficult

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
accelerating body is far more difficult

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.010 
accelerating body is far more difficult
to<00:02:30.070> stop<00:02:30.250> then<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.610> inert<00:02:30.850> one<00:02:31.030> no<00:02:31.750> one<00:02:31.900> else

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
to stop then the inert one no one else

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.180 
to stop then the inert one no one else
is<00:02:32.200> difficult<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.740> stop

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
is difficult to stop

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.520 
is difficult to stop

where's slimy creatures have us trapped
not<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.480> prob<00:03:10.900> we'll<00:03:11.470> let<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.740> fry<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.190> robot

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
not a prob we'll let you fry the robot

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.990 
not a prob we'll let you fry the robot
and<00:03:12.940> shut<00:03:13.240> them<00:03:13.450> off<00:03:13.600> or<00:03:13.980> we<00:03:14.980> could<00:03:15.250> use<00:03:15.550> their
