toes but that new are one I got really
has<00:02:29.950> inspired<00:02:30.430> me<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.849> ride<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.060> little<00:02:31.239> harder

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
has inspired me to ride a little harder

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.350 
has inspired me to ride a little harder
so<00:02:32.220> as<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.490> can<00:02:32.580> see<00:02:32.640> we've<00:02:33.000> been<00:02:33.030> touching

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
so as you can see we've been touching

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.330 
so as you can see we've been touching
down<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.780> little<00:02:33.990> bit<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.890> can<00:02:34.980> see<00:02:35.040> they

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
down a little bit and you can see they

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.380 
down a little bit and you can see they
wear<00:02:35.670> quite<00:02:36.210> nicely<00:02:36.990> so<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.380> like<00:02:37.710> that

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
wear quite nicely so I like that

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.420 
wear quite nicely so I like that
something<00:02:39.390> else<00:02:39.600> I've<00:02:39.840> noticed<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
something else I've noticed is the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.100 
something else I've noticed is the
shifter<00:02:42.270> pad<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.710> a<00:02:43.890> very<00:02:44.340> pliable<00:02:45.110> soft

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
shifter pad this is a very pliable soft

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.780 
shifter pad this is a very pliable soft
material<00:02:46.830> it's<00:02:46.920> meant<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.160> protect<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.580> boot

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
material it's meant to protect the boot

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.540 
material it's meant to protect the boot
it<00:02:48.390> really<00:02:48.840> enhanced<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.500> feel<00:02:49.740> for<00:02:50.040> me<00:02:50.220> with

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
it really enhanced the feel for me with

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.070 
it really enhanced the feel for me with
the<00:02:50.730> shifter<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.210> I<00:02:51.270> think<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.660> made<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.960> even

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
the shifter and I think it made it even

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.980 
the shifter and I think it made it even
easier<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.770> ride<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.610> motorcycle<00:02:53.990> having

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
easier to ride the motorcycle having

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.590 
easier to ride the motorcycle having
that<00:02:55.140> there<00:02:55.460> the<00:02:56.460> inside<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.270> boot<00:02:57.420> and

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
that there the inside of the boot and

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.570 
that there the inside of the boot and
this<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.840> really<00:02:58.140> important<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.950> inside<00:02:59.430> of

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
this is really important the inside of

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.030 
this is really important the inside of
the<00:02:59.640> boot<00:02:59.850> is<00:03:00.080> clean<00:03:01.080> okay<00:03:01.680> there<00:03:01.860> are<00:03:01.890> no
