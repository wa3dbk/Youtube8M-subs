00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.940 
and I think most people know if you if
you're<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.690> nine-to-five<00:00:13.080> job<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.740> want<00:00:13.920> to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
and weekends but the reason why we say

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.010 
and weekends but the reason why we say
five<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.020> nine<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.439> this<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.680> whole<00:00:21.020> community

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
because it represents the discipline

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
business cultural mentors you can be

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.310 
business cultural mentors you can be
glad<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> put<00:01:09.450> somebody<00:01:09.780> else<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.170> if<00:01:10.260> you

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
glad to put somebody else but if you

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.780 
glad to put somebody else but if you
don't<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.619> one<00:01:10.650> needs<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.430> learn<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.640> be

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
don't have one needs to learn to be

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.280 
don't have one needs to learn to be
accountable<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> yourself<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.750> some<00:01:12.930> regard

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
accountable to yourself in some regard

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.460 
accountable to yourself in some regard
and<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.970> idea<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.689> exercise<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
and so the idea is that you exercise the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.950 
and so the idea is that you exercise the
same<00:01:16.500> discipline<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.030> would<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.509> you're

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
same discipline that you would if you're

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.390 
same discipline that you would if you're
in<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.080> 95<00:01:19.439> job<00:01:19.470> now<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.799> reason<00:01:20.040> why<00:01:20.250> that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
in a 95 job now the reason why that

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.260 
in a 95 job now the reason why that
difficult<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.299> because<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> same<00:01:22.350> 24<00:01:22.920> hour

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
difficult is because in the same 24 hour

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.350 
difficult is because in the same 24 hour
time<00:01:24.270> span<00:01:24.509> your<00:01:25.380> brain<00:01:26.189> has<00:01:26.729> got<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.000> operate

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
time span your brain has got to operate

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.170 
time span your brain has got to operate
in<00:01:27.509> two<00:01:27.689> different<00:01:27.869> ways<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.460> 95<00:01:29.970> you're

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
in two different ways so in a 95 you're

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.609 
in two different ways so in a 95 you're
being<00:01:30.420> told<00:01:30.659> what<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:31.140> you're<00:01:31.409> being

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
being told what to do you're being

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.350 
being told what to do you're being
directed<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> boss<00:01:33.030> or<00:01:33.180> all<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
directed and you have a boss or all the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.240 
directed and you have a boss or all the
rest<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.079> when<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.380> get<00:01:34.619> home<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.040> your

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
rest of it and when you get home to your

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.850 
rest of it and when you get home to your
529<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.509> do<00:01:36.750> now<00:01:36.960> mentally<00:01:37.530> got<00:01:37.710> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
529 you do now mentally got to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.819 
529 you do now mentally got to
completely<00:01:38.640> flip<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.119> around<00:01:39.180> yeah<00:01:39.960> um<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
completely flip that around yeah um and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.800 
completely flip that around yeah um and
it's<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.159> easy<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.420> million

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
it's not easy you can have million
