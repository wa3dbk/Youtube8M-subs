00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 to do exercises remove flaccidity 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.990
 raise a muscle I'll tell you here 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.630
 after age 30 all 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.690
 we lose approximately 500 grams of 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.450
 muscle mass and we turn it into the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.090
 rather the other way around we lost 500 grams 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.119
 of muscle and we turn it into fat that 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.960
 happens the metabolism slows down is a 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.910
 inch we almost lose muscle and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.800
 we earn it in fat then these two 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.300
 exercise that we are going to do today that the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.610
 first it's going to be baby broncos that are 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.050
 caballitos and the second grasshopper is going to 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.149
 help speed up the metabolism and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.579
 work the whole body are pretty 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.550
 strong but you can do it with all the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.950
 family on the beach in the park where 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.410
 you are now on vacation the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.820
 first is the little horse 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.750
 he puts like this with his hands up 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.750
 we go down 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.440
 and we return 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.660
 and we return 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.660
 let's see 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.560
 exact here we work arms let's go 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.930
 new arm back chest and especially 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.730
 cardiovascular system 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.890
 something that asks me a lot people are 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.930
 how to build muscle the muscle 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.120
 develops with proteins we have to 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.560
 consume more protein and less 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.000
 refined carbohydrates what is the 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.310
 protein turkey fish meat I do not know by 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.520
 example the vegetables the pins the wines 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.520
 chichas peas are the teachers 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.920
 sorry the second peas is Argentine 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.660
 the second the second exercise that is 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.200
 the grasshopper is one that I like 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.630
 a lot and it's the next with the feet of 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.070
 this way open we're going towards 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.260
 ahead 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.260
 and we make it like a lizard 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.600
 two 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.420
 again 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.340
 yes 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.670
 then we are working legs 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.830
 let's go again leg 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.850
 equally all the arms with the 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.640
 dominated 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.459
 we do squats and I put him on the grass 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.360
 for the way they work and locate the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.680
 legs 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.470
 I want us to place our legs and 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.910
 arms in this way we go down we do 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.590
 down 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.440
 and we go back and up 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.080
 very good for you to see again 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.690
 this exercise can be done by any 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.840
 family member because because 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.560
 You can make a minimum of 8 players to 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.790
 15 reps it 's important that you go 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.400
 little by little I see how the rhythm rises 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.530
 heart why because greatly accelerates 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.140
 metabolism and you're going to feel the wear 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.150
 after training if you should eat 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.300
 proteins so good training 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.640
 and then consume more protein and less 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.200
 carbohydrates so I'm diego 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.660
 demarcated I want you to choose to be well and 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.940
 remember more small changes in your life 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.940
 and you will get great results
