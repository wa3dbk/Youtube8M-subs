00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560 

Oh

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.870 

this<00:00:04.529> is<00:00:04.860> problem<00:00:05.730> number<00:00:05.760> two<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:07.140> first

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
this is problem number two the first

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.030 
this is problem number two the first
real<00:00:08.880> problem<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:10.099> tried<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.280> find<00:00:11.690> some<00:00:13.040> nice

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
real problem I tried to find some nice

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.580 
real problem I tried to find some nice
combinations<00:00:14.790> that's<00:00:15.859> suitable<00:00:16.859> for<00:00:18.590> for

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
combinations that's suitable for for

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.620 
combinations that's suitable for for
this<00:00:19.770> kind<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.010> exercise<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:20.760> my<00:00:20.970> recent<00:00:21.390> games

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
this kind of exercise in my recent games

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.000 
this kind of exercise in my recent games
but<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.830> not<00:00:23.070> easy<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:25.500> ones<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.949> could

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
but it's not easy and the ones I could

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.980 
but it's not easy and the ones I could
think<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.940> couldn't<00:00:27.330> remember<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
think of I couldn't remember the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.560 
think of I couldn't remember the
solution<00:00:28.199> myself<00:00:29.100> so<00:00:31.309> instead<00:00:32.570> there's

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
solution myself so instead there's

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.860 
solution myself so instead there's
there's<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.379> lot<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:35.510> there<00:00:36.510> were<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.629> lot<00:00:36.839> of

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
there's a lot of there were a lot of

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.319 
there's a lot of there were a lot of
nice<00:00:37.260> combinations<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.339> my<00:00:38.670> games<00:00:38.940> from<00:00:41.329> 10

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
nice combinations in my games from 10

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.779 
nice combinations in my games from 10
years<00:00:42.569> ago<00:00:42.749> or<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.420> this<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.629> one<00:00:46.019> of<00:00:46.139> them

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
years ago or so and this is one of them

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
years ago or so and this is one of them
a<00:00:47.789> black<00:00:48.389> like<00:00:48.839> to<00:00:49.049> play<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:50.299> is<00:00:51.299> a<00:00:51.329> pawn<00:00:51.600> up

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
a black like to play like is a pawn up

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.680 
a black like to play like is a pawn up
but<00:00:52.769> the<00:00:53.010> knight<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.460> stranded<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.359> need<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
but the knight is stranded so we need to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:04.360 
but the knight is stranded so we need to
find<00:00:54.929> a<00:00:55.519> radical<00:00:56.519> solution

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.780 

you

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.170 

at<00:01:09.270> an<00:01:09.510> early<00:01:09.600> age<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.620> many<00:01:10.860> others<00:01:11.220> learned

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
at an early age I as many others learned

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.330 
at an early age I as many others learned
that<00:01:12.480> the<00:01:12.630> first<00:01:12.870> thing<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.860> should<00:01:13.890> examine

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that the first thing you should examine

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.390 
that the first thing you should examine
in<00:01:14.940> a<00:01:14.970> position<00:01:15.510> is<00:01:15.900> possible<00:01:16.590> captures<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
in a position is possible captures and

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.860 
in a position is possible captures and
possible<00:01:17.790> checks<00:01:18.120> and<00:01:19.550> for<00:01:20.550> black<00:01:21.030> here<00:01:21.390> there

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
possible checks and for black here there

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.700 
possible checks and for black here there
are<00:01:22.080> not<00:01:23.040> many<00:01:23.250> captures<00:01:23.850> available<00:01:24.660> and<00:01:24.870> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
are not many captures available and the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.640 
are not many captures available and the
only<00:01:25.830> capture<00:01:26.160> is<00:01:26.460> possible<00:01:27.200> lose<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.230> piece

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
only capture is possible lose a piece

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.750 
only capture is possible lose a piece
and<00:01:29.660> once<00:01:30.660> we<00:01:30.990> start<00:01:31.410> examining<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:32.400> checks

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
and once we start examining the checks

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.850 
and once we start examining the checks
we<00:01:33.690> find<00:01:34.050> really<00:01:35.030> only<00:01:36.030> two<00:01:36.480> checks<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:37.380> of

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
we find really only two checks one of

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.600 
we find really only two checks one of
them<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.550> drops<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.060> night<00:01:39.470> but<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:41.460> other

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
them just drops a night but the other

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.710 
them just drops a night but the other
one<00:01:41.910> is<00:01:42.590> much<00:01:43.590> better<00:01:45.410> now<00:01:46.410> as<00:01:46.950> soon<00:01:47.820> soon<00:01:48.540> as

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
one is much better now as soon soon as

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.410 
one is much better now as soon soon as
we<00:01:48.870> discover<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.920> move<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.910> know<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.240> it's

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
we discover this move we know that it's

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.680 
we discover this move we know that it's
the<00:01:51.570> right<00:01:51.720> solution<00:01:52.730> since<00:01:53.730> then<00:01:54.240> we<00:01:54.480> see

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
the right solution since then we see

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.810 
the right solution since then we see
that<00:01:54.900> when<00:01:55.740> white<00:01:56.580> takes<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:58.710> Queen<00:01:59.010> which<00:01:59.790> is

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
that when white takes the Queen which is

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.870 
that when white takes the Queen which is
forced<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.690> have<00:02:00.900> rook<00:02:01.560> over<00:02:01.800> here<00:02:02.250> with

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
forced we have rook over here with

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.910 
forced we have rook over here with
checkmate<00:02:03.450> because<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:04.230> knight<00:02:04.440> core<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
checkmate because the knight core is the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.900 
checkmate because the knight core is the
only<00:02:05.690> escape<00:02:06.690> square
