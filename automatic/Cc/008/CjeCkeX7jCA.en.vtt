fly<00:01:38.109> away<00:01:38.350> so<00:01:38.409> I<00:01:38.649> just<00:01:39.219> pulled<00:01:39.700> out<00:01:39.969> some<00:01:40.420> of<00:01:40.569> my

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:40.749 
fly away so I just pulled out some of my

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:43.109 
fly away so I just pulled out some of my
own<00:01:40.929> here<00:01:41.590> at<00:01:41.679> the<00:01:41.770> front<00:01:42.009> here<00:01:42.159> yeah<00:01:42.880> there's

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
own here at the front here yeah there's

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.510 
own here at the front here yeah there's
pretty<00:01:43.329> much<00:01:43.389> it<00:01:43.689> is<00:01:43.990> not<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.380> lot<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:44.889> except

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
pretty much it is not a lot to it except

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.559 
pretty much it is not a lot to it except
it's<00:01:45.670> better<00:01:45.729> if<00:01:45.939> you<00:01:46.030> have<00:01:46.119> long<00:01:46.299> here

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
it's better if you have long here

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:49.529 
it's better if you have long here

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
because mine goes thin and doesn't look

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.469 
because mine goes thin and doesn't look
as<00:01:49.659> good<00:01:49.810> ok<00:01:50.530> as<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:50.829> can<00:01:51.039> tell<00:01:51.429> i<00:01:51.700> also<00:01:51.999> did

down and tug them to give them a little

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.839 
down and tug them to give them a little
bit<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.780> oomph<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.349> that's<00:02:23.069> really<00:02:23.370> basically

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
bit of oomph and that's really basically

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.180 
bit of oomph and that's really basically
it<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.480> would<00:02:24.810> recommend<00:02:24.989> something<00:02:25.410> hair<00:02:26.010> ties

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
it I would recommend something hair ties

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.740 
it I would recommend something hair ties
with<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.489> little<00:02:26.760> more<00:02:26.880> substance<00:02:27.120> than<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
with a little more substance than the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.380 
with a little more substance than the
elastic<00:02:28.140> ones<00:02:28.260> are<00:02:28.500> used<00:02:28.770> because<00:02:29.390> they

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
elastic ones are used because they

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.260 
elastic ones are used because they
didn't<00:02:30.810> pull<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.440> tight<00:02:31.890> enough<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.400> they

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
didn't pull in tight enough and they

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.600 
didn't pull in tight enough and they
would<00:02:33.390> have<00:02:33.510> snapped<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:33.989> I'd<00:02:34.110> done<00:02:34.349> them

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
would have snapped if I'd done them

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.610 
would have snapped if I'd done them
twice<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.120> they<00:02:36.840> really<00:02:37.050> weren't<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.470> best

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
twice so they really weren't the best

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.699 
twice so they really weren't the best
