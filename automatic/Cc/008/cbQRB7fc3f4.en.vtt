00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 who actually has a clear cut 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.230
 commanders are in tyrol scenarios and 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.050
 wall was painted 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.519
 Now only endgames if I am 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.180
 with ner blue skirts were my lies the 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.180
 headline class sometimes she has 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.580
 his series horse delicious system 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.619
 spoken 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.099
 It is effective so it is precipitation 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.670
 want 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:35.430
 there is nothing to do but goal is 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:38.280
 clear the site again village here 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.399
 that means the location of the ferries 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.780
 to make eon and in order to 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.399
 accomplish world trade fair 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.010
 but it would be felling 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.989
 actually the activities through very 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.579
 high seventies reference to ritz and 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.969
 defined and right in all areas 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.190
 critical in question what are we going to do 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.750
 Doing everything right properly 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.960
 and finally the corresponding ones 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.700
 make decisions 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.659
 the proposal saucers occurs 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.659
 everything from the base 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.140
 that would be so more than the revenues 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.659
 without clear cutting 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.460
 what does the interest rates want ? 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:27.020
 exempted wants me out of it conditionally 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.869
 to the location factor of the wave that 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.780
 facebook-account it's against reading 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.829
 be in the rhythm of the day informatik now 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.750
 time here the board of directors can sit 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.479
 the joke hangs with the location 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.630
 busy to be said and we clearly 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.970
 that says hecka from kbc so this one 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.490
 location on the oberwerth under the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.560
 condition that the war which implement 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.290
 what he has promised now goes and me 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.600
 believe the fact that the reading 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.990
 namely decide relatively quickly 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.219
 after that that would be wrong because that is 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.680
 He is now focused on that 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:10.649
 already see the pull shows 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:32.819
 actually that you need situation 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:37.019
 i have the energy the kids then 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.780
 Look what we think about that there I am 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.819
 now an embassy is clear if I am 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.980
 knows that language will be explained 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.840
 but I know that actually is 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.840
 the ideal conditions 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.910
 after i am here in control 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.760
 an activity was started for the 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.200
 Energy situation restructured and 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.540
 I believe that I am a one-time 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.540
 chance to counter everything clear 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.420
 the location is ethical and final 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.970
 Chance gives and what he said in the result 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:19.460
 meanwhile he is not better but rather 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:24.950
 because finally waiting for her 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:27.760
 provocative joke fish as blu rays of 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:33.310
 customers but oswald and additive 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:40.010
 Competitors like to toy with us 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:42.470
 the peak in 2002 , he is weak 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.800
 the petrol engine but firmly 100 percent 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:50.720
 and one of the most important 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.860
 prerequisite for the nonsense managed 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.320
 I'm timing it 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.760
 it is absolutely necessary that we do that 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.310
 Timing runs like it does now 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.200
 We planned to do it as soon as possible 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:05.840
 but internally and externally displaced the 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.840
 viva la gare religion for sure 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:13.400
 make that the corresponding projects 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:16.489
 tensions investments and oestrich 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.890
 So investments like to go 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.190
 as before the military service to 100 million 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.870
 a year ago when he was with his 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.480
 last year were the fewest wants to 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:32.090
 were regularly invested specifically 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.850
 new brand new thing still brings fish 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.670
 In turn, we say opportunity gives one 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.790
 to create a position 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:44.630
 no galling choice that i take you and 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:51.940
 Now you can say that I am in mine 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.940
 most beautiful years now that we are the things 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:36.370
 actually index lost and hit 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.370
 for me there are very canonical 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.660
 made 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.590
 Thank you very much
