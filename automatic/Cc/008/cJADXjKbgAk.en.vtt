hi<00:00:01.709> I<00:00:01.740> had<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.270> code<00:00:03.270> 12<00:00:03.780> on<00:00:04.259> my<00:00:04.589> rear<00:00:05.279> ABS<00:00:06.170> Rab

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
hi I had a code 12 on my rear ABS Rab

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.289 
hi I had a code 12 on my rear ABS Rab
system<00:00:07.830> on<00:00:08.069> my<00:00:09.260> Ford<00:00:10.260> Ranger<00:00:10.500> truck<00:00:11.120> 1994<00:00:12.349> so<00:00:13.349> I

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
system on my Ford Ranger truck 1994 so I

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.430 
system on my Ford Ranger truck 1994 so I
found<00:00:15.299> out<00:00:15.420> what<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.630> problem<00:00:15.990> was<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
found out what the problem was the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.429 
found out what the problem was the
problem<00:00:16.830> was<00:00:17.119> over<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.420> on<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.869> master

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
problem was over here on the master

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.660 
problem was over here on the master
cylinder<00:00:21.470> his<00:00:22.470> three<00:00:22.740> wires<00:00:23.010> come<00:00:23.400> out<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
cylinder his three wires come out of the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.290 
cylinder his three wires come out of the
master<00:00:24.029> cylinder<00:00:24.210> connector<00:00:25.670> one<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.789> them<00:00:26.910> is

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
master cylinder connector one of them is

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.490 
master cylinder connector one of them is
a<00:00:28.039> green<00:00:29.039> wire<00:00:29.580> with<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> yellow<00:00:30.300> stripe<00:00:30.779> this

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
a green wire with a yellow stripe this

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.020 
a green wire with a yellow stripe this
third<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.420> well<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.719> connector<00:00:34.230> was<00:00:35.030> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
third one well this connector was the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.830 
third one well this connector was the
pin<00:00:36.300> inside<00:00:36.660> there<00:00:36.930> was<00:00:37.050> broken<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:38.489> just

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
pin inside there was broken so I just

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.299 
pin inside there was broken so I just
talked<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.989> little<00:00:40.050> bit<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> wire<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
talked a little bit on the wire and the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.010 
talked a little bit on the wire and the
whole<00:00:41.489> thing<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:42.270> fell<00:00:42.600> out<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
whole thing just fell out of the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.810 
whole thing just fell out of the
connector<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.219> was<00:00:44.340> barely<00:00:44.610> making

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
connector so it was barely making

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.799 
connector so it was barely making
contact<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> sensor<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.390> did<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
contact with with the sensor so I did a

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.369 
contact with with the sensor so I did a
real<00:00:49.110> cheap<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.860> dirty<00:00:50.100> fix<00:00:50.850> here<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:52.110> um

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
real cheap and dirty fix here I just um

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.720 
real cheap and dirty fix here I just um
I<00:00:53.149> cut<00:00:54.149> away<00:00:54.469> in<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.710> connector<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.280> totally

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
I cut away in this connector is totally

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.319 
I cut away in this connector is totally
wasted<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.930> other<00:00:58.079> part<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:59.100> know<00:00:59.219> as<00:01:00.090> this

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
wasted the other part you know as this

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.230 
wasted the other part you know as this
black<00:01:00.629> wire<00:01:00.899> over<00:01:01.230> here<00:01:01.579> connectors<00:01:02.600> broken

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
black wire over here connectors broken

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.390 
black wire over here connectors broken
but<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.420> melted<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.080> connector<00:01:07.740> until<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.130> could

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
but I melted the connector until I could

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.289 
but I melted the connector until I could
see<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.930> metal<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.560> pin<00:01:10.950> from<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> sensor

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
see the metal of the pin from the sensor

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.120 
see the metal of the pin from the sensor
and<00:01:12.540> then<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.640> soldered<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.619> what<00:01:16.619> was<00:01:16.740> left<00:01:16.950> of

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
and then I soldered the what was left of

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.090 
and then I soldered the what was left of
the<00:01:17.220> pin<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.790> side<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the pin on this side to this to the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.070 
the pin on this side to this to the
center<00:01:20.460> pin<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> just<00:01:21.420> started<00:01:21.750> these<00:01:21.869> two

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
center pin so I just started these two

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.230 
center pin so I just started these two
pieces<00:01:22.259> together<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.009> I'm<00:01:23.130> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.369> try<00:01:24.210> to

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
pieces together and I'm going to try to

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.149 
pieces together and I'm going to try to
um<00:01:25.520> maybe<00:01:26.520> give<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.710> some<00:01:28.710> strain<00:01:29.100> relief<00:01:29.460> by

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
um maybe give this some strain relief by

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.920 
um maybe give this some strain relief by
using<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.400> zip<00:01:32.610> tie<00:01:32.850> or<00:01:33.150> something<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.810> to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
using a zip tie or something just to

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.690 
using a zip tie or something just to
take<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> pressure<00:01:34.320> off<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.979> assembly<00:01:35.520> it's

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
take the pressure off this assembly it's

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.880 
take the pressure off this assembly it's
obviously<00:01:36.180> fragile<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.079> really<00:01:37.590> need<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> new

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
obviously fragile I really need a new

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.010 
obviously fragile I really need a new
new<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.850> don't<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.240> want<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.570> spend

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
new one but I don't really want to spend

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.830 
new one but I don't really want to spend
the<00:01:40.140> cash<00:01:40.320> right<00:01:40.710> now<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:44.240> yeah<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.630> I'm<00:01:45.689> going

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the cash right now so yeah so I'm going

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.149 
the cash right now so yeah so I'm going
to<00:01:45.899> do<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.079> try<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.530> take<00:01:46.710> all<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> pressure

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
to do just try to take all the pressure

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.899 
to do just try to take all the pressure
off<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.000> hopefully<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:49.729> quick<00:01:50.729> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
off this and hopefully this quick and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.929 
off this and hopefully this quick and
dirty<00:01:51.060> solder<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:51.990> well<00:01:52.549> we'll<00:01:53.549> take<00:01:53.700> care

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
dirty solder here well we'll take care

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.020 
dirty solder here well we'll take care
of<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.299> turn<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.439> turn<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.310> key<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
of it I turn I just turn the key and the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.300 
of it I turn I just turn the key and the
code<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.390> definitely<00:01:57.840> gone<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.770> need<00:01:59.130> to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
code is definitely gone I just need to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.069 
code is definitely gone I just need to
make<00:01:59.729> sure<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.210> connection<00:02:00.479> stays

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
make sure that that connection stays

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.969 
make sure that that connection stays
stable<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.759> yeah<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.420> was<00:02:03.630> code<00:02:03.869> 12<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.619> didn't

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
stable so yeah that was code 12 I didn't

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.510 
stable so yeah that was code 12 I didn't
really<00:02:05.130> need<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.310> do<00:02:05.520> anything<00:02:05.759> else<00:02:06.030> but<00:02:06.270> that

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
really need to do anything else but that

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.999 
really need to do anything else but that
so<00:02:09.080> hopefully

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
so hopefully

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.619 
so hopefully
you<00:02:11.159> know<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:11.489> as<00:02:11.640> simple<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.540> you

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
you know it's as simple as that for you

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.690 
you know it's as simple as that for you
I<00:02:12.900> heard<00:02:13.290> other<00:02:13.500> people<00:02:13.620> online<00:02:14.250> talking

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
I heard other people online talking

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.059 
I heard other people online talking
about<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.780> know<00:02:15.870> problems<00:02:16.319> with<00:02:16.439> the<00:02:16.560> diode

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
about you know problems with the diode

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.979 
about you know problems with the diode
inside<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:18.349> box<00:02:19.489> no<00:02:20.489> other<00:02:20.790> issues<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.239> are

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
inside this box no other issues that are

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.740 
inside this box no other issues that are
faults<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.129> caused<00:02:24.170> code<00:02:25.170> 12<00:02:25.560> but<00:02:26.150> this<00:02:27.150> this

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
faults it caused code 12 but this this
