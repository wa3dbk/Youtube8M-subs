00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.880
 There are friends for a lifetime to write. 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.840
 is bringing more good news 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.219
 for our old friends are special offers for vehicles series 3 and 4 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.320
 with the price you can not lose 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.570
 a unique opportunity for people visiting a house to write 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.360
 all these offers in addition to having a skilled workforce and the 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.039
 possibility that only the state can offer 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.279
 time goes by 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.470
 but the true friends 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.650
 I continue forever 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.650
 but first and foremost for you 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.890
 net hand 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.390
 the truck cabin was not injured 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.230
 as a favorite 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.990
 a third point some 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.990
 all night 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.050
 besides all the comfort ricardo brook is like this 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.420
 How are you? 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.420
 mobility 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.110
 We are not here at the italian factory in sÃ£o bernardo 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.180
 last wednesday 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.180
 which has the capacity to produce 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.250
 new sales 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.250
 beyond the taboo care with the variable part 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.490
 this farm 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.400
 about the food they attract 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.370
 the project of the region 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.959
 already in sweden they have faith in processes that people 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.810
 here in Brazil also tries dangerous because truth is a 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.619
 global system 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:17.849
 and is a tool is product development 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.579
 this tool 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.269
 one of her things is to develop a component of the truck before 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.420
 small computer then does all the tsd that is going to be required in the field does in the 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.819
 computer made the piece his client music and prototype karate 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:34.839
 still 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:37.259
 I stay here until protocol does the tests 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:38.400
 this Tuesday 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.960
 then validated in prototypes there was a piece in me 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:46.479
 as if it were a production process spit being his but in minor 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:47.430
 still quantity 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.430
 You've done too late even here in the factory. 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.549
 in addition to all these machines and thefts that work here within the 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.039
 sound factory but also has the job 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:04.569
 the staff there 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.800
 There are so many materials at sea in one mind. 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.800
 for it to happen within the international quality standards 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.299
 there is early training 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.539
 without the player to the selection 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:20.309
 trained and highly qualified to perform the function they do 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:23.309
 they participate in the development of the piece 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.669
 and during the development of you establishes in what form this feat and which 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.669
 has increased and if necessary and when we talk about safety standards 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:35.039
 there is also inside the fail-safe factory would this 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.440
 during the production process here at the factory 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.440
 everything component on TV is 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.590
 we consider to him that he is a critical part of any evil 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.419
 creates some risk 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.469
 then as a component of this 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.669
 the production process is proof of failure what is it 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.369
 for example if we then determined to touch the screw 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:01.559
 the equipment only releases the cab 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:05.329
 after this moment gave what to talk about than the bolts was tightened 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.279
 and this suits both the background counts for Grandma the sensors labels 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:13.679
 all parts critical to the other stage cabin is very important for the 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:15.760
 driver safety 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.870
 inside the booth is the collage of congratulations formerly that collage was 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.910
 made manually the player already has a high technology between ensures even more 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.650
 this national security 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.970
 That's when we brought the montage. 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.009
 air 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.279
 the windshield sticking with brazil 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:36.529
 is the great advantage of robbery or in that he always guarantees the same he has high 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:37.699
 repeatability 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.240
 one of the most important things about the windshield with the side and the uniformity of the 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.930
 conab 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.289
 As soon as we started riding we made several feet and several 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.340
 attempts to get us a perfect 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.680
 alignment is a perfect glue in the thousand-dollar uniformity and 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.930
 and assures repeatability of that 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.349
 I achieved a high performance 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.860
 with high technology with high quality in windshield gluing 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:06.610
 people talking about various tests are performed in various parts of the cabin 

00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:09.609
 the mainly parts of materials insistence bonding 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.330
 when talking about the electrical functions of the cabins they are tested 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:15.909
 then it fits in 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:18.289
 it is composed of several 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.289
 electric modules 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.289
 each with its module function up 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.740
 the coordinator each module to be reprogrammed individually according to 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.789
 with the specification of the truck 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.659
 the program detested separately after mounting them in the cabin they 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.199
 they talk to each other 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:43.009
 and at the end of the line we simulate all the formations of the recipe field 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:43.790
 expected 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.969
 at the cab closure 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:48.330
 there is one of several reasons 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.410
 that the truck expect national and international preference ' 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.779
 the assurance of having a quality truck always on the road this year 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:59.839
 yes we here in the factory we are always looking to perfect 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.789
 in quality and technology so that we can provide a cabin with the most 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.460
 high security rating 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.510
 and that the driver has a great day's work on the road
