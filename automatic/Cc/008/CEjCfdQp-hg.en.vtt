00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
actually have to create these you have

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.209 
actually have to create these you have
to<00:02:03.180> craft<00:02:03.540> these<00:02:03.740> really<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:04.860> really<00:02:05.070> easy

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
to craft these really it's really easy

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.340 
to craft these really it's really easy
you<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.460> need<00:02:05.640> seven<00:02:06.090> pieces<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.420> iron<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:07.110> a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
you just need seven pieces of iron and a

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.690 
you just need seven pieces of iron and a
redstone<00:02:07.530> torch<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.129> get<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> fireworks

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
redstone torch and you get the fireworks

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.949 
redstone torch and you get the fireworks
block<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.270> place<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.569> down<00:02:09.810> wherever

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
block you just place it down wherever

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.780 
block you just place it down wherever
you<00:02:10.140> want<00:02:10.319> it's<00:02:10.560> activated<00:02:11.129> by<00:02:11.190> redstone<00:02:11.430> like

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
you want it's activated by redstone like

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.680 
you want it's activated by redstone like
I<00:02:11.879> said<00:02:12.090> earlier

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
I said earlier

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.680 
I said earlier
and<00:02:13.010> that's<00:02:14.010> basically<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:15.060> that's<00:02:15.270> how<00:02:15.630> you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
and that's basically it that's how you

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.350 
and that's basically it that's how you
get<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.230> beautifulness<00:02:16.910> now<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:17.970> can't<00:02:18.240> go

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
get the beautifulness now you can't go

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.090 
get the beautifulness now you can't go
into<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.570> configuration<00:02:19.230> files<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.680> change

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
into the configuration files and change

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.730 
into the configuration files and change
it<00:02:20.220> around<00:02:20.460> so<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.510> get<00:02:21.690> some<00:02:21.990> dolphins<00:02:22.560> or

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
it around so you get some dolphins or

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.780 
it around so you get some dolphins or
something<00:02:23.070> if<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.250> wanted<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.610> make<00:02:23.760> a

something if you wanted to make a

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.490 
something if you wanted to make a
dolphin<00:02:24.120> check<00:02:24.510> firework<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.230> figured

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
dolphin check firework and you figured

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.870 
dolphin check firework and you figured
out<00:02:25.590> how<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:26.340> have<00:02:26.850> literally<00:02:27.150> no<00:02:27.420> idea<00:02:27.450> I

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
evil thoughts going on but actually what

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.010 
evil thoughts going on but actually what
I<00:02:59.370> have<00:02:59.610> here<00:02:59.790> is<00:02:59.910> three<00:03:00.180> sets<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.570> fireworks

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
I have here is three sets of fireworks

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.200 
I have here is three sets of fireworks
working<00:03:01.380> off<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> clock<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.280> are<00:03:02.910> going<00:03:03.120> to

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
working off a clock that are going to

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.460 
working off a clock that are going to
you<00:03:03.870> know<00:03:04.050> shoot<00:03:04.980> them<00:03:05.250> all<00:03:05.580> at<00:03:06.270> intervals<00:03:06.930> so

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
you know shoot them all at intervals so

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.280 
you know shoot them all at intervals so
you<00:03:07.530> get<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.980> maximum<00:03:08.600> firework<00:03:09.600> experience

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
you get the maximum firework experience

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.080 
you get the maximum firework experience
now<00:03:10.740> I<00:03:10.770> know<00:03:10.920> there's<00:03:11.220> not<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.490> many<00:03:11.700> but

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
now I know there's not that many but

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.000 
now I know there's not that many but
that's<00:03:12.240> only<00:03:12.420> because<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:13.320> way<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.650> mod<00:03:13.830> is

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
that's only because the way the mod is

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.920 
that's only because the way the mod is
programmed<00:03:14.490> I<00:03:14.730> found<00:03:15.150> out<00:03:15.360> is<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.690> if<00:03:15.840> you

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
programmed I found out is that if you

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.540 
programmed I found out is that if you
have<00:03:16.110> them<00:03:16.290> too<00:03:16.650> many<00:03:16.830> going<00:03:17.100> off<00:03:17.220> at<00:03:17.370> once

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
have them too many going off at once

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.100 
have them too many going off at once
they'll<00:03:17.790> actually<00:03:18.000> stop<00:03:18.420> exploding<00:03:18.990> in<00:03:19.080> the

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
they'll actually stop exploding in the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.990 
they'll actually stop exploding in the
air<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.800> you'll<00:03:19.980> just<00:03:20.160> get<00:03:20.370> these<00:03:20.490> nice

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
air and you'll just get these nice

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.220

little how about I show you now actually
so<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.360> have<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:25.110> know<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:25.410> right<00:03:25.590> here<00:03:25.890> and

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
so I have you know this right here and

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.920 
so I have you know this right here and
there's<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.400> really<00:03:26.610> cool<00:03:26.760> trick<00:03:27.390> ant<00:03:27.600> showed

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
there's a really cool trick ant showed

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.740 
there's a really cool trick ant showed
me<00:03:28.080> that<00:03:28.430> when<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.610> have<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:30.150> repeater<00:03:30.540> hook

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
me that when you have a repeater hook

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.630 
me that when you have a repeater hook
directly<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.410> block<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:32.130> gives<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.490> like<00:03:32.520> a

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
directly to the block it gives it like a

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.240 
directly to the block it gives it like a
quick<00:03:33.210> fire<00:03:33.450> mechanism<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:34.830> all<00:03:35.040> these

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
quick fire mechanism and so all these

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.160 
quick fire mechanism and so all these
blocks<00:03:35.520> are<00:03:35.730> about<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.060> go<00:03:36.210> off<00:03:36.450> on<00:03:36.750> my

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
blocks are about to go off on my

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.450 
blocks are about to go off on my
freaking<00:03:37.710> look<00:03:37.890> at<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.190> it's<00:03:38.370> like

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
freaking look at that it's like

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.330 
freaking look at that it's like
rapid-fire<00:03:39.180> fireworks<00:03:39.960> and<00:03:40.830> as<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.130> can<00:03:41.280> see

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
rapid-fire fireworks and as you can see

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.100 
rapid-fire fireworks and as you can see
we're<00:03:41.880> not<00:03:42.000> getting<00:03:42.330> that<00:03:42.420> many<00:03:42.570> explosions

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
we're not getting that many explosions

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.810 
we're not getting that many explosions
and<00:03:43.530> they're<00:03:43.650> really<00:03:43.830> just<00:03:44.100> like<00:03:44.340> doing<00:03:44.700> these

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
and they're really just like doing these

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.110 
and they're really just like doing these
