00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and and just thinking of cryptozoology

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.200 
and and just thinking of cryptozoology
and<00:00:21.869> something<00:00:22.350> that's<00:00:22.500> unidentified<00:00:23.000> or<00:00:24.000> you

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
thought it might be you brought on a

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.419 
thought it might be you brought on a
wasp<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.230> found<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.830> said<00:00:29.099> wasn't

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
wasp that you found and you said wasn't

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.730 
wasp that you found and you said wasn't
indigenous<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.570> area<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.199> you're<00:00:31.529> going

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
indigenous to the area and you're going

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.600 
indigenous to the area and you're going
to<00:00:31.800> send<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.160> away<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:33.170> be<00:00:34.170> analyzed<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.250> I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
to send it away to be analyzed and I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.930 
to send it away to be analyzed and I
hope<00:00:35.940> think<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:37.170> did<00:00:37.590> indeed<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.160> I'm<00:00:38.430> not<00:00:38.640> here

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
hope think I did indeed and I'm not here

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.840 
hope think I did indeed and I'm not here
and<00:00:39.120> here<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.320> wasp<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.579> we

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
and here we have a wasp and we have we

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.400 
and here we have a wasp and we have we
can<00:00:42.120> now<00:00:42.360> confirm<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> new<00:00:44.340> solid

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
can now confirm that is a new solid

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.410 
can now confirm that is a new solid
species<00:00:46.410> remember<00:00:47.160> when<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.309> was<00:00:47.399> dr.<00:00:47.700> zoology

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
species remember when I was dr. zoology

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.790 
species remember when I was dr. zoology
vision<00:00:48.690> everything<00:00:48.960> has<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.440> classified

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
vision everything has to be classified

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.369 
vision everything has to be classified
so<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.700> classify<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.239> into<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.020> family

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
so we can classify this into a family

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.330 
so we can classify this into a family
which<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.680> Scalia<00:00:53.340> okay<00:00:54.239> now<00:00:54.510> Scalia<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.649> Lord

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
which is Scalia okay now Scalia is Lord

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.979 
which is Scalia okay now Scalia is Lord
wasps<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.910> exist<00:00:57.210> here<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> méditerranée

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
wasps I exist here and the méditerranée

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.889 
wasps I exist here and the méditerranée
but<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> new<00:00:59.039> body<00:00:59.640> species<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:00.840> a

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
but this is a new body species so it's a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.770 
but this is a new body species so it's a
completely<00:01:01.289> new<00:01:01.530> species<00:01:01.800> as<00:01:02.129> as<00:01:02.430> yet

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
completely new species as as yet

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.509 
completely new species as as yet
unclassified<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.650> classified<00:01:05.280> as

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
unclassified so it's classified as

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.260 
unclassified so it's classified as

this<00:04:11.920> specimen<00:04:12.519> they're<00:04:12.910> not<00:04:13.090> sure<00:04:13.209> where<00:04:13.329> the

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
this specimen they're not sure where the

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.819 
this specimen they're not sure where the
camera<00:04:13.720> can<00:04:13.870> pick<00:04:14.019> here<00:04:14.170> there's<00:04:14.620> about<00:04:14.680> a

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
camera can pick here there's about a

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.340 
camera can pick here there's about a
centimeter<00:04:15.489> on<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:16.150> adults<00:04:16.540> is<00:04:16.630> about<00:04:16.900> 15

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
centimeter on the adults is about 15

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.930 
centimeter on the adults is about 15
millimeter

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
that she is friendly and if we compare

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.840 
that she is friendly and if we compare
her<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:46.440> baboon<00:04:46.800> spider<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:47.430> we've<00:04:47.580> just

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
her to the baboon spider that we've just

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.020 
her to the baboon spider that we've just
seen<00:04:48.180> just<00:04:48.660> look<00:04:48.870> how<00:04:49.080> how<00:04:49.980> kind<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:50.790> gentle

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
so this is just to prove that not all

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.960 
so this is just to prove that not all
spiders<00:04:57.480> should<00:04:57.750> be<00:04:57.870> feared<00:04:58.320> no<00:04:59.100> true<00:04:59.640> and

of you can tell huger's nearly a foot
and<00:05:51.690> it<00:05:51.990> was<00:05:52.080> an<00:05:52.200> unclassified<00:05:52.680> species<00:05:53.430> so

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
and it was an unclassified species so

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.310 
and it was an unclassified species so
therefore<00:05:53.910> as<00:05:54.000> an<00:05:54.120> alien<00:05:54.510> we<00:05:54.900> did<00:05:55.080> however

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
therefore as an alien we did however

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.920 
therefore as an alien we did however
work<00:05:55.770> out<00:05:56.120> through<00:05:57.120> our<00:05:57.180> research<00:05:57.450> that<00:05:57.840> I<00:05:57.900> was
