00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:10.830
 since Christmas the sky has come down on the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.330
 earth and since not that the eyes have 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.450
 open for the earth to rise to the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.450
 sky 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.200
 faith the religion of fact more 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.250
 necessarily part of people's daily life 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.599
 we often talk about the crisis of 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.710
 vocations there are more priests but 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.849
 I dare say that before talking about the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.770
 vocations crisis would have to talk about 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.800
 the crisis of faith and I tell myself that he 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.000
 would always be it would be amazing he 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.750
 there are more priests than there are 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.010
 practitioners today people have 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.620
 may not need god when we 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.150
 lives in a world we have more we have 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.519
 the hobbies that we want 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.070
 we dress as we want what is 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.329
 god can bring me more to the bottom if 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.920
 it is only he will mobilize a bad 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.750
 Sunday morning for Mass while 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.129
 as I work all week I 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.379
 will be a need tomorrow sunday for me 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.600
 to rest but what the world has forgotten 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.109
 is that society offers happiness 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.359
 ephemeral 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.609
 while god proposes a real happiness 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.070
 and give meaning to a life and that's where 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.800
 I say to myself of a maul unlike 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.880
 between society and god knows they do not 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.880
 do not offer the same happiness 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.320
 I think for some 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.260
 generation the priest still represents 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.300
 someone for other generations was 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.340
 not sure that the priest still represents 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.530
 a lot of things if the one who goes 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.080
 marry buried baptized and very often 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.700
 people do not know we exist 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.830
 but the day they need no it takes 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.800
 to be at their disposal and from 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:42.470
 holy spirit to a single lord for a 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.880
 marriage for example it seemed that the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.280
 fiances want to be celebrated at the church 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.619
 while in the church we celebrate god and 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.910
 just there we are people shift I 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.340
 will offer them for example a 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.530
 wedding preparation the first 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.450
 questions that come this is how I 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.300
 will return do I return the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.560
 last so the departure we are not 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.410
 at all on the same wavelength 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.209
 it's more of the art of tradition 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:13.910
 even folk bit my goal to me 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.280
 it does not have to fill - 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.519
 Sunday church but my goal 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.049
 as would lend it's momentum I would like 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.019
 give to my parish community 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:26.269
 it is to testify of the love of god 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.500
 as I believe a couple lives at 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.200
 daily 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.040
 what he has to live ben me I live with 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.840
 says daily 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.910
 I do not necessarily love at first sight 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.140
 in my teenage years for a person 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.510
 but I fell in love with God 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.200
 are five 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.200
 our taste 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.820
 it is this presence of God and at each 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.660
 moment in my life we have to live at 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.810
 daily 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.800
 this desire of heaven will close as 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.080
 before because we tend towards a 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.120
 world again one while being in 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.140
 remaining yourself and I believe this 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:12.180
 world we have already created in 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.180
 daily thus able
