that I've taken them out of the jar out
of<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> container<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.000> I'm<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.990> lay

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
of the container and I'm going to lay

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.680 
of the container and I'm going to lay
them<00:00:31.349> here<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.880> want<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.210> make<00:00:33.329> sure<00:00:33.360> that

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.569 
they all cut folk they can they're
touching<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.660> you'll<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> base<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
touching so you'll have a base for the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.150 
touching so you'll have a base for the
ring<00:00:40.579> okay<00:00:42.440> and<00:00:43.440> then<00:00:43.620> we're<00:00:43.770> going<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> put

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
ring okay and then we're going to put

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.729 
ring okay and then we're going to put
one<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:48.870> I'm<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.200> stick<00:00:49.469> one

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
one here and then I'm going to stick one

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.310 
one here and then I'm going to stick one
here<00:00:51.500> okay<00:00:53.300> so<00:00:54.300> they're<00:00:54.480> all<00:00:54.629> touching<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
here okay so they're all touching and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.380 
here okay so they're all touching and
overlapping<00:00:55.829> which<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.460> going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.699> give<00:00:56.910> us<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
overlapping which is going to give us a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.450 
overlapping which is going to give us a
base<00:00:58.350> okay<00:01:03.379> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.559> mash<00:01:04.739> them<00:01:04.920> together<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
base okay you can mash them together and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.359 
base okay you can mash them together and
kind<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.700> make<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.909> seamless<00:01:06.680> so<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.220> what

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
kind of make it seamless so this is what

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.060 
kind of make it seamless so this is what

don't want it closed all the way on both

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.660 
don't want it closed all the way on both
sides<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.390> can<00:02:08.509> actually<00:02:09.140> pull<00:02:10.069> these<00:02:10.280> out

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
sides you can actually pull these out

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.510 
sides you can actually pull these out
and<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:11.600> can<00:02:11.780> layer<00:02:12.020> it<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.680> just<00:02:13.160> go<00:02:13.340> around

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
and you can layer it and just go around

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.440 
and you can layer it and just go around
it<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.530> they<00:02:15.650> overlap<00:02:16.250> each<00:02:16.550> other<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:17.300> the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
it so they overlap each other on the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.660 
it so they overlap each other on the
outside<00:02:17.900> like<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:20.030> then<00:02:21.400> just<00:02:22.400> spread

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
outside like that and then just spread

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.330 
outside like that and then just spread
all<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.090> ingredients<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:23.989> middle<00:02:24.410> before

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
all the ingredients in the middle before

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.100 
all the ingredients in the middle before
you<00:02:25.730> bake<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.420> only<00:02:26.570> want<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:26.900> bake<00:02:27.080> it

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
you bake it and you only want to bake it

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.870
