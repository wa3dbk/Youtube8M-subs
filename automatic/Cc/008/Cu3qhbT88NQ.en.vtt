Wandy

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.580 

and<00:02:16.490> I<00:02:16.790> think<00:02:17.210> that's<00:02:17.540> pretty<00:02:17.810> much<00:02:17.960> it<00:02:18.200> the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
and I think that's pretty much it the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.070 
and I think that's pretty much it the
pre-chorus<00:02:19.600> which<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.870> DG<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:23.720> bridge

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
pre-chorus which the DG a is the bridge

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.700 
pre-chorus which the DG a is the bridge
and<00:02:25.210> that's<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.420> whole<00:02:26.570> song<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.140> then<00:02:27.680> I

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
and that's the whole song and then I

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.470 
and that's the whole song and then I
think<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:27.980> just<00:02:28.040> goes<00:02:28.190> back<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.460> that<00:02:28.940> first

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
think it just goes back to that first

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.570 
think it just goes back to that first
