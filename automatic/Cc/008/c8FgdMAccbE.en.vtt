00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.349 

well<00:00:01.500> that<00:00:02.460> took<00:00:02.669> all<00:00:02.850> of<00:00:02.879> two<00:00:03.540> seconds<00:00:05.029> yeah

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
well that took all of two seconds yeah

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.970 
well that took all of two seconds yeah
and<00:00:07.200> I<00:00:07.440> don't<00:00:07.500> have<00:00:07.770> anything<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:12.679> would<00:00:13.679> be

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
and I don't have anything that would be

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.419 
and I don't have anything that would be
good

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
good

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.359 
good
I<00:00:14.460> think<00:00:14.910> actually<00:00:15.379> the<00:00:16.379> insulation<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
I think actually the insulation on the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.470 
I think actually the insulation on the
fuse

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.160 

so<00:00:22.990> when<00:00:23.740> spoke<00:00:24.010> too<00:00:24.220> soon<00:00:24.430> we'll<00:00:24.610> see<00:00:25.050> back<00:00:26.050> in

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
so when spoke too soon we'll see back in

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.230 
so when spoke too soon we'll see back in
a<00:00:26.200> minute

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.700 

minutes<00:00:30.600> now

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.740 

but

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.200 

and<00:00:41.960> as<00:00:42.110> you<00:00:42.260> can<00:00:42.440> see<00:00:42.680> I've<00:00:42.890> got

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
and as you can see I've got

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.250 
and as you can see I've got
basically<00:00:45.170> no<00:00:45.350> smoke<00:00:45.740> coming<00:00:46.100> over<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.430> top

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
basically no smoke coming over the top

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.630 
basically no smoke coming over the top
hopefully<00:00:48.260> it'll<00:00:48.380> go<00:00:48.530> even<00:00:48.710> faster<00:00:49.010> once<00:00:49.490> it

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
hopefully it'll go even faster once it

00:00:49.640 --> 00:01:12.820 
hopefully it'll go even faster once it
gets<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:50.090> heat<00:00:50.480> exchanger

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:24.590 

call<00:01:13.830> me<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.370> buy<00:01:14.550> forth

step<00:01:33.790> to<00:01:33.880> your<00:01:33.970> right<00:01:37.470> take<00:01:38.470> Ricardo's<00:01:38.890> not<00:01:39.070> on

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
step to your right take Ricardo's not on

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.990 
step to your right take Ricardo's not on
it

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.340 

now<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:44.150> can't<00:01:44.360> really<00:01:44.420> tell<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:45.140> dark

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
now you can't really tell to dark

00:01:45.350 --> 00:02:00.130 
now you can't really tell to dark
anyways

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.420 

though<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:01.670> were<00:02:02.030> good

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
you can slide the glass in and out the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.320 
you can slide the glass in and out the
this<00:02:23.780> whole<00:02:23.990> piece<00:02:24.260> comes<00:02:24.650> off<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:26.000> can

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
you were to break it and just made the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.070 
you were to break it and just made the
whole<00:02:30.560> little<00:02:30.920> bit<00:02:31.010> bigger<00:02:31.540> aluminum<00:02:32.540> handles

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
whole little bit bigger aluminum handles

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.440 
whole little bit bigger aluminum handles
on<00:02:33.350> everything<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:34.520> tested<00:02:35.000> last<00:02:35.150> night

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
on everything that I tested last night

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.080 
on everything that I tested last night
we<00:02:35.570> burned<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.990> last<00:02:36.230> night<00:02:36.550> for<00:02:37.550> like<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:37.790> while

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
we burned it last night for like a while

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.650 
we burned it last night for like a while
and<00:02:38.590> these<00:02:39.590> things<00:02:39.920> stayed<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:41.000> one<00:02:41.330> and

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
and these things stayed this one and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.010 
and these things stayed this one and
this<00:02:42.500> one<00:02:42.830> would<00:02:43.820> be<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:44.150> warmest<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.780> and

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
this one would be the warmest to and

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.930 
this one would be the warmest to and
they<00:02:45.110> were<00:02:45.260> even<00:02:45.680> barely<00:02:46.340> warm<00:02:46.490> as<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.730> touch

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
they were even barely warm as a touch

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.240 
they were even barely warm as a touch
this<00:02:47.180> one<00:02:47.330> was<00:02:47.480> cold<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.050> this<00:02:48.200> one<00:02:49.010> on<00:02:49.160> the

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
this one was cold and this one on the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.010 
this one was cold and this one on the
lid<00:02:49.460> was<00:02:49.640> cold<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:51.310> just<00:02:52.600> fixed<00:02:53.600> up<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.810> doors

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
lid was cold and just fixed up the doors

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.170 
lid was cold and just fixed up the doors
a<00:02:54.170> little<00:02:54.530> bit<00:02:57.010> figured<00:02:58.010> out<00:02:58.160> that<00:02:58.850> when

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
a little bit figured out that when

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.420 
a little bit figured out that when
you're<00:02:59.300> burning<00:02:59.480> ret<00:02:59.780> wet<00:03:00.080> wood<00:03:00.320> you<00:03:00.800> almost

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
you're burning ret wet wood you almost

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.060 
you're burning ret wet wood you almost
just<00:03:01.610> leave<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:02.150> lid<00:03:02.330> right<00:03:02.570> off<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:03.260> then

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
just leave the lid right off and then

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.960 
just leave the lid right off and then
when<00:03:04.190> you<00:03:04.250> got<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.520> dry<00:03:04.760> stuff<00:03:05.090> using<00:03:05.510> this<00:03:05.870> is

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
when you got the dry stuff using this is

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.270 
when you got the dry stuff using this is
once<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.120> get<00:03:08.270> it<00:03:08.390> up<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.110> running<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.890> close

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
once you get it up and running you close

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.060 
once you get it up and running you close
this<00:03:10.610> one<00:03:10.880> right<00:03:11.810> down<00:03:12.160> use<00:03:13.160> this<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:15.560> regulate

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
this one right down use this to regulate

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.800 
this one right down use this to regulate
it<00:03:16.250> actually<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:16.850> pretty<00:03:17.030> much<00:03:17.120> left<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:17.600> almost

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
it actually I pretty much left it almost

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.630 
it actually I pretty much left it almost
all<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.020> way<00:03:18.110> open<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:18.770> was<00:03:18.920> perfect<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.550> it

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
all the way open that was perfect and it

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.780 
all the way open that was perfect and it
burned<00:03:19.820> real<00:03:20.000> slow<00:03:20.300> nice<00:03:20.600> but<00:03:21.560> then<00:03:21.830> ran<00:03:22.670> out

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
burned real slow nice but then ran out

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.670 
burned real slow nice but then ran out
of<00:03:22.880> good<00:03:23.090> wood<00:03:23.300> and<00:03:23.600> started<00:03:23.989> using<00:03:24.140> wet<00:03:24.440> wood

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
of good wood and started using wet wood

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.420 
of good wood and started using wet wood
and<00:03:25.580> then<00:03:25.760> we<00:03:25.910> found<00:03:26.150> that<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:28.010> just<00:03:28.160> closed

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
and then we found that you just closed

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.460 
and then we found that you just closed
that<00:03:28.670> off<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:29.030> take<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.209> lid<00:03:29.510> right<00:03:29.720> out<00:03:29.900> then

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
that off and take the lid right out then

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.490 
that off and take the lid right out then
we<00:03:30.530> had<00:03:30.650> pieces<00:03:30.890> sticking<00:03:31.459> out<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.730> about<00:03:31.910> here

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
we had pieces sticking out to about here

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.229 
we had pieces sticking out to about here
and<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.890> worked<00:03:34.070> pretty<00:03:34.250> good<00:03:34.370> we<00:03:35.150> were

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
and it worked pretty good we were

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.390 
and it worked pretty good we were
actually<00:03:35.540> having<00:03:35.600> to<00:03:35.870> fire<00:03:36.110> one<00:03:36.560> bonfire<00:03:37.160> and

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
actually having to fire one bonfire and

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.699 
actually having to fire one bonfire and
one<00:03:37.690> rocket<00:03:38.690> stove<00:03:38.900> fire<00:03:39.140> just<00:03:39.380> off<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.680> the

putting it in the secondary or the heat
exchanger<00:04:41.960> chamber<00:04:42.860> or<00:04:43.010> whatever<00:04:43.250> the

so<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:46.880> now<00:04:47.030> I'm<00:04:47.150> using<00:04:47.300> this<00:04:47.540> better<00:04:47.750> camera

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.710 
so and now I'm using this better camera
so<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.590> sound<00:04:48.800> will<00:04:48.860> be<00:04:49.010> better<00:04:49.419> so<00:04:50.419> there<00:04:50.630> it

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
so the sound will be better so there it

00:04:50.720 --> 00:05:02.020 
so the sound will be better so there it
