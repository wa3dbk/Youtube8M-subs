00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.380 

the<00:00:21.020> most<00:00:21.200> common<00:00:21.560> mistake<00:00:22.119> when<00:00:23.119> hitting

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
the most common mistake when hitting

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.380 
the most common mistake when hitting
overheads<00:00:24.020> and<00:00:24.260> moving<00:00:25.250> backwards<00:00:25.730> is

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
overheads and moving backwards is

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.019 
overheads and moving backwards is
hitting<00:00:26.869> into<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:27.260> net<00:00:27.439> and<00:00:28.130> I<00:00:28.760> want<00:00:28.939> to

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
hitting into the net and I want to

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.240 
hitting into the net and I want to
explain<00:00:29.360> why<00:00:29.510> this<00:00:29.570> happens<00:00:30.170> and<00:00:30.349> what<00:00:31.099> you

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
explain why this happens and what you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.470 
explain why this happens and what you
have<00:00:31.430> to<00:00:31.460> do<00:00:31.760> the<00:00:32.689> reason<00:00:33.820> why<00:00:34.820> this<00:00:34.880> happens

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
have to do the reason why this happens

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.900 
have to do the reason why this happens
is<00:00:35.630> because<00:00:36.280> when<00:00:37.280> you're<00:00:37.430> not<00:00:37.670> moving

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
is because when you're not moving

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.569 
is because when you're not moving
backwards<00:00:38.570> we<00:00:39.530> are<00:00:39.590> used<00:00:39.800> to<00:00:40.010> finding<00:00:40.430> the

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
backwards we are used to finding the

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.790 
backwards we are used to finding the
right<00:00:40.730> angle<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:41.239> you<00:00:41.420> know<00:00:41.660> at<00:00:41.930> what<00:00:42.290> angle

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
right angle so you know at what angle

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.370 
right angle so you know at what angle
your<00:00:42.950> racket<00:00:43.340> must<00:00:43.610> be<00:00:43.810> so<00:00:44.810> that<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.170> ball

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
your racket must be so that the ball

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.500 
your racket must be so that the ball
goes<00:00:45.620> into<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.250> court<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:47.030> you've<00:00:47.180> done<00:00:47.390> it

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
goes into the court and you've done it

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.959 
goes into the court and you've done it
many<00:00:47.660> times<00:00:47.840> and<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:48.980> it's<00:00:49.129> like<00:00:49.309> stored<00:00:49.730> in

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
many times and so it's like stored in

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:51.790 
many times and so it's like stored in
your<00:00:50.090> mind<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:50.600> you<00:00:50.690> know<00:00:50.719> the<00:00:51.019> angle<00:00:51.440> of<00:00:51.620> the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
your mind and you know the angle of the

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.400 
your mind and you know the angle of the
racket<00:00:51.949> is<00:00:52.340> like<00:00:52.550> automatic<00:00:53.260> when<00:00:54.260> you're

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
racket is like automatic when you're

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.229 
racket is like automatic when you're
moving<00:00:54.590> backwards<00:00:55.039> and<00:00:55.550> hitting<00:00:56.120> the

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
moving backwards and hitting the

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.319 
moving backwards and hitting the
overhead<00:00:56.690> then<00:00:57.679> what<00:00:57.890> happened<00:00:58.340> is<00:00:58.460> that<00:00:58.640> you

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
overhead then what happened is that you

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.119 
overhead then what happened is that you
actually<00:00:59.780> moved<00:01:00.050> a<00:01:00.260> little<00:01:00.469> bit<00:01:00.589> away<00:01:00.890> from

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
actually moved a little bit away from

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.829 
actually moved a little bit away from
the<00:01:01.280> ball<00:01:01.489> while<00:01:01.820> you're<00:01:02.059> hitting<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:02.690> ball

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
the ball while you're hitting the ball

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.350 
the ball while you're hitting the ball
and<00:01:03.410> it's<00:01:03.980> very<00:01:04.160> hard<00:01:04.460> for<00:01:04.519> your<00:01:04.760> minds<00:01:05.210> to

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
and it's very hard for your minds to

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.570 
and it's very hard for your minds to
register<00:01:05.870> that<00:01:06.050> so<00:01:06.740> you<00:01:06.800> just<00:01:06.890> move<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.340> little

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
register that so you just move a little

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.970 
register that so you just move a little
bit<00:01:07.730> away<00:01:08.170> so<00:01:09.170> when<00:01:09.380> you're<00:01:09.500> hitting<00:01:09.860> and

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
bit away so when you're hitting and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.160 
bit away so when you're hitting and
moving<00:01:10.280> away<00:01:10.430> you<00:01:11.300> just<00:01:11.510> move<00:01:11.750> a<00:01:11.780> little<00:01:12.050> bit

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
moving away you just move a little bit

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.620 
moving away you just move a little bit
away<00:01:12.230> and<00:01:12.770> now<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.460> racket<00:01:14.000> has<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.420> move<00:01:14.600> a

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
away and now the racket has to move a

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.450 
away and now the racket has to move a
little<00:01:14.840> bit<00:01:14.990> more<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.530> get<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.010> ball<00:01:16.220> and

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
little bit more to get to the ball and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.760 
little bit more to get to the ball and
when<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.450> racket<00:01:17.780> moves<00:01:18.050> a<00:01:18.200> little<00:01:18.320> bit<00:01:18.530> more

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
when the racket moves a little bit more

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.520 
when the racket moves a little bit more
you<00:01:18.920> see<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.250> angle<00:01:19.580> changes<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:21.050> now<00:01:21.230> it's<00:01:21.410> a

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
you see the angle changes so now it's a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.770 
you see the angle changes so now it's a
much<00:01:21.680> steeper<00:01:22.130> angle<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.730> that's<00:01:23.480> why<00:01:23.720> the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
much steeper angle and that's why the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.470 
much steeper angle and that's why the
ball<00:01:24.050> goes<00:01:24.290> into<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.770> net<00:01:25.000> so<00:01:26.000> again<00:01:26.300> it's

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
ball goes into the net so again it's

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.970 
ball goes into the net so again it's
very<00:01:26.630> hard<00:01:26.900> for<00:01:27.080> your<00:01:27.200> brain<00:01:27.410> to<00:01:27.440> notice

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
very hard for your brain to notice

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.750 
very hard for your brain to notice
whether<00:01:28.790> you're<00:01:29.090> standing<00:01:29.690> and<00:01:29.870> hitting<00:01:30.530> or

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
whether you're standing and hitting or

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.460 
whether you're standing and hitting or
slightly<00:01:31.760> moving<00:01:32.090> backwards<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:32.810> when

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
slightly moving backwards and when

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.950 
slightly moving backwards and when
you're<00:01:33.620> moving<00:01:33.770> backward<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:35.360> angle<00:01:35.810> will

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
you're moving backward the angle will

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.250 
you're moving backward the angle will
increase<00:01:36.550> of<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.910> racket<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.660> that's<00:01:39.080> why

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
increase of the racket and that's why

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.590 
increase of the racket and that's why
you<00:01:39.320> hit<00:01:39.530> into<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:39.980> net<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:41.180> what's<00:01:41.420> the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
you hit into the net so what's the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.260 
you hit into the net so what's the
solution<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.890> solution<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:43.640> always<00:01:44.000> aim

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
solution the solution is to always aim

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.800 
solution the solution is to always aim
deep<00:01:44.800> so<00:01:45.800> whenever<00:01:46.190> you<00:01:46.400> hit<00:01:46.790> an<00:01:47.000> overhead<00:01:47.270> and

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
deep so whenever you hit an overhead and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.170 
deep so whenever you hit an overhead and
you're<00:01:48.620> moving<00:01:48.800> backward<00:01:49.430> your<00:01:49.700> target

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
you're moving backward your target

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.060 
you're moving backward your target
should<00:01:50.330> always<00:01:50.570> in<00:01:50.990> your<00:01:51.110> mind<00:01:51.380> be<00:01:51.590> very<00:01:51.830> deep

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
should always in your mind be very deep

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.850 
should always in your mind be very deep
you<00:01:52.400> must<00:01:52.610> not<00:01:52.790> aim<00:01:53.200> close<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:54.530> service

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
you must not aim close to the service

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.880 
you must not aim close to the service
line<00:01:55.070> but<00:01:55.310> always<00:01:55.550> always<00:01:56.000> aim<00:01:56.570> much<00:01:57.560> closer

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
line but always always aim much closer

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.830 
line but always always aim much closer
to<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.310> baseline<00:01:58.730> and<00:01:59.420> you<00:01:59.570> will<00:01:59.690> realize

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
to the baseline and you will realize

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.720 
to the baseline and you will realize
that<00:02:00.290> even<00:02:00.440> though<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.770> aim<00:02:01.070> close<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.640> the

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
that even though you aim close to the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.170 
that even though you aim close to the
baseline<00:02:02.150> your<00:02:03.100> shot<00:02:04.100> will<00:02:04.340> actually<00:02:04.790> land

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
baseline your shot will actually land

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.109 
baseline your shot will actually land
much<00:02:06.140> shorter<00:02:06.620> and<00:02:06.650> then<00:02:06.920> in<00:02:07.070> time<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:07.940> will

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
much shorter and then in time this will

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.089 
much shorter and then in time this will
become<00:02:08.420> like<00:02:08.450> your<00:02:08.780> second<00:02:09.649> nature<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:10.009> you

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
become like your second nature and you

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.400 
become like your second nature and you
won't<00:02:10.280> have<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.489> think<00:02:10.789> about<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.209> but<00:02:12.019> that's

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
won't have to think about it but that's

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.440 
won't have to think about it but that's
