kind<00:01:14.680> of<00:01:14.740> frozen<00:01:15.070> like<00:01:15.340> a<00:01:15.400> plank<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:16.660> then

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
kind of frozen like a plank and then

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.530 
kind of frozen like a plank and then
when<00:01:17.500> he<00:01:17.560> lifts<00:01:18.220> up<00:01:18.369> this<00:01:18.850> is<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.150> real<00:01:19.270> moment

when he lifts up this is the real moment
of<00:01:19.780> transformation<00:01:20.080> and<00:01:20.740> it<00:01:20.860> basically

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
of transformation and it basically

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.210 
of transformation and it basically
becomes<00:01:21.490> a<00:01:21.670> new<00:01:21.940> object<00:01:22.420> where<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.259> feathers

would help turn back and forth we did

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.370 
would help turn back and forth we did
this<00:02:14.110> by<00:02:14.290> using<00:02:14.349> a<00:02:14.650> remote<00:02:14.950> camera<00:02:15.220> setup<00:02:15.670> and

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
from above but the female sees is

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.410 
from above but the female sees is
actually<00:02:30.099> more<00:02:30.220> like<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.430> wobbling<00:02:31.209> black

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420
