choosing to make a decade I will be

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.090

right<00:00:57.309> now<00:00:57.520> but<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.540> main<00:00:58.720> reason<00:00:58.750> I<00:00:59.409> will<00:00:59.739> be

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
right now but the main reason I will be

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.090 
right now but the main reason I will be
main<00:01:01.239> deck<00:01:01.510> getting<00:01:01.839> forbidden<00:01:02.559> chalice<00:01:02.949> is

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
main deck getting forbidden chalice is

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.780 
main deck getting forbidden chalice is
because<00:01:03.489> there's<00:01:03.670> also<00:01:03.909> the<00:01:04.330> game<00:01:04.629> 400<00:01:05.260> attack

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
because there's also the game 400 attack

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.310 
because there's also the game 400 attack
so<00:01:06.790> that<00:01:07.450> kind<00:01:07.690> of<00:01:07.750> gives<00:01:07.840> it<00:01:07.990> a<00:01:08.080> more

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
so that kind of gives it a more

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.040 
so that kind of gives it a more
variation<00:01:09.159> for<00:01:09.550> different<00:01:09.850> situations<00:01:10.050> to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
variation for different situations to

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.090 
variation for different situations to
either<00:01:11.229> stop<00:01:12.010> their<00:01:12.190> monsters<00:01:12.640> effect<00:01:13.060> or

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
either stop their monsters effect or

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.790 
either stop their monsters effect or
give<00:01:15.100> my<00:01:15.340> monster<00:01:15.790> 400<00:01:16.390> attack<00:01:16.630> boost<00:01:16.960> so

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
give my monster 400 attack boost so

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.060
