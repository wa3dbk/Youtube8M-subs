00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
that would have so many ramifications in

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.880 
that would have so many ramifications in
this<00:00:52.770> time<00:00:53.129> when<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.300> much<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.320> our<00:00:55.440> dominant

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
this time when so much of our dominant

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.740 
this time when so much of our dominant
culture<00:00:56.220> seems<00:00:56.580> to<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:56.850> forgotten<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
culture seems to have forgotten this and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.930 
culture seems to have forgotten this and
so<00:00:58.350> our<00:00:58.559> project<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:59.100> eco<00:00:59.280> psychology<00:00:59.820> is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
so our project in eco psychology is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.120 
so our project in eco psychology is
remembering<00:01:00.470> remembering<00:01:01.470> and<00:01:01.980> then

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
remembering remembering and then

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.549 
remembering remembering and then
applying<00:01:02.700> this<00:01:03.060> remembering<00:01:03.720> in<00:01:03.900> a<00:01:04.050> strategic

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
applying this remembering in a strategic

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.920 
applying this remembering in a strategic

ecopsychology recognize a deep seamless

psychology is a broader sense of

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.949 
psychology is a broader sense of
interconnection<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.849> think<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.599> could<00:02:03.810> even

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
interconnection I think we could even

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.639 
interconnection I think we could even
say<00:02:04.410> that<00:02:04.440> both<00:02:04.979> fields<00:02:05.750> recognize<00:02:06.750> non

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
say that both fields recognize non

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.260 
say that both fields recognize non
duality<00:02:07.920> or<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.959> unity<00:02:09.959> at<00:02:10.619> their<00:02:11.220> origins<00:02:12.000> at

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
duality or a unity at their origins at

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.080 
duality or a unity at their origins at
their

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
their

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.800 
their
so<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:13.900> would<00:02:14.290> say<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.680> ecopsychology<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:16.060> by

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
so I would say that ecopsychology is by

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.580 
so I would say that ecopsychology is by
its<00:02:17.020> nature<00:02:17.110> an<00:02:17.790> inclusive<00:02:18.790> approach<00:02:19.590> it's

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
its nature an inclusive approach it's

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
its nature an inclusive approach it's
inclusive<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.720> empirical<00:02:22.720> research<00:02:23.610> good

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
inclusive of empirical research good

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.449 
inclusive of empirical research good
hard<00:02:25.360> conceptual<00:02:26.260> thinking<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:26.980> critical

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.320 
hard conceptual thinking and critical

with a separation of humans in nature

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.680 
with a separation of humans in nature

appealing to fear guilt really does not

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.000 
appealing to fear guilt really does not
really<00:03:01.959> make<00:03:02.230> me<00:03:02.410> want<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.680> change<00:03:02.860> if

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
really make me want to change if

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.309 
really make me want to change if
somebody<00:03:03.250> comes<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.489> me<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.790> way

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
but what actually leads people to want

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.759 
but what actually leads people to want
to<00:03:07.360> make<00:03:07.540> change<00:03:09.180> I've<00:03:10.180> been<00:03:10.390> amazed<00:03:10.930> at<00:03:11.319> how
