00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
notes being deployed here okay you can

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.370 
notes being deployed here okay you can
see<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:11.850> kind<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.840> pentatonic

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
see it's kind of like the pentatonic

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.840 
see it's kind of like the pentatonic
scale<00:02:13.590> because<00:02:13.830> we've<00:02:13.980> got<00:02:14.130> this<00:02:14.280> note<00:02:14.580> that

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
scale because we've got this note that

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.820 
scale because we've got this note that
note<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:18.420> if<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.569> played<00:02:18.780> every<00:02:19.080> second<00:02:19.500> note<00:02:19.650> it

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
note so if I played every second note it

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.190 
note so if I played every second note it
would<00:02:19.950> be<00:02:20.100> this<00:02:20.330> not<00:02:21.330> quite<00:02:21.569> but<00:02:23.930> okay<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:24.989> you

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
would be this not quite but okay so you

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.830 
would be this not quite but okay so you
can<00:02:25.440> see<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.860> very<00:02:26.069> pentatonic<00:02:26.850> based<00:02:27.090> but

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
can see it very pentatonic based but

hear<00:05:53.830> that<00:05:54.010> oh<00:05:54.040> this<00:05:54.340> note<00:05:54.580> sounds<00:05:54.880> great<00:05:55.180> over

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
hear that oh this note sounds great over

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.540 
hear that oh this note sounds great over
that<00:05:55.600> call<00:05:55.840> but<00:05:56.020> bad<00:05:56.230> over<00:05:56.530> this<00:05:56.680> one<00:05:56.890> so<00:05:57.400> he

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
that call but bad over this one so he

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.100 
that call but bad over this one so he
just<00:05:57.730> wouldn't<00:05:58.030> do<00:05:58.150> it<00:05:58.180> experience<00:05:58.900> would

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
just wouldn't do it experience would

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.140 
just wouldn't do it experience would
tell<00:05:59.320> him<00:05:59.470> this<00:05:59.920> note<00:06:00.190> sounds<00:06:00.610> great<00:06:00.850> over

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
tell him this note sounds great over

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.940 
tell him this note sounds great over
here<00:06:01.180> but<00:06:01.450> when<00:06:01.570> the<00:06:01.690> band<00:06:01.900> changes<00:06:02.410> chords<00:06:02.800> I

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
here but when the band changes chords I

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.680 
here but when the band changes chords I
can't<00:06:03.430> play<00:06:03.610> that<00:06:03.790> note<00:06:03.940> anymore<00:06:04.300> I<00:06:04.330> have<00:06:04.540> to

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
can't play that note anymore I have to

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.510 
can't play that note anymore I have to
move<00:06:04.810> it<00:06:04.990> to<00:06:05.110> a<00:06:05.140> different<00:06:05.230> note<00:06:05.710> so<00:06:06.310> having

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
move it to a different note so having

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.340 
move it to a different note so having
some<00:06:06.850> understanding<00:06:07.780> of<00:06:07.870> the<00:06:07.960> theory<00:06:08.200> is

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
some understanding of the theory is

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.050 
some understanding of the theory is
definitely<00:06:08.680> not<00:06:08.800> going<00:06:08.920> to<00:06:08.980> hurt<00:06:09.220> if<00:06:09.640> anything

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
definitely not going to hurt if anything

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.670 
definitely not going to hurt if anything
it'll<00:06:10.180> speed<00:06:10.600> up<00:06:10.630> the<00:06:11.020> process<00:06:11.440> of<00:06:11.590> you

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
it'll speed up the process of you

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.320 
it'll speed up the process of you
hearing<00:06:12.070> it<00:06:12.160> because<00:06:12.400> you<00:06:12.520> can<00:06:12.670> be<00:06:12.790> doing<00:06:13.180> the

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
hearing it because you can be doing the

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.270 
hearing it because you can be doing the
right<00:06:13.510> thing<00:06:13.870> hearing<00:06:14.560> how<00:06:14.710> good<00:06:14.950> it<00:06:15.070> sounds

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
right thing hearing how good it sounds

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.310 
right thing hearing how good it sounds
and<00:06:15.520> if<00:06:15.610> you<00:06:15.730> do<00:06:15.880> the<00:06:16.060> wrong<00:06:16.240> thing<00:06:16.600> if<00:06:16.870> you

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
and if you do the wrong thing if you

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.590 
and if you do the wrong thing if you
play<00:06:17.560> that<00:06:17.590> c-sharp<00:06:18.310> note<00:06:18.580> over<00:06:18.760> the<00:06:19.000> d7<00:06:19.510> chord

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
play that c-sharp note over the d7 chord

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.420 
play that c-sharp note over the d7 chord
you're<00:06:19.750> gonna<00:06:19.840> go<00:06:19.990> oh<00:06:20.200> oh<00:06:20.500> yeah<00:06:21.040> that<00:06:21.280> note

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
you're gonna go oh oh yeah that note

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.740 
you're gonna go oh oh yeah that note
doesn't<00:06:21.760> work<00:06:21.880> over<00:06:22.060> that<00:06:22.300> chord<00:06:22.540> and<00:06:22.660> you'll

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
doesn't work over that chord and you'll

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.200 
doesn't work over that chord and you'll
kind<00:06:22.960> of<00:06:23.050> it<00:06:23.350> should<00:06:23.620> help<00:06:23.920> you<00:06:24.130> not<00:06:24.580> do<00:06:24.820> it<00:06:24.970> so

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
kind of it should help you not do it so

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.540 
kind of it should help you not do it so
often<00:06:25.420> so<00:06:26.080> this<00:06:26.230> is<00:06:26.410> a<00:06:26.440> really<00:06:26.950> good<00:06:27.100> kind<00:06:27.370> of

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
often so this is a really good kind of

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.180 
often so this is a really good kind of
step<00:06:27.850> in<00:06:28.060> getting<00:06:28.270> into<00:06:28.480> your<00:06:28.720> chord<00:06:29.320> specific

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
step in getting into your chord specific

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.520 
step in getting into your chord specific
mix<00:06:30.490> and<00:06:30.760> learning<00:06:31.300> how<00:06:31.450> to<00:06:31.480> make<00:06:31.840> the<00:06:32.050> changes

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
mix and learning how to make the changes

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.380 
mix and learning how to make the changes
because<00:06:32.950> it<00:06:33.070> really<00:06:33.370> is<00:06:33.490> a<00:06:33.520> cool<00:06:33.790> thing<00:06:34.090> it's

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
because it really is a cool thing it's

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.790 
because it really is a cool thing it's
something<00:06:34.570> that<00:06:34.870> you<00:06:34.990> should<00:06:35.020> find<00:06:35.680> yourself

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
something that you should find yourself

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.070 
something that you should find yourself
doing<00:06:36.250> by<00:06:36.580> ear<00:06:36.940> but<00:06:37.300> a<00:06:37.330> lot<00:06:37.480> of<00:06:37.510> people<00:06:37.720> did<00:06:38.050> not

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
doing by ear but a lot of people did not

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.350 
doing by ear but a lot of people did not
be<00:06:38.350> honest<00:06:38.590> I<00:06:38.770> didn't<00:06:39.160> I<00:06:39.310> had<00:06:39.669> to<00:06:39.790> get<00:06:39.940> shown<00:06:40.210> at

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
be honest I didn't I had to get shown at

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.640 
be honest I didn't I had to get shown at
first<00:06:40.540> I<00:06:40.690> was<00:06:40.840> forever<00:06:41.080> playing<00:06:41.350> the<00:06:41.500> wrong

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
first I was forever playing the wrong

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.230 
first I was forever playing the wrong
licks<00:06:41.890> in<00:06:42.040> the<00:06:42.070> wrong<00:06:42.280> places<00:06:42.550> until<00:06:42.850> I<00:06:43.000> got

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
licks in the wrong places until I got

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.090 
licks in the wrong places until I got
shown<00:06:43.720> oh<00:06:43.930> look<00:06:44.110> that's<00:06:44.260> that<00:06:44.560> note<00:06:44.770> and<00:06:44.950> that

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100 
shown oh look that's that note and that

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.770 
shown oh look that's that note and that
belongs<00:06:45.370> to<00:06:45.550> that<00:06:45.760> chord<00:06:46.000> and<00:06:46.210> you<00:06:46.360> can't<00:06:46.600> use

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780 
belongs to that chord and you can't use

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.330 
belongs to that chord and you can't use
it<00:06:46.930> over<00:06:47.140> that<00:06:47.260> one<00:06:47.440> because<00:06:47.590> it<00:06:47.710> clashes<00:06:47.919> like

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340 
it over that one because it clashes like

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.310 
it over that one because it clashes like
oh<00:06:48.550> that's<00:06:49.120> why<00:06:49.300> some<00:06:49.540> of<00:06:49.570> my<00:06:49.780> licks<00:06:49.990> sounded

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
oh that's why some of my licks sounded

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.960 
oh that's why some of my licks sounded
really<00:06:50.590> rubbish<00:06:50.919> sometimes<00:06:51.340> you<00:06:51.520> know<00:06:51.669> it

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
really rubbish sometimes you know it

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.300 
really rubbish sometimes you know it
made<00:06:52.240> sense<00:06:52.540> then<00:06:52.810> and<00:06:53.020> straightaway<00:06:53.470> my<00:06:54.040> ear

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
made sense then and straightaway my ear

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.460 
made sense then and straightaway my ear
kind<00:06:54.700> of<00:06:54.850> corrected<00:06:55.330> it<00:06:55.450> then<00:06:55.630> but<00:06:56.080> it<00:06:56.200> wasn't

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
kind of corrected it then but it wasn't

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.110 
kind of corrected it then but it wasn't
until<00:06:56.710> my<00:06:56.860> brain<00:06:57.130> knew<00:06:57.370> it<00:06:57.490> it's<00:06:57.730> kind<00:06:57.970> of<00:06:58.060> the

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
until my brain knew it it's kind of the

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.790 
until my brain knew it it's kind of the
wrong<00:06:58.300> way<00:06:58.450> around<00:06:58.720> and<00:06:58.870> I<00:06:58.930> mostly<00:06:59.320> play<00:06:59.620> by

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
wrong way around and I mostly play by

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.560 
wrong way around and I mostly play by
ear<00:07:00.010> but<00:07:00.190> that<00:07:00.610> was<00:07:00.790> definitely<00:07:00.940> a<00:07:01.180> point<00:07:01.390> in

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.570 
ear but that was definitely a point in

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.720 
ear but that was definitely a point in
my<00:07:01.750> learning<00:07:02.200> where<00:07:02.620> somebody<00:07:02.950> explained<00:07:03.520> the

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.730 
my learning where somebody explained the

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.760 
my learning where somebody explained the
idea<00:07:03.760> of<00:07:04.270> making<00:07:04.810> the<00:07:04.900> different<00:07:05.260> changes<00:07:05.650> and

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 
idea of making the different changes and

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.050 
idea of making the different changes and
having<00:07:05.980> different<00:07:06.400> blues<00:07:06.640> licks<00:07:06.880> for

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
having different blues licks for

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.880 
having different blues licks for
different<00:07:07.390> chords<00:07:07.690> made<00:07:08.110> a<00:07:08.140> huge<00:07:08.470> difference

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:08.890 
different chords made a huge difference

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.560 
different chords made a huge difference
to<00:07:08.980> how<00:07:09.190> well<00:07:09.400> I<00:07:09.430> played<00:07:09.760> not<00:07:09.970> that<00:07:10.090> I<00:07:10.120> think

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.570 
to how well I played not that I think

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:11.790 
to how well I played not that I think
I'm<00:07:10.690> brilliant<00:07:11.050> at<00:07:11.110> it<00:07:11.140> now<00:07:11.320> but<00:07:11.530> you<00:07:11.620> know<00:07:11.740> I'm

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 
I'm brilliant at it now but you know I'm

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.360 
I'm brilliant at it now but you know I'm
getting<00:07:12.070> there

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
getting there

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.180 
getting there
so<00:07:12.880> hopefully<00:07:13.600> this<00:07:14.169> lick<00:07:14.410> will<00:07:14.620> help<00:07:14.860> you<00:07:15.040> on

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.190 
so hopefully this lick will help you on
