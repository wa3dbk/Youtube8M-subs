international pariah true open all would
investigate<00:01:38.369> no<00:01:38.670> doubt<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.210> heard<00:01:39.659> they<00:01:39.840> used

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
investigate no doubt I heard they used

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.499 
investigate no doubt I heard they used
Japan's<00:01:40.470> three<00:01:40.950> non-nuclear<00:01:41.729> principles<00:01:42.329> as

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
Japan's three non-nuclear principles as

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.179 
Japan's three non-nuclear principles as
their<00:01:42.720> model<00:01:43.079> when<00:01:43.229> they<00:01:43.350> drew<00:01:43.530> up<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.799> treaty

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
their model when they drew up the treaty

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.760 
their model when they drew up the treaty
I<00:01:44.310> think<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> Treaty<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.540> Tlatelolco<00:01:45.770> might

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
I think the Treaty of Tlatelolco might

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.230 
I think the Treaty of Tlatelolco might
have<00:01:46.890> been<00:01:47.009> their<00:01:47.159> way<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.460> asking<00:01:47.610> nuclear

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
have been their way of asking nuclear

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.389 
have been their way of asking nuclear
powers<00:01:48.689> not<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.290> use<00:01:49.470> nukes<00:01:49.799> against<00:01:50.250> them

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
powers not to use nukes against them

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.980 
powers not to use nukes against them
that's<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.299> biggest<00:01:51.450> difference<00:01:51.899> between

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
that's the biggest difference between

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.319 
that's the biggest difference between
the<00:01:52.409> treaty<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.310> three<00:01:53.579> principles<00:01:54.090> I

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the treaty and the three principles I

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.090 
the treaty and the three principles I
guess<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.200> could<00:01:55.380> call<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.799> fourth

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
guess you could call it a fourth

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.670 
guess you could call it a fourth
principle<00:01:59.360> so<00:02:00.360> Costa<00:02:00.780> Rica<00:02:01.049> abolished<00:02:01.500> its

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
principle so Costa Rica abolished its

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.560 
principle so Costa Rica abolished its
army<00:02:01.979> back<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.490> what<00:02:03.590> 1949<00:02:05.030> pretty<00:02:06.030> gutsy<00:02:06.240> move

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
army back in what 1949 pretty gutsy move

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.240 
army back in what 1949 pretty gutsy move
for<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.899> Central<00:02:07.350> American<00:02:07.710> nation<00:02:08.039> at<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
for a Central American nation at the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
time yeah well they just come out of a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.500 
time yeah well they just come out of a
civil<00:02:10.590> war<00:02:10.619> I'm<00:02:11.459> sure<00:02:11.760> they<00:02:11.940> were<00:02:12.030> driven<00:02:12.239> by<00:02:12.480> a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
civil war I'm sure they were driven by a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.790 
civil war I'm sure they were driven by a
desire<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:12.989> avoid<00:02:13.349> an

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800

the<00:02:13.920> tragedy<00:02:14.460> like<00:02:14.700> Paz<00:02:15.000> said<00:02:15.300> but<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.900> think

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
the tragedy like Paz said but I think

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.170 
the tragedy like Paz said but I think
they<00:02:16.260> had<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.440> more<00:02:16.680> compelling<00:02:17.100> reason<00:02:17.610> army

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
they had a more compelling reason army

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.300 
they had a more compelling reason army
coup<00:02:18.390> d'etat<00:02:18.750> our<00:02:19.050> way<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.530> life<00:02:19.770> in<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.250> many

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310

Latin<00:02:20.850> American<00:02:20.880> countries<00:02:22.040> imagine<00:02:23.040> seeing

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
Latin American countries imagine seeing

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.900

that<00:02:23.400> up<00:02:23.610> close<00:02:23.790> no<00:02:24.330> army<00:02:24.840> no<00:02:25.500> coup<00:02:25.910> makes

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
that up close no army no coup makes

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.420 
that up close no army no coup makes

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
sense plus their economy was in ruins

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.310 
sense plus their economy was in ruins
so<00:02:29.790> they<00:02:29.910> honestly<00:02:30.270> didn't<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:30.840> any<00:02:31.050> money

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
so they honestly didn't have any money

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.890 
so they honestly didn't have any money
to<00:02:31.620> spend<00:02:31.860> on<00:02:32.040> an<00:02:32.220> army<00:02:32.610> anyway<00:02:33.060> yeah<00:02:33.510> but
