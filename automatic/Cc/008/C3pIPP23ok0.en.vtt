00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:10.639
 who do we want to get garlic 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.730
 high-yielding with a large head and 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:19.500
 good bed 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.119
 but what we get and seems to be on 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.880
 the first 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:28.610
 at the first collection we plant here approximately 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:33.930
 glomerulus first second third year 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.850
 Here we get a head and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.870
 the result 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:43.380
 from year to year our head turns 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.960
 just so shallow and often resemble 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:52.070
 instead of azimov 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:54.450
 spring garlic and the place of such workers 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.860
 groups of us it turns out such here 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.200
 small teeth 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.110
 without thinking that we have it 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.930
 reborn we still continue 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.360
 plant these teeth and get the whole sword 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.399
 sword sword sword and end can reach 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.750
 to the extent that we are looking for to 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:16.840
 reappears Sirin w I do not do that I 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:22.300
 said i take 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.300
 garlic just being 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.869
 plant such a tooth here means at me 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.490
 grows out of this tooth well, too 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.090
 naturally below the head 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.909
 here I leave the arrow on top and on this 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.920
 arrows appears here is such a head 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.040
 with little boules daughters time 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.009
 maturation 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.530
 say it yourself but by the way this is the title 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.229
 here is a head with a bulb 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.380
 it is an indicator when 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.280
 digging garlic a lot on often 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.950
 hear and see recommendations from litter 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.560
 agronomists scientists that garlic is necessary 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.070
 dig up the Urals here 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.760
 July or early August or 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.340
 beginning there depending the answer 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.670
 early july mid and late july early 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.300
 August I think this is not the right advice 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.730
 insofar as 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:28.200
 against ripening garlic depends on 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:33.150
 of what kind of soil 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:36.780
 The head here is this now acquired 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:41.519
 appearance it means garlic is time 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.920
 dig out that is on the head bulb 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.480
 chips on the arrows formed dry 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.930
 Here is such a shell that 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.480
 cracked faces purchased 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.610
 matching dark color means 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.610
 Garlic should be digging means taking 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.500
 flat cutter pruner 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.319
 reduce the arrow with these bombs 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.159
 as soon as I have these 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:14.519
 I will dry up their arrows sever sow 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:17.129
 and then me from these buns 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:23.010
 You grow up such a one tooth 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:24.840
 I dig up this little one then 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.389
 when the arrow will tell me this one 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:34.230
 time again and in the autumn I plant and I receive here 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:37.700
 this has been 1 large clove you see 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:41.849
 what's the difference here is such a story 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.689
 bomb nudity first year 1 tooth to 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.829
 second job 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:49.919
 and on the third boss I get this one 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.769
 the head that is it turns out with this one 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.879
 teeth get just such a head then 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.959
 this head 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:04:00.599
 I share the take and bottom of the barrels and the process 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.290
 repeated landings from barrels again 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:06.419
 getting 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:12.049
 faces and so on let's see 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:12.049
 now that we have a solution here is earth 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:19.639
 from this 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:23.280
 garlic from worms 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:28.289
 Here is the head we have from the world 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:31.169
 such one tube of tarragona this 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:34.169
 garlic about here i will take for 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.070
 matchbox comparison box put here 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.909
 such 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.560
 we have grown garlic this year 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:43.440
 despite the fact that it was very 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.110
 cold and so repeats from year to year 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.139
 that is, you should have three on the plot 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.729
 beds on one bed you grow 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:58.199
 teeth to get 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:05:04.020
 Now these are bullets. 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:05.669
 2 3 2 such 3 with barrels where specifically 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.250
 maybe this is not a garden bed 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.020
 it is necessary in any area can be planted in 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.810
 a barrel they grow such booths the 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.590
 moon form wednesday then one bed you have 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:20.039
 where will sit one little teeth where where 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:23.340
 You will these things 1 vodka and old teeth 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:25.289
 bed of species garlic like this 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.139
 way you will always be with good 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.900
 harvest of garlic and you have it a year 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.300
 will not shallow not turn here 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.969
 such a box like here 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.110
 It turned out to be such here 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:42.430
 heads here's a secret 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.430
 yield seeks to dangle
