so be interesting to see how much damage
this<00:01:23.460> one<00:01:23.640> does<00:01:24.740> thirty-one<00:01:25.740> percent<00:01:25.890> not<00:01:26.250> bad

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
this one does thirty-one percent not bad

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.520

and<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:27.120> did<00:01:27.300> know<00:01:27.540> as<00:01:27.690> he<00:01:27.780> started<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.170> jump<00:01:28.410> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
and I did know as he started to jump a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.070 
and I did know as he started to jump a
lot<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.520> I'd<00:01:29.760> use<00:01:30.060> my<00:01:30.090> anti-air<00:01:30.600> not<00:01:30.810> too<00:01:30.960> much

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
lot so I'd use my anti-air not too much

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.920 
lot so I'd use my anti-air not too much
I<00:01:31.260> was<00:01:31.380> going<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.570> I<00:01:33.570> still<00:01:33.810> not

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
I was going for that and I still not

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.050 
I was going for that and I still not
getting<00:01:34.170> any<00:01:34.260> solid<00:01:34.830> combos<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.520> him<00:01:35.640> well

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
getting any solid combos on him well

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.390

that's<00:01:36.210> understandable<00:01:36.390> first<00:01:37.080> match<00:01:37.260> do<00:01:38.250> bad

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400

I've<00:01:38.610> got<00:01:38.700> some<00:01:38.850> more<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.060> start<00:01:39.390> getting

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
I've got some more I start getting

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.500 
I've got some more I start getting
better<00:01:39.660> at<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.110> think<00:01:41.090> there<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.150> go<00:01:42.300> that's

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
better at it I think there we go that's

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.930 
better at it I think there we go that's
not<00:01:42.630> too<00:01:42.780> that's<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.260> little<00:01:43.380> bit<00:01:43.620> and<00:01:43.940> scoop

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
not too that's a little bit and scoop

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.030 
not too that's a little bit and scoop
yes<00:01:45.480> miss<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> next<00:01:46.230> bit<00:01:46.470> because<00:01:46.650> of<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
yes miss the next bit because of the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.980 
yes miss the next bit because of the
input<00:01:47.700> latency<00:01:47.850> which<00:01:48.120> I'll<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.720> adapt

match is trying to get a good combo like
that<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:08.900> then<00:04:08.990> what<00:04:09.170> there<00:04:09.320> was<00:04:09.490> thirty-five

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
that and then what there was thirty-five

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.340 
that and then what there was thirty-five
percent<00:04:10.700> doesn't<00:04:11.150> think<00:04:11.270> so<00:04:12.110> that<00:04:12.140> was

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
percent doesn't think so that was

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.870 
percent doesn't think so that was
reasonable<00:04:12.770> none<00:04:12.980> of<00:04:13.100> us<00:04:13.190> have<00:04:13.310> used<00:04:13.490> a<00:04:13.610> clash

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
reasonable none of us have used a clash

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.479 
reasonable none of us have used a clash
system<00:04:14.300> either<00:04:14.450> so<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:14.990> think<00:04:15.890> everyone's

okay<00:05:17.260> now<00:05:18.260> I'm<00:05:18.350> gonna<00:05:18.500> probably<00:05:19.150> get<00:05:20.150> a<00:05:20.210> scoop

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
okay now I'm gonna probably get a scoop

okay<00:05:27.380> that<00:05:27.560> seems<00:05:27.860> really<00:05:28.130> dangerous<00:05:28.310> again

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200

so<00:05:39.169> then<00:05:39.320> my<00:05:39.410> first<00:05:39.620> three<00:05:39.860> matches<00:05:40.010> I<00:05:40.340> think<00:05:40.550> I

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
so then my first three matches I think I

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.640 
so then my first three matches I think I
improved<00:05:41.150> from<00:05:41.810> the<00:05:41.870> first<00:05:42.110> one<00:05:42.290> to<00:05:42.380> the<00:05:42.440> third

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
improved from the first one to the third

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.620 
improved from the first one to the third
one<00:05:42.830> I've<00:05:42.919> got<00:05:42.950> some<00:05:43.250> good<00:05:43.880> combos<00:05:44.270> I<00:05:44.390> kept

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.020 
one I've got some good combos I kept
getting<00:05:44.720> the<00:05:44.900> scoop<00:05:45.169> kept<00:05:45.940> continuing<00:05:46.940> the

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
getting the scoop kept continuing the

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.150 
getting the scoop kept continuing the
combo<00:05:47.300> deep<00:05:47.690> forgot<00:05:48.080> to<00:05:48.169> use<00:05:48.290> any<00:05:48.440> e<00:05:48.530> ex<00:05:48.860> though

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
combo deep forgot to use any e ex though

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.250

I'm<00:05:50.060> not<00:05:50.240> using<00:05:50.419> my<00:05:50.570> tray<00:05:50.840> although<00:05:51.140> this

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
I'm not using my tray although this

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.780 
I'm not using my tray although this
guy's<00:05:51.470> not<00:05:51.620> hitting<00:05:51.860> me<00:05:51.919> with<00:05:52.040> several

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
guy's not hitting me with several

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.220 
guy's not hitting me with several
hitting<00:05:53.000> moves<00:05:53.210> so<00:05:53.510> there's<00:05:53.660> no<00:05:53.720> real<00:05:53.990> point

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
hitting moves so there's no real point

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.070 
hitting moves so there's no real point
to<00:05:54.440> doing<00:05:54.590> it<00:05:55.180> because<00:05:56.180> it<00:05:56.330> just<00:05:56.419> reduces<00:05:56.630> hits

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
to doing it because it just reduces hits

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.800 
to doing it because it just reduces hits
done<00:05:57.520> but<00:05:58.520> I<00:05:58.550> think<00:05:58.880> now<00:05:59.210> what<00:05:59.450> I<00:05:59.510> need<00:05:59.570> to

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
done but I think now what I need to

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.860 
done but I think now what I need to
train<00:06:00.080> on<00:06:00.290> is<00:06:00.940> remembering<00:06:01.940> the<00:06:02.390> openers

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
train on is remembering the openers

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
and try and be strategic about when I

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:08.950 
and try and be strategic about when I
use<00:06:08.090> those<00:06:08.300> moves<00:06:08.510> cuz

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
which I know our openers and regardless

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:14.650 
which I know our openers and regardless

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
of whether it's high or low I'm just

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.029 
of whether it's high or low I'm just
throwing<00:06:14.840> them<00:06:15.020> out<00:06:15.139> so<00:06:15.440> that's<00:06:15.650> probably<00:06:15.889> the

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
throwing them out so that's probably the

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:18.129 
throwing them out so that's probably the
next<00:06:16.130> thing<00:06:16.400> the<00:06:16.850> next<00:06:16.880> step<00:06:17.330> is<00:06:17.810> to<00:06:17.870> try<00:06:18.110> and

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.139 
next thing the next step is to try and

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.950 
next thing the next step is to try and
learn<00:06:18.349> high<00:06:18.680> and<00:06:18.830> lows<00:06:19.750> thank<00:06:20.750> you<00:06:20.840> for
