00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 they have already seen the starting point of the 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.100
 today's program is in the province of 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.100
 Toledo 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.480
 30 kilometers from the capital in Sorcerer 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.050
 we found this spectacular landscape 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.520
 the ravines are cut clayey 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.160
 that have been formed by the erosion of 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.270
 wind and the waters of the river tajo a 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.500
 little known place that however 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.890
 appears in the last announcement of that 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:37.590
 well-known soda brand so 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.590
 we have to visit the ravines 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.820
 yes 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.820
 but 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.829
 with which neither hello good go his 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.320
 honor day 6 good morning go luck that 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.149
 you have a group to have a place 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.339
 natural like this so awesome 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.839
 For if the truth is it's very nice 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.850
 they have compared us to the canyon of 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.040
 colorado with deserts of syria with the 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.539
 Dead sea what do I know but here we are 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.000
 that is clear in the ravines of 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.289
 mailbox in burujón in bureau since we are 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.220
 wanting to know them so we go for 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.220
 there then we go there 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.050
 good juanjo we have already reached the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.660
 Canyons main viewpoint as 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.050
 yes this is the beginning of the path 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.430
 ecological of the ravines and in the background 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.050
 You see the pico cambrón of the most 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.720
 representative of all cuttings 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.450
 clay we have in what are the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.070
 Barrancas de Burujón and at the foot of the peak 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.230
 there is the castrejón reservoir 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.670
 I had never seen it as green as 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.790
 we can enjoy right now 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.860
 they are usually more brown but on 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.410
 everything when it snows or when it coincides 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.770
 years of water bonanza like this year 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:59.609
 It offers us a natural spectacle 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.609
 that is 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.900
 I think we are very well accompanied not 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.900
 they have come 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.869
 all right 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.940
 for you it has to be very 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.130
 important this place you have to have 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.950
 countless memories linked to it 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.900
 truth is very important and also very 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.090
 special 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:29.560
 that our first exit of all but 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.690
 bathed you do not know here to bathe in this 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.790
 area never good so let's continue 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.000
 discovering different corners of this 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.000
 panel 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.359
 Juanjo and what would be the origin of these 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.230
 formations 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:48.420
 well, we have to go back to 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.359
 quite a few million years ago because 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.719
 this is dated from 25 million years ago 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.939
 at that time what is produced is a 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:03:00.240
 phenomenon that is called gold genesis if it is 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:02.040
 simply the plate clash 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.530
 and in which deformations occur 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.390
 of the ground 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.740
 and here are several hundred 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.150
 meters like for example what we have 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.020
 said before the champion guy who has 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.200
 one 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:17.980
 here it happens that all the 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.280
 material that there is lithology is clay 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.140
 and marl, that is, sediments and 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.600
 dissolve easily by the population 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.660
 of rainwater and so it is 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.200
 produces what are the slopes the portal 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.200
 two rings 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.830
 to the sides this wonder that 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.830
 we have in front 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.860
 low from the water from the reservoir the 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.120
 Panoramic are also beautiful 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.940
 we have been the player before 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.970
 pretty from where we are now because it 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.340
 look even more beautiful and from the water 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.230
 well you have to also be a 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.799
 show because we passed the area 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.040
 low of plateau or of soto of the river to the 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.040
 elevation 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.690
 to me to be able to access the reservoir by 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.820
 where would we do it 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.390
 of the town when we come here to the 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.730
 pilgrimage and to spend someday we enter by 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.440
 a little path and there is below that 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.860
 we call it the entry of 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.469
 the rich 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.840
 this goes as far as the edge of the 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:32.289
 swamp and from there then we are at 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.090
 few meters from the marshes of 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.719
 castejón the bottom of the swamp very 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:40.120
 unstable that is composed as of many 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:43.210
 rhythms of one of a floor that seem 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.219
 even quicksand and you have to 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.289
 enjoy inside what we say 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:49.740
 of what common sense reigns to those 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:52.210
 islets where there are n carts 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.610
 workers agreed that the 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.439
 furniture craftsmen working and 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.659
 who made these chairs came to them 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:00.099
 to the islets but by routes that 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:01.930
 only they knew even though 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.509
 look like they are in the middle of 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.099
 swamp they came and it did not cover them 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.099
 more more than the waist 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:16.599
 Juan Antonio here we can come in addition 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.959
 with good binoculars and enjoy 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:22.809
 of an incredible fauna truth yes yes it is 

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:26.349
 a very privileged place also in the 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:29.110
 wildlife theme especially for having 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:31.269
 the reservoir of castejón to have water 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.049
 We can find different types of 

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:37.539
 bitter carp fish but good what more 

00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:39.339
 predominates in this space and most 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.229
 nice that can be seen with more said 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:44.589
 with binoculars on a good day that 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:47.409
 there are many many anna in the water 

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:49.089
 Martinez ducks storks 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:51.939
 can see many even black stork 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:54.039
 and above all a raptor theme is a 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:57.249
 good place to be able to see in some 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:06:00.549
 moment there were real eagles of many 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:02.110
 Vulture types even up to some hawk 

00:06:00.549 --> 00:06:04.469
 pilgrim or has been seen in some 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.469
 moment 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.710
 clear in addition to the landscape often site 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.840
 to come and see henares here we celebrate 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.970
 san blas in february 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.419
 we make a pilgrimage and the 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:24.060
 town hall a tent and we have in 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.639
 iron and then everyone brings their own 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.350
 we have tables in the people three months a 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.449
 month in their chairs they make fire 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:34.940
 had also days that have been brought 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:34.940
 dances and had a good time 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.400

 June that then the rigors of summer 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.820
 here they are very intense and it is very hot 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.950
