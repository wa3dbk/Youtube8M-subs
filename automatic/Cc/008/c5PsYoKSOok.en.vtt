00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.600
 well we continue with more on this day 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.069
 Monday of civilians following the 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.959
 designer of her rosary theory now 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.099
 he only has one very important technique 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:10.299
 that I think you pay attention and 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.410
 I love as a line the same 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.570
 program is already always encouraging 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.219
 women because they do not know techniques and 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.050
 to start your own business this occasion 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.090
 let's see each other I will teach in a 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.740
 braid strings necklace set 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.740
 attention the direction the capsule 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.980
 How about friends ready to do something 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.870
 easy but awesome I also today 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.870
 we will make a braid necklace with chains 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.920
 this braid will be two colors 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.020
 but basically we have to use these 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.450
 two wicks that by folding the already 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.060
 I explain how to get two of us to stay 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.770
 even colors not two red wicks and 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.500
 a yellow for 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.450
 we are three yards from each color the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.210
 which we are going to split in half is 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.210
 say half yard each 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.430
 we match here and then we cut 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.909
 to burn the ends so that we are not 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.909
 parade 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:24.970
 now let's start our braid 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.970
 also folding a single color 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.970
 trying to be even and here we will 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:39.340
 a kind of bent eyelet with a 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.340
 we are going to scare it 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.080
 we have is here then we doubled and 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.080
 we cut the drop 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.909
 we put it also in the center 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.179
 and what 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.560
 and we are going to embrace the first part 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.590
 A) Yes 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.450
 we cross the first two here 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.450
 size and now the other colors go 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.330
 we will always cross the colors 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.660
 same the cross the red he crossed in the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.660
 Marine 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.220
 We will try to get the thread to go 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.370
 remaining plan and tone mounted one on 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.370
 the other 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.959
 now that we have the braid we are going to 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.580
 measure the size of our necklace and we 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.319
 it is more or less 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.049
 of 40 centimeters by all 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.580
 now let's grab the wick that is 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:12.420
 over 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:16.580
 red both and we're going to put you 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.580
 another ring to hold here 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.379
 to ramala where above and then both of 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.739
 down so that we do not get rid of 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.739
 braid 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.000
 and its fields well so that the 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.880
 The ends of the ring are not going to be very 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.490
 lifted so that they do not disturb the skin 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.100
 then we talk a little bit the others for 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:45.110
 that we will not be loose X and 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.110
 we repeat placing another ring here 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.630
 now that we have our necklace this 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.430
 we're just going to tie it in the buttonhole 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.680
 we did first there venus is pretty much 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.510
 how will it fit and what we 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.319
 tie up we have 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.299
 getting around here 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.530
 and you can see that you do not need 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.200
 no snap now let's cut 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.340
 sounds that's why they have to be fine 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.130
 grab 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.220
 and we cut especially the two that 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.239
 they are hidden so that later on 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.239
 tie not notice 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.480
 this also we burn it a little bit 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.300
 and now we do the same with that 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.270
 if you want a necklace two in one 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.500
 we can also put a piece of 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.500
 chain on the bottom 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.650
 and we are going to tie it with another 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.020
 thread that contrast and if not then the 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.940
 Same color as you like, we are going to 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.460
 make a tie with another thread in this 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.820
 case and a little thinner 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.810
 and we will try to hide it 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.810
 we play well 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.850
 we cut and we're going to burn 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.310
 now let's bring by the side of 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.700
 our braid to tie the 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.700
 chain 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.090
 We fill the string together 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.470
 place it here and we will be careful to 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.210
 when making the knot so that it does not 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.210
 note and the necklace will be finished 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.650
 So we have finished our necklace 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.960
 braid with chain we also have it in 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.880
 other colors remember to have a 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.160
 organizer of necklaces so you do not 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.050
 he mistreats you can place them in boxes 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.210
 transparent to identify it with 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.310
 ease or a tablet with several 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.260
 Brads in your closet I hope you 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.950
 have liked and see you another time 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.950
 good afternoon
