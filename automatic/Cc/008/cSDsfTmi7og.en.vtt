nothing<00:01:50.310> really<00:01:50.520> mattered<00:01:50.970> because<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.299> was

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
nothing really mattered because it was

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.819 
all so crazy and ridiculous that I
didn't<00:01:54.390> care<00:01:54.659> what<00:01:54.840> happened<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.259> anybody<00:01:55.590> so

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
didn't care what happened to anybody so

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.980 
didn't care what happened to anybody so
it's<00:01:56.219> not<00:01:56.399> really<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.820> type<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.090> movie<00:01:57.509> thing

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
it's not really that type of movie thing

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.510 
it's not really that type of movie thing
that<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.409> would<00:01:58.530> actually<00:01:58.829> get<00:01:59.130> into<00:01:59.310> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that you would actually get into and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.219 
that you would actually get into and
care<00:01:59.729> about<00:01:59.850> what's<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.780> really

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
care about what's going on it's really

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.649 
care about what's going on it's really
more<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.000> crazy<00:02:03.210> movie

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
more of a just this is a crazy movie

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.780 
more of a just this is a crazy movie
just<00:02:03.869> sit<00:02:04.110> back<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.350> it'll<00:02:05.100> just<00:02:05.189> blow<00:02:05.610> your

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
just sit back and it'll just blow your

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.310 
just sit back and it'll just blow your
mind<00:02:06.030> pretty<00:02:06.360> much<00:02:06.540> that's<00:02:06.810> what<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.079> and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
mind pretty much that's what it is and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.540 
mind pretty much that's what it is and
you<00:02:07.409> can<00:02:07.439> kind<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.770> see<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.009> by<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.190> trailer

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you can kind of see that by the trailer

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.880 
you can kind of see that by the trailer
so<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:09.119> not<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.360> big<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.780> surprise<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.619> I

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
so it's not that big of a surprise but I

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.780 
so it's not that big of a surprise but I
I<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:11.220> like<00:02:11.550> to

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
I do like to

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.059 
I do like to
be<00:02:11.849> able<00:02:11.969> to<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.299> something<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.620> movie

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
be able to have something in a movie

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.399 
be able to have something in a movie
that<00:02:14.219> I<00:02:14.250> can<00:02:14.459> actually<00:02:14.579> care<00:02:15.420> about<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:16.019> guess

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
that I can actually care about I guess

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.589 
that I can actually care about I guess
plot<00:02:16.950> wise<00:02:17.159> as<00:02:17.430> far<00:02:17.640> as<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.819> remember<00:02:17.849> like<00:02:18.480> I

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
plot wise as far as I remember like I

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.970 
plot wise as far as I remember like I
said<00:02:18.659> it<00:02:18.900> was<00:02:19.019> all<00:02:19.140> just<00:02:19.170> ridiculous<00:02:19.769> there's

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
said it was all just ridiculous there's

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.069 
said it was all just ridiculous there's
a<00:02:20.040> crazy<00:02:20.310> plot<00:02:20.640> but<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.629> kind<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.900> all

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
a crazy plot but it's just kind of all

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.809 
a crazy plot but it's just kind of all
over<00:02:22.109> the<00:02:22.379> place<00:02:22.469> and<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.340> felt<00:02:23.519> like<00:02:23.549> just<00:02:23.760> a

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
over the place and it felt like just a

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.000 
over the place and it felt like just a
lot<00:02:23.969> of<00:02:24.000> crazy<00:02:24.599> events<00:02:25.109> strung<00:02:25.799> together

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
lot of crazy events strung together

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.030 
lot of crazy events strung together
vaguely<00:02:26.489> by<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.849> loose<00:02:27.480> plot<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.170> once<00:02:28.859> again

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
vaguely by a loose plot so once again

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.589 
vaguely by a loose plot so once again
you<00:02:29.400> can<00:02:29.609> kind<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.849> see<00:02:29.909> that<00:02:30.090> in<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.269> trailer

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
you can kind of see that in the trailer

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.449 
you can kind of see that in the trailer
so<00:02:30.629> is<00:02:31.049> that<00:02:31.079> surprising<00:02:31.470> not<00:02:32.159> really

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
so is that surprising not really

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.309 
so is that surprising not really
directing<00:02:33.000> wise<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.689> where<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.049> movie

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
directing wise this is where the movie

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.390 
directing wise this is where the movie
like<00:02:34.500> i<00:02:34.620> said<00:02:34.769> is<00:02:34.859> going<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.129> a<00:02:35.159> cult

like i said is going to be a cult

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.149 
like i said is going to be a cult
classic<00:02:35.549> it<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.030> crazy<00:02:36.720> it's<00:02:37.349> directed<00:02:37.889> by<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
classic it is crazy it's directed by the

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.800 
classic it is crazy it's directed by the
guy<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.519> did<00:02:38.730> torque<00:02:39.180> as<00:02:39.329> far<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:39.599> i<00:02:39.659> believe

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
guy that did torque as far as i believe

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.140 
guy that did torque as far as i believe
and<00:02:40.019> he<00:02:40.139> makes<00:02:40.349> fun<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.620> himself<00:02:40.859> in<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.760> movie

and he makes fun of himself in the movie
which<00:02:42.629> is<00:02:42.930> kind<00:02:43.379> of<00:02:43.439> cool<00:02:43.500> it's<00:02:43.859> like<00:02:43.980> a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
which is kind of cool it's like a

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.129 
which is kind of cool it's like a
self-aware<00:02:44.609> movie<00:02:44.939> in<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.209> sense<00:02:45.510> but<00:02:45.810> also

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
self-aware movie in that sense but also

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.860 
self-aware movie in that sense but also
kind<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.069> just<00:02:47.280> like<00:02:47.430> okay<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.269> know<00:02:48.569> yeah

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
does he not take himself seriously I

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.759 
does he not take himself seriously I
don't<00:02:51.120> know<00:02:51.180> visually<00:02:51.480> it's<00:02:52.109> got<00:02:52.379> a<00:02:52.409> very

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
don't know visually it's got a very

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.679 
don't know visually it's got a very
glossy<00:02:53.159> look<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.669> it<00:02:53.790> like<00:02:53.909> I<00:02:54.000> said<00:02:54.299> it's<00:02:54.569> just

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
glossy look to it like I said it's just

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.199 
glossy look to it like I said it's just
really<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.859> just<00:02:55.889> pops<00:02:56.280> out<00:02:56.489> at<00:02:56.669> you<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.970> I

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
really it just pops out at you and I

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.909 
really it just pops out at you and I
have<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.599> say<00:02:57.629> I<00:02:57.810> did<00:02:58.169> like<00:02:58.379> that<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.829> was

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
have to say I did like that it was

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.280 
have to say I did like that it was
definitely<00:02:59.129> visually<00:02:59.939> stimulating<00:03:00.659> so<00:03:00.900> it

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
definitely visually stimulating so it

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.110 
definitely visually stimulating so it
was<00:03:01.620> interesting<00:03:01.799> in<00:03:02.189> that<00:03:02.220> sense<00:03:02.669> but<00:03:02.909> once

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
was interesting in that sense but once

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.399 
was interesting in that sense but once
again<00:03:03.269> just<00:03:03.540> kind<00:03:03.659> of<00:03:03.689> a<00:03:03.810> bunch<00:03:03.989> of<00:03:04.079> crazy

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
again just kind of a bunch of crazy

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.069 
again just kind of a bunch of crazy
stuff<00:03:04.709> going<00:03:04.769> on<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:05.340> very<00:03:06.209> vaguely<00:03:06.569> strung

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
stuff going on and very vaguely strung

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.679 
stuff going on and very vaguely strung
together<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.500> my<00:03:07.769> opinion<00:03:08.040> acting-wise

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
together in my opinion acting-wise

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.030 
together in my opinion acting-wise
honestly<00:03:09.689> it's<00:03:09.959> hard<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.409> grade<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.709> acting

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
honestly it's hard to grade the acting

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.069 
honestly it's hard to grade the acting
because<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.790> goes<00:03:12.000> along<00:03:12.180> with<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.629> movie<00:03:12.959> and

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
because it goes along with the movie and

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.960 
because it goes along with the movie and
the<00:03:13.109> movies<00:03:13.409> crazy<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.859> ridiculous<00:03:13.919> and<00:03:14.459> so

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
the movies crazy and ridiculous and so

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.670 
the movies crazy and ridiculous and so
is<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.180> acting<00:03:15.480> it's<00:03:15.689> kind<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:15.959> just<00:03:16.109> I<00:03:16.379> don't

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
is the acting it's kind of just I don't

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.020 
is the acting it's kind of just I don't
really<00:03:16.889> know<00:03:17.099> how<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.549> take<00:03:17.729> it<00:03:17.790> seriously

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
really know how to take it seriously

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.149 
really know how to take it seriously
because<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.989> fits<00:03:19.440> well<00:03:19.590> with<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.799> movies<00:03:20.040> so

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
because it fits well with the movies so

okay you know what you got what you
wanted<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.799> that's<00:03:53.010> fine<00:03:53.220> so<00:03:53.579> looking<00:03:53.909> at<00:03:54.060> it

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
wanted and that's fine so looking at it

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.879 
wanted and that's fine so looking at it
that<00:03:54.359> way<00:03:54.389> once<00:03:55.139> again<00:03:55.409> I<00:03:55.439> think<00:03:55.560> it's<00:03:55.799> going

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
that way once again I think it's going

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.759 
that way once again I think it's going
to<00:03:55.949> be<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.370> big<00:03:56.970> hit<00:03:57.269> with<00:03:57.569> a<00:03:57.840> small<00:03:58.379> amount<00:03:58.409> of

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
to be a big hit with a small amount of

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.500 
to be a big hit with a small amount of
people<00:03:59.129> but<00:03:59.459> overall<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.879> think<00:04:00.000> people<00:04:00.359> are

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
people but overall I think people are

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.879 
people but overall I think people are
not<00:04:00.689> really<00:04:00.900> going<00:04:01.049> to<00:04:01.109> get<00:04:01.290> this<00:04:01.439> movie<00:04:01.739> maybe

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
not really going to get this movie maybe

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.229 
not really going to get this movie maybe
I'll<00:04:02.040> be<00:04:02.159> surprised<00:04:02.549> but<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:02.819> think<00:04:03.030> it's<00:04:03.150> going

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
I'll be surprised but I think it's going

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.330 
I'll be surprised but I think it's going
to<00:04:03.299> be<00:04:03.419> a<00:04:03.449> very<00:04:03.720> tiny<00:04:04.049> niche<00:04:04.379> thing<00:04:04.739> however

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
to be a very tiny niche thing however

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.429
