00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
few hours and get on to our next recipe

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.760 
few hours and get on to our next recipe
which<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.540> tropical<00:02:13.540> tostada

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
which is tropical tostada

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.370 
which is tropical tostada
so<00:02:15.520> now<00:02:15.640> we're<00:02:15.760> gonna<00:02:15.850> make<00:02:16.060> some<00:02:16.120> crusts<00:02:17.110> for

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
so this is going to create a crust which

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.320 
so this is going to create a crust which
we<00:02:34.030> will<00:02:34.150> dehydrate<00:02:34.680> at<00:02:35.680> 110<00:02:36.580> degrees<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:37.180> like

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
we will dehydrate at 110 degrees I like

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.660 
we will dehydrate at 110 degrees I like
to<00:02:37.450> keep<00:02:37.570> it<00:02:37.750> under<00:02:37.840> 118<00:02:38.590> degrees<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.340> know

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
to keep it under 118 degrees so I know

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.130 
to keep it under 118 degrees so I know
that<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.940> enzymes<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.690> nutrients

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
that the enzymes and the nutrients

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.190 
that the enzymes and the nutrients
proteins<00:02:41.590> are<00:02:41.710> all<00:02:41.800> intact<00:02:44.640> there<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.700> go

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
proteins are all intact there you go
