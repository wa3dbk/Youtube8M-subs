00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
dicking hats weren't tick tock clock and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.790 
dicking hats weren't tick tock clock and
um

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.290 

airship<00:03:01.800> in<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.099> level<00:03:02.370> because<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:03.150> was

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
airship in this level because that was

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.699 
airship in this level because that was
like<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.569> only<00:03:03.840> thing<00:03:04.050> that's<00:03:04.230> ever<00:03:04.349> come<00:03:04.590> out

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
like the only thing that's ever come out

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
of Super Mario Brothers G that I thought

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.540 
of Super Mario Brothers G that I thought
was<00:03:06.270> really<00:03:06.420> cool<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.930> reference<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:08.220> airship

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
was really cool to reference the airship

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170
