00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.420
 race 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.179
 first thing we were not 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.679
 activities in rosemont is good 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.500
 will allow for the horse as soon as they 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.719
 take care of more but hey it's a 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.530
 beautiful race as convincing 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:46.629
 I tried to hang the little bit more 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.629
 simple here that 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:01:02.079
 and well fresh timoko obviously appears 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.790
 to be the race horse but 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.590
 the opposition and is doing mainly 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.810
 commander twice laureate twice 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.979
 kymi grand prix 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.300

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.369
 races of the year associated with his 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.080
 new robin bakker pilot held in 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.070
 high esteem by fabrice souloy 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.470
 it'll be a little more raised we see 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.640
 to get a little bit big no depends 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.140
 how true is the first 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.340
 it was not so easy a cause 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.539
 it works and two enemies of the size 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.160
 record as the second it was 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:28.690
 really easy so it was good for 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.770
 him to get back into the bath do not have 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.800
 so it's easy now 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.990
 Today it is with a little bit 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.909
 judgment of the cedh is able to 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.270
 cure 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.799
 his fate the horses parade in front of the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.700
 public and the match is announced between 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.679

 robin bakker and commander cros take 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.310
 the head and well couple comes quickly 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.020
 placed timoko to his outside in the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.549
 last turning timoko looks tired 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.259
 but it is only to better start again 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.880
 timoko outdo themselves to get ahead 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.479
 sketch commander finds a shape 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.340
 magnificent 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.259
 the southwestern horse picks up his 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.759
 tenth group 1 the reduction 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.649
 kilometer is not impressive 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.369
 a May 13 the last meters were 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.270
 very fast 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.660
 a Greek born to the wind 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.280
 he can do everything he can all that is 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.989
 really phenomenon is not you from my 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:19.120
 turn I lost I know what it is 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.120
 why weather does not work too fast 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.599
 and every hour it was good 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.220
 the association provided by the coach 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.840
 as early as April with the biggest 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.489
 Swedish rigor is a huge success 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.080
 four races for as many wins 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.269
 a first in the grand prix kymi 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.400
 for the gold helmet me I speak at it 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.230
 makes a very good race 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.220
 I am I was very happy then 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.909
 not very happy for me I was 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.340
 happy to be the first outside I 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.019
 I'm not happy with the orders to miss 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.360
 in the lead because as a very 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.680
 good and before the race and win it 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.069
 easily the last race and I 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.829
 afraid to order in mind but art 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.380
 is a great war the last season 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.600
 m 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.420
 my horse there just defeated commander 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.560
 just before the finish with that because he has 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.900

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.760
 with her keel had her head she did 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:16.599
 a good job is there 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:18.579
 very impressive we are very happy 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.409
 to win this race it's his tenth 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:27.849
 group 1 and that's important for its 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:29.980
 elite stallion club career it was 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.049

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.230
 the choice of his next commitment 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.329

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.200
