00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:10.469
 so people here is the following and it's 16 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.139
 home, and it's good, we have a 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.510
 cb 300 2011 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:22.140
 The fact is that he took this bike to a 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:26.400
 mechanical mechanic month did the cleaning 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:31.890
 This nozzle cleaning system played together 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:35.040
 Finally, the bike did not work and the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.460
 bike stayed there for about a month more 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.520
 or less and the problem has not been resolved 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:48.390
 he brought here is what we can see 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:53.730
 that the head of him crashed discovered the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.690
 problem has not discovered a problem that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.430
 that the defect which gave was that here we 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.430
 take a look at the head 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.790
 Let's take a look at the head. 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:28.530
 but the only reason you're home is a 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:32.040
 here and here and the engine will not 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.070
 leaking understanding if you see that 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.970
 she chose here what is the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.009
 compression of the world's engine flow then 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:48.560
 lost shopping compression ratio 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:55.439
 and now this head here was already sun 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:59.430
 software, that's it, people how to do it 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.680
 this head with her to walk and 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.250
 leave a service 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.250
 beautiful
