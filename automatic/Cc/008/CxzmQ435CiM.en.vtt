00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:09.830
 I'm in town This time, I would like to introduce the custom I've been doing 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:21.420
 At first it is a bikini cowl 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:24.260
 In this way, I use 180 cups of general-purpose bikini cowl 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.580
 By this being a 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:33.970
 The wind coming to my belly is not coming so much 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.970
 I feel that some fatigue has been alleviated 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:44.730
 It is yes and 35 w 6000 Kelvin hid 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.410
 It is hi and low correspondence 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.670
 Something like this 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.670
 Pretty bright Lou 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:01:02.340
 And it is a LED blinker 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.340
 This is also very bright and you can see it from the front 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:14.030
 And it is LED smoke tail lamp for net 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.030
 This is also led so it's very bright and easy to be with my brother 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:24.030
 And the rear blinker is also an LED blinker 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.030
 This also looks bright enough 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.840
 And here is the license plate cover 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.840
 It is a black edge here 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:40.260
 By this being 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.330
 Thank you for the license plate due to that vibration 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.390
 Something 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:49.780
 The number of my cd 50 is crooked with that little vibration 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.850
 Well it is something to prevent it 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:58.549
 Because it is Tomaa 250 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.850
 It looks like it looks like a large displacement when viewed from a distance by putting it on 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.850
 I will 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:12.100
 And here is behind this license plate server 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:17.310
 It is a number tool hook you wearing a tool hook 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:20.360
 By adding this, when loading luggage 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.360
 Stand in doing 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:32.080
 Yes, this is the ic winker relay under the seat 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:36.370
 When this is replaced with LED blinker 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:41.430
 It will blink fast if it is a genuine turn signal relay 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.430
 So you need to change to ic blinker relay 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:54.060
 This is the engine slider 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:55.410
 Recessed when the wait is sometimes dunk Hornet of the tank was the ironing, which also was in the very large 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.830
 Will be 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.830
 So we put the slider for Standing moss prevention 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.180
 And with cigar socket power supply 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:13.390
 It is usb power 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.390
 This power supply is taken from the week second power supply 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.980
 10 days such Yes and pollinators such a 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:26.260
 Make it all led 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:32.530
 If you are in the meter class, there are three t 10 LED lamps. 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:38.140
 There is one speedometer and two tachometers . 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:41.300
 And it is the turn signal indicator lamp and high beam 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:46.150
 East neutral lamp is also led 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.150
 Planning has become a led after the key 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.970
 By the way Makura is still also I'd a place you want to exchange money Achotto not so much 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.100
 Than 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.100
 Muffler replacement is likely to be ahead 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:12.460
 And this is a tank pad- 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:17.010
 Will prevent the scratched when sitting by spanned this 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.010
 Because I did not do 1000 yen, it was a great deal 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:25.290
 By the way, I put this carbon seal also on this tank cap 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.290
 Pretty cool 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:35.009
 Yes, this is a ballast of 叡 id 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.400
 This is to remove the tank 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:40.710
 It is fixed to the frame 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.380
 Even if you turn the handle 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.380
 I'm fixed to the extent not to hit the last minute 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:05:01.870
 If you want to do more custom, you can do this 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:07.000
 This is a radiator cover It is this silver metal 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:10.220
 This is easy to remove and I think from a hex wrench 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.689
 I think it will be done with a hex wrench 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.740
 Remove this 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:19.840
 If you drop the color and repaint again 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.669
 Can be custom to your color 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.669
 We do not and my laws 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.970
 Drop the paint 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.970
 It will fill in red to the underlying processing 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:41.190
 By the way, it is a hornet's tail lamp 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:46.860
 It seems that you can use the led lamp of cbr practice wr 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:53.370
 It is a first leg wr of cd r of the better not the current model to say that 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:56.490
 People who don't like this shape seem to be able to put on something 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:01.220
 I think it is already cool 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.220
 Maybe it feels like you remove and attach the cowl 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:13.850
 You can always change whether you decide yes or not 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.850
 It is ok even if you write according to the color 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:22.889
 And I can also put on the handle brace I'm not attached but someday 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:29.030
 I want to put 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:29.030
 Well I want a red handle brace if you attach it to this 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:40.729
 Yes I've done my own buying as far as possible so much money 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:47.379
 I'm going to try not to go away 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:47.379
 I think it will cost a lot of money by replacing the muffler 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:59.350
 Yes more than Hornet's ever done custom 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:59.350
 More than please enjoy and custom bike is caught car
