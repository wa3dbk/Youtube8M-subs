are all different types of blocks which
is<00:02:50.570> super<00:02:51.170> cool<00:02:51.410> for<00:02:51.709> custom<00:02:52.100> maps<00:02:52.310> this<00:02:52.580> is

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
is super cool for custom maps this is

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.970 
is super cool for custom maps this is
like<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.780> best<00:02:53.989> like<00:02:54.410> though<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:54.709> can<00:02:54.860> put

like the best like though you can put

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.850 
like the best like though you can put
this<00:02:55.040> in<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.250> wall<00:02:55.400> as<00:02:55.519> a<00:02:55.550> clock<00:02:55.910> you<00:02:56.709> can<00:02:57.709> put

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
this in a wall as a clock you can put

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.430 
this in a wall as a clock you can put

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
this in the ground as a Spidey sensor

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.370 
this in the ground as a Spidey sensor
Spidey<00:03:00.950> man<00:03:01.250> no<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:02.330> is<00:03:02.480> like<00:03:02.630> what<00:03:03.019> is<00:03:03.140> that

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
Spidey man no this is like what is that

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
as a radar sensor and like this could be

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.259 
as a radar sensor and like this could be
a<00:03:09.709> crate<00:03:10.130> this<00:03:10.400> could<00:03:10.610> be<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:11.620> don't<00:03:12.620> know

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
a crate this could be I don't know

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.860 
a crate this could be I don't know
clone<00:03:14.980> yeah<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.010> don't<00:03:16.430> even<00:03:16.640> know<00:03:16.880> it's<00:03:17.540> just<00:03:17.720> a

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
clone yeah I don't even know it's just a

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.410 
clone yeah I don't even know it's just a
really<00:03:17.900> cool<00:03:18.440> texture<00:03:18.860> pack<00:03:19.100> for<00:03:19.850> custom<00:03:20.239> maps

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
really cool texture pack for custom maps

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.000 
really cool texture pack for custom maps
this<00:03:20.600> is<00:03:20.720> like<00:03:20.840> an<00:03:20.959> air<00:03:21.170> vent<00:03:21.380> it's<00:03:21.739> like<00:03:21.890> you

could<00:03:22.130> have<00:03:22.250> this<00:03:22.400> in<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:22.640> ceilings<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.570> is

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
could have this in the ceilings it is

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.759 
could have this in the ceilings it is
pretty<00:03:24.799> incredible<00:03:25.370> if<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.390> ask<00:03:26.570> me<00:03:26.900> so

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
pretty incredible if you ask me so

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.400 
pretty incredible if you ask me so

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
plants the saplings so let's go over

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.650 
plants the saplings so let's go over
here<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:16.549> I<00:04:16.820> don't<00:04:16.880> really<00:04:17.209> want<00:04:17.390> to<00:04:17.419> show<00:04:17.600> you

here and I don't really want to show you

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.009 
here and I don't really want to show you
these<00:04:17.840> so<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.549> wheats<00:04:19.760> like<00:04:20.000> in<00:04:20.180> pods<00:04:20.570> and

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
these so the the wheats like in pods and

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.960 
these so the the wheats like in pods and
so<00:04:21.409> these<00:04:21.590> are<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:21.919> full<00:04:22.159> pods<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:22.789> then

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
so these are the full pods and then

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.730 
so these are the full pods and then
these<00:04:23.180> this<00:04:23.539> is<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:23.720> this<00:04:24.260> is<00:04:24.320> one<00:04:24.590> that

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
these this is the this is one that

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.110 
these this is the this is one that
hasn't<00:04:24.890> grown<00:04:25.220> yet

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
hasn't grown yet

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.090 
hasn't grown yet
so<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.630> progress<00:04:26.960> meter<00:04:27.290> will<00:04:27.470> go<00:04:27.590> up<00:04:27.830> which

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
so the progress meter will go up which

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.560 
so the progress meter will go up which
is<00:04:28.280> kind<00:04:29.000> of<00:04:29.120> cool

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
is kind of cool

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.930 
is kind of cool

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
over here the this is like the water

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.450 
over here the this is like the water
which<00:04:32.300> is<00:04:33.910> it's<00:04:34.910> completely<00:04:35.419> nasty<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:37.280> bad

which is it's completely nasty the bad
thing<00:04:37.699> about<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:37.910> switchback<00:04:38.330> is<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:38.660> moving

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
thing about the switchback is the moving

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.140 
thing about the switchback is the moving
water<00:04:39.139> does<00:04:39.410> not<00:04:39.620> even<00:04:39.860> show<00:04:40.370> up<00:04:42.910> as<00:04:43.910> you<00:04:44.030> can

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150

water does not even show up as you can
see<00:04:45.190> well<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.580> might<00:04:46.760> might<00:04:47.060> show<00:04:47.300> up<00:04:47.449> it<00:04:47.600> just

the cliff sheep is now floating like
devil<00:05:31.400> box<00:05:31.639> which<00:05:32.120> is<00:05:33.250> pretty<00:05:34.250> pretty<00:05:34.490> sweet<00:05:34.729> I

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
don't know if that was on purpose but if

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.680 
don't know if that was on purpose but if
I<00:05:37.370> was<00:05:37.490> in<00:05:37.610> Fallout<00:05:37.940> I'd<00:05:38.090> be<00:05:38.180> scared<00:05:38.479> of<00:05:38.570> flying

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
I was in Fallout I'd be scared of flying

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.270 
I was in Fallout I'd be scared of flying
robots<00:05:39.320> and<00:05:39.500> I<00:05:39.590> think<00:05:39.830> that's<00:05:40.010> what<00:05:40.130> they're

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
robots and I think that's what they're

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.940 
robots and I think that's what they're
going<00:05:40.520> for<00:05:41.020> thousand<00:05:42.020> a<00:05:42.110> thousand<00:05:42.500> a<00:05:42.560> nuclear

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
going for thousand a thousand a nuclear

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.850 
going for thousand a thousand a nuclear
fallout<00:05:43.360> and<00:05:44.360> down<00:05:44.570> here<00:05:44.810> we<00:05:44.930> have<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.500> pigs

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
fallout and down here we have the pigs

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.990 
fallout and down here we have the pigs
and<00:05:46.660> left<00:05:47.660> sheikhan<00:05:48.310> so<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:49.460> chicken<00:05:49.820> is<00:05:49.970> a

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
and left sheikhan so the chicken is a

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.219 
and left sheikhan so the chicken is a
smaller<00:05:50.800> floating<00:05:51.800> nuclear<00:05:52.750> robot<00:05:53.750> I<00:05:53.780> believe

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
smaller floating nuclear robot I believe

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.219 
smaller floating nuclear robot I believe
and<00:05:54.560> the<00:05:55.070> pigs<00:05:55.340> are<00:05:55.550> just<00:05:55.580> like<00:05:55.970> dead<00:05:56.419> like<00:05:56.960> I

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
and the pigs are just like dead like I

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.200 
and the pigs are just like dead like I
don't<00:05:57.500> even<00:05:57.680> know<00:05:58.720> it's<00:05:59.720> pretty<00:06:00.500> freaky

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
don't even know it's pretty freaky

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.640 
don't even know it's pretty freaky
anyway<00:06:02.210> this<00:06:02.389> is<00:06:02.570> somewhat<00:06:03.169> what<00:06:03.470> some

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
anyway this is somewhat what some

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.400 
anyway this is somewhat what some
landscape<00:06:04.160> would<00:06:04.340> look<00:06:04.460> like<00:06:04.639> around<00:06:04.849> here

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
landscape would look like around here

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.110 
landscape would look like around here
just<00:06:06.410> some<00:06:06.470> nice<00:06:06.650> landscape<00:06:07.310> it's<00:06:07.610> really

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
just some nice landscape it's really

really dark and really really really
gloomy<00:06:11.590> but<00:06:12.590> it<00:06:12.889> is<00:06:13.099> great<00:06:14.060> for<00:06:14.360> texture<00:06:14.810> packs

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
gloomy but it is great for texture packs

gloomy but it is great for texture packs
if<00:06:15.860> you're<00:06:16.039> trying<00:06:16.190> to<00:06:16.250> make<00:06:16.340> a<00:06:16.370> custom<00:06:16.820> map

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
if you're trying to make a custom map

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.029

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
gonna make another custom map and it was

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.589 
gonna make another custom map and it was
nuclear<00:06:26.990> fallout<00:06:27.770> related<00:06:28.460> I<00:06:28.639> would

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 
nuclear fallout related I would

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.740 
nuclear fallout related I would
definitely<00:06:30.050> recommend<00:06:30.820> making<00:06:31.820> it<00:06:31.970> with<00:06:32.479> this
