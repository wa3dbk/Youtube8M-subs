00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.820 
the game started so now how does it
change<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:34.270> think<00:02:34.750> it's<00:02:34.930> way<00:02:35.050> more<00:02:35.080> complex<00:02:35.709> I

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
change I think it's way more complex I

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.290 
change I think it's way more complex I
mean<00:02:35.980> gradually<00:02:36.490> got<00:02:36.610> more<00:02:36.640> complex<00:02:37.120> when<00:02:37.209> we

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
mean gradually got more complex when we

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.670 
mean gradually got more complex when we
have<00:02:37.390> more<00:02:37.570> types<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:37.959> cars<00:02:38.170> like<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.560> know

different<00:02:39.160> things<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.400> can<00:02:39.520> do<00:02:39.730> different

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
different things you can do different

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.350 
different things you can do different
rules<00:02:41.020> even

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
rules even

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.990 
rules even
more<00:02:42.840> complex<00:02:43.290> yeah<00:02:43.470> more<00:02:43.890> competitive<00:02:44.460> now<00:02:44.490> I

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
more complex yeah more competitive now I

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.570 
more complex yeah more competitive now I
mean<00:02:45.330> we<00:02:45.450> have<00:02:45.540> thousand<00:02:45.990> person<00:02:46.290> why<00:02:47.010> CSS<00:02:47.490> as
