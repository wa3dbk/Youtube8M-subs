00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.459 

all<00:00:08.240> right<00:00:08.450> so<00:00:08.660> we're<00:00:09.170> doing<00:00:09.260> a<00:00:09.530> test

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.709 

or<00:00:12.530> over<00:00:13.089> sophisticated<00:00:14.089> tests<00:00:14.299> but<00:00:14.570> it's

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
or over sophisticated tests but it's

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:15.840 
or over sophisticated tests but it's
just<00:00:14.900> you<00:00:15.559> know<00:00:15.650> the

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:15.850 
just you know the

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.560 
just you know the
result<00:00:16.120> so<00:00:16.390> it's<00:00:16.540> just<00:00:16.720> a<00:00:16.870> test<00:00:17.170> to<00:00:17.710> show<00:00:18.570> the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
result so it's just a test to show the

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.810 
result so it's just a test to show the
how<00:00:20.050> the<00:00:20.110> brain<00:00:20.410> works<00:00:20.440> on<00:00:20.950> the<00:00:21.280> specialized

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
how the brain works on the specialized

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.260 
how the brain works on the specialized
Stumpjumper<00:00:23.760> we're<00:00:24.760> going<00:00:24.880> to<00:00:24.940> go<00:00:25.090> through

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
Stumpjumper we're going to go through

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.070 
Stumpjumper we're going to go through
this<00:00:25.390> screen<00:00:25.810> right<00:00:25.960> here<00:00:26.230> and<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:28.090> a<00:00:28.750> small

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
this screen right here and it's a small

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.820 
this screen right here and it's a small
rain<00:00:29.320> Rutter's<00:00:29.800> you<00:00:30.340> know<00:00:30.460> I<00:00:30.490> mean<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.830> we

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
rain Rutter's you know I mean and we

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.710 
rain Rutter's you know I mean and we
just<00:00:36.040> point<00:00:36.580> to<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:36.730> brain<00:00:37.030> here<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:40.450> that<00:00:40.660> a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
just point to the brain here is that a

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.260 
just point to the brain here is that a
brain<00:00:41.020> what<00:00:41.620> I<00:00:41.739> do<00:00:41.800> we're<00:00:42.190> going<00:00:42.370> to<00:00:42.430> do<00:00:42.550> two

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
brain what I do we're going to do two

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.160 
brain what I do we're going to do two
passes<00:00:43.809> through<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.379> rainbow<00:00:44.699> now<00:00:45.900> the<00:00:46.900> first

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
passes through the rainbow now the first

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.509 
passes through the rainbow now the first
time<00:00:47.430> would<00:00:48.430> be<00:00:48.870> totally<00:00:49.870> open<00:00:50.080> it's<00:00:50.949> actually

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
time would be totally open it's actually

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.410 
time would be totally open it's actually
going<00:00:51.699> to<00:00:51.820> be<00:00:52.809> really<00:00:53.620> soft<00:00:53.890> and<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:55.059> second

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
going to be really soft and the second

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.210 
going to be really soft and the second
time<00:00:55.600> we're<00:00:56.080> going<00:00:56.199> to<00:00:56.260> have<00:00:56.409> it<00:00:56.530> fully<00:00:56.680> closed

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
time we're going to have it fully closed

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.630 
time we're going to have it fully closed
and<00:00:57.580> so<00:00:57.699> it's<00:00:57.879> going<00:00:58.089> to<00:00:58.150> be<00:00:58.300> very<00:00:58.870> firm<00:00:59.640> and

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
and so it's going to be very firm and

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.520 
and so it's going to be very firm and
again<00:01:01.210> this<00:01:01.330> is<00:01:01.510> just<00:01:01.540> to<00:01:01.750> illustrate<00:01:01.930> what

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
again this is just to illustrate what

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.240 
again this is just to illustrate what
the<00:01:02.650> back<00:01:02.830> wheel<00:01:03.129> was<00:01:03.460> on<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.409> suspension<00:01:05.830> and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
the back wheel was on the suspension and

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.500 
the back wheel was on the suspension and
so<00:01:07.030> that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
so that

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.690 
so that
see<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:07.780> results<00:01:08.200> we're<00:01:08.800> not<00:01:08.920> going<00:01:09.130> clips<00:01:09.460> or

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
see the results we're not going clips or

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.010 
see the results we're not going clips or
anything<00:01:09.730> like<00:01:10.120> that<00:01:10.150> but<00:01:10.510> you<00:01:10.570> can<00:01:10.660> really

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
anything like that but you can really

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.870 
anything like that but you can really
get<00:01:11.290> kind<00:01:11.590> of<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.800> feeling<00:01:12.070> for<00:01:12.310> how<00:01:12.520> it's<00:01:12.700> going

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
get kind of a feeling for how it's going

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.590 
get kind of a feeling for how it's going
to<00:01:12.940> work<00:01:13.890> we're<00:01:14.890> going<00:01:14.980> to<00:01:15.040> have<00:01:15.220> a<00:01:15.300> rebound<00:01:16.300> on

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
to work we're going to have a rebound on

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.170 
to work we're going to have a rebound on
a<00:01:17.730> full<00:01:18.730> fat<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:21.490> I<00:01:21.520> said<00:01:21.760> we're<00:01:21.940> going

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
a full fat and like I said we're going

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.730 
a full fat and like I said we're going
to<00:01:22.270> go<00:01:22.360> through<00:01:22.540> this<00:01:22.600> twice<00:01:22.810> keep<00:01:23.500> your<00:01:23.680> eyes

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
to go through this twice keep your eyes

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.560 
to go through this twice keep your eyes
on<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:24.190> back<00:01:24.340> wheel<00:01:24.640> that's<00:01:25.300> where<00:01:25.480> the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
on the back wheel that's where the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.540 
on the back wheel that's where the
cameras<00:01:25.900> can<00:01:25.930> refine<00:01:26.380> it<00:01:26.530> any<00:01:26.650> way<00:01:26.860> but<00:01:27.100> people

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
cameras can refine it any way but people

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.270 
cameras can refine it any way but people
here<00:01:27.910> precise<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.690> see<00:01:28.900> how<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.350> spring<00:01:29.980> kind

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
here precise to see how the spring kind

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.110 
here precise to see how the spring kind
of<00:01:30.370> action<00:01:30.760> with<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.450> suspension

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:50.010 

you

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.890 

so<00:01:51.020> if<00:01:51.799> you<00:01:51.979> watch<00:01:52.130> carefully<00:01:52.760> when<00:01:53.330> we<00:01:53.780> were

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
so if you watch carefully when we were

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.539 
so if you watch carefully when we were
going<00:01:54.170> through<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.500> couple<00:01:54.799> of<00:01:54.890> passes<00:01:55.340> here

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
going through the couple of passes here

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.800 
going through the couple of passes here
the<00:01:55.760> first<00:01:56.000> pass<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:57.740> brain<00:01:58.520> was<00:01:58.790> fully<00:01:59.420> soft

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
the first pass the brain was fully soft

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.580 
the first pass the brain was fully soft
and<00:02:00.190> we<00:02:01.190> went<00:02:01.430> through<00:02:01.790> and<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:03.080> rear

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
and we went through and the rear

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.249 
and we went through and the rear
suspension<00:02:03.740> compressed<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:05.420> when<00:02:05.720> we<00:02:05.840> came

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
suspension compressed and when we came

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.570 
suspension compressed and when we came
through<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.979> bulb<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.520> rain<00:02:07.820> run<00:02:08.590> he<00:02:09.590> had<00:02:10.550> a

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
through the bulb the rain run he had a

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.750 
through the bulb the rain run he had a
couple<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.060> more<00:02:11.209> bounces<00:02:11.720> outside<00:02:12.410> of<00:02:13.010> the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
couple of more bounces outside of the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.270 
couple of more bounces outside of the
rain<00:02:13.940> run<00:02:14.150> now<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:15.500> second<00:02:15.860> time<00:02:16.010> we<00:02:16.100> went

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
rain run now the second time we went

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.180 
rain run now the second time we went
through<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:17.920> brain<00:02:18.920> was<00:02:19.430> on<00:02:19.700> full<00:02:20.239> firm<00:02:20.540> and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
through the brain was on full firm and

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.650 
through the brain was on full firm and
so<00:02:22.190> we<00:02:22.310> went<00:02:22.489> through<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.300> compressed

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
so we went through and it compressed

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.990 
so we went through and it compressed
again<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.140> did<00:02:24.320> that<00:02:24.709> basic<00:02:25.340> same<00:02:25.550> compression

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
again it did that basic same compression

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.270 
again it did that basic same compression
and<00:02:26.450> when<00:02:27.350> we<00:02:27.470> came<00:02:27.620> out<00:02:27.680> though<00:02:28.040> it

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
and when we came out though it

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.040 
and when we came out though it
stabilized<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.390> didn't<00:02:29.660> consume<00:02:29.930> any

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
stabilized it didn't consume any

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.509 
stabilized it didn't consume any
balancing<00:02:30.500> afterwards<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.160> that's<00:02:31.280> really

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
balancing afterwards and that's really

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.050 
balancing afterwards and that's really
why<00:02:32.090> we<00:02:32.360> chose<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:32.959> video<00:02:33.290> or<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:34.070> yeah

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
why we chose you that video or that yeah

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.910 
why we chose you that video or that yeah
that<00:02:35.090> little<00:02:35.480> bit<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.690> video<00:02:35.959> was<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.830> you

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
that little bit of video was so that you

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.680 
that little bit of video was so that you
could<00:02:36.950> see<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.340> effect<00:02:37.850> of<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.239> brain<00:02:38.480> on

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
could see the effect of the brain on

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.110 
could see the effect of the brain on
suspension<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.530> what<00:02:40.010> it's<00:02:40.160> doing<00:02:40.519> now<00:02:40.700> we

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
suspension and what it's doing now we

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.680 
suspension and what it's doing now we
realize<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:43.340> lot<00:02:44.060> of<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.330> are<00:02:44.480> going<00:02:44.600> to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
realize that a lot of you are going to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.630 
realize that a lot of you are going to
be<00:02:44.780> riding<00:02:44.959> much<00:02:45.260> bigger<00:02:45.560> stuff<00:02:45.920> going<00:02:46.459> much

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
be riding much bigger stuff going much

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.449 
be riding much bigger stuff going much
faster<00:02:46.880> than<00:02:47.300> we<00:02:47.450> went<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:48.250> that's<00:02:49.250> not

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
faster than we went and that's not

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.640 
faster than we went and that's not
really<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.819> point<00:02:50.000> though<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.900> point<00:02:51.170> is<00:02:51.440> is

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
really the point though the point is is

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.130 
really the point though the point is is
we're<00:02:51.830> trying<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.370> illustrate<00:02:52.810> what<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:53.840> does

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
we're trying to illustrate what it does

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.050 
we're trying to illustrate what it does
slow<00:02:54.829> speeds<00:02:55.160> on<00:02:55.310> small<00:02:55.579> stuff<00:02:55.850> because

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
slow speeds on small stuff because

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.000 
slow speeds on small stuff because
pretty<00:02:56.269> much<00:02:56.360> everybody's<00:02:57.079> riding<00:02:57.560> they're

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
pretty much everybody's riding they're

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.080 
pretty much everybody's riding they're
going<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.190> come<00:02:58.340> into<00:02:58.489> contact<00:02:58.700> with

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
going to come into contact with

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.750 
going to come into contact with
something<00:02:59.390> like<00:02:59.690> this<00:02:59.959> and<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:00.980> it'll<00:03:01.519> give

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
something like this and so it'll give

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.589 
something like this and so it'll give
you<00:03:01.880> an<00:03:02.000> idea<00:03:02.150> on<00:03:02.900> some<00:03:03.470> level<00:03:03.920> of<00:03:04.130> what<00:03:04.340> it

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
you an idea on some level of what it

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.099 
you an idea on some level of what it
react<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.290> on<00:03:05.590> bigger<00:03:06.579> bumps<00:03:07.420> at<00:03:07.599> faster

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
react to on bigger bumps at faster

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:17.800 
react to on bigger bumps at faster
speeds<00:03:08.140> as<00:03:08.620> well

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:27.220 

you

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.490 

alright<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.950> next

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
alright so the next

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.310 
alright so the next
is<00:03:29.620> going<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.370> be<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:31.840> show<00:03:32.020> how<00:03:32.260> the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
is going to be to show how the

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.280 
is going to be to show how the
suspension<00:03:33.070> reacts<00:03:33.550> to<00:03:33.820> pedaling<00:03:34.210> we're<00:03:35.170> not

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
suspension reacts to pedaling we're not

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.810 
suspension reacts to pedaling we're not
going<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.500> do<00:03:35.560> any<00:03:35.740> bumps<00:03:36.070> because<00:03:36.220> we<00:03:36.580> already

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
going to do any bumps because we already

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.120 
going to do any bumps because we already
did<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.180> we<00:03:37.330> showed<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:37.540> with<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.130> grain

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
did that we showed that with the grain

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.540 
did that we showed that with the grain
rut<00:03:39.430> experiment<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:41.500> so<00:03:42.250> what<00:03:42.340> we're<00:03:42.460> going

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
rut experiment and so what we're going

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.920 
rut experiment and so what we're going
to<00:03:42.610> do<00:03:42.790> is<00:03:42.970> we're<00:03:43.180> going<00:03:43.300> to<00:03:43.360> go<00:03:43.540> on<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:43.720> flat

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
to do is we're going to go on a flat

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.990 
to do is we're going to go on a flat
surface<00:03:44.200> we're<00:03:44.710> going<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:44.920> pedal<00:03:45.460> standing<00:03:45.880> up

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
surface we're going to pedal standing up

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.830 
surface we're going to pedal standing up
just<00:03:46.630> a<00:03:47.200> side<00:03:47.440> note<00:03:47.470> we<00:03:48.250> already<00:03:48.850> tried<00:03:49.480> this

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
just a side note we already tried this

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.080 
just a side note we already tried this
sitting<00:03:50.740> down<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:51.250> there's<00:03:51.760> really<00:03:51.880> nothing

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
sitting down and there's really nothing

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.580 
sitting down and there's really nothing
to<00:03:52.330> show<00:03:52.540> so<00:03:52.810> we're<00:03:52.930> not<00:03:52.990> going<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.260> show<00:03:53.410> it

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
to show so we're not going to show it

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.620 
to show so we're not going to show it
sitting<00:03:53.860> down<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.490> bike<00:03:54.670> pedals<00:03:55.060> excellent

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
sitting down the bike pedals excellent

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.140 
sitting down the bike pedals excellent
with<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.870> brain<00:03:56.110> on<00:03:56.320> or<00:03:56.680> off<00:03:57.150> pedaling

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
with the brain on or off pedaling

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.220 
with the brain on or off pedaling
sitting<00:03:58.480> down<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:01.120> what<00:04:01.720> we're<00:04:01.870> going<00:04:01.959> to<00:04:02.020> do

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
sitting down so what we're going to do

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.140 
sitting down so what we're going to do
instead<00:04:02.530> is<00:04:03.160> we're<00:04:03.489> going<00:04:03.580> to<00:04:03.640> go<00:04:03.850> in<00:04:04.000> the

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
instead is we're going to go in the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.240 
instead is we're going to go in the
hardest<00:04:04.600> gear<00:04:04.870> for<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.440> suspension<00:04:05.830> that<00:04:06.130> is

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
hardest gear for the suspension that is

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.760 
hardest gear for the suspension that is
granny<00:04:06.489> gear<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:08.040> we're<00:04:09.040> going<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.489> do<00:04:10.330> some

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
granny gear and we're going to do some

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.380 
granny gear and we're going to do some
pretty<00:04:11.770> hard<00:04:12.310> peddling<00:04:12.790> in<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:12.970> granny<00:04:13.180> gear

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
pretty hard peddling in the granny gear

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.180 
pretty hard peddling in the granny gear
not<00:04:13.690> ridiculous<00:04:14.320> or<00:04:14.500> anything<00:04:14.650> but<00:04:14.950> it's<00:04:15.100> just

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
not ridiculous or anything but it's just

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.210 
not ridiculous or anything but it's just
to<00:04:15.370> show<00:04:15.550> how<00:04:15.850> this<00:04:16.419> is<00:04:16.600> sent<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:16.989> react<00:04:17.230> in

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
to show how this is sent and react in

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.940 
to show how this is sent and react in
the<00:04:18.430> granny<00:04:18.669> gear<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.200> brain<00:04:20.410> react

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
the granny gear and the brain react

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.420 
the granny gear and the brain react
react<00:04:21.370> interact<00:04:21.820> with<00:04:22.090> the

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430
