 developers working in stores 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.740

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.110
 contracts that demarcate them 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.240
 responsibility although it treats them under a 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.310

 deceased Juan Carlos García could not 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.990

 we do not have that service because security 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.160
 this one unfortunately does not give us that 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.160
 service to have our things safe 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.990
 they steal us when we leave the store 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.660
