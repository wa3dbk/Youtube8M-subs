00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
experienced it is just out of this world

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.979 
experienced it is just out of this world
it<00:00:43.500> was<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:44.010> wasn't<00:00:44.129> saying<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.579> was<00:00:44.730> um<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.300> was

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it was it wasn't saying it was um it was

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.810 
it was it wasn't saying it was um it was
a<00:00:46.019> beautiful<00:00:46.170> car<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.859> went<00:00:47.010> incredibly

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
a beautiful car that went incredibly

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.700 
a beautiful car that went incredibly
quickly<00:00:48.149> everything<00:00:48.899> about<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.109> just<00:00:49.440> felt

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
quickly everything about it just felt

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.020 
quickly everything about it just felt
good<00:00:49.769> a<00:00:49.920> problem<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.250> Sat<00:00:50.460> Nav<00:00:50.489> which<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.000> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
good a problem the Sat Nav which is a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.660 
good a problem the Sat Nav which is a
bit<00:00:51.210> dated<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:52.079> seems<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.859> bit<00:00:52.949> pedantic<00:00:53.280> to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
bit dated but seems a bit pedantic to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.220 
bit dated but seems a bit pedantic to
live<00:00:53.820> against<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.359> core<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.839> expense

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
live against the core of that expense

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.450 
live against the core of that expense
but<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.649> would<00:00:55.859> kind<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.339> expect

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
but then you would kind of expect

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.549 
but then you would kind of expect
everything<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.149> work<00:00:57.390> exactly<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.350> know

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
everything to work exactly you just know

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.340 
everything to work exactly you just know
it<00:00:58.769> worked<00:00:59.249> it<00:00:59.670> was<00:00:59.789> just<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.030> bit<00:01:00.269> oh<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:01.320> be

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
it worked it was just a bit oh to be

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.810 
it worked it was just a bit oh to be
fair<00:01:01.440> that's<00:01:01.739> probably<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> only<00:01:02.370> thing<00:01:02.699> that

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
fair that's probably the only thing that

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.910 
fair that's probably the only thing that
isn't<00:01:02.940> handcrafted<00:01:03.929> why<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> people<00:01:04.830> at

isn't handcrafted why the people at

there should be for that amount of money
you<00:01:13.770> could<00:01:13.890> probably<00:01:14.070> afford<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.640> little<00:01:14.970> man

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
