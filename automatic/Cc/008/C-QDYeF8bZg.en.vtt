if<00:00:32.880> they're<00:00:33.150> instant<00:00:33.720> eggs<00:00:34.580> now<00:00:35.580> we<00:00:35.640> need<00:00:36.060> to

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
if they're instant eggs now we need to

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:45.200 
if they're instant eggs now we need to
fold<00:00:36.330> the<00:00:36.450> paper<00:00:36.630> into<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.170> cone<00:00:37.290> shape<00:00:44.210> you

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
fold the paper into a cone shape you

00:00:45.210 --> 00:01:03.130 
fold the paper into a cone shape you
need<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.480> make<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.720> sharp<00:00:46.050> eye<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.290> the<00:00:46.559> donkey
