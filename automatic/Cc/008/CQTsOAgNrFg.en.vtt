00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.389
 a lot of things need to show about the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.940
 problem is not succinct so let's 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.580
 to give all is in formal planaltina is the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.800
 break this disgust through the mouth and throw 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.330
 41 glasses with no chance to go one 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.820
 alleged rivalry with the Lincoln 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.250
 ewerthon if you create a unique chance at 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.250
 rpg games col 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.150
 it will be a game more 17 was a move 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.660
 fantastic with spelling also in your 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.540
 region 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.280
 wilson pt go 14 afi known by 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.040
 example is not the perfect game because 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.660
 this is a new shop function in the vehicle 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.730
 we have a perfect campaign and we can not 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.590
 say this is one of the good and is normal 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.760
 in any of them they think that in their 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.829
 conception 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.809
 I hope the show we lack is even 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.820
 standard in thesis as strong that 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.190
 basically means that I only got 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.809
 see what our candidate coming to 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.340
 demonstrate how they have all consumed 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.649
 be it in the sea shell 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.300
 obviously the important thing is that there are 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.760
 points that marked a specific miracle 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.580
 in which did not win and semob technicians 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.510
 one where to all of us with care of a 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.510
 tactical system 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:30.950
 I laughed at July hi look to you is the 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:37.820
 understanding of the parties may 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:39.470
 also changed the rules can 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.450
 sign up for the goianos time 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.220
 magnificent multiplayer online mode on 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.060
 which can still lose a game today 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.920
 in five minutes or alternatively the 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.549
 auditor maps and builds our version of 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.549
 hell 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.330
 as always the popularity of video game 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.350
 is for being a version for consoles a 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.780
 passage and something else for the digit 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:13.519
 some holders but does not affect much is 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:15.440
 magnificence distributed in June to 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.300
 This person is a brooklin at school who does not 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.900
 I was in Brazil, and even with a lot of 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.900
 emotion for me 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:36.630
 certainly one of the reasons for 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:39.920
 living cause is every day and I love it 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.920
 go sport
