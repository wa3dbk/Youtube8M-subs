you<00:01:03.640> know<00:01:03.670> what<00:01:03.820> I<00:01:03.879> mean<00:01:03.910> you<00:01:04.180> learn<00:01:04.449> on<00:01:05.260> your

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
you know what I mean you learn on your

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.230 
you know what I mean you learn on your
own<00:01:05.530> you<00:01:05.950> know<00:01:06.070> to<00:01:06.130> meet<00:01:06.340> with<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.580> scars<00:01:06.910> and

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
own you know to meet with the scars and

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.450 
own you know to meet with the scars and
bruises<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:07.780> staying<00:01:08.170> out<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.620> like<00:01:08.800> so<00:01:09.340> then

bruises and staying out and like so then

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.010 
bruises and staying out and like so then
I<00:01:09.580> guess<00:01:09.790> fast<00:01:10.060> forward<00:01:10.420> to<00:01:10.540> now<00:01:11.040> 33<00:01:12.040> and<00:01:12.340> I<00:01:12.430> was

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
I guess fast forward to now 33 and I was

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.070 
I guess fast forward to now 33 and I was
14<00:01:14.020> 15<00:01:14.290> 16<00:01:14.770> when<00:01:15.189> I<00:01:15.220> was<00:01:15.400> skating<00:01:15.580> you<00:01:15.880> know

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
14 15 16 when I was skating you know

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.679 
14 15 16 when I was skating you know
when<00:01:17.080> I<00:01:17.110> first<00:01:17.350> started<00:01:17.799> so<00:01:18.210> now<00:01:19.210> applying

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
when I first started so now applying

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.719 
when I first started so now applying
that<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.049> really<00:01:20.590> think<00:01:20.799> it<00:01:21.009> plays<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.340> role<00:01:21.700> in

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
that I really think it plays a role in

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.969 
that I really think it plays a role in
like<00:01:22.150> how<00:01:22.329> you<00:01:22.390> see<00:01:22.840> stuff<00:01:23.170> no<00:01:23.500> matter<00:01:23.740> like

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
you know maybe that's not a building but

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.330 
you know maybe that's not a building but
like<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:26.259> know<00:01:26.380> it<00:01:26.530> changes<00:01:26.860> your<00:01:27.009> perception

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340
