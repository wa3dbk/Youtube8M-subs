00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.560 
beta as far as this map now one thing
that<00:01:04.290> has<00:01:04.589> been<00:01:04.860> changed<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.940> spawn

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that has been changed is the spawn

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.630

the<00:01:11.910> beta<00:01:12.240> now<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.750> guess<00:01:13.050> spawn<00:01:13.320> camping<00:01:13.920> was<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
the beta now I guess spawn camping was a

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.480 
the beta now I guess spawn camping was a
very<00:01:15.120> big<00:01:15.420> issue<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.230> much<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.680> they<00:01:17.040> even<00:01:17.310> put

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
very big issue so much so they even put

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.960 
very big issue so much so they even put
in<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.880> three<00:01:18.150> second<00:01:18.540> delay<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.700> on<00:01:20.700> top<00:01:20.909> of

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
in that three second delay and on top of

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.120 
in that three second delay and on top of
that<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.360> some<00:01:21.659> maps<00:01:21.960> since<00:01:22.500> i've<00:01:22.680> actually

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that on some maps since i've actually

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.569 
that on some maps since i've actually
played<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.700> lot<00:01:24.119> more<00:01:24.360> than<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.659> now<00:01:25.579> for

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579

three<00:01:30.119> exits<00:01:30.570> inside<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> spawn<00:01:31.590> instead<00:01:32.040> of

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
three exits inside a spawn instead of

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.580 
three exits inside a spawn instead of
just<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.579> how<00:01:32.939> they<00:01:33.119> had<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> beta<00:01:33.899> so

powerful<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.640> from<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> beta<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.600> goes

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
powerful as from the beta it goes

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.380 
powerful as from the beta it goes
underground<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.490> soon<00:01:53.700> as<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.000> finds<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
underground and as soon as it finds the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.959 
underground and as soon as it finds the
target<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.930> will<00:01:54.960> pop<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:56.430> explode

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
target it will pop up and then explode

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.120 
target it will pop up and then explode
now<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:57.539> somebody<00:01:57.990> sees<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.530> shoot<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.979> it's

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.060 
now if somebody sees you shoot it it's
really<00:01:59.939> easy<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.450> dodge<00:02:00.719> there<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> delay

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
really easy to dodge there is a delay

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.190 
really easy to dodge there is a delay
when<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.579> pops<00:02:02.850> up<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.149> could<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.570> side<00:02:03.869> roll

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
when it pops up you could just side roll

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.410 
when it pops up you could just side roll
you'll<00:02:04.560> get<00:02:04.710> slightly<00:02:05.009> damaged<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:06.329> if

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
you'll get slightly damaged but if

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.819 
you'll get slightly damaged but if
you're<00:02:06.539> in<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.689> middle<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.930> chainsawing<00:02:07.439> or

the beta everybody seems to be using
this<00:02:28.800> weapon<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.450> because<00:02:30.450> everything<00:02:30.900> is

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
this weapon and because everything is

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.540 
this weapon and because everything is
just<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.260> powerful<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.190> game<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.520> really

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
just so powerful in this game it really

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.240 
just so powerful in this game it really
works<00:02:33.030> out<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.569> just<00:02:33.600> an<00:02:34.050> extremely<00:02:34.680> balanced

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
works out it just an extremely balanced

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.570 
works out it just an extremely balanced
game<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.959> can<00:02:37.110> see<00:02:37.260> there's<00:02:37.470> fire<00:02:38.100> grenades

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.350 
game you can see there's fire grenades
and<00:02:38.910> that's<00:02:39.800> still<00:02:40.800> just<00:02:40.830> as<00:02:41.220> cool<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.700> think

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
and that's still just as cool I think

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.090

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
they upgraded the graphics though when

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.440 
they upgraded the graphics though when

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
you're holding the fire grenade now it

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.430 
you're holding the fire grenade now it
looks<00:02:45.570> like<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.810> sparkler<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:48.110> as<00:02:49.110> far<00:02:49.290> as

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
looks like a sparkler and as far as

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.680 
looks like a sparkler and as far as
weapon<00:02:49.980> timing<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.670> haven't<00:02:51.360> actually<00:02:51.420> been

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
weapon timing I haven't actually been

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.330 
weapon timing I haven't actually been
able<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.989> figure<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.410> out<00:02:52.470> yet<00:02:52.860> if<00:02:52.980> anyone

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.010 
able to figure that out yet if anyone
knows<00:02:53.550> please<00:02:53.970> definitely<00:02:54.150> did<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> comment

but<00:02:55.260> as<00:02:55.950> far<00:02:56.459> as<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.670> know<00:02:56.730> as<00:02:57.300> soon<00:02:57.959> as<00:02:58.050> you're

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
but as far as I know as soon as you're

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.860 
but as far as I know as soon as you're
out<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.410> ammo<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:59.340> weapon<00:02:59.700> starts<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.390> respond

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
out of ammo the weapon starts to respond

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.940 
out of ammo the weapon starts to respond
and<00:03:01.200> it's<00:03:01.560> roughly<00:03:02.220> 30<00:03:02.610> seconds<00:03:03.060> before<00:03:03.270> the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
and it's roughly 30 seconds before the

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:12.280 
and it's roughly 30 seconds before the
actual<00:03:04.950> weapon<00:03:05.810> responds<00:03:10.730> now<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:12.030> just

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
actual weapon responds now I just

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.229 
actual weapon responds now I just
usually<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.590> this<00:03:13.709> beta<00:03:13.980> right<00:03:14.250> here<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:15.030> run

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
usually in this beta right here you run

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.390 
usually in this beta right here you run
out<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.390> ammo<00:03:15.750> really<00:03:16.380> quickly<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.280> whole

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
out of ammo really quickly and the whole

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.220 
out of ammo really quickly and the whole
point<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:17.730> gives<00:03:17.940> war<00:03:18.209> is<00:03:18.390> fire<00:03:18.630> as<00:03:18.840> many

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
point of gives war is fire as many

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.750 
point of gives war is fire as many
bullets<00:03:19.590> as<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:19.830> can<00:03:20.040> try<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.519> be<00:03:20.640> as

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
bullets as you can try and be as

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.540 
bullets as you can try and be as
accurate<00:03:21.090> as<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.600> can<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.110> just<00:03:22.190> kill<00:03:23.190> stuff

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
accurate as you can and just kill stuff

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.690 
accurate as you can and just kill stuff
so<00:03:24.300> it<00:03:24.600> is<00:03:24.630> extremely<00:03:25.260> gory<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:27.690> love<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:27.959> I

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
so it is extremely gory and I love it I

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.860 
so it is extremely gory and I love it I
pick<00:03:29.700> up<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.910> flame<00:03:30.150> grenades<00:03:30.450> here<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.780> as

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
pick up the flame grenades here and as

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.830 
pick up the flame grenades here and as
you<00:03:30.989> can<00:03:31.110> see<00:03:31.140> they're<00:03:32.070> sparklers<00:03:32.780> they<00:03:33.780> were

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
you can see they're sparklers they were

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.660 
you can see they're sparklers they were
not<00:03:34.290> like<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.709> in<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.890> beta<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.340> if<00:03:35.549> you

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
not like that in the beta and if you

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.310 
not like that in the beta and if you
actually<00:03:35.850> throw<00:03:36.239> these<00:03:36.360> on<00:03:36.510> people<00:03:36.900> they<00:03:37.140> will

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
actually throw these on people they will

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.229 
actually throw these on people they will
burn<00:03:37.500> alive<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:38.250> as<00:03:38.370> far<00:03:38.519> as<00:03:38.579> walking<00:03:38.910> over

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
burn alive and as far as walking over

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.699 
burn alive and as far as walking over
the<00:03:39.329> flames<00:03:39.570> it<00:03:39.780> doesn't<00:03:40.079> do<00:03:40.170> all<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.560> much

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
the flames it doesn't do all that much

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.650 
the flames it doesn't do all that much
damage<00:03:40.950> but<00:03:41.760> if<00:03:41.850> somebody's<00:03:42.120> camping<00:03:42.480> on<00:03:42.570> the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
damage but if somebody's camping on the

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.910 
damage but if somebody's camping on the
other<00:03:42.780> side<00:03:43.019> of<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.170> wall<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.590> throw<00:03:43.829> them

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
other side of a wall and you throw them

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.640 
other side of a wall and you throw them
there<00:03:44.160> they<00:03:45.090> will<00:03:45.299> be<00:03:45.510> laying<00:03:45.810> in<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.380> flame

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
there they will be laying in the flame

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.949 
there they will be laying in the flame
so<00:03:46.980> slowly<00:03:47.430> it<00:03:47.730> will<00:03:47.760> hurt<00:03:48.360> them<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:48.750> then<00:03:48.870> you

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
so slowly it will hurt them and then you

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.750 
so slowly it will hurt them and then you
can<00:03:49.110> just<00:03:49.290> sort<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.739> shoot<00:03:49.980> them<00:03:50.190> out<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.489> cover

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
can just sort of shoot them out of cover

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.000 
can just sort of shoot them out of cover
so<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.329> definitely<00:03:51.840> works<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.500> adds<00:03:52.650> the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
so it definitely works it adds the

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.460 
so it definitely works it adds the
tactic<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.670> gears<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.209> war<00:03:54.390> now<00:03:55.079> right<00:03:55.320> now<00:03:55.440> I'm
