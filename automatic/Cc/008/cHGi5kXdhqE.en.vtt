00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
browns so that the brown switches I was

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.660 
browns so that the brown switches I was
thinking<00:02:25.500> about<00:02:25.590> getting<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.980> blues<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.580> the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
thinking about getting the blues and the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.010 
thinking about getting the blues and the
fact<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.030> was<00:02:27.240> originally<00:02:27.690> getting<00:02:27.930> the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
fact that I was originally getting the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.070 
fact that I was originally getting the
blues<00:02:28.550> but<00:02:29.550> then<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:30.090> couldn't<00:02:30.630> get<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.900> blues

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
blues but then I couldn't get the blues

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.120 
blues but then I couldn't get the blues
because<00:02:31.410> they<00:02:31.530> were<00:02:31.590> out<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:31.830> stock

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
because they were out of stock

00:02:32.130 --> 00:03:16.610 
because they were out of stock
everywhere<00:02:32.819> that<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:32.970> try<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.180> order<00:02:33.360> them<00:03:15.620> so

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
everywhere that I try to order them so

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.560 
everywhere that I try to order them so
there's<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:16.860> little<00:03:17.160> little<00:03:17.280> typing<00:03:17.970> test<00:03:18.269> I

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
there's a little little typing test I

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.240 
there's a little little typing test I
tend<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.140> make<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.350> lot<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.560> mistakes<00:03:19.860> cuz<00:03:20.160> I'm

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
tend to make a lot of mistakes cuz I'm

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.250 
tend to make a lot of mistakes cuz I'm
not<00:03:20.370> use<00:03:20.549> this<00:03:20.910> kind<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.239> keyword<00:03:21.510> at<00:03:21.630> all<00:03:21.780> the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
not use this kind of keyword at all the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.170 
not use this kind of keyword at all the
action<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.739> just<00:03:22.920> takes<00:03:23.130> some<00:03:23.310> pressing<00:03:23.970> down

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
action it just takes some pressing down

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.380 
action it just takes some pressing down
um<00:03:25.110> but<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.650> o<00:03:25.829> it<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.370> satisfying<00:03:27.030> it's

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
um but it o it is so satisfying it's

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.670 
um but it o it is so satisfying it's
hard<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.690> explain<00:03:28.019> without<00:03:28.170> trying<00:03:28.590> it

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
hard to explain without trying it

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.430 
hard to explain without trying it
yourself<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:29.220> hopefully<00:03:29.519> this<00:03:29.640> wasn't

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
yourself so hopefully this wasn't

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.289 
yourself so hopefully this wasn't
vibrating<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.769> microphone<00:03:32.670> too<00:03:32.790> much<00:03:32.970> cuz

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
vibrating that a microphone too much cuz

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.400 
vibrating that a microphone too much cuz
unfortunately<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.810> have<00:03:33.900> to

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410

is pretty standard and the sizing is
pretty<00:03:45.090> standard<00:03:45.450> on<00:03:45.630> keyboards<00:03:46.080> but<00:03:46.310> that

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
pretty standard on keyboards but that

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.640 
pretty standard on keyboards but that
action<00:03:47.730> is<00:03:47.910> not<00:03:48.210> standard<00:03:49.110> it's<00:03:49.230> just<00:03:49.440> awesome
