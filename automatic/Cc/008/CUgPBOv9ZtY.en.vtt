00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.960
 both 2015 we are like leni of lenovo e 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.540
 this is yoga 3 11 the third generation 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.160
 of tablet convertible at home 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.900
 Chinese 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.880
 here we see the 11-inch model but 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.860
 in the background there is also the 14 model 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.960
 thumbs however since they have of 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.820
 greater differences than the one alone 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.580
 screen diagonal we will cover them 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.350
 display in this case separately 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.710
 a diagonal of 11 if inches a 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.619
 hd resolution and an ips and multi screen 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.289
 touch 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.239
 the fact of having a screen of 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.129
 small size allows yoga 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.280
 3ds not very compact and easy device 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.250
 to carry the thickness of only 15 mm 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.989
 eight shots of a hundred file 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.610
 and this also thanks to the fact that the 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.339
 frame is made of magnesium alloy 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.250
 therefore a particularly metal 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.839
 robust but at the same time light 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.479
 another novelty is the white population 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.339
 because however a detail is required 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:02.229
 production process called a thousand 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.259
 the colors remain then instead 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:09.820
 traditional in black anodized metal 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:13.020
 kiss the true that goes orange 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.020
 in the port of caregivers 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.900
 it could also be from the foreigner 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.780
 below the screen there is a sharp keyboard 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.119
 which allows a good precision and a 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.310
 good comfort of use and then in the center 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.659
 of the palm rest that presents even if one 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.380
 white breakfast however with a finish 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.860
 brushed there is also the touchpad 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.850
 the white color in terms of 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.850
 interfaces 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.180
 we start from the right side we have one 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.450
 acer and volume usb port 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.979
 button for rotation lock 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.259
 the ignition button on the side 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.659
 front there is nothing on the side 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.040
 left we have a peak in the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.960
 heart of power that however with 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.790
 white in the derby so it can be 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.800
 used to connect any 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.110
 peripherals if they have not been used 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.580
 recharging another of a displayport 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.580
 a sd card reader 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.880
 there is no system grid 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.350
 ventilation only below we see 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.310
 that there are grids of 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.040
 speakers and this because yoga 3 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.890
 11 is totally false therefore to lack of 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.989
 fan that being based on a 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.280
 intel core processor is therefore a 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.190
 very high efficiency processor 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.660
 energy accompanied here by 4 gb of 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.700
 roma ram are also available 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.709
 8 gigabyte versions and storage gift 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.319
 up to 256 GB 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.910
 an integrated battery emphasizes this 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.380
 It allows 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.380
 up to a maximum of six and a half hours 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.120
 and then when we talk about yoga not 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.700
 we can do without talking about the 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.860
 zipper that allows you to position it 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.600
 screen in four different ways of 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.490
 other very notes about sing of 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.020
 the stand by mode also awaits you 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.380
 knocking it down completely 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.380
 Tablet 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.570
 really 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.570
 but let's talk about a hinge that is 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.540
 has been improved and allows 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.610
 now to position and to strill.it is 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.160
 perfectly flat while precedence 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.160
 he was a little relieved about the base 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.900
 for 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.310
 our 3 11 yoga preview from 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.310
 sias 2015 is everything
