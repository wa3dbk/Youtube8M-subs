00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.020 
welcome to Maastricht University are you
ready

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.589

not how we do it small tutorial groups
that's<00:00:21.689> better

anything<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.140> often<00:01:19.290> make<00:01:19.650> good<00:01:19.890> progress

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
anything but we often make good progress

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.640 
anything but we often make good progress
by<00:01:20.549> ourselves<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.810> tutor<00:01:22.140> stays<00:01:22.439> in

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650

cooperate with one another we start by

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.420 
cooperate with one another we start by
examining<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.140> case<00:01:52.070> through<00:01:53.070> active

examining the case through active

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.670 
examining the case through active
brainstorming<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.659> try<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.960> get<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> picture<00:01:55.530> of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
brainstorming we try to get a picture of

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.999 
brainstorming we try to get a picture of
the<00:01:55.920> puzzle<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:56.880> individual<00:01:57.450> pieces

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
the puzzle and it's individual pieces

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.590 
the puzzle and it's individual pieces
we're<00:01:59.009> often<00:01:59.189> amazed<00:01:59.729> at<00:01:59.969> how<00:02:00.149> much<00:02:00.390> we

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
we're often amazed at how much we

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.460 
we're often amazed at how much we
already<00:02:00.750> know

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.200 

the<00:02:04.470> next<00:02:04.770> step<00:02:04.980> is<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.280> cluster<00:02:05.730> the<00:02:05.820> pieces

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
the next step is to cluster the pieces

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.109 
the next step is to cluster the pieces
of<00:02:06.300> information<00:02:07.280> theories<00:02:08.280> are<00:02:08.520> separated

from experience causes from consequences
in<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:13.290> way<00:02:13.530> we<00:02:13.890> get<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.100> good<00:02:14.340> idea<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
in this way we get a good idea of the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.080 
in this way we get a good idea of the
structure<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.810> problem

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090

finally<00:02:18.090> for<00:02:18.480> each<00:02:18.630> category<00:02:18.930> we<00:02:19.770> search<00:02:20.040> for

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
finally for each category we search for

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.370 
finally for each category we search for
the<00:02:20.459> missing<00:02:20.700> pieces<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.390> puzzle<00:02:21.810> based
