00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
side of the the call a rather than a

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.959 
side of the the call a rather than a
song<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.389> label<00:03:09.250> we<00:03:10.250> have<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.459> label<00:03:10.699> which

actually<00:03:11.359> placed<00:03:12.349> on<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.949> material<00:03:13.459> itself

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
actually placed on the material itself

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.209 
actually placed on the material itself
it's<00:03:14.329> sort<00:03:14.569> of<00:03:14.689> like<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:15.139> when<00:03:15.980> you<00:03:16.040> buy<00:03:16.189> a

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:16.219 
it's sort of like the when you buy a

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.569 
it's sort of like the when you buy a
t-shirt<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:17.090> they<00:03:17.780> have<00:03:18.099> the<00:03:19.099> lettering<00:03:19.430> on<00:03:19.549> a

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
t-shirt and they have the lettering on a

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.819 
t-shirt and they have the lettering on a
t-shirt<00:03:19.849> the<00:03:20.720> advertisements<00:03:21.530> or<00:03:21.560> whatever

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
t-shirt the advertisements or whatever

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.369 
t-shirt the advertisements or whatever
painted<00:03:22.340> on<00:03:22.489> that's<00:03:23.359> what<00:03:23.599> this<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:24.019> and<00:03:24.259> so

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
painted on that's what this is and so

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.319 
painted on that's what this is and so
the<00:03:24.620> advantage<00:03:25.220> of<00:03:25.609> course<00:03:25.819> is<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.060> you're

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
the advantage of course is that you're

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.409 
the advantage of course is that you're
not<00:03:26.479> going<00:03:26.659> to<00:03:26.720> have<00:03:27.340> labeled<00:03:28.340> with<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.729> thread

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
not going to have labeled with a thread

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.599 
not going to have labeled with a thread
going<00:03:29.780> through<00:03:30.019> on<00:03:30.199> either<00:03:30.349> side<00:03:30.709> so<00:03:31.040> we<00:03:31.459> would

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
going through on either side so we would

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.520 
going through on either side so we would
end<00:03:31.790> up<00:03:31.849> showing<00:03:32.090> in<00:03:32.359> the<00:03:32.449> back<00:03:32.629> I<00:03:32.870> like<00:03:33.319> the

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
end up showing in the back I like the

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.140 
end up showing in the back I like the
fact<00:03:33.709> that<00:03:33.889> people<00:03:34.220> are<00:03:34.310> now<00:03:34.459> in<00:03:34.669> printing

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
fact that people are now in printing

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.080 
fact that people are now in printing
labels<00:03:35.540> on<00:03:36.349> the<00:03:36.620> material<00:03:37.159> itself<00:03:37.280> rather

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
labels on the material itself rather

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.339 
labels on the material itself rather
than<00:03:38.439> attaching<00:03:39.439> something<00:03:39.829> else<00:03:41.169> okay<00:03:42.169> I've

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
than attaching something else okay I've

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.080 
than attaching something else okay I've
just<00:03:42.590> turned<00:03:42.799> the<00:03:42.979> shirt<00:03:43.220> inside<00:03:43.609> out<00:03:43.669> so<00:03:44.000> you

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
just turned the shirt inside out so you

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.509 
just turned the shirt inside out so you
get<00:03:44.269> to<00:03:44.479> have<00:03:45.199> a<00:03:45.259> pretty<00:03:45.949> good<00:03:46.009> look<00:03:46.250> at<00:03:46.370> the

get to have a pretty good look at the

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.550 
get to have a pretty good look at the
pocket<00:03:46.819> and<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.269> way<00:03:47.389> how<00:03:47.540> it's<00:03:47.750> designed<00:03:48.019> as

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
pocket and the way how it's designed as
