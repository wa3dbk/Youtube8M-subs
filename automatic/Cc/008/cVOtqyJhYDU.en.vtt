you might need I got inside for you

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:50.980 
you might need I got inside for you
backpack<00:01:36.899> backpack<00:01:47.240> should<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.360> use<00:01:49.429> meteo

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
backpack backpack should we use meteo

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:02.470 
backpack backpack should we use meteo
hammer<00:01:52.100> or<00:01:53.420> mapa<00:01:54.440> map<00:01:56.569> meteo<00:01:58.940> mapa

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.660 

that's<00:02:03.080> right<00:02:03.520> mappa<00:02:06.040> let's<00:02:07.040> see<00:02:07.310> where<00:02:07.550> we

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
that's right mappa let's see where we

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.170 
that's right mappa let's see where we
have<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:08.000> go<00:02:08.180> today<00:02:09.190> here's<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.430> map<00:02:10.730> of<00:02:11.000> the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
have to go today here's the map of the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.400 
have to go today here's the map of the
park<00:02:12.250> well<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.520> has<00:02:13.790> 10,000<00:02:14.600> feet<00:02:15.140> squared<00:02:16.150> so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
park well it has 10,000 feet squared so

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.860 
park well it has 10,000 feet squared so
which<00:02:18.410> do<00:02:18.860> we<00:02:19.010> walk<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.660> perimeter

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
which do we walk so that the perimeter

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.020 
which do we walk so that the perimeter
is<00:02:21.110> less<00:02:22.000> this<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.150> an<00:02:23.270> optimization<00:02:24.230> problem

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
is less this is an optimization problem

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.220 
is less this is an optimization problem
look<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.720> primary<00:02:27.140> equals<00:02:27.530> 2x<00:02:28.220> plus<00:02:28.790> 2y<00:02:29.230> and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
look the primary equals 2x plus 2y and

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.500 
look the primary equals 2x plus 2y and
if<00:02:31.100> we<00:02:31.430> can<00:02:31.790> solve<00:02:32.090> for<00:02:32.390> y<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.170> we<00:02:33.560> plug<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:33.980> in

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
if we can solve for y and we plug it in

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.750 
if we can solve for y and we plug it in
take<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.660> derivative<00:02:36.520> do<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:37.610> like

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
take the derivative do you like

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.670 
take the derivative do you like
derivatives<00:02:39.580> cool<00:02:40.580> well<00:02:41.570> take<00:02:42.560> the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
derivatives cool well take the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.540 
derivatives cool well take the
derivative<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.580> then<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:45.440> solve<00:02:45.770> to<00:02:46.340> see

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
derivative and then you solve to see

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.440 
derivative and then you solve to see
which<00:02:47.120> would<00:02:47.300> be<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.510> minimum<00:02:47.870> perimeter<00:02:49.450> so

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
which would be the minimum perimeter so

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.980 
which would be the minimum perimeter so
with<00:02:51.050> calculus<00:02:51.590> we<00:02:52.220> see<00:02:52.460> that<00:02:52.670> this<00:02:53.570> distance

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
with calculus we see that this distance

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.280 
with calculus we see that this distance
is<00:02:54.530> 70<00:02:55.460> feet<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.660> this<00:02:57.170> is<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:57.350> 140<00:02:58.280> feet<00:02:59.290> let's

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
is 70 feet and this is a 140 feet let's

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.580 
is 70 feet and this is a 140 feet let's
go

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.120

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
get to it I know that we can do it where

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.070 
get to it I know that we can do it where

70 feet 140 feet then halfway that's
another<00:05:02.860> 35<00:05:03.580> feet<00:05:05.490> we<00:05:06.490> better<00:05:06.729> go

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:36.140 

oh<00:05:32.180> he's<00:05:33.180> ten<00:05:33.480> feet<00:05:33.750> up<00:05:33.930> in<00:05:34.200> the<00:05:34.230> branches<00:05:35.150> if

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
oh he's ten feet up in the branches if

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.190 
oh he's ten feet up in the branches if
you<00:05:36.870> throws<00:05:37.290> at<00:05:37.650> an<00:05:37.770> initial<00:05:38.040> speed<00:05:38.640> of<00:05:39.200> 80

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
you throws at an initial speed of 80

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.230 
you throws at an initial speed of 80
feet<00:05:40.620> per<00:05:40.860> second<00:05:42.440> then<00:05:43.820> while<00:05:44.820> we<00:05:44.940> can<00:05:45.090> use

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
feet per second then while we can use

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.530 
feet per second then while we can use
calculus<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:46.290> position<00:05:46.800> equation<00:05:47.310> is

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
calculus the position equation is

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.570 
calculus the position equation is
one-half<00:05:48.540> GT<00:05:49.230> squared<00:05:49.410> plus<00:05:50.400> b<00:05:50.670> 0<00:05:50.700> T<00:05:51.060> plus<00:05:51.540> s<00:05:51.780> 0

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
one-half GT squared plus b 0 T plus s 0

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.060 
one-half GT squared plus b 0 T plus s 0
so<00:05:53.580> that<00:05:54.440> would<00:05:55.440> be<00:05:55.470> negative<00:05:56.180> 16t<00:05:57.180> squared

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
so that would be negative 16t squared

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.290 
so that would be negative 16t squared
plus<00:05:59.070> let's<00:06:00.000> see<00:06:00.210> what<00:06:00.810> is<00:06:00.930> the<00:06:01.140> velocity

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
plus let's see what is the velocity

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.640 
plus let's see what is the velocity
that's<00:06:03.300> right<00:06:03.690> 80<00:06:04.500> feet<00:06:04.860> per<00:06:05.220> second<00:06:05.930> plus<00:06:06.930> 10

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
that's right 80 feet per second plus 10

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.700 
that's right 80 feet per second plus 10
