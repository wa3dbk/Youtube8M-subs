farm here in Idaho we have to wait for
the<00:00:40.520> do<00:00:40.700> and<00:00:41.000> the<00:00:41.660> doom<00:00:41.810> comes<00:00:42.050> on<00:00:42.640> very<00:00:43.640> rarely

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
the do and the doom comes on very rarely

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.479 
the do and the doom comes on very rarely
and<00:00:44.960> if<00:00:45.020> it<00:00:45.140> does<00:00:45.290> it's<00:00:45.590> for<00:00:45.950> a<00:00:45.980> few<00:00:46.190> hours<00:00:46.220> a

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
and if it does it's for a few hours a

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.510 
and if it does it's for a few hours a
day<00:00:46.720> and<00:00:47.720> that's<00:00:47.840> early<00:00:48.320> morning<00:00:48.680> and<00:00:48.830> so<00:00:49.040> the
