by<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.920> hurricane<00:00:56.299> as<00:00:57.299> we<00:00:57.449> were<00:00:57.540> saying

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
by the hurricane as we were saying

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.649 
by the hurricane as we were saying
earlier<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:59.070> weight<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.640> a<00:01:00.239> tailwheel

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
earlier the weight of a tailwheel

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.959 
earlier the weight of a tailwheel
aircraft<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.409> behind<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.219> main<00:01:02.399> world<00:01:02.699> so

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
aircraft is behind the main world so

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.240 
aircraft is behind the main world so
you're<00:01:03.149> working<00:01:03.299> quite<00:01:03.780> hard<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.350> keep<00:01:05.039> these

narrable<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.320> finish<00:01:07.619> working<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.720> reckon<00:01:09.720> if

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
narrable to finish working I reckon if

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.169 
narrable to finish working I reckon if
you<00:01:09.929> look<00:01:10.080> at<00:01:10.289> got<00:01:10.649> a<00:01:10.679> wider<00:01:11.250> track<00:01:11.610> it's

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:12.179 
you look at got a wider track it's

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:15.230 
you look at got a wider track it's
easier<00:01:12.569> for<00:01:12.600> them<00:01:12.979> pilots<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.520> keep<00:01:15.090> it

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
easier for them pilots to keep it

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.690 
easier for them pilots to keep it
straight<00:01:15.569> but<00:01:15.720> even<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.319> to<00:01:17.220> kill<00:01:17.429> me<00:01:17.520> when

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
straight but even so to kill me when
