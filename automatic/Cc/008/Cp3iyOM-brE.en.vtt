00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
that's momentum momentum is a subject is

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.910 
that's momentum momentum is a subject is
a<00:00:12.269> technique<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:12.929> I've<00:00:13.230> been<00:00:13.349> using<00:00:13.559> for

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
a technique that I've been using for

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.340 
a technique that I've been using for
over<00:00:13.950> 35<00:00:14.549> years<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.900> one<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
over 35 years and is one of the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.349 
over 35 years and is one of the
cornerstones<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:17.369> my<00:00:17.520> whole<00:00:17.760> investment

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
cornerstones of my whole investment

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.109 
cornerstones of my whole investment
approach<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.680> what<00:00:19.890> momentum<00:00:20.430> simply<00:00:20.850> says

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
approach and what momentum simply says

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.590 
approach and what momentum simply says
is<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.480> trends<00:00:22.289> persist<00:00:23.090> let's<00:00:24.090> take<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> look

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
is that trends persist let's take a look

days but this article was fantastic

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.010 
days but this article was fantastic
because<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.540> looked<00:00:42.840> at<00:00:43.050> momentum<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:45.020> looked

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020

because it looked at momentum and looked
at<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> track<00:00:46.590> record<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:47.100> using<00:00:47.520> momentum

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
at the track record of using momentum

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.720 
at the track record of using momentum
let's<00:00:48.930> take<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> look<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.340> studies

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
let's take a look at one of the studies

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.029 
let's take a look at one of the studies
that<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:51.000> present<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.530> case<00:00:52.770> it's

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
that they present and in this case it's

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.750 
that they present and in this case it's
the<00:00:53.219> stock<00:00:53.520> market<00:00:54.649> this<00:00:55.649> study<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.460> done<00:00:56.579> by

article and this takes British shares in
this<00:03:21.989> particular<00:03:22.290> case<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.949> it<00:03:23.819> assumes<00:03:24.209> that

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
this particular case and it assumes that

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.610 
this particular case and it assumes that
we<00:03:24.510> started<00:03:24.900> with<00:03:25.049> one<00:03:25.349> pound<00:03:26.209> back<00:03:27.209> in<00:03:27.620> 1900

we started with one pound back in 1900

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.900 
we started with one pound back in 1900
so<00:03:28.859> we're<00:03:29.010> looking<00:03:29.400> at<00:03:29.519> we're<00:03:29.730> going<00:03:29.849> to

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.740 
so we're looking at we're going to
invest<00:03:30.269> one<00:03:30.690> pound<00:03:31.079> in<00:03:31.410> 1900<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.549> if<00:03:33.299> we<00:03:33.569> had

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
invest one pound in 1900 and if we had

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.710 
invest one pound in 1900 and if we had

rebalanced annually we'd have 49 pounds

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.800 
rebalanced annually we'd have 49 pounds
a<00:03:46.079> hundred<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.680> ten<00:03:46.859> years<00:03:46.889> later<00:03:47.449> now<00:03:48.449> after

a hundred and ten years later now after

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.680 
a hundred and ten years later now after
inflation<00:03:50.060> devaluation<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.180> taxes<00:03:51.660> that

inflation devaluation and taxes that

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.990 
inflation devaluation and taxes that
means<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.079> were<00:03:52.169> wiped<00:03:52.410> out<00:03:52.680> even<00:03:52.949> your<00:03:53.819> 1

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
means you were wiped out even your 1

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.430 
means you were wiped out even your 1
pound<00:03:54.299> is<00:03:54.480> probably<00:03:54.720> not<00:03:54.810> even<00:03:54.959> worth<00:03:55.199> one

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
pound is probably not even worth one

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.009 
pound is probably not even worth one
pound<00:03:55.739> if<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:57.030> bought<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.480> middle<00:03:57.870> if<00:03:57.989> you

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
pound if you bought the middle if you

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.170 
pound if you bought the middle if you
basically<00:03:58.349> bought<00:03:58.859> the<00:03:59.129> stock<00:03:59.400> market<00:03:59.970> you

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
basically bought the stock market you

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.960 
basically bought the stock market you
would<00:04:00.659> have<00:04:00.810> had<00:04:00.930> about<00:04:01.400> 20,000<00:04:02.400> pounds<00:04:02.609> after

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
would have had about 20,000 pounds after

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.640 
would have had about 20,000 pounds after
a<00:04:03.150> hundred<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.629> ten<00:04:03.810> years<00:04:03.870> starting<00:04:04.560> with

a hundred and ten years starting with
one<00:04:04.859> dollar<00:04:05.159> so<00:04:05.790> that's<00:04:05.970> pretty<00:04:06.239> impressive

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
one dollar so that's pretty impressive

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.339 
one dollar so that's pretty impressive
but<00:04:07.680> if<00:04:07.889> you<00:04:08.099> had<00:04:08.310> bought<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:09.329> top<00:04:09.690> 20

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
but if you had bought the top 20

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.069 
but if you had bought the top 20
percentile<00:04:11.010> at<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.459> end<00:04:11.639> of<00:04:11.849> one<00:04:12.060> year<00:04:12.090> held

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
percentile at the end of one year held

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.289 
percentile at the end of one year held
it<00:04:13.290> for<00:04:13.470> another<00:04:13.709> year<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.159> rebalanced<00:04:14.849> you

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
it for another year and rebalanced you

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.870 
it for another year and rebalanced you
would<00:04:15.449> have<00:04:15.569> had<00:04:15.690> two<00:04:15.989> point<00:04:16.380> three<00:04:16.880> million

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
would have had two point three million

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.949 
would have had two point three million
pounds<00:04:18.739> look<00:04:19.739> at<00:04:19.799> this<00:04:20.180> 49<00:04:21.180> pounds<00:04:21.510> for<00:04:21.870> the

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
pounds look at this 49 pounds for the

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.219 
pounds look at this 49 pounds for the
bottom<00:04:22.289> 20<00:04:22.590> percent<00:04:23.599> 20,000<00:04:24.599> pounds<00:04:24.990> for<00:04:25.139> the

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
bottom 20 percent 20,000 pounds for the

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.890 
bottom 20 percent 20,000 pounds for the
middle<00:04:25.530> but<00:04:26.180> 2.3<00:04:27.180> million

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
middle but 2.3 million

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.340 
middle but 2.3 million
for<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.620> top-20<00:04:29.540> momentum<00:04:30.540> stocks<00:04:30.960> and

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
for the top-20 momentum stocks and

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.670 
for the top-20 momentum stocks and
remember<00:04:31.800> we<00:04:31.949> did<00:04:32.160> no<00:04:32.720> fundamental<00:04:33.720> analysis

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
remember we did no fundamental analysis

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.610 
remember we did no fundamental analysis
and<00:04:34.919> we<00:04:35.010> use<00:04:35.220> no<00:04:35.639> risk<00:04:36.150> management<00:04:36.780> at<00:04:36.840> all<00:04:36.990> so

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
and we use no risk management at all so

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.830 
and we use no risk management at all so
I<00:04:37.650> believe<00:04:38.190> using<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:39.090> techniques<00:04:39.540> that<00:04:39.750> I

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
I believe using the techniques that I

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.469 
I believe using the techniques that I
teach<00:04:40.139> we<00:04:40.380> can<00:04:40.530> actually<00:04:40.740> improve<00:04:41.430> on<00:04:42.150> the

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
teach we can actually improve on the

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.390 
teach we can actually improve on the
performance<00:04:42.630> of<00:04:43.169> what<00:04:43.770> I'm<00:04:43.889> showing<00:04:44.130> you<00:04:44.280> here

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
performance of what I'm showing you here

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.790 
performance of what I'm showing you here
I'm<00:04:45.180> going<00:04:45.330> to<00:04:45.419> do<00:04:45.660> a<00:04:45.690> few<00:04:45.990> more<00:04:46.110> videos<00:04:46.350> on

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
I'm going to do a few more videos on

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.860 
I'm going to do a few more videos on
momentum<00:04:47.400> but<00:04:48.030> I<00:04:48.060> wanted<00:04:48.389> to<00:04:48.479> give<00:04:48.630> you<00:04:48.720> these

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
momentum but I wanted to give you these

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.810 
momentum but I wanted to give you these
great<00:04:49.139> statistics<00:04:49.919> to<00:04:50.040> show<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:50.400> that<00:04:50.699> the

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
great statistics to show you that the

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.210 
great statistics to show you that the
underlying<00:04:51.360> concept<00:04:52.050> is<00:04:52.199> very<00:04:52.500> powerful<00:04:52.919> and

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
underlying concept is very powerful and

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.030 
underlying concept is very powerful and
you<00:04:53.280> really<00:04:54.090> must<00:04:54.510> be<00:04:54.600> including<00:04:55.139> it<00:04:55.229> in<00:04:55.440> your

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
you really must be including it in your

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.250 
you really must be including it in your
investment<00:04:56.610> techniques<00:04:57.150> thanks<00:04:57.960> very<00:04:58.110> much

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
investment techniques thanks very much

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.250 
investment techniques thanks very much
talk<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.590> you<00:04:58.680> in<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:58.800> next<00:04:58.919> video
