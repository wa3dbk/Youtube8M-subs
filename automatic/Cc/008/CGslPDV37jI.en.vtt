00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.000
 good 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.130
 since its appearance in the year 86 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.590
 dragonball z has had countless 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.779
 movies in his arsenal given room to 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.970
 good comments but at the same time strong 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.820
 criticisms since 80% of these 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.500
 movies are alternative realities and 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.560
 they have no link to the series 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.630
 original is why I have encouraged 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.790
 make this top of the 5 best 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.910
 dragon ball z movies we started 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.130
 number 5 the two warriors of the future 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.440
 enjoy and trump known also as 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.560
 Resistance to despair is 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.930
 premiered in the year of 1993 in this 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.000
 movie is released one of the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.680
 different alternate futures where 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.290
 tells the story of trump of the future 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.390
 in this timeline goku and his 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.730
 teleportation to intercept 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.890
 frizer and defeat him with his father 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.860
 but unexpectedly later 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.870
 dies from heart disease 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.640
 this movie has a place in this top 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.740
 for being the few that fit 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.290
 perfectly on the timeline 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.479
 the series also the most important thing of 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.270
 the movies are the villains and in this 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.270
 case we have two the number 17 and number 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.910
 18 invincible beings in this line of 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.610
 time and that in a few words can 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.680
 fight a thousand years without taking a break 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.960
 also many of us agree that the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.200
 command the future is much better than 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 current number 4 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.420
 bardot the father of goku released in the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.150
 year of 1990 this movie is very 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.570
 interesting because they tell you the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.820
 how 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.920
 because freezer decides to betray his 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.930
 faithful servants since frizer feared 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.300
 that the legend of his character gin be 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.430
 real since it is known that the more quarrelsome 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.710
 Sayayin stronger also becomes 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.080
 we can observe even a little what 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.690
 that was the childhood of the prince of the race 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.400
 warrior of links and has vegueta 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.710
 also the argument of the premonitions 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.780
 in the head of beards makes it more 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.729
 attractive since this film 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.560
 we can observe short of the series in 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.440
 yes and a preview to what would be the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.570
 confrontation between goku and freezer in 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.670
 if this movie allows us to know a 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.890
 little more than the family class where 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.200
 comes goku and likewise this 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.660
 movie also fits perfectly in 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.300
 the series and is taken by many as 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.280
 official one important fact is that akira 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.290
 Toriyama liked the character so much 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.970
 beard who included it in the series and is 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.930
 for this and more than this movie has 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.550
 a place in this top number 3 the battle 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.320
 of the gods for many will be a 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.300
 surprise that this movie has a 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.489
 podium so high despite being very 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.130
 criticized by fans when cataloging it 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.340
 as ridiculous boring and unnecessary 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.620
 but here's my reason 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.470
 the battle of the gods I liked a lot 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.629
 more than those of posts 5 and 4 due to 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.730
 that was my reunion with a stage 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.920
 beautiful of my life since as many of 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.840
 you I grew up watching this series and 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.030
 see it again on big screen and with 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.069
 the same voices that I heard more ago 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.680
 of a decade they made it very special 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.900
 but very apart from this I loved it 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.910
 the character of beats a new god 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.209
 currently the most powerful in the universe 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.040
 7 and therefore stronger than goku but a 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.110
 Although being the god of death is not 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.540
 of the whole bad rather it's a character 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.390
 of chapter their confrontation against 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.310
 Goku left me satisfied since I already 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.799
 I imagined that this would be a new 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.170
 I start and I swear that he gave me an orgasm 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.599
 when I saw them there were 12 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.790
 gods of destruction and that could 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.920
 be much stronger than him for being so 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.349
 special and for being a new beginning of 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.239
 all dragon ball z is that this movie 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.310
 it takes the third place in this top 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.130
 number 2 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.840
 the freezer resurrection that can be 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.760
 say about this movie that has not been 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.770
 I already said in the description 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.170
 link my opinion about her and the 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.030
 why he is in position number 2 clear 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.890
 is after finishing seeing this 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.720
 video number 1 the invincible power 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.220
 released in the year of 1993 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.140
 this movie meets all the 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.120
 requirements that fans want to see in 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.980
 Dragonball film since 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.599
 the villain on duty was nothing more and nothing 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.299
 less than the legendary super I'm Jim 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.739
 according to the universe of all animation the 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.900
 plot this movie is nothing of the other 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.150
 world but it is the character of broli 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.700
 who steals the whole movie because 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.310
 who better than a sayayin to defeat 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.530
 to others there is much more jim if this one 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.690
 has unlimited powers something that the 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.400
 most we like to see is how course 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.680
 exceeds your limits to defeat your 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.290
 enemy but he turns out that neither goku nor 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.090
 no one can defeat Brolin in 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.250
 few words is a legend 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.470
 even the king vegueta ordered his 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.169
 annihilation because of the fear I had for 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.240
 brolin being just a baby but like 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.250
 Boku always wins April and they gave him a 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.210
 achilles heel since the only way 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.460
 to defeat him 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.169
 give him a hit in his abdomen and 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.449
 that we all know that he was stabbed 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.220
 he was barely born although it was a 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.470
 pity that they changed the voice to goku 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.300
 for an economic disagreement does not stop 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.250
 be the best movie I've seen of 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.960
 dragonball z and that's why this 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.530
 movie takes first place 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.849
 remember that this is just my opinion 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.620
 you are free to put in the comments 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.870
