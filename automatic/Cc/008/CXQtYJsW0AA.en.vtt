00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
steering system which is largely made

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.980 
steering system which is largely made
out<00:05:06.639> of<00:05:06.729> plastic<00:05:07.180> so<00:05:07.300> it's<00:05:07.450> a<00:05:07.479> lot<00:05:07.600> stronger

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
out of plastic so it's a lot stronger

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.200 
out of plastic so it's a lot stronger
and<00:05:08.470> it<00:05:08.950> has<00:05:09.070> a<00:05:09.100> lot<00:05:09.280> tighter<00:05:09.520> tolerances<00:05:10.150> so

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
and it has a lot tighter tolerances so

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.310 
and it has a lot tighter tolerances so
you<00:05:10.360> don't<00:05:10.479> get<00:05:10.570> as<00:05:10.690> much<00:05:10.810> movement<00:05:11.200> in<00:05:11.260> your

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
you don't get as much movement in your

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.990 
you don't get as much movement in your
bars<00:05:11.620> it<00:05:12.250> allows<00:05:12.520> for<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:12.729> use<00:05:12.880> of

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
bars it allows for the use of

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.430 
bars it allows for the use of
aftermarket<00:05:13.270> handle<00:05:13.810> bars<00:05:13.960> like<00:05:14.200> this

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
aftermarket handle bars like this

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.560 
aftermarket handle bars like this
conventional<00:05:15.010> cross<00:05:15.220> bar<00:05:15.520> type<00:05:15.790> or<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:16.479> can

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
conventional cross bar type or you can

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.570 
conventional cross bar type or you can
also<00:05:16.690> use<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:17.139> new<00:05:17.260> style<00:05:17.620> bulge<00:05:17.889> bars

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
also use the new style bulge bars

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.150 
also use the new style bulge bars
it<00:05:18.790> has<00:05:18.940> inserts<00:05:19.330> that<00:05:19.479> remove<00:05:20.040> from<00:05:21.040> the
