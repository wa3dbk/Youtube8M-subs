00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.130
 once upon a time when the coolest 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.530
 the phone was considered a camera tube in 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.410
 zero point 3 megapixels i charged my 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.290
 favorite nokia e66 20 times in three or four 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.210
 days have passed a dozen years of smartphones 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.960
 turned into a full pocket 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.449
 computers 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.210
 but for some reason they began to work less than a day 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.779
 played half an hour in your favorite game listened 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.909
 music 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.249
 answered a couple of calls and in the afternoon already 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:30.859
 need to run to the outlet but with a new one 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:33.560
 lenovo smartphone for 70 with battery 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.990
 at 4000 milliamp-hours is hardly 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.710
 what's happening is essentially improved. 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.210
 in all respects the model lenovo p780 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.190
 which is more than a year enjoy 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.680
 just crazy popular in 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.070
 categories of android smartphones up to 200 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.960
 dollars thanks to the right combination 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.030
 performance and autonomy throwing 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.400
 A look at the smartphone immediately and you will not say 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.380
 what is the record for autonomy with 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.690
 high-capacity battery 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.790
 normal rectangular shape in 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.129
 measure thin with fairly wide frames 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.130
 around the display and the classic 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.790
 plastic cover without any 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.310
 designer delights 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.040
 one word workhorse for everyone 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.909
 day back removable cover 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.460
 dark purple can so 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.800
 time covered with scratches but not visible 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.500
 only at certain angles which are not 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.930
 tell me about the fingerprints here they are 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.240
 collects just to the Urals on top 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.030
 on the left are two holes for 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.130
 camera and flash on the side of the button 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.320
 power lock and adjust 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.780
 loudness last by the way are 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.030
 right under your thumb if you hold 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.729
 smartphone in the traditional way but 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.400
 the main button is unusual 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.780
 low under the cover 2 slots for micro sim 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.260
 one of which supports 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.979
 only 2g connection whereas the other 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.100
 2g 3g idazh lt immediately a little higher slot for 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.320
 micro sd memory cards up to 32 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.170
 gigabyte ambiguous limit with 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.490
 Considering the fact that the device has only 16 GB 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.500
 internal memory 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.049
 the entire front panel with screen is located 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.750
 on a kind of site that is higher 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.599
 the main body of the company logo 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.390
 on the display is almost invisible he is not 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.450
 striking and it is commendable from 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.670
 remarkable 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.800
 here the voice speaker is a mesh of 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.650
 indicator light to alert you 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.970
 different events a little to the left 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.860
 5 megapixel front camera under 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.920
 the screen has touch control buttons 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.910
 with a weak backlight 5 inch 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.069
 screen with a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels is not 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.680
 has an air gap so also 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.650
 has a good oleophobic coating 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.900
 display colors are very saturated are created 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.299
 even the impression that we have a matrix 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.670
 super amoled but without the traditional 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.220
 such screens kinks green 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.830
 viewing angles are almost maximum but 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.049
 not perfect when you tilt the smartphone out 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.720
 side to side you can see that 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.349
 white color on the screen becomes gray 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.780
 shade 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.599
 but this is not a problem but rather my personal 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.579
 niggle so the screen in lenovo is 70 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.829
 excellent in all parameters of descent 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.049
 virtual parrots in antutu 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.840
 smartphone performance indicator 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.870
 but when the middling model gives out almost 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.190
 forty four thousand points it's worthy 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.930
 inside the smartphone 64 bit processor 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.930
 mediatek 6753 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:31.019
 its eight cortex a-53 cores work with 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:33.200
 1.75 clock pray 760 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.730
 RAM 2 gigabytes 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.400
 the system works so fast 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.480
 as far as possible 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.930
 the manufacturer managed to find the gold 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.579
 midway between performance and 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.799
 optimizing for 70 is just nice 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.290
 enjoy it is worth you talking about work 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.739
 with the most demanding nfs bridge games 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.840
 new 3 modern combat 5 perfect 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.819
 at maximum settings unexpectedly 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.489
 smoothly with the correct drawing of all 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.069
 parts and a decent amount of fps 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.230
 there is nothing seriously to complain about 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.769
 I almost forgot from the wireless modules 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.900
 bluetooth 40 wifi and dps scene available 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.450
 everything did not work well, okay, from 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.310
 additional options there is a radio which 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.889
 traditionally operates only with 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.979
 connected headphones all this iron 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.630
 works on android 4 4 4 with shell 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.599
 which should be familiar to you by 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.460
 bright lenovo smartphone wipe bright 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.470
 moderately pretty and with one 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.480
 feature 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.340
 there is no menu with applications they are all 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.530
 located on desktops 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.170
 by the way in lenovo they confirmed that for 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.660
 70 is planned to upgrade to android 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.060
 5 this is important not only because of serious 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.330
 innovations in or dad the thing is that 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.310
 it is this system that can truly 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.070
 unlock the potential of the processor thanks to 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.650
 full 64-bit support 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.870
 architecture to simplify working with 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.240
 Smartphone settings provided 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.250
 special tab here you can customize 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.110
 lock the smartphone oppo shakes u 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.240
 activate the start menu button 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.460
 most used programs 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.310
 also enable speed mode 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.520
 without unlocking the device in lenovo 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.710
 70 installed two cameras main on 13 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.080
 and 5 megapixel front 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.300
 the main thing is not to expect any kind of cameras from these 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.640
 impressive results because 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.770
 ready shots look mediocre because 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.850
 low detail and problems with 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.400
 color rendering 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.980
 does not help either jorney mode somewhat 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.500
 interesting non-regulatory special effects 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.330
 Aisa 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.650
 like 3d shot mode yes but only 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.450
 as a toy 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.700
 practical application of this mode 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.919
 I could not come up with a video 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:43.750
 recorded in full hd resolution and 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.750
 not particularly impressive 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:48.830
 all of the above applies to 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:50.719
 front camera do not save even 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.479
 virtual rejuvenation mode with 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:54.979
 wrinkle removal by lightening the face and 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.889
 other liposuction me 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:00.349
 Now about the main thing yes before you the most 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:03.050
 real android long-liver from full 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.849
 charge non-removable battery 4000 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.800
 milliampere hours he can live 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.719
 two to three days with an average load 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.360
 the result is worthy against the background of the majority 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:11.839
 smartphones that by the evening need 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.539
 feed 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:16.309
 electricity besides lenovo 70 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.419
 supports accelerated charging mode 

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:19.339
 Victor 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.979
 which allows you to fully charge 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:23.960
 battery in just three hours is not at all 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.389
 ordinary smartphone usage model 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.569
 charging other devices included with 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.520
 lenovo 70 there is a 5g adapter which 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:34.249
 allows you to connect to our hero 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.309
 for example other smartphones with weak 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:38.930
 charge them with batteries 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:41.119
 tanker in the world of smartphones in 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.399
 As a result, lenovo seems to be able to find 

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:45.139
 that golden mean which 

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:48.020
 some manufacturers android 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.309
 smartphones are still looking for sane 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.589
 money you get 

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:53.749
 exceptional machine with excellent 

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:56.649
 characteristics and impressive 

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:56.649
 autonomy
