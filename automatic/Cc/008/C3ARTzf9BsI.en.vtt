00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.400
 Hello, I will explain to you in this video 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:08.670
 Isometric exercises for the area 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.670
 cervical 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.119
 and such 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:17.480
 when there are cervical problems 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:19.970
 arthrosis tensions or any problem 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.949
 affecting the cervical area one of the 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.470
 things that happen is that the muscles are 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.349
 they remain spastic they are left without that 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.840
 ability to contract and relax if 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.840
 somehow that control is lost 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.930
 about them this is a subtle exercise 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.440
 soft not of strength is an exercise 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.750
 oriented to get loosen the area 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.350
 cervical to remind the muscles that 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.560
 they have that ability to on off on off 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.780
 contract relax because as I say 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.090
 many times they have stayed in the on and 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.489
 they have not known how to turn off anymore 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.470
 has lost even the awareness that 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.660
 they are contracted, they just feel that it hurts 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.670
 the neck but you do not realize it's not 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.309
 aware that he has a tension 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.619
 muscle we are going to raise a little bit that 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.259
 tension and then when relaxing 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.060
 get down a little bit lower than 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.250
 agreement is very simple is an exercise 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.679
 very simple where what depends is not 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.300
 so much or what is important is not so much the 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:20.420
 exercise itself but how 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.880
 the attention you put into it and how 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.400
 come you fill it with your own 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.530
 consciousness and your own relaxation of 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:33.270
 agreement let's go there we're going to place 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.219
 simply a hand against the side 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.159
 and we are going to push the hand against 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:43.130
 head and head against the hand very 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.750
 very soft 300 grams 400 grams 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.659
 imagine what weighs an envelope of ham 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:54.000
 york, that's the push you have 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:56.250
 to do push and smooth 1 2 3 4 and 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.729
 loosen jce and when loosening you have to 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.330
 feel like the neck relaxes if it's worth 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:07.450
 you do a repetition 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.450
 and benissa the left side pushes 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:20.890
 1-2-3-4 loosen 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:24.860
 loose loose push 1-2-3-4 loosen 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:30.160
 you do the same in the forehead you push 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:34.080
 forward now 1 2 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.800
 4 and loosen 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:45.090
 and you do the same on the back of the neck 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:47.540
 push 1 2 3 4 and loosen up you're going to repeat 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.040
 this same sequence of repetitions 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.520
 left right forward back 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.100
 left right forward back 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.500
 repeating it always focusing on the 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.510
 relaxation after contracting that 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.510
 push pushes push and then release well 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.100
 the tension perceive as low a little 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.720
 below you can do this circuit 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.190
 these four contractions 15 20 times 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.959
 perfectly and it is an exercise that as 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.260
 I tell you it will help relax 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.080
 cervical musculature and recover to 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.000
 recover is 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.870
 if it is that duality of contraction 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.240
 relaxation 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.880
 anyway I invite you to 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.490
 find and look for another bunch of 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.890
 exercises another bunch of stretches 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.870
 for the cervical area tips and 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.030
 explanations of why they can be your 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.910
 pains in the neck and where you can 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.280
 find all this here in this you 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.280
 online physiotherapy portal 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.160
 Y 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.160
 good 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.019
