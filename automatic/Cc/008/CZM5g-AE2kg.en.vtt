00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.810
 very well as you can so I have a 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.240
 league 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.280
 this one of nothing else and all skin that if not 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.840
 much trouble your help that you put the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.670
 hand so firm as I have it here 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.640
 it's because I'm going to try to make this 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.470
 league jump from my hand yours 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.470
 just to be like that 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.160
 very well then the way in which 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.910
 works this effect itself consists the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.070
 preparation 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.670
 and have the leagues to cover a little the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.629
 excess and the formula that is prepared before 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.750
 to follow the performance explanation 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.660
 general is to put your thumb on the 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.989
 part of front the four fingers 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.269
 They must go behind league rule between 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:59.800
 the thumb and forefinger and I turn it 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:05.089
 take out and in this this space I put all 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.240
 the thumbs of the index to medicare 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.630
 you can see that it comes from the thumb 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.729
 until the mini care to the tip number 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.939
 back because he closed his hand did not 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.060
 can talk a lot with your fingers that's why 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.560
 I have it from point to point to close 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.170
 your fingers and that you can see a little more 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.080
 like this from the back 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.420
 here 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.970
 and the time to release the thumb of 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.290
 relax 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.940
 is going to release the league so the moment 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.040
 that it is the viewer that puts the 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.750
 another hand you hit 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.470
 one more direct from below up 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.660
 but at a 45 degree angle because 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.520
 this section of the league which is going to 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.180
 go through the top of the hand 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.180
 of the viewer 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.420
 and that can help a little more than 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.600
 between as much as possible and alemanno 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.799
 Having a long sleeve can help in 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.799
 case you do not have leagues 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.560
 the plate for the excess tries that the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.260
 I'm not very close to the hand 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.560
 to be the most out there then 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.140
 the doll that now before doing this 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.819
 performance I have the league here so that the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.850
 viewer has a clear vision of 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.800
 how is the league 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.220
 and then I tell him to put his hand 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.740
 just like I do I try to do a little 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.110
 more than eye contact and then it 's 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.050
 when I do the preparation the 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.940
 preparation one more time 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.990
 thumb goes across the four fingers 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.170
 behind 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.230
 through the league and by the index and the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.290
 thumb and the abulense take out without having to 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.020
 make any turn and there in the openings 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.540
 when all the fingers enter the 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.090
 expression with the thumb against 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.190
 index so that the league does not leave 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.220
 to keep the league more towards the wrist 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.340
 and here you can cover using others 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.960
 leagues or you can fold the wrist but 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.300
 they would have to see very directly from 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.090
 up in this to cover with the skin 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.000
 although the league does not use manga 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.770
 long but if you have leagues to cover 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.530
 who treats you to be a little more 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.840
 loose 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.160
 but for the excess there was not much 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.580
 pressure because if not the league is not going to 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.370
 go well and with the blows with the hand 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.900
 This can be a little fingers not 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.660
 expose a lot the back is not 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:40.630
 necessary and no more once with that already 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.630
 try to be the angle hit 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.810
 because the league between the moment of 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.980
 relax the thumb and that would be all the 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.980
 explanation basically 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.280
