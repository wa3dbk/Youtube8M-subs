00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.440 
would like to add salt to taste this way
when<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.990> vegetables<00:03:30.530> are<00:03:30.650> cooking<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:32.120> salt

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
as you can see after cooking for like 10

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.640 
as you can see after cooking for like 10
to<00:04:43.760> 12<00:04:44.090> minutes<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.750> vegetables<00:04:45.320> are<00:04:45.470> nice

to 12 minutes the vegetables are nice
and<00:04:45.950> soft<00:04:46.040> now<00:04:46.640> so<00:04:47.480> you<00:04:47.540> remove<00:04:48.320> them<00:04:48.560> from

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800

this<00:04:54.140> soup<00:04:54.470> is<00:04:54.650> ready<00:04:55.160> to<00:04:55.460> go<00:04:55.670> into<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.360> liquid

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
this soup is ready to go into the liquid

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.129 
this soup is ready to go into the liquid
Iser

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.540 

very<00:05:00.919> gently<00:05:01.280> you<00:05:01.969> put<00:05:02.210> all<00:05:02.479> the<00:05:02.719> vegetables

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
very gently you put all the vegetables

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.600 
very gently you put all the vegetables
first<00:05:04.550> into<00:05:05.240> the<00:05:05.270> liquid<00:05:05.599> I<00:05:05.900> so<00:05:05.960> if<00:05:06.560> there<00:05:07.490> is

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
first into the liquid I so if there is

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.140 
first into the liquid I so if there is
too<00:05:07.849> much<00:05:08.060> liquid<00:05:08.389> you<00:05:09.229> can<00:05:09.460> take<00:05:10.460> it<00:05:10.669> out<00:05:10.879> and

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
too much liquid you can take it out and

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.209 
too much liquid you can take it out and
put<00:05:11.240> it<00:05:11.629> at<00:05:11.749> the<00:05:11.810> side<00:05:12.229> because<00:05:12.590> it's<00:05:12.919> not

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:13.219 
put it at the side because it's not

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:16.480 
put it at the side because it's not
necessary<00:05:13.819> to<00:05:13.909> put<00:05:14.300> all<00:05:14.599> the<00:05:14.930> liquid<00:05:15.490> which

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
necessary to put all the liquid which

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.350 
necessary to put all the liquid which
has<00:05:16.669> come<00:05:16.879> out<00:05:17.090> while<00:05:17.749> cooking<00:05:18.529> the<00:05:18.889> soup<00:05:19.360> to

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.480 

now<00:05:33.340> that<00:05:33.580> the<00:05:33.760> soup<00:05:34.000> is<00:05:34.210> churned<00:05:34.570> nicely<00:05:35.490> we

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
now that the soup is churned nicely we

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.710 
now that the soup is churned nicely we
have<00:05:36.820> to<00:05:37.090> put<00:05:37.780> it<00:05:37.930> through<00:05:38.200> the<00:05:38.380> sieve

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.760 

little<00:05:43.470> by<00:05:43.620> little<00:05:43.650> of<00:05:44.190> course

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.770 

at<00:05:47.770> this<00:05:47.950> point<00:05:48.220> if<00:05:48.520> you<00:05:48.670> really<00:05:49.120> want<00:05:49.390> a<00:05:49.510> nice

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
have the correct sieve through which you

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.900 
have the correct sieve through which you
are<00:05:56.980> going<00:05:57.220> to<00:05:57.780> strain<00:05:58.780> your<00:05:59.020> suits<00:05:59.670> in<00:06:00.670> the
