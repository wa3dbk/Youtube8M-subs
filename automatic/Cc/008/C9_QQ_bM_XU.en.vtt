00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:23.479
 internet after a week and a half 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.189
 for getting to find the solution and 

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:27.019

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.780
 problem fixing 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.240

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.590

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.840
 I did it in your time and once you have 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.300
 deleted closed and direct access 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.770

 I have and I have it here 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.020

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.710
