say that we're out of the big 12 race

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.710

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
because Kansas and Oklahoma are not

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.600 
because Kansas and Oklahoma are not
going<00:06:05.900> to<00:06:05.990> lose<00:06:06.140> three<00:06:06.530> games<00:06:06.770> and<00:06:07.100> Congress

going to lose three games and Congress

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.340 
going to lose three games and Congress

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
not the way they're playing and I get

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.510 
not the way they're playing and I get
you<00:06:09.440> props<00:06:09.650> to<00:06:09.800> Kansas<00:06:10.190> you<00:06:10.280> know<00:06:10.370> they're

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
you props to Kansas you know they're

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.680

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
supposed to have a down year this year

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.150 
supposed to have a down year this year
and<00:06:11.930> I<00:06:11.960> did<00:06:12.140> say<00:06:12.320> you<00:06:12.380> know<00:06:12.560> watch<00:06:12.740> out<00:06:12.980> for

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.680 
and I did say you know watch out for
them<00:06:13.280> but<00:06:14.030> I<00:06:14.090> didn't<00:06:14.270> think<00:06:14.330> they<00:06:14.510> were<00:06:14.570> going

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
them but I didn't think they were going

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.940 
them but I didn't think they were going
to<00:06:14.750> be<00:06:14.900> the<00:06:15.020> third<00:06:15.169> or<00:06:15.350> fourth<00:06:15.530> team<00:06:15.740> in<00:06:15.890> the

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
to be the third or fourth team in the

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.980 
to be the third or fourth team in the
conference<00:06:16.130> in<00:06:16.610> there<00:06:16.790> they're<00:06:17.540> challenging

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
conference in there they're challenging

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.480 
conference in there they're challenging
for<00:06:18.169> the<00:06:18.230> top<00:06:18.410> spot<00:06:18.560> as<00:06:18.860> they<00:06:18.980> always<00:06:19.130> do

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
for the top spot as they always do

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.250 
for the top spot as they always do
that's<00:06:19.790> what<00:06:19.940> basketball<00:06:20.360> you<00:06:20.720> know<00:06:20.750> programs

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
that's what basketball you know programs

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.820 
that's what basketball you know programs
do<00:06:21.760> so<00:06:22.990> hopefully<00:06:23.990> Texas<00:06:24.320> turns<00:06:24.410> around<00:06:24.680> I

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
do so hopefully Texas turns around I

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.770 
do so hopefully Texas turns around I
just<00:06:24.860> it's<00:06:25.310> hard<00:06:25.370> for<00:06:25.640> me<00:06:25.700> to<00:06:25.790> see<00:06:26.000> it<00:06:26.150> not

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
just it's hard for me to see it not

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.550 
just it's hard for me to see it not
because<00:06:26.930> I<00:06:27.050> don't<00:06:27.200> think<00:06:27.230> we<00:06:27.380> have<00:06:27.500> the

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
because I don't think we have the

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.110 
because I don't think we have the
athletes<00:06:28.040> to<00:06:28.160> do<00:06:28.310> it<00:06:28.430> by<00:06:28.520> just<00:06:28.550> don't<00:06:28.850> think<00:06:29.030> we

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
athletes to do it by just don't think we

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.260 
athletes to do it by just don't think we
