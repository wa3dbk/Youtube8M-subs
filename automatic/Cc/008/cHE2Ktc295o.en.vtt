00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.660
 from the reflection until the moment 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.130
 product will end up in store there 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.590
 must be between 2 to 3 years on the 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.170
 product complexity weave 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.100
 possession of new products in one does 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.500
 no starting point 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.630
 we think about it 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.360
 zero you really have to count three years 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.040
 so before we start designing 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.170
 spend a lot of time talking with 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.360
 practitioners or athletes if it's 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.460
 a product and cc and to understand well 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.650
 their demands their affinities with 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.290
 some some some subjects 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.940
 certain forms sold and after one 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.560
 begins to think and put in 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.009
 point all that to create the new 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.340
 model we start drawing on 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.869
 shoes and then after here in if we 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.000
 is able to make prototypes 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.490
 quickly enough to validate 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.320
 concepts that allows us to try that from 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.930
 give it to practices between noon and 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.880
 two or the weekend trying to validate 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.920
 if it's good maybe not 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.340
 correct some defects to improve 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.560
 some things until having a pro 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.430
 tower or functional that satisfies the 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.430
 the practitioner 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.670
 so we have a material library we have 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.350
 elaborated with all the materials we 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.510
 uses until today so the 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.850
 materials in our toolbox are 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.190
 already tested and approved 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.320
 so they are listed in a 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.780
 computer database that 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.670
 repeat all the tests that can be done 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.070
 on this matter so for example one 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.080
 can test the abrasion the resistance to 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.700
 tearing and that's all attraction 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.050
 that and so we know that all these 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.570
 materials in our toolbox passes 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.570
 our quality standards on these tests there 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.569
 in my life that achieving a 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.190
 prototype is characterized by 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.690
 different phases the first phase 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.390
 it's the choice of materials 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.239
 so we choose soft materials 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.720
 in our material library then we 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.230
 make the patronage in 2d in order to 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.849
 cut 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.940
 all these materials that we chose 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.040
 in parallel we establish the 3d plane 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.510
 of the week and we can 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.879
 prototype is in our workshop 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.370
 then we assemble his different 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.860
 components therefore stems and mingle 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.049
 finished product we test it with 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.849
 practitioners on the ground in order to 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.360
 make sure they match 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.360
 their needs 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.910
 to qualify and validate 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.270
 models before impoundment placed on the 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.910
 market 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.250
 we need to test the materials 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.680
 and the finished products it is articulated on 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.080
 two phases firstly we rely on 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.430
 standard tests and then on 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.680
 tests that we developed 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.110
 specifically for home testing 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.970
 to correlate as closely as possible 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.970
 field tests in the laboratory 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.090
 we go to my life that we have three 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.910
 types of tests we have the tests 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.070
 static and is island dynamic 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.230
 performance and long-term tests 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.960
 static tests I do try some 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.030
 shoes to find out if people are 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.490
 well feel good in have no 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.680
 embarrassment of discomfort a good behavior then 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.680
 test performance dynamic tests 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.140
 we organize outdoor tests 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.610
 testers with their bike they do the 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.560
 course we do it with them they 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.860
 fill out a dynamics sheet where 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.630
 they also tell us comfortably 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.720
 transmission their sensations then in 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.190
 durability test we lend products on 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.320
 sends products to testers 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.730
 that he uses throughout the year 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.959
 we make points every three months 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.959
 on long-term tests 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.160
 I have my life that quality is a moment 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.080
 an important point from the first proto to the 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.270
 product release on the market 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.600
 it takes about a hundred 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.600
 proto
