place<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.480> traction<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.929> hunt<00:00:31.109> over<00:00:31.340> so<00:00:32.340> why

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
place for traction to hunt over so why

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.190 
place for traction to hunt over so why
am<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.759> why<00:00:32.940> would<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.149> be<00:00:33.300> here<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.600> early<00:00:33.750> August

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
to turn this plot up the reason is is it

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.869 
to turn this plot up the reason is is it

the growing weeds out of the soil that's

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.229 
the growing weeds out of the soil that's
absorbing<00:01:02.340> them<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.550> taking<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.940> lot<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.180> the

moisture out and then I'm going to leave
it<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.650> way<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.339> barren<00:01:05.670> state<00:01:05.970> for

to be bank in that barren soil and held
on<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.590> when<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.830> come<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.280> put<00:01:17.460> seed

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
on to so that when I come and put seed

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.609 
on to so that when I come and put seed
in<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> ground<00:01:17.909> I've<00:01:18.360> got<00:01:18.600> much<00:01:19.110> better<00:01:19.290> soil

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
in the ground I've got much better soil

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.429 
in the ground I've got much better soil
moisture<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.180> were<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.600> what<00:01:22.259> most

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
moisture and if I were to do what most

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.260 
moisture and if I were to do what most
people<00:01:22.830> do<00:01:22.979> which<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.369> come<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.850> disk

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
people do which is to come and disk

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.440 
people do which is to come and disk
right<00:01:25.140> before<00:01:25.560> they<00:01:25.650> put<00:01:25.860> seed<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.280> by<00:01:26.880> disking

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
right before they put seed in by disking

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.140 
right before they put seed in by disking
the<00:01:27.600> soil<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.470> lose<00:01:29.040> what<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.640> equivalent

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
the soil you can lose what is equivalent

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.840 
the soil you can lose what is equivalent
to<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.479> inch<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.780> rainfall<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.710> soil<00:01:32.400> moisture

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
to one inch of rainfall in soil moisture

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.969 
to one inch of rainfall in soil moisture
so<00:01:33.450> when<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.930> very<00:01:34.170> little<00:01:34.350> rainfall<00:01:34.590> here

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
so when I have very little rainfall here

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.620 
so when I have very little rainfall here
in<00:01:35.100> South<00:01:35.280> Texas<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.850> want<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> bank<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
in South Texas I want to bank and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.330 
in South Texas I want to bank and
conserve<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.079> soil<00:01:37.530> moisture<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:37.979> best<00:01:38.189> I

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
conserve that soil moisture as best I

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.030 
conserve that soil moisture as best I
