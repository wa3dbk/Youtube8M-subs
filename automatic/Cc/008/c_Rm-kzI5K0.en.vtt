way<00:00:49.320> more<00:00:49.590> than<00:00:49.649> kyros<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.340> Rebecca's

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
way more than kyros and Rebecca's

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.090 
way more than kyros and Rebecca's
talking<00:00:51.899> about<00:00:52.050> Rocinante<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.800> how<00:00:53.039> he

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
talking about Rocinante and how he

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.950

trusted<00:00:53.699> him<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.850> he's<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.600> only<00:00:54.750> lied

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960

to<00:00:55.079> me<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.590> time<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.309> guess<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.820> was

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
to me that one time and I guess that was

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.029 
to me that one time and I guess that was
you<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.360> guess<00:00:57.510> sengoku<00:00:57.960> never<00:00:58.170> knew

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
you because I guess sengoku never knew

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.799 
you because I guess sengoku never knew
for<00:00:59.430> sure<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.640> was<00:01:00.149> law<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:00.539> now<00:01:00.660> he's

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
for sure that was law but now he's

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.389 
for sure that was law but now he's
pieced<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.530> together<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.980> how<00:01:02.219> they're

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
pieced that together and how they're

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.479 
pieced that together and how they're
talking<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.059> he's<00:01:03.960> asking<00:01:04.320> about<00:01:04.379> D<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
like maybe a little something right

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.330 
like maybe a little something right
there<00:03:15.090> like<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.780> scrape<00:03:16.110> but<00:03:16.680> he<00:03:17.100> seems

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
there like a scrape but he seems

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.130 
there like a scrape but he seems
perfectly<00:03:17.730> fine<00:03:17.940> from<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.390> mostly<00:03:18.989> but

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
perfectly fine from it mostly but

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.600 
perfectly fine from it mostly but
goddamn<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.739> did<00:03:19.890> not<00:03:20.040> expect<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.580> happen

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
goddamn I did not expect that to happen

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.850 
goddamn I did not expect that to happen
maybe<00:03:21.060> next<00:03:21.330> chapter<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:21.930> guess<00:03:22.380> we'll<00:03:22.530> have<00:03:22.680> to

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
maybe next chapter I guess we'll have to

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.710 
maybe next chapter I guess we'll have to
have<00:03:23.010> them<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.519> mean<00:03:24.209> he's<00:03:24.300> gotta<00:03:24.480> run

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
have them I mean he's gotta run

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.870 
have them I mean he's gotta run
obviously<00:03:25.500> he<00:03:25.620> cannot<00:03:25.830> fight<00:03:26.040> fujitora<00:03:26.430> maybe

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
obviously he cannot fight fujitora maybe

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.660 
obviously he cannot fight fujitora maybe
if<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.060> get<00:03:27.209> everybody<00:03:27.660> there<00:03:27.900> all<00:03:28.140> together

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
if you get everybody there all together

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.610 
if you get everybody there all together
maybe<00:03:29.670> but<00:03:30.330> he<00:03:30.900> can't<00:03:31.200> do<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.320> by<00:03:31.530> himself

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
maybe but he can't do it by himself

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.830 
maybe but he can't do it by himself
obviously<00:03:32.070> so<00:03:33.030> they're<00:03:33.300> still<00:03:33.480> gonna<00:03:33.600> have<00:03:33.750> to

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
obviously so they're still gonna have to

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.060 
obviously so they're still gonna have to
escape<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.320> I'm<00:03:34.380> sure<00:03:34.530> they're<00:03:34.709> gonna<00:03:34.800> end<00:03:35.010> up

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
escape and I'm sure they're gonna end up

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.100 
escape and I'm sure they're gonna end up
leaving<00:03:35.280> in<00:03:35.610> 800<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:36.660> we'll<00:03:36.750> still<00:03:36.900> have<00:03:36.989> to

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
leaving in 800 so we'll still have to

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.110 
leaving in 800 so we'll still have to
deal<00:03:37.260> with<00:03:37.380> them<00:03:37.560> leaving<00:03:37.910> in<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.090> next

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
deal with them leaving in the next

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.900 
deal with them leaving in the next
chapter<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.840> then<00:03:40.230> whether<00:03:41.190> we'll<00:03:41.400> have<00:03:41.640> a

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
chapter and then whether we'll have a

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.390 
chapter and then whether we'll have a
female<00:03:42.900> crew<00:03:43.260> member<00:03:43.290> join<00:03:43.769> because<00:03:44.040> this<00:03:44.280> is
