00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
this all works yeah basically can sprout

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.850 
this all works yeah basically can sprout
like<00:05:21.640> that<00:05:23.100> tree<00:05:24.100> kinda<00:05:24.490> seeds<00:05:24.790> or<00:05:25.680> you<00:05:26.680> can

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
like that tree kinda seeds or you can

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.290 
like that tree kinda seeds or you can
sprout<00:05:27.160> them<00:05:27.370> at<00:05:27.490> different<00:05:27.640> time<00:05:28.000> so<00:05:28.240> you

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
sprout them at different time so you

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.260 
sprout them at different time so you
have<00:05:28.540> a<00:05:29.490> steady<00:05:30.490> flow<00:05:30.790> of<00:05:31.090> sprouts<00:05:31.980> and<00:05:33.240> yeah<00:05:34.240> I

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
have a steady flow of sprouts and yeah I

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.820 
have a steady flow of sprouts and yeah I
guess<00:05:34.570> that's<00:05:34.840> it<00:05:36.630> next<00:05:37.630> time<00:05:38.080> all<00:05:38.560> you<00:05:38.680> got<00:05:38.800> to

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
guess that's it next time all you got to

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.150 
guess that's it next time all you got to
do<00:05:39.040> a<00:05:39.070> video<00:05:39.430> just<00:05:39.910> on<00:05:40.090> that<00:05:40.150> thing<00:05:41.010> once<00:05:42.010> I
