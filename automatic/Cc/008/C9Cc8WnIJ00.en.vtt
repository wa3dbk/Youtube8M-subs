00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 I adore life I adore I love it 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.819
 the iPhone diodoro the iPhone of me too with 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.330
 the iphone 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.679
 I, instead, a samsung I love ours 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.570
 I adore nexus 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.570
 in short, I love all smartphones 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.740
 we can call it mottled 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.210
 send messages to everyone connected 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.500
 social networks take pictures of us 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.040
 we can also listen to music in 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.750
 bus 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.220
 and all this most often with a 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.810
 object that we also manage to put into 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.660
 pocket less than just instead of a 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.890
 iphone we don't have a samsung 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.540
 this was bad but unfortunately 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.550
 smartphones also have lots of sides 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.710
 negative especially if you have an iphone 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.850
 like me for example 97 percent two 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.440
 times when you fall to those who fell it 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.030
 screen facing the floor and up 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.620
 cold as he picks it up out of fear 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.239
 to turn it around and find a broken screen 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.890
 fucking films to keep it 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.609
 clean screen that comes off after three 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.620
 or four days 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.059
 siri that we never use and the few times 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.149
 in which we use it does not understand what 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.149
 you say 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.030
 francesco exact you did not understand a shit 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.769
 not even this time 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.120
 but above all the biggest flaw of 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.890
 this cell phone is its battery 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.050
 does not accept the fact that every day there 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.700
 I'm 24 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.350
 does not hold it up as a thing to parts defects 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.060
 that may have and I believe I am 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.409
 forget a lot maybe write a 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.030
 comment from when we have these 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.560
 phones we spend the days writing 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.420
 we write definitely much more but 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.159
 we talk much less and the term 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.509
 conversation nowadays comes 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.280
 used to indicate a series of messages 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.409
 that we exchange with our cell phones while 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.149
 once a conversation was me who 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.320
 I was talking to someone in my opinion 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.700
 these virtual conversations 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.770
 it would be nice that over notifications of 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.600
 displayed and typing in progress there 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.280
 it was also written when a person 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.570
 maybe he is rereading old messages 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.549
 already just like state is rereading 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.400
 from the old messages okay here's how 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.440
 my life since an iphone 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.790
 in short , but it will be read by col 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.290
 cellphone charge them is precisely the 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.650
 wake up a dozen times a pair 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.030
 of manhattan and I fall asleep in the morning 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.380
 I wake up with a ring of shit that 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.830
 mine a couple of times before getting up 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.540
 from bed 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.830
 then I get up from bed I open facebook I see 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.420
 that there are no typical audio 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.130
 whatsapp more intransitive so I do 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.480
 breakfast then dress and esprit case e 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.830
 at this time of day a 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.900
 iPhone battery is one hundred per 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.330
 hundred or inner serenity of 24 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.920
 seconds more valley of the day 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.300
 I take the bus and hygiene when I am 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.590
 on the bus, watch the clock 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.300
 thinking I'm late 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.530
 so it worries me making me salt shaker 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.240
 anxiety means making a book from 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.380
 bag and start thinking that then it is 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.940
 enough for the exam 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.740
 or maybe my life sucks then 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.209
 decided to listen to a song I am 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.760
 go back to the small pizzas you find 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:26.200
 a for the risk of pocket because 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.610
 unfortunately fortunately they are one of those 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.050
 people to disconnect from the world 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.310
 regardless of where you are 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.780
 finds he needs to put a pair of 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:40.570
 headphones and turn up the volume to the maximum 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:41.800
 of music comes the action but not 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.450
 message my best friend and see 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.489
 that the battery of a cellphone l 87 per 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.989
 hundred or perplexities have passed 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.739
 only 12 minutes from the hundred percent 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.790
 the lesson begins 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.870
 I impose to be careful at least 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.489
 the first two but after ten minutes 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.810
 I understand that I can't take the 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.700
 mobile phone to see what time to scheduled 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.560
 grain I open whatsapp I open facebook and then 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.879
 can the phone but not just now so 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.900
 it concerns him and in general at the end of the lesson 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.010
 with the sphere I have 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.359
 while all my companions in progress 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.799
 I spend an hour on my cell phone without making myself 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.909
 find out I'm just being scolded 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:11.459
 mobile phone triumphed for five 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:12.870
 seconds at the end of the lesson lunch with 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.189
 some of my classmates though 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.689
 nowadays eating together 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.919
 I think I 'm going to eat alone because 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.150
 most often as soon as I finish 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.349
 send a message all those with 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.269
 to which a table is put to write 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.439
 one is that it is municipal elections of is 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.419
 usually at this time of the 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.489
 day the phone battery to 45 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.810
 percent or nervousness are not 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.879
 even in the middle of the day the battery of the 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.049
 cell phone is already discharged where the card 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.109
 takes the car keys I get in 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.109
 machine 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.280
 what to take a friend while driving the 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.569
 my best friend writes to me that you do e 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.920
 I try to respond to some write 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.879
 I no no quiet on the part in three 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.010
 I'm writing to you to register 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.599
 vocal while trying to cancel the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.359
 voice recording I leave while yes 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.989
 yes i have to stop the road where the 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.060
 people 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.349
 hi site you can tell me something go home 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.549
 I wait for the gym bag I wonder 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.439
 heal in the gym feet or in the car 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.000
 but above all it drains the battery first 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.620
 or after going to the gym vaira 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.599
 by pieri since the battery mi2 anchor 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.799
 an hour or so runs to the gym just 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.329
 we will have in the gym look at the time and me 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.530
 the mobile phone arrives on the 20th 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.579
 percent of battery and I regret 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.939
 what I thought five minutes 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.349
 before 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.799
 I put the silent cell phone and I do 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.799
 work out 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.829
 at the end of training I look at my mobile phone 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.390
 to see what time it is 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.859
 and I find 10 notifications to reply to 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.390
 everyone will have to send nine messages and do 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.980
 a call because my mother posts 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.720
 does not read them but I have little battery while 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.950
 I think of all this the battery has fallen 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.420
 suddenly at one percent or 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.680
 crisis in the longest time of the 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.030
 full day life passes by 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.410
 to the heartbeat and birth and the 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.640
 awareness that perhaps in the one 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.860
 time when the cell phone would be you 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.120
 served really you can't use it you don't 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.650
 I left the gym and the 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.640
 cell phone was still a percent then I have 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.640
 started running his home 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.210
 finally arrived under my house farrow 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.680
 that I forgot the bag in 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.660
 gym the house keys are in the 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.760
 so shit bag every nanny think what 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.140
 to be able to already do in general in 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.730
 this moment of the day mine 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.720
 cell phone turns me off and I'm just the 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.220
 half past five in the afternoon 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.570
 in short, the battery does not improve either 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.010
 half day unless he place 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.540
 return the lesson to the days when ai 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.160
 free afternoons I don't see myself with able 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.050
 to the media my best friend is a little 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.610
 proud and spoiled as stubborn as 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.900
 most women then in those 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.310
 days when I come home and I'm on 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.810
 eyelash of the door, the iPhone is not me 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.770
 turn off and if when a person came out 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.720
 come home with the battery of the 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.710
 cell phone probably still charged 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.710
 that person the right one 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.349
 such 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.349
 I 

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:37.969

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:39.709

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:41.509
 seen I have the cell phone down and I have to 

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:43.569
 still talk within the home with 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:48.309
 cell phone to charger and wait 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:51.349
 wait finally we do finally

 where when we missed someone instead 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:12.860

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:28.339
 and he answers me, and yes, because there is a 

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:29.989
 nice background I answer no because it was 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:31.399
 a nice photo booth team ok 

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:33.439
 I write to her but she started me 

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:35.929
 he writes no part of me told me 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:38.269
 I would get pissed but vain wrote no 

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:39.740
 cimatti wrote no with a dot and in 

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:41.479
 that point in three cita mente is there 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.789
 written yes I am ugly angry 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.619
 dickhead but maybe he answers me 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.789
 after he is generally after he does not answer me 

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:48.259
 more and the bad arguing for 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:49.699
 message and then you do race though 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.559
 I want to those who view for more time 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.969
 without answering and all this for sure 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:54.469
 does not put you in a good mood even if you 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:55.699
 I really realize I am lonely 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:57.110
 when on the bus I wear headphones 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:58.219
 of the iphone with cesar music but not 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.990
 I listen to it because I'm inside 

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:00.769
 thoughts 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.849
 in short, in those days look 

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:03.409
 continuously then without having 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:04.669
 message plus reply by consuming the 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:06.079
 phone battery by opening facebook 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:06.559
 to spy on the person I have with 

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:07.639
 fight 

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:08.929
 hoping he wrote something 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:11.439
 from the palette to understand how 

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:11.439
 behave 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.169
 we live in a world where to do 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.120
 friendship 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:18.800
 just a click we communicate through 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.750
 fuck phones and social networks 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.280
 colorful that make us feel close to us 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.199
 We delude ourselves that we are not his only because 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.580
 someone is writing to us on whatsapp but 

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:27.169
 It is actually just us it continuously 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.030
 only that we don't realize why 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:30.860
 we believe that in the xxi century the 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.880
 loneliness both unlock the screen not 

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.150
 find notification 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.150

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.740
 The sale 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.200

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.430
