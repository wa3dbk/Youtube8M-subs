2014

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.929 
2014
I'll<00:00:24.750> explain<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> bet<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.730> engine

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
I'll explain to you a bet on that engine

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.080 
I'll explain to you a bet on that engine
we<00:00:27.510> have<00:00:27.750> introduced<00:00:28.609> lightweight<00:00:29.609> engines

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
we have introduced lightweight engines

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.240 
we have introduced lightweight engines
so<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.689> engine<00:00:31.019> replaced<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.800> eight<00:00:31.980> one

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
so this engine replaced the eight one

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.340 
so this engine replaced the eight one
that<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.550> use<00:00:32.759> with<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.800> 375<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.059> 425<00:00:36.200> so<00:00:37.200> now

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
that we use with the 375 and 425 so now

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.209 
that we use with the 375 and 425 so now
we're<00:00:37.500> gonna<00:00:37.649> line<00:00:38.100> up<00:00:38.129> 350<00:00:38.790> 380<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:40.219> 436

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
we're gonna line up 350 380 in 436

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.380 
we're gonna line up 350 380 in 436
leader<00:00:41.780> lightweight<00:00:42.780> we're<00:00:43.200> talking<00:00:43.710> about

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
leader lightweight we're talking about

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.670 
leader lightweight we're talking about
157<00:00:45.530> 157<00:00:46.530> pounds<00:00:46.710> lighter<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:48.000> engine

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
157 157 pounds lighter on this engine

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.490 
157 157 pounds lighter on this engine
also<00:00:49.680> while<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.280> introduce<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.140> variable<00:00:52.140> cam

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
also while we introduce the variable cam

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.720 
also while we introduce the variable cam
timing<00:00:52.820> on<00:00:53.820> all<00:00:54.210> engines<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:55.440> by<00:00:55.649> doing<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.430> is

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
timing on all engines so by doing so is

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.270 
timing on all engines so by doing so is
we're<00:00:57.300> getting<00:00:57.600> like<00:00:57.989> 20%<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.800> till<00:00:59.039> better

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
we're getting like 20% of till better

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.150 
we're getting like 20% of till better

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
fuel economy using elements indirect oil

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.369 
fuel economy using elements indirect oil
pan<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.789> element<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.239> well<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.989> we're

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
pan is the element as well and we're

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.180 
pan is the element as well and we're
using<00:01:04.530> composite<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.339> intake<00:01:06.240> manifold

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
using composite of intake manifold

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.040 
using composite of intake manifold

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.310 
cars or trucks for years as of July 2013
we<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.400> all<00:01:15.000> our<00:01:15.270> gas<00:01:15.450> products<00:01:15.869> often<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.290> a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
we are all our gas products often with a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.980 
we are all our gas products often with a
five-year<00:01:16.800> warranty<00:01:17.690> bumper<00:01:18.690> to<00:01:18.869> bumper

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
five-year warranty bumper to bumper

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.980 
five-year warranty bumper to bumper
basically<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.920> all<00:01:20.220> all<00:01:20.880> components<00:01:21.479> except

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
basically so all all components except

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.170 
basically so all all components except
the<00:01:22.080> maintenance<00:01:22.350> components<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.729> package

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the maintenance components the package

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.999 
the maintenance components the package
itself<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.630> smaller<00:01:24.930> than<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.170> one<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:25.890> can

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
itself is smaller than a one so we can

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.670 
itself is smaller than a one so we can
fit<00:01:26.190> it<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.700> smaller<00:01:26.970> package<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.960> by

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
fit it in a smaller package and by

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.530 
fit it in a smaller package and by
having<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> 6.0<00:01:29.790> with<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.090> would<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.360> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
having the 6.0 with it would be a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.480 
having the 6.0 with it would be a
variable<00:01:30.869> cam<00:01:31.170> timing<00:01:31.200> what<00:01:32.190> it<00:01:32.310> does

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
variable cam timing what it does

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.690 
variable cam timing what it does
basically<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> 500<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.800> hole

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
basically on the 500 you get a hole

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.130 
basically on the 500 you get a hole
shots<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.300> really<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.630> good<00:01:36.780> buddy<00:01:36.930> that

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
shots not really that good buddy that

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.350 
shots not really that good buddy that
you<00:01:37.440> get<00:01:37.560> top<00:01:37.770> speed<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.520> five-seven<00:01:39.240> you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
you get top speed on the five-seven you

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.480 
you get top speed on the five-seven you
get<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> really<00:01:39.869> good<00:01:40.080> hole<00:01:40.350> shot<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.399> you

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
get a really good hole shot but you

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.940 
get a really good hole shot but you
don't<00:01:41.640> get<00:01:41.729> top<00:01:41.970> speed<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.990> 6.0<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.830> were

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
don't get top speed on the 6.0 we were

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.499 
don't get top speed on the 6.0 we were
able<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> cabinet<00:01:44.700> variable<00:01:45.090> cam<00:01:45.270> can

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
able with a cabinet variable cam can

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.389 
able with a cabinet variable cam can
play<00:01:46.259> with<00:01:46.440> three<00:01:46.560> five<00:01:46.800> degrees<00:01:47.039> of<00:01:47.190> timing

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
play with three five degrees of timing

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.219 
play with three five degrees of timing
so<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.789> way<00:01:48.090> what<00:01:48.300> we're<00:01:48.600> doing<00:01:48.899> it's<00:01:49.080> like

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
so that way what we're doing it's like

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.540 
so that way what we're doing it's like
you're<00:01:49.440> getting<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.740> really<00:01:50.009> good<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.399> hole

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
you're getting a really good and hole

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.520 
you're getting a really good and hole
shot<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.119> as<00:01:51.690> well<00:01:51.899> you're<00:01:52.110> getting<00:01:52.229> top

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
shot and as well you're getting top

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.029 
shot and as well you're getting top
speed<00:01:52.830> really<00:01:53.160> good<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:54.360> that's<00:01:55.289> the<00:01:55.590> that's

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
speed really good and that's the that's

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.590 
speed really good and that's the that's
what<00:01:56.190> we<00:01:56.280> ready<00:01:56.429> for<00:01:56.550> the<00:01:56.850> future<00:01:57.090> bird<00:01:57.390> with

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
what we ready for the future bird with

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.990 
what we ready for the future bird with
all<00:01:57.780> our<00:01:58.050> engine<00:01:58.740> line<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.520> advantage<00:01:59.910> of

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
all our engine line the advantage of

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.600 
all our engine line the advantage of
drill<00:02:00.300> prop<00:02:00.600> we'll<00:02:00.929> use<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.860> dual<00:02:02.070> prophets

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
drill prop we'll use the dual prophets

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.180 
drill prop we'll use the dual prophets
they<00:02:02.820> only<00:02:03.119> about<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.780> 20<00:02:04.530> footers<00:02:05.009> and

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
they only about like 20 footers and

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.160 
they only about like 20 footers and
higher<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.970> have<00:02:06.119> come<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.479> rotating<00:02:06.840> crops

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
higher you have come to rotating crops

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.650 
higher you have come to rotating crops
so<00:02:08.160> basically<00:02:08.519> I'll<00:02:08.729> give<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.269> better<00:02:09.390> old

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
so basically I'll give you a better old

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.080 
so basically I'll give you a better old
shot<00:02:09.929> better<00:02:10.739> mid-range<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.459> compared<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
shot better mid-range so compared to the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.729 
shot better mid-range so compared to the
single<00:02:12.269> clock<00:02:12.570> simply<00:02:13.200> prop<00:02:13.410> you'll<00:02:13.620> be

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
single clock simply prop you'll be

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.100 
single clock simply prop you'll be
cruising<00:02:14.220> at<00:02:14.340> 3200<00:02:15.000> rpm<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:15.510> with<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.900> dual

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
cruising at 3200 rpm and with the dual

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.860 
cruising at 3200 rpm and with the dual
property<00:02:16.470> be<00:02:16.590> cruising<00:02:16.950> at<00:02:17.070> 3<00:02:17.459> 2800<00:02:18.360> rpm<00:02:18.660> so

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
property be cruising at 3 2800 rpm so

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.120 
property be cruising at 3 2800 rpm so
that<00:02:19.079> will<00:02:19.200> give<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.500> better<00:02:19.709> fuel<00:02:20.070> economy

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
that will give you a better fuel economy

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.839 
that will give you a better fuel economy
as<00:02:20.519> well

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
as far as top speed you probably gain as

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.369 
as far as top speed you probably gain as
well<00:02:23.790> compared<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.599> single<00:02:24.780> problem

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
well compared to the single problem

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.379 
well compared to the single problem

about three years ago we changed to our

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.940 
about three years ago we changed to our
cartridge<00:02:57.130> size<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:57.580> again<00:02:58.150> more<00:02:59.050> environment

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
cartridge size so again more environment

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.670 
cartridge size so again more environment
is<00:03:00.070> more<00:03:00.400> friendly<00:03:00.700> easy<00:03:01.570> disposal<00:03:02.020> and
