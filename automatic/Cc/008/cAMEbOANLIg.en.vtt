with is flashlights I probably am more

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.400 
with is flashlights I probably am more
into<00:00:41.969> flashlights<00:00:42.420> than<00:00:42.660> anything<00:00:43.050> else<00:00:43.230> that

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
into flashlights than anything else that

into flashlights than anything else that
I<00:00:43.440> review<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.100> channel<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.789> that's

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
I review on this channel and that's

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.319 
I review on this channel and that's
because<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:45.840> me<00:00:45.989> light<00:00:46.980> means<00:00:47.329> civilization

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
because for me light means civilization

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.979 
because for me light means civilization
or<00:00:48.539> at<00:00:48.660> least<00:00:48.870> some<00:00:49.230> vestige<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.950> civilization

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
or at least some vestige of civilization

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.049 
or at least some vestige of civilization
surviving<00:00:51.989> should<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.649> dead<00:00:52.860> walk<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.579> earth

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
surviving should the dead walk the earth

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.389 
surviving should the dead walk the earth
you<00:00:54.719> know<00:00:54.870> if<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.530> dead<00:00:55.739> are<00:00:55.770> actually

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
you know if the dead are actually

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.060 
you know if the dead are actually
walking<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.789> earth<00:00:57.030> if<00:00:57.620> society<00:00:58.620> really<00:00:58.890> has

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
walking the earth if society really has

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.099 
walking the earth if society really has
full<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.520> fallen<00:00:59.910> apart<00:01:00.180> if<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.690> Power<00:01:00.870> has

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
full and fallen apart if the Power has

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.950 
full and fallen apart if the Power has
been<00:01:01.140> off<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:02.370> three<00:01:02.969> weeks<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.660> had<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
been off for three weeks and I had to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.050 
been off for three weeks and I had to
choose<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.530> flashlight<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
choose one flashlight of all the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.929 
choose one flashlight of all the
flashlights<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.200> keep<00:01:07.670> this<00:01:08.670> one

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
flashlights that I have to keep this one

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.899 
flashlights that I have to keep this one
right<00:01:09.360> here<00:01:09.720> would<00:01:09.900> be<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.530> one<00:01:11.280> important

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
right here would be it for one important

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.179 
right here would be it for one important
reason<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.920> would<00:01:14.130> be

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
reason and that is that it would be

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.179 
reason and that is that it would be
working<00:01:14.939> most<00:01:15.750> likely<00:01:16.200> while<00:01:16.439> all<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.920> others

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
working most likely while all the others

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.830 
working most likely while all the others
I'd<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.670> some<00:01:17.939> kind<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.299> problem<00:01:18.540> with

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
I'd have some kind of a problem with

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.190 
I'd have some kind of a problem with
batteries<00:01:19.350> or<00:01:20.090> something<00:01:21.090> that's<00:01:21.780> because

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
batteries or something that's because

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.340 
batteries or something that's because
this<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.280> hybrid<00:01:23.549> light<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.630> might<00:01:24.840> guess

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
this is the hybrid light you might guess

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.539 
this is the hybrid light you might guess
and<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:25.890> made<00:01:26.009> by<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.189> company<00:01:26.460> called

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and it's made by a company called

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.999 
and it's made by a company called
interestingly<00:01:27.000> enough<00:01:27.420> hybrid<00:01:28.049> light<00:01:28.229> you

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
interestingly enough hybrid light you

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.359 
interestingly enough hybrid light you
might<00:01:29.159> guess<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:30.860> this<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:32.159> looks

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
might guess that this here looks

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.920 
might guess that this here looks
surprisingly<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> solar<00:01:33.509> panel<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
surprisingly like a solar panel and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.990 
surprisingly like a solar panel and
that's<00:01:34.079> because<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.829> there<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.880> an

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that's because it is there is an

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.450 
that's because it is there is an
internal<00:01:36.420> battery<00:01:36.930> actually<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.680> think<00:01:37.799> based

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
internal battery actually I think based

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.190 
internal battery actually I think based
on<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> specifications<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.720> actually<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
on the specifications it's actually a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.340 
on the specifications it's actually a
high-capacity<00:01:41.810> electrolytic<00:01:42.810> capacitor

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
high-capacity electrolytic capacitor

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.510 
high-capacity electrolytic capacitor
although<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.680> can't<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.399> be

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
although I can't get that to be

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.539 
although I can't get that to be
confirmed<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.470> with<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.770> ordinary<00:01:47.280> room

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
confirmed and with just ordinary room

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.700 
confirmed and with just ordinary room
light<00:01:47.790> or<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.810> decent<00:01:49.140> amount<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.530> sunlight

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
light or a decent amount of sunlight

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.230 
light or a decent amount of sunlight
within<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.220> couple<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.520> hours<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.030> will

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
within a couple of hours this will

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.840 
within a couple of hours this will
charge<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.159> will<00:01:53.250> give<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.549> ten

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
charge up so that it will give you ten

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.810 
charge up so that it will give you ten
hours<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.299> very<00:01:54.869> bright<00:01:55.470> light<00:01:55.799> very<00:01:56.549> bright

hours of very bright light very bright
in<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.000> case<00:01:57.240> meaning<00:01:57.509> about<00:01:58.310> 30-40<00:01:59.310> lumens

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
in this case meaning about 30-40 lumens

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.850 
in this case meaning about 30-40 lumens
depending<00:02:00.149> upon<00:02:00.240> how<00:02:00.570> well<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.290> charged<00:02:01.680> in

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
a number of other factors it works

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.469 
a number of other factors it works
extremely<00:02:04.920> well<00:02:05.159> it's<00:02:05.520> very<00:02:05.820> bright<00:02:06.240> light

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479

to<00:03:59.700> get<00:03:59.819> 90<00:04:00.209> percent<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.810> amount<00:04:00.989> of<00:04:01.109> light

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
to get 90 percent of the amount of light

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.020 
to get 90 percent of the amount of light
out<00:04:01.440> of<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:01.859> what<00:04:02.069> is<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.310> nine<00:04:02.489> times<00:04:02.790> for

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
out of that so what is it nine times for

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.960 
out of that so what is it nine times for
me<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.510> do<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.720> math<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:04.079> lot<00:04:04.859> of<00:04:05.040> light<00:04:05.220> you

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
me you do the math a lot of light you

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.670 
me you do the math a lot of light you
can<00:04:06.150> beat<00:04:06.389> the<00:04:06.569> heck<00:04:06.750> out<00:04:06.930> of<00:04:06.959> this<00:04:07.139> as<00:04:07.440> you<00:04:07.530> can

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
can beat the heck out of this as you can

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.650 
can beat the heck out of this as you can
see<00:04:07.829> I'm<00:04:08.099> pounding<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:08.819> on<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.090> table<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.510> I'm

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.599 
is waterproof I've thrown it in the pool
I've<00:04:16.169> dunked<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.560> underwater<00:04:16.979> it<00:04:17.340> works

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
I've dunked it underwater it works

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.569 
I've dunked it underwater it works
underwater<00:04:17.970> they<00:04:18.959> don't<00:04:19.560> claim<00:04:19.829> necessarily

that it's you know good down to ten feet
or<00:04:23.760> whatever<00:04:23.909> but<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:24.330> does<00:04:24.630> float<00:04:25.409> and<00:04:25.740> it

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
or whatever but it does float and it

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.999 
or whatever but it does float and it
work<00:04:27.360> just<00:04:27.389> fine<00:04:27.870> in<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.139> rain<00:04:28.379> even<00:04:28.680> after

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
work just fine in the rain even after

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.550 
work just fine in the rain even after
you<00:04:29.099> beat<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.550> up<00:04:29.699> like<00:04:29.940> this<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.389> it<00:04:31.289> just

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
you beat it up like this and it just

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.309 
you beat it up like this and it just
keeps<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.979> lickin<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.370> keeps<00:04:33.030> on<00:04:33.180> tickin<00:04:33.659> to

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
has gone wrong it goes without saying of

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.570 
has gone wrong it goes without saying of
course<00:05:24.719> that<00:05:25.050> that's<00:05:25.229> an<00:05:25.379> LED<00:05:25.860> flashlight<00:05:26.219> if

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
course that that's an LED flashlight if

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.520 
course that that's an LED flashlight if
I<00:05:26.669> haven't<00:05:26.849> mentioned<00:05:27.090> that<00:05:27.330> before<00:05:27.509> so<00:05:28.319> this

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
I haven't mentioned that before so this

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.219 
I haven't mentioned that before so this
has<00:05:28.650> got<00:05:28.740> about<00:05:28.860> a<00:05:28.979> duty<00:05:29.310> cycle<00:05:29.460> of<00:05:30.229> 10,000

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
has got about a duty cycle of 10,000

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:32.390 
has got about a duty cycle of 10,000
hours<00:05:31.319> which<00:05:31.710> means<00:05:31.740> you<00:05:32.069> could<00:05:32.159> probably

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
hours which means you could probably

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.860 
hours which means you could probably
leave<00:05:33.180> this<00:05:33.419> on<00:05:33.690> for<00:05:33.990> like<00:05:34.789> several<00:05:35.789> years<00:05:36.509> at

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
leave this on for like several years at

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.649 
leave this on for like several years at
a<00:05:36.930> time<00:05:37.259> if<00:05:37.560> you<00:05:37.620> had<00:05:37.919> the<00:05:38.819> opportunity<00:05:39.060> to<00:05:39.509> do

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
a time if you had the opportunity to do

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.990 
a time if you had the opportunity to do
so<00:05:39.870> and<00:05:39.900> it<00:05:40.139> would<00:05:40.259> still<00:05:40.469> keep<00:05:40.710> working<00:05:41.069> the

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
so and it would still keep working the

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.459 
so and it would still keep working the
hybrid<00:05:42.330> light<00:05:42.539> I'm<00:05:42.810> going<00:05:43.020> to<00:05:43.080> add<00:05:43.229> in<00:05:43.409> the

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:43.469 
hybrid light I'm going to add in the

hybrid light I'm going to add in the
