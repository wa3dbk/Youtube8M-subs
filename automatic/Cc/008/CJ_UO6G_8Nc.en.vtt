00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.069
 hello tankers with you 40 tons and i want 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.380
 share with you another 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.130
 wonderful thing I managed 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.860
 find out 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.929
 it certainly was hard and happened in 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.750
 more randomly but possessing 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.830
 certain acquaintances I learned one 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.570
 a feature that is sewn into the game but 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.670
 practically no one they know and only 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.700
 communicating closely with game developers 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.650
 You can find out about this: but 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.890
 as you know, any game when done 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.900
 then they are trying to her wildebeest always 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.150
 well what lay there cheats or even 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.980
 something similar which will give 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.610
 advantages if desired over others 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.640
 by the players 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.950
 but in the game world of tanks practically 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.850
 there is no such thing and here's a feature for you 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.730
 I managed to find out if you are 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.120
 put on the Soviet equipment one 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:59.050
 special with special crew member 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.030
 namely it should be a radio operator that is 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.030
 with other crew members this is not 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.130
 work it must be a radio operator not in 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.320
 In this case, I have a crew here. 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.170
 commander combine 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.370
 the function is also a radio operator 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:19.030
 just take it and name it 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.030
 vasily hares everyone knows how someone 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.650
 don't know there is such a movie about war about 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.200
 great patriotic 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.250
 where basil hares was a very sniper 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.740
 good sniper 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.320
 the film is called the enemy at the gate if i 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.940
 does not change memory so here if someone 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.190
 I do not know how to do it 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.460
 click on any member of the crew 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.310
 personal business open the documents tab 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.080
 and here you can look through 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.240
 and choose firstly you can choose 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.260
 photo before the icon will look like 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.390
 this crew member 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.070
 secondly you can choose last names 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.619
 You can choose 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:59.439
 and then for 50 gold you confirm and 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.390
 the photo is changing and the name is not 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.549
 what skills will nothing be lost 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.670
 never be afraid that is your whole experience 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:10.389
 which you have earned everything will remain so 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.240
 that's when you get in the crew 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:17.890
 radio operator named Vasily hares 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.560
 then your tank gets certain 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.230
 abilities well in general to start 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.030
 act in randomness rule which 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.580
 gives you an edge over all players 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.330
 now let's jump into battle I'll tell you 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.020
 more 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.390
 and so here we are in battle and I want to immediately 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.390
 explain what will happen when you 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.300
 all done as I explained to you then in 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.880
 randomly you will be distributed 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.620
 rules of your frag i mean around 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.320
 there may be many allies 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.110
 they can damage enemies there how much 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.200
 anything but that will happen 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.930
 way that the frags get to you then 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.640
 is there if the enemy tank has two 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.650
 thousands of lives you can beat beat and 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.930
 finish up to 100 x n but after that to him 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.030
 will hit the caterpillar into the trunk 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.170
 and it will ricochets but when 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.140
 shoot you 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.600
 then you kill him and now look 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.200
 as it happens I will even slow down 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.310
 so that you would see better 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.820
 leave 1390 we start here a little bit 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.940
 slowed down I shoot please immediately 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.800
 I kill it a beautiful figure flew here 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.690
 that is, nobody killed him I killed but this 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.700
 it is not yet clear indicator on 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.040
 look further as will be here 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.280
 kill butchery inspect him kill 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.800
 kill shoot shoot and you see 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.710
 that is, he was left here ask 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.990
 notice he had 256 left to 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.320
 he wasn't shot down anyway 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.840
 now he has 17 and then I 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.620
 took this frag ie normal here 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.250
 2 already I am recharging 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.250
 from 7 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.260
 and again he is like a padar that is art 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.090
 can work on it and our allies 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.030
 all work on it work work 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.420
 so i'm distracted by the t-50 2 here look 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.480
 small t 52 hard to get but drive 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.640
 this rule is like a projectile too 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.980
 but accuracy is three times more 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.380
 that is, incomplete information can 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.510
 shoot anyway much more often you 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.150
 will get it already checked one hundred percent 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.080
 and here look the seven that is it there 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.620
 Damash Damash Damash and here I shoot 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.300
 take a look 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.740
 and that's it so vanshot just ammo well 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.389
 so you understood that is 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.690
 there is no further to repeat 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:40.930
 meaning the main thing here is look at 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.639
 teams 4 frags are four fraga my 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.800
 there are no matter how many enemies they damage 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.190
 I wish I didnâ€™t drive, I just shoot 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.820
 frags are my only thing i have to 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.850
 to tell 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.490
 if you really like just one enemy 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.620
 there up surrounded a lot of people and but they 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.470
 just can't all miss out there with 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.650
 distances of 100 or 50 meters all over it 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.660
 shoot the same yes he dies that is 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.400
 this frag won't be there in two compiled 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.400
 there in any case even though you are through 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.020
 the card will go but when you are actively 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.600
 participate in the fighting then 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.820
 advantage leans very strongly on 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.680
 your side and here if you are active 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.620
 work then all enemies will be yours 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.580
 I hope advice helped you with you was 40 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.580
 tons of luck
