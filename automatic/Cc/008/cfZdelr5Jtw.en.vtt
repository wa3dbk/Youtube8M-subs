00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
kill and what has happened is that the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.700 
kill and what has happened is that the

somewhere around so it helps us find

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.270 
somewhere around so it helps us find
where<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> cutoff<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.080> between<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> bed<00:01:43.800> and<00:01:44.190> a

the fourth threat is habitat loss we

just<00:05:33.360> because<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:33.990> fact<00:05:34.140> that<00:05:34.260> they're<00:05:34.500> on

our<00:05:34.650> money<00:05:35.040> they're<00:05:35.850> good<00:05:36.750> indicators<00:05:37.230> for<00:05:37.350> an
