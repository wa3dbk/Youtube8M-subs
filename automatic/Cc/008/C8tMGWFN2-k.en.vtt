00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.919
 want discount to enter college 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:09.200
 access point 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.900
 Hello, welcome to the picture today. Come on. 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.060
 talk about the body jacket and 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.960
 reptile skeleton you've already repaired 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.590
 as is the skin of reptiles good in that 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.170
 class 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.800
 We'll see this and I'll use it. 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:28.220
 here is a snake as it is always the skin of 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.360
 snakes and reptiles in general is very dry 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.090
 and it is all covered by scales and this 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.210
 skin is waterproof 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.149
 but because it is waterproof good 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.110
 the most superficial cells here 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:48.170
 epidermis are rich in a protein that is 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.870
 called keratin and what then 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:56.329
 keratin is a protein that 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.059
 waterproof the skin of reptiles and which 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.480
 What is the importance of all this skin? 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.869
 and has to go to the tub confers a protection 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.079
 against dehydration against loss of 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.389
 water and this protection against 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:14.389
 Dehydration is one important 

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:16.639
 adaptation to terrestrial environments 

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:19.299
 remembering that reptiles are the 

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:22.429
 first animals to conquer 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.649
 definitely a terrestrial environment and 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:27.709
 presence of this skin covered with 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:31.630
 keratin was very important for this 

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:33.409
 in addition this tag has high capacity 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.049
 regenerative 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.289
 for example snakes can change 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.319
 of skin several times a year 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.299
 only a lot of attention the coating 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:47.869
 body may vary according to the 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:51.770
 order of the reptiles eg the snake 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:54.289
 section of the sco order to present the woods 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.169
 body lined with scales 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.989
 already alligators and crocodiles that are 

00:01:57.169 --> 00:02:03.979
 order crocodile feature the body 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:07.930
 and chelonians that 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:12.050
 are turtle turtles and turtles 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.900
 have a shell and these plates and 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.110
 the shell 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.470
 they are also keratin, yes they are 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.689
 are also constituted by keratin and 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.299
 here is an important detail many 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:27.239
 people value advisors who are 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.110
 made from the skin of reptiles by 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.829
 example 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.450
 bags and this ends up provoking 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.760
 hunting of these animals 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.579
 many times man hunts snakes 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.500
 alligators just for skin removal 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.340
 these animals and this may end 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.739
 causing the extinction of many species 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.200
 and now to end let's talk about the 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.659
 the skeleton of reptiles like this 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.090
 structure then already draws a sketch 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.909
 an alligator and let's see what the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.900
 skeleton as we have already seen in the 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.560
 amphibians 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:05.069
 here there is an axial skeleton which is 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.849
 composed of the bones of the skull that are 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:12.689
 here represented but the column 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:16.699
 vertebral with all the vegetables then 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:20.910
 skull but spine form skeleton 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:24.449
 axial as we have already seen in class 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:28.019
 of amphibians and I have already said that reptiles 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:31.159
 are tetrapods, taking snakes that do not 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:34.530
 all other reptiles have legs 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:38.340
 have four legs and on these legs 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.909
 we found the appendicular skeleton 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:46.019
 and the appendicular skeleton of the reptiles is 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:48.290
 also formed by the shoulder girdle and 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.409
 plus all bones of the limbs 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.329
 that are already here 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:57.349
 represented and also by the waist 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:01.169
 but the bones of the limbs 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:03.329
 and you can see all 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.639
 these others in our lesson on 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.010
 skeleton of a son 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:11.510
 so this skeleton from here that goes 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.359
 compose the appendices is called 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.889
 appendicular skeleton and here is a 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:21.810
 interesting thing 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:25.560
 that the reptiles' feet are on the 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.710
 same body year because of this 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.199
 positioning 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.490
 tata if reptiles are animals 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:37.060
 creep the very name reptile 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.380
 means the one who crawls and 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.840
 close this class 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.509
 I just want to talk here about the skeleton of 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.759
 two orders of order that the student and 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:48.250
 order exclaimed conquer these 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:51.039
 skeletons good as I already told 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.949
 the chelonians have a face make 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:57.190
 This face passes consists of 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:05:00.220
 keratin and also by several bones that 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.280
 are merged into it for example the 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.590
 bones of the rib and it is precisely because 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.680
 cause of this merger of others 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.710
 impossible to remove the carapace from a 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.660
 kilometer without killing it and it 's interesting 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.180
 What does that face grow? 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.580
 accompanying the growth of the body of the 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.580
 animal and many cases when it is 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.400
 damaged when the animal is injured or 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.880
 attacked by man for example this face 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.099
 can regenerate and now you 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.289
 Can you imagine why this face 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.750
 passing is important to the animal 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:37.539
 first it is very resistant and 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.330
 protection for these animals 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:43.570
 in addition, several that far 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.969
 hide the head and paws inside the 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.520
 carapace and how they are not very 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:50.560
 fast this strategy of hiding 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.509
 inside the shell is a great 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.030
 defense strategy 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:57.310
 and to close let's talk here about the 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.099
 representatives of the order and with the 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:04.060
 it's the snakes in these animals we 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:07.539
 we found only the axial skeleton that 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:11.139
 is composed of the skull and also the 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:14.440
 spinal leave this column 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:17.500
 several vertebrae then repair personnel 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.650
 in this case there is no skeleton 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.400
 appendicular in this group of non-reptilian 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:27.340
 Locomotive limbs are found 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.979
 Good, that's it, we finished here. I hope. 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.780
 Have you understood in the next class? 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:36.449
 Let's talk about other systems 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.449
 physiologically I'll wait for you there more
