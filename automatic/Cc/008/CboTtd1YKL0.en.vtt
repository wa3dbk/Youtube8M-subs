because you could be going up or down if

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.960

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
results you don't know you know does

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.500 
results you don't know you know does
that<00:03:14.370> make<00:03:14.550> sense<00:03:14.580> that's<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.120> like<00:03:15.270> say<00:03:15.480> oh

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
that make sense that's just like say oh

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.510 
that make sense that's just like say oh
I'm<00:03:15.870> high<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.710> I<00:03:16.830> earned<00:03:17.040> it's<00:03:17.160> like<00:03:17.280> great

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
I'm high and I earned it's like great

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.060 
I'm high and I earned it's like great
but<00:03:17.730> we're<00:03:18.420> low<00:03:18.600> before<00:03:18.990> were<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:19.230> higher<00:03:19.470> so

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
but we're low before were you higher so

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.650 
but we're low before were you higher so
you<00:03:20.550> could<00:03:20.700> be<00:03:20.760> going<00:03:20.880> down<00:03:21.000> can<00:03:21.330> be<00:03:21.420> going<00:03:21.570> up

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
you could be going down can be going up

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.380 
you could be going down can be going up
could<00:03:21.870> be<00:03:21.960> staying<00:03:22.170> stationary<00:03:23.270> just<00:03:24.270> like

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
could be staying stationary just like

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.619 
could be staying stationary just like
traffic<00:03:24.600> lights<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.080> know

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.809 

so<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:28.230> makes<00:03:28.439> sense<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.340> don't<00:03:29.519> need<00:03:29.609> blood

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
so that makes sense you don't need blood

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.539 
so that makes sense you don't need blood

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.170 
happens as people start to feel a bit
slower<00:05:56.230> so<00:05:57.190> that<00:05:57.220> they<00:05:57.460> all<00:05:57.610> need<00:05:57.790> to<00:05:57.880> train

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
slower so that they all need to train

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.420 
slower so that they all need to train
more<00:05:58.390> I<00:05:58.630> need<00:05:58.840> to<00:05:58.900> train<00:05:59.140> harder<00:05:59.560> I'm<00:06:00.190> not

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
more I need to train harder I'm not

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.550 
more I need to train harder I'm not
training<00:06:00.700> hard<00:06:00.910> enough<00:06:01.060> I'm<00:06:01.630> gonna<00:06:01.810> smash<00:06:02.320> it

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
training hard enough I'm gonna smash it

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.000 
training hard enough I'm gonna smash it
every<00:06:02.980> fucking<00:06:03.520> day<00:06:03.730> and<00:06:04.330> then<00:06:04.980> but<00:06:05.980> I

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
every fucking day and then but I

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.860 
every fucking day and then but I
actually<00:06:06.160> need<00:06:06.490> more<00:06:06.700> rest

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
actually need more rest

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.600 
actually need more rest
they<00:06:08.260> need<00:06:08.470> more<00:06:08.680> restful<00:06:09.190> water<00:06:09.430> more

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
they need more restful water more

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.790 
they need more restful water more
carbohydrates<00:06:10.360> late<00:06:11.140> they<00:06:11.320> need<00:06:11.470> any<00:06:11.680> more

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
carbohydrates late they need any more

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.020 
carbohydrates late they need any more
training<00:06:13.110> so<00:06:14.110> their<00:06:14.260> vain

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
training so their vain

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.380 
training so their vain
they<00:06:16.030> burn<00:06:16.300> out<00:06:16.740> as<00:06:17.740> long<00:06:17.950> as<00:06:18.010> they<00:06:18.070> die

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
they burn out as long as they die

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.000 
they burn out as long as they die
unfortunately<00:06:19.390> most<00:06:20.290> times<00:06:20.590> set<00:06:20.800> up<00:06:20.890> in

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
unfortunately most times set up in

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.250 
unfortunately most times set up in
hospital<00:06:21.630> so<00:06:22.630> I'm<00:06:22.690> just<00:06:22.840> think<00:06:23.020> glandular

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
hospital so I'm just think glandular

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.000 
hospital so I'm just think glandular
fever<00:06:23.500> or<00:06:24.070> plenty<00:06:24.280> fatigue<00:06:24.640> or<00:06:25.620> epsilon<00:06:26.620> bar<00:06:26.800> I

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
fever or plenty fatigue or epsilon bar I

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.240 
fever or plenty fatigue or epsilon bar I
really<00:06:27.400> want<00:06:27.610> to<00:06:27.670> call<00:06:27.790> it<00:06:28.680> then<00:06:29.680> so<00:06:30.100> yeah

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
really want to call it then so yeah

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.610 
really want to call it then so yeah
we're<00:06:30.610> doing<00:06:30.670> blood<00:06:30.880> tests<00:06:31.210> you<00:06:31.330> can<00:06:31.590> get<00:06:32.590> a

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
we're doing blood tests you can get a

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.860 
we're doing blood tests you can get a
forecast<00:06:32.980> what's<00:06:33.340> going<00:06:33.460> to<00:06:33.490> happen<00:06:33.870> if

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
forecast what's going to happen if

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.000

you're<00:06:35.050> savvy<00:06:35.850> so<00:06:36.850> always<00:06:37.030> even<00:06:37.600> down<00:06:38.010> skip

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
you're savvy so always even down skip

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.540 
you're savvy so always even down skip
training<00:06:39.310> or<00:06:39.700> train<00:06:39.970> really<00:06:40.180> easy<00:06:40.980> and<00:06:41.980> take<00:06:42.520> a

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
training or train really easy and take a

training or train really easy and take a
month<00:06:42.820> off<00:06:43.000> if<00:06:43.510> you<00:06:43.630> have<00:06:43.720> to<00:06:44.760> it's<00:06:45.760> better<00:06:45.940> to

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
month off if you have to it's better to

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.050 
month off if you have to it's better to
be<00:06:46.120> strong<00:06:46.450> through<00:06:47.250> the<00:06:48.250> super<00:06:48.550> strong<00:06:48.790> for<00:06:49.000> a

month and then burning out for six

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.540 
month and then burning out for six
months<00:06:51.960> don't<00:06:52.960> make<00:06:53.050> sense<00:06:53.340> learn<00:06:54.340> how<00:06:54.520> to

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
months don't make sense learn how to

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.670 
months don't make sense learn how to
train<00:06:54.850> smarter<00:06:55.300> not<00:06:55.419> harder

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
train smarter not harder
