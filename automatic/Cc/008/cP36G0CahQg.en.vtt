00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.890 
problem that I have with this iPod is
that<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.490> does<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.210> new<00:01:18.450> connection

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
that it does have this new connection

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.560 
that it does have this new connection
and<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.280> little<00:01:20.460> little<00:01:21.299> tiny

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and see it's just a little little tiny

and see it's just a little little tiny
one<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.530> problem<00:01:22.920> with<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:24.479> I

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
one and the problem with that is if I

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.190 
one and the problem with that is if I
take<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.960> out<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:29.090> that<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
take this out you can see that on the

take this out you can see that on the
bottom<00:01:31.530> here<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.189> two<00:01:32.460> connections<00:01:32.729> one

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
to plug into and what this does is it

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
to plug into and what this does is it
allows<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.119> plug<00:01:39.240> into<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.630> computer
