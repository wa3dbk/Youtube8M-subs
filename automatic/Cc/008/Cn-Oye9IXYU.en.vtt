with<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.219> Stars<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.610> everything<00:00:57.059> don't<00:00:57.930> know

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
with the Stars and everything don't know

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.200 
with the Stars and everything don't know
if<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.140> real<00:00:58.289> or<00:00:58.410> not<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.910> looks<00:01:00.149> pretty

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210

full art that he made you have these I

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.340 
full art that he made you have these I
think<00:01:52.649> that's<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.860> bear<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.570> instead<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.689> an<00:01:55.110> ox

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
think that's a bear and instead of an ox

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.580 
think that's a bear and instead of an ox
or<00:01:55.680> some<00:01:56.280> sort<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.549> more<00:01:56.969> maybe<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
or some sort of more maybe in the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.050 
or some sort of more maybe in the
background<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.430> Garrick<00:01:59.759> he<00:01:59.939> is

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
background and you have Garrick he is

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.910 
background and you have Garrick he is
this<00:02:00.270> focus<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.960> image<00:02:01.229> he's<00:02:01.439> centered

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
this focus of the image he's centered

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.060 
this focus of the image he's centered
but<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.360> know<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:03.990> look<00:02:04.500> at<00:02:04.680> Magic<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
but you know if you look at Magic the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.429 
but you know if you look at Magic the
Gathering<00:02:05.100> cards<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:06.149> art<00:02:06.390> center<00:02:07.020> it's

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
Gathering cards the art center it's

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.109 
Gathering cards the art center it's
actually<00:02:07.829> kind<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.039> limiting<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.580> border

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
actually kind of limiting the border

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.509 
actually kind of limiting the border
frame<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.629> since<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.409> must<00:02:10.739> focus<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.370> on<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
frame and since it must focus in on the

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.250 
frame and since it must focus in on the
planeswalker<00:02:12.060> dramatically<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.049> that<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
planeswalker dramatically so that the

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.350 
planeswalker dramatically so that the
planeswalker<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.920> only<00:02:14.269> element<00:02:15.269> that

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
planeswalker is the only element that

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.530 
planeswalker is the only element that
really<00:02:15.750> sticks<00:02:16.049> out<00:02:16.230> they<00:02:16.860> cut<00:02:17.400> most<00:02:17.909> of<00:02:18.239> the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
really sticks out they cut most of the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.130 
really sticks out they cut most of the
picture<00:02:19.409> frame<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:21.150> original<00:02:21.750> artwork<00:02:22.019> i

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
picture frame and the original artwork i

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.509 
picture frame and the original artwork i
think<00:02:22.319> is<00:02:22.409> absolutely<00:02:22.560> fabulous<00:02:23.040> it's

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
think is absolutely fabulous it's

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.839 
think is absolutely fabulous it's
definitely<00:02:23.909> a<00:02:23.970> lot<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:25.530> lot<00:02:26.370> more<00:02:26.579> interesting

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
definitely a lot a lot more interesting

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.880 
definitely a lot a lot more interesting
and<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.390> doesn't<00:02:27.659> make<00:02:27.780> them<00:02:27.900> feel<00:02:28.140> more<00:02:28.349> in

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
and it doesn't make them feel more in

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.800 
and it doesn't make them feel more in
nature<00:02:29.370> based<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.790> at<00:02:29.909> home<00:02:30.090> here<00:02:30.450> he's<00:02:30.599> kind

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
nature based in at home here he's kind

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.930 
nature based in at home here he's kind
of<00:02:30.870> just<00:02:31.049> he's<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:32.040> know<00:02:32.099> we're<00:02:32.459> kind<00:02:32.879> of

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
of just he's you know we're kind of

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.509 
of just he's you know we're kind of
weird<00:02:33.180> pose<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.709> never<00:02:34.769> was<00:02:35.129> thrown<00:02:35.400> with

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
weird pose and I never was thrown with

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.569 
weird pose and I never was thrown with
the<00:02:35.549> garrick<00:02:35.879> laura<00:02:36.180> b<00:02:36.329> start<00:02:36.599> work<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:37.579> they

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
the garrick laura b start work but they

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.819 
the garrick laura b start work but they
see<00:02:38.640> even<00:02:39.090> more<00:02:39.299> just<00:02:39.750> how<00:02:39.989> much<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.650> art

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
see even more just how much the art

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.240 
see even more just how much the art
loses<00:02:41.459> by<00:02:42.209> being<00:02:42.480> removed<00:02:42.870> from<00:02:43.049> its<00:02:43.739> setting

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
loses by being removed from its setting

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.559 
loses by being removed from its setting
that<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.579> original<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.329> artist

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
that the original that the artist

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.110 
that the original that the artist
designed<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.680> for<00:02:46.709> why<00:02:47.579> is<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.819> kind<00:02:48.030> of

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
designed it for why is this kind of

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.119 
designed it for why is this kind of
important<00:02:48.510> well<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.720> was<00:02:48.930> generally<00:02:49.799> thinking

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
important well I was generally thinking

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.710 
important well I was generally thinking
about<00:02:50.310> what<00:02:50.489> what<00:02:50.640> other<00:02:50.849> planeswalkers<00:02:51.239> do

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
about what what other planeswalkers do

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.780 
about what what other planeswalkers do
do<00:02:52.290> they<00:02:52.440> have<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.859> today<00:02:53.069> ever<00:02:53.370> have<00:02:53.609> this

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
do they have that today ever have this

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.030 
do they have that today ever have this
problem<00:02:54.120> with<00:02:55.049> other<00:02:55.260> planeswalkers<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.010> i

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
problem with other planeswalkers so i

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.740 
problem with other planeswalkers so i
couldn't<00:02:56.519> find<00:02:56.670> every<00:02:57.060> single<00:02:57.329> planeswalker

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
couldn't find every single planeswalker

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.720 
couldn't find every single planeswalker
a<00:02:57.900> full<00:02:58.170> art<00:02:58.349> image<00:02:58.680> but<00:02:59.250> let's<00:02:59.430> just<00:02:59.579> run

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
a full art image but let's just run

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.580 
a full art image but let's just run
through<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.970> couple<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.329> found<00:03:00.569> so<00:03:00.810> this<00:03:01.049> is<00:03:01.230> the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
through a couple I found so this is the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.490 
through a couple I found so this is the
full<00:03:01.890> art<00:03:02.069> Sauron<00:03:02.549> image<00:03:03.079> designed<00:03:04.079> again<00:03:04.349> to

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
full art Sauron image designed again to

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.410 
full art Sauron image designed again to
focus<00:03:04.769> on<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.980> planeswalker<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:05.730> here<00:03:06.030> the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
focus on the planeswalker but here the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.449 
focus on the planeswalker but here the
background<00:03:06.840> isn't<00:03:07.019> exactly<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:07.680> important

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
background isn't exactly that important

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.610 
background isn't exactly that important
if<00:03:08.579> you<00:03:08.640> look<00:03:08.790> at<00:03:08.909> the<00:03:09.000> actual<00:03:09.209> art<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:10.409> art

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
if you look at the actual art the art

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.870 
if you look at the actual art the art
takes<00:03:11.099> about<00:03:11.750> here<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:13.500> little<00:03:13.859> square<00:03:14.609> area

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
takes about here this little square area

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.020 
takes about here this little square area
which<00:03:15.630> doesn't<00:03:15.989> really<00:03:16.130> lose<00:03:17.130> much<00:03:17.459> because

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
which doesn't really lose much because

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.759 
which doesn't really lose much because
the<00:03:18.120> background<00:03:18.299> is<00:03:18.599> already<00:03:18.810> shaded<00:03:19.440> in<00:03:19.500> gray

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
the background is already shaded in gray

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.039 
the background is already shaded in gray
the<00:03:20.099> focus<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.519> obviously<00:03:21.090> just<00:03:21.180> on<00:03:21.599> soarin

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
the focus is obviously just on soarin

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.599 
the focus is obviously just on soarin
and<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.829> works<00:03:23.660> same<00:03:24.660> thing<00:03:24.840> with<00:03:24.930> Tybalt<00:03:25.609> yeah

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
and it works same thing with Tybalt yeah

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.369 
and it works same thing with Tybalt yeah
you<00:03:27.000> could<00:03:27.239> have<00:03:27.389> this<00:03:27.510> lava<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.109> everything

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
you could have this lava and everything

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.199 
you could have this lava and everything
but<00:03:28.470> this<00:03:28.590> really<00:03:28.799> it's<00:03:29.099> really<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.549> crag<00:03:29.910> and

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
but this really it's really the crag and

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.199 
but this really it's really the crag and
his<00:03:30.900> fire<00:03:31.230> flame<00:03:31.919> from<00:03:32.129> his<00:03:32.250> hand<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.790> those

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
his fire flame from his hand and those

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.809 
his fire flame from his hand and those
are<00:03:33.359> in<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.629> frame<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:34.819> planeswalker

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
are in the frame of the planeswalker

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.490 
are in the frame of the planeswalker
they<00:03:35.970> kind<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.239> cut<00:03:36.480> out<00:03:36.599> the<00:03:36.750> volcanic<00:03:37.049> River

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
they kind of cut out the volcanic River

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.309 
they kind of cut out the volcanic River
which<00:03:38.340> doesn't<00:03:38.790> hurt<00:03:39.120> so<00:03:39.599> much<00:03:39.750> again<00:03:40.019> because

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
which doesn't hurt so much again because

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.069 
which doesn't hurt so much again because
the<00:03:40.560> focus<00:03:40.739> is<00:03:40.980> so<00:03:41.129> much<00:03:41.280> on<00:03:41.489> him<00:03:41.910> he's<00:03:42.810> kind<00:03:43.049> of

the focus is so much on him he's kind of

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.839 
the focus is so much on him he's kind of

the only important aspect of the image
everything<00:03:45.180> else<00:03:45.299> is<00:03:45.449> just<00:03:45.480> general

art of the card anyone I notice it but

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.000 
art of the card anyone I notice it but
then<00:04:27.910> again<00:04:28.030> it's<00:04:28.300> so<00:04:28.570> out<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:29.020> you<00:04:29.740> know<00:04:29.830> it's

then again it's so out of you know it's
so<00:04:31.320> clear<00:04:32.320> that<00:04:32.650> you<00:04:32.740> don't<00:04:32.800> really<00:04:33.070> see<00:04:33.400> it

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
so clear that you don't really see it

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.120 
so clear that you don't really see it
the<00:04:34.150> focus<00:04:34.420> is<00:04:34.630> obviously<00:04:35.230> just<00:04:35.350> on<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:35.950> plan

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
the focus is obviously just on the plan

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.610 
the focus is obviously just on the plan
to<00:04:36.280> walk<00:04:36.430> around<00:04:36.580> not<00:04:36.790> much<00:04:36.970> else<00:04:37.350> but<00:04:38.350> look<00:04:38.500> at

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
to walk around not much else but look at

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.520 
to walk around not much else but look at
the<00:04:38.710> garrick<00:04:39.100> it<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.720> garrick<00:04:41.080> here<00:04:41.110> he

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
the garrick it the the garrick here he

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.560 
the garrick it the the garrick here he
really<00:04:41.830> is<00:04:41.950> part<00:04:42.280> of<00:04:42.460> this<00:04:42.640> image<00:04:43.000> he's<00:04:43.210> part

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
really is part of this image he's part

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.260 
really is part of this image he's part
of<00:04:43.720> this<00:04:43.960> background<00:04:44.200> frame<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:45.150> when<00:04:46.150> you

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
of this background frame and when you

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.200 
of this background frame and when you
slice<00:04:46.630> him<00:04:46.960> on<00:04:47.140> his<00:04:47.320> own<00:04:47.620> he<00:04:48.430> does<00:04:48.730> there<00:04:49.030> is

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
slice him on his own he does there is

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.770 
slice him on his own he does there is
something<00:04:49.600> lost<00:04:49.870> I<00:04:50.200> think<00:04:50.500> in<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:51.880> frame<00:04:52.450> it

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
something lost I think in the frame it

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.600 
something lost I think in the frame it
makes<00:04:52.990> him<00:04:53.140> feel<00:04:53.380> very<00:04:53.680> out<00:04:53.770> of<00:04:53.890> place<00:04:54.160> because

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
makes him feel very out of place because

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.730 
makes him feel very out of place because
you<00:04:54.700> don't<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.540> see<00:04:55.750> here<00:04:55.960> he's<00:04:56.140> facing<00:04:56.440> this

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
way but you don't really see if you're

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.200

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
sorry you don't really see this sort of

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.450 
sorry you don't really see this sort of
scale<00:05:01.630> of<00:05:01.870> how<00:05:02.020> of<00:05:02.320> what<00:05:02.500> he's<00:05:02.650> looking<00:05:02.860> at<00:05:03.190> his

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
scale of how of what he's looking at his

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.180 
scale of how of what he's looking at his
hands<00:05:04.240> kind<00:05:04.480> of<00:05:04.570> just<00:05:04.720> caught<00:05:05.380> meaning<00:05:06.100> they

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
hands kind of just caught meaning they

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.920 
hands kind of just caught meaning they
kind<00:05:06.430> of<00:05:06.460> just<00:05:06.520> did<00:05:06.940> they<00:05:07.090> had<00:05:07.210> to<00:05:07.330> force<00:05:07.720> it

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
kind of just did they had to force it

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.470 
kind of just did they had to force it
instead<00:05:08.530> of<00:05:08.590> including<00:05:09.160> this<00:05:09.490> you<00:05:10.180> know<00:05:10.300> the

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
instead of including this you know the

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.760 
instead of including this you know the
tree<00:05:10.720> they<00:05:10.870> couldn't<00:05:11.170> do<00:05:11.290> that<00:05:11.320> because<00:05:11.530> you

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
tree they couldn't do that because you

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.370 
tree they couldn't do that because you
have<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.400> bear<00:05:12.610> involved<00:05:13.150> and<00:05:13.270> it<00:05:13.780> would<00:05:13.990> be

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
have the bear involved and it would be

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.380 
have the bear involved and it would be
jarring<00:05:15.070> so<00:05:15.400> it<00:05:15.490> said<00:05:15.640> they<00:05:15.760> sliced<00:05:16.060> it<00:05:16.240> right

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
jarring so it said they sliced it right

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.630 
jarring so it said they sliced it right
at<00:05:16.510> the<00:05:16.660> hand<00:05:16.930> which<00:05:17.620> makes<00:05:17.890> it<00:05:18.040> kind<00:05:18.520> of

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
at the hand which makes it kind of

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.730 
at the hand which makes it kind of
awkward<00:05:19.090> because<00:05:19.270> he's<00:05:20.110> gripping<00:05:20.410> but<00:05:20.650> they

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
awkward because he's gripping but they

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.290 
awkward because he's gripping but they
kind<00:05:20.950> of<00:05:20.980> they<00:05:21.040> cut<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.550> tree<00:05:21.850> that<00:05:22.030> he's

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
kind of they cut the tree that he's

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.050 
kind of they cut the tree that he's
gripping<00:05:23.170> which<00:05:24.070> just<00:05:24.310> I'm<00:05:24.460> nearly<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:24.880> same

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
gripping which just I'm nearly the same

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
gripping which just I'm nearly the same
epic<00:05:25.570> scale<00:05:25.900> they<00:05:26.380> have<00:05:26.530> here<00:05:26.860> and<00:05:28.050> yeah<00:05:29.050> I

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
epic scale they have here and yeah I

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.780 
epic scale they have here and yeah I
just<00:05:29.380> think<00:05:29.530> the<00:05:29.620> artwork<00:05:29.980> loses<00:05:30.370> a<00:05:30.400> lot<00:05:30.640> by

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
just think the artwork loses a lot by

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.210 
just think the artwork loses a lot by
slicing<00:05:31.300> so<00:05:31.510> much<00:05:31.660> of<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:31.930> artists<00:05:32.500> design<00:05:32.950> I

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
slicing so much of the artists design I

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.010 
slicing so much of the artists design I
think<00:05:33.520> they<00:05:33.790> should<00:05:33.970> have<00:05:34.060> just<00:05:34.210> you<00:05:34.990> know

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
think they should have just you know

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.860 
think they should have just you know
told<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:35.470> artist<00:05:35.800> you<00:05:35.950> know<00:05:36.450> rework<00:05:37.450> it<00:05:37.660> so

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
told the artist you know rework it so

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.690 
told the artist you know rework it so
that<00:05:38.080> you<00:05:38.320> can<00:05:38.470> have<00:05:38.560> a<00:05:38.620> similar<00:05:38.860> pose<00:05:39.250> similar

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
that you can have a similar pose similar

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.280 
that you can have a similar pose similar
whatever<00:05:39.940> but<00:05:40.180> rework<00:05:40.480> its<00:05:40.690> of<00:05:40.780> the<00:05:40.870> art<00:05:41.020> isn't

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
whatever but rework its of the art isn't

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.220 
whatever but rework its of the art isn't
this<00:05:41.620> way<00:05:41.860> but<00:05:42.550> just<00:05:42.910> quickly<00:05:43.390> cropping<00:05:44.110> in

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
this way but just quickly cropping in

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.840 
this way but just quickly cropping in
fitting<00:05:44.680> it<00:05:44.800> into<00:05:44.920> the<00:05:45.100> frame<00:05:45.370> I<00:05:45.520> think<00:05:45.730> it

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
fitting it into the frame I think it

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:46.980 
fitting it into the frame I think it
took<00:05:46.090> away<00:05:46.360> something<00:05:46.600> from<00:05:46.780> the

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
took away something from the

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.510 
took away something from the
planeswalker<00:05:47.440> that<00:05:48.070> a<00:05:48.100> lot<00:05:48.280> of<00:05:48.400> other

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
planeswalker that a lot of other

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.340 
planeswalker that a lot of other
planeswalkers<00:05:48.910> I<00:05:49.570> don't<00:05:49.900> think<00:05:50.050> had<00:05:50.200> that

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
planeswalkers I don't think had that

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.470 
planeswalkers I don't think had that
same<00:05:50.560> problem<00:05:50.590> but<00:05:51.190> really<00:05:52.000> what<00:05:52.150> do<00:05:52.210> you<00:05:52.330> guys

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
same problem but really what do you guys

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.170 
same problem but really what do you guys
think<00:05:52.540> about<00:05:52.930> this<00:05:53.440> maybe<00:05:54.430> you<00:05:54.580> can<00:05:54.670> find<00:05:54.970> more

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
think about this maybe you can find more

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.480 
think about this maybe you can find more
art<00:05:55.420> works<00:05:55.660> of<00:05:55.960> other<00:05:56.410> planeswalkers<00:05:56.830> and<00:05:57.310> see

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
art works of other planeswalkers and see

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.370 
art works of other planeswalkers and see
if<00:05:57.580> it<00:05:57.730> it's<00:05:58.150> generally<00:05:58.660> true<00:05:58.720> but<00:05:59.110> this<00:05:59.230> is

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
if it it's generally true but this is

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.900 
if it it's generally true but this is
feels<00:05:59.740> like<00:05:59.860> the<00:05:59.980> first<00:06:00.160> planeswalker<00:06:00.700> that

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
feels like the first planeswalker that

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.660 
feels like the first planeswalker that
really<00:06:01.210> was<00:06:01.390> awkward<00:06:01.900> for<00:06:01.930> me<00:06:02.520> let<00:06:03.520> me<00:06:03.580> know

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
really was awkward for me let me know

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.520 
really was awkward for me let me know
