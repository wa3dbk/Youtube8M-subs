00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.049 
so right now the plate is oscillating
very<00:00:40.710> very<00:00:40.920> gently<00:00:41.250> he's<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.879> basically

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
very very gently he's just basically

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.410 
very very gently he's just basically
gonna<00:00:42.600> sit<00:00:42.870> here<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.610> vibrated<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.850> 10

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
gonna sit here and be vibrated for 10

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.410 
gonna sit here and be vibrated for 10
minutes<00:00:46.160> gentle<00:00:47.160> vibration<00:00:50.000> not<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.180> bad

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
minutes gentle vibration not so bad

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.770

for<00:00:53.780> eight<00:00:53.960> weeks<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.890> turkeys<00:00:55.339> get<00:00:55.489> a<00:00:55.550> buzz

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
for eight weeks the turkeys get a buzz

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.149 
for eight weeks the turkeys get a buzz
for<00:00:56.269> ten<00:00:56.539> minutes<00:00:56.719> a<00:00:56.929> day<00:00:59.620> then<00:01:00.620> some<00:01:00.890> of<00:01:01.010> their

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
for ten minutes a day then some of their

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.069 
for ten minutes a day then some of their
bone<00:01:01.399> samples<00:01:01.969> are<00:01:02.120> placed<00:01:02.390> in<00:01:02.600> an<00:01:02.719> x-ray

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
bone samples are placed in an x-ray

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.570 
bone samples are placed in an x-ray
machine<00:01:03.199> to<00:01:03.800> see<00:01:03.949> if<00:01:04.100> anything<00:01:04.519> has<00:01:04.670> changed

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
machine to see if anything has changed

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.070 
machine to see if anything has changed
so<00:01:07.580> once<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:07.939> bone<00:01:08.119> is<00:01:08.330> actually<00:01:08.509> in<00:01:08.899> this

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
so once the bone is actually in this

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.310 
so once the bone is actually in this
x-ray<00:01:09.530> machine<00:01:09.950> we<00:01:10.880> take<00:01:11.149> it<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.509> take<00:01:12.080> a

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
x-ray machine we take it and take a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.410 
x-ray machine we take it and take a
number<00:01:12.680> of<00:01:12.770> salami<00:01:13.220> slices<00:01:13.909> through<00:01:14.149> it<00:01:14.240> and

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
number of salami slices through it and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.330 
number of salami slices through it and
here<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:14.869> see<00:01:15.080> in<00:01:15.200> this<00:01:15.350> shin<00:01:15.710> bone<00:01:15.950> or<00:01:16.220> in

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
here you see in this shin bone or in

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.639 
here you see in this shin bone or in
this<00:01:16.460> tibia<00:01:16.939> these<00:01:17.539> struts<00:01:18.049> that<00:01:18.380> go<00:01:18.530> across

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
this tibia these struts that go across

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.100 
this tibia these struts that go across
and<00:01:19.220> see<00:01:19.430> struts<00:01:19.909> that<00:01:20.180> actually<00:01:20.840> give<00:01:20.990> the

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
and see struts that actually give the

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.820 
and see struts that actually give the
bone<00:01:21.520> strength<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:22.759> stiffness<00:01:23.770> now<00:01:24.770> you

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
bone strength and stiffness now you

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.550 
bone strength and stiffness now you
compare<00:01:25.039> this<00:01:25.460> image<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:26.390> this<00:01:26.539> image<00:01:26.960> here

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
compare this image to this image here

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.350 
compare this image to this image here
you've<00:01:27.679> got<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.310> shin<00:01:28.580> bone<00:01:28.759> of<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.090> tibia

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
you've got the shin bone of the tibia

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.200 
you've got the shin bone of the tibia
that<00:01:30.080> was<00:01:30.200> actually<00:01:30.679> bust<00:01:31.130> vibrated<00:01:32.000> very

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
that was actually bust vibrated very

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.480 
that was actually bust vibrated very
very<00:01:32.420> gently<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.440> what's<00:01:33.619> quite<00:01:34.039> clear<00:01:34.369> is

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
very gently and what's quite clear is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.609 
very gently and what's quite clear is
there<00:01:34.670> many<00:01:35.149> more<00:01:35.450> struts<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.289> struts

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
there many more struts and the struts

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.919 
there many more struts and the struts
are<00:01:36.830> actually<00:01:37.280> quite<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:37.640> bit<00:01:37.850> thicker<00:01:38.179> so<00:01:38.840> the

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
are actually quite a bit thicker so the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.719 
are actually quite a bit thicker so the
bone<00:01:39.080> is<00:01:39.350> actually<00:01:39.500> stiffer<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:40.459> stronger

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
bone is actually stiffer and stronger

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.699 
bone is actually stiffer and stronger
this<00:01:41.119> will<00:01:41.299> be<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.450> great<00:01:41.750> structure<00:01:42.110> ISM

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
this will be a great structure ISM

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:46.330 
this will be a great structure ISM
how<00:01:43.640> great<00:01:43.970> is<00:01:44.149> this<00:01:44.390> you've<00:01:45.080> got<00:01:45.319> a<00:01:45.350> bone<00:01:45.770> that

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
how great is this you've got a bone that

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.749 
how great is this you've got a bone that
just<00:01:46.759> by<00:01:46.940> buzzing<00:01:47.420> is<00:01:47.630> better<00:01:48.440> about<00:01:48.799> but<00:01:49.580> then

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
just by buzzing is better about but then

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.309 
just by buzzing is better about but then
you<00:01:49.909> sit<00:01:50.090> there's<00:01:50.360> that<00:01:50.539> we'll<00:01:50.659> wait<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:50.869> second

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
you sit there's that we'll wait a second

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:52.960 
you sit there's that we'll wait a second
if<00:01:51.440> you're<00:01:51.590> recruiting<00:01:52.100> all<00:01:52.220> these<00:01:52.429> cells<00:01:52.729> to

there's<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.930> clue<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.950> vibrating<00:01:58.460> turkeys

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
there's a clue the vibrating turkeys

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.139 
there's a clue the vibrating turkeys
have<00:01:59.000> grown<00:01:59.240> bone<00:01:59.539> tissue<00:01:59.869> and<00:02:00.829> the<00:02:01.729> control

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
have grown bone tissue and the control

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.010 
have grown bone tissue and the control
group<00:02:02.180> has<00:02:02.600> grown<00:02:02.750> fat<00:02:04.450> how<00:02:05.450> come<00:02:05.719> the<00:02:05.869> bad

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
group has grown fat how come the bad

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.840 
group has grown fat how come the bad
turkeys<00:02:06.439> didn't<00:02:06.740> get<00:02:06.859> back

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
turkeys didn't get back

now get ready for weird connection
number<00:02:11.950> four<00:02:12.160> Flynn<00:02:12.819> came<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.120> my<00:02:13.240> office

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
number four Flynn came to my office

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.050 
number four Flynn came to my office
because<00:02:13.840> he<00:02:14.140> was<00:02:14.260> vibrating<00:02:14.680> turkeys<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.580> he

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
because he was vibrating turkeys and he

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.150 
because he was vibrating turkeys and he
noticed<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:16.660> during<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.230> experiments<00:02:18.010> that

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
noticed that during the experiments that

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.360 
noticed that during the experiments that
he<00:02:18.880> was<00:02:19.030> seeing<00:02:19.240> reduced<00:02:19.630> fat<00:02:19.870> mass<00:02:20.170> he<00:02:21.130> didn't

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
he was seeing reduced fat mass he didn't

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.880 
he was seeing reduced fat mass he didn't
understand<00:02:21.760> why<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.420> came<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.319> me<00:02:23.440> because

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
understand why and came to me because

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.850 
understand why and came to me because

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
at first I was very skeptical I didn't

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.510 
at first I was very skeptical I didn't
believe<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.770> just<00:02:29.980> assumed<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.489> was

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
believe it I just assumed it was
