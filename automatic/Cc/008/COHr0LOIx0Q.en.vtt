00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:08.870
 good now i have plant birth 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.240
 neighbors of the easy ne 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.900
 In this case, use a cat but it can be 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.539
 Relop even you can sing and ailton 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.820
 planting in the multiple phenolic ne 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:29.539
 I'm even crying crying 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:31.640
 stir to plant the seeds do not 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.559
 need to go very deep because I think the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:40.489
 phenomenon has already been cut to 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.500
 where will I put my seed that I will 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.390
 leave this box here is medically 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.230
 closed with the cover after voting and 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.050
 puts 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.100
 that germinate he has determined 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.550
 dark 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.059
 then after 23 days at most I 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.570
 I'm passing this slap same day since the 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.400
 seeds will be germinated is already all 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.900
 here in the case of the audience that other 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:12.290
 plan to keep sbt if that in reality 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.140
 is not this dynamic not to plant and I will 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.659
 place two needles in each work that 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:24.200
 must leave to be able to help and then 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.479
 three days four days I go three days 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.810
 in another country here in case I go 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.159
 save with this exchange here 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.030
 This proof that I will see from here I 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:38.810
 was planted the seed with it closed 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.810
 got and then I wait 23 days for 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.920
 to open this box to see these 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.430
 germinated seeds here I'm still 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.280
 planting I will use this if this 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:57.280
 seed in the case I said this cat but 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 can be any use of lope or 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:08.700
 and then I'll plant just that 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.099
 gave my cell machines to people like 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.660
 fenoco that time foam good when it comes 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:18.989
 in fact you still need to get water 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.850
 washing and that is where you keep germinating 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.959
 in each square since it goes after 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.750
 to put inside a cup 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.980
 disposable to put inside the 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:34.069
 pipes with the objectives salts 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.069
 in case here still tested planted 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:42.930
 placing them immediately in the box, right? 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.390
 here it's all 8080 feet 80 feet 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.780
 lettuce 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.799
 I 'll start planting my seedlings. 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:58.470
 so I can use a spoon 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:03:02.280
 small to pick the seeds at 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:06.810
 and then I'm putting 2012 every hole 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:13.140
 do not go down by putting two on each doll 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:19.470
 with dense is I pull puts 2007 and more 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:25.829
 fat and another who missed planted 2 2 a 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:28.530
 2 to 1 and so on or 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:34.530
 planting sbt is to give o ok 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:38.239
 and then they go after that same box 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.239
 they will germinate're 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.980
 ae 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:04:02.049
 hence I'm implanting it and so 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.470
 successively 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:10.360
 and so soon I will show the result 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:13.209
 of my changes and she votes 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.940
 around 16 days she is ready to 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.889
 I apply in disposable cups 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.539
 I'll show you in the procession for you. 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:25.840
 because it's bound to 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:28.030
 Hi, Ricardo. Hi, everyone. 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.150
 I'll show you how to do with 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.460
 planting lettuce seedlings in the glass 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.990
 disposable in trombone power system 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.030
 the right 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.610
 here already exists in some plants that the 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:44.320
 are already well developed 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.229
 even developed up to animals 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:51.250
 some are already more than a span of 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:55.180
 by now the seedlings are planted in the cope 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:05:01.750
 al looks at it develops within the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:04.120
 disposable cup and it gets blurred 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.360
 tried to receive the nutrients 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.889
 I'll show you how to do the 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.139
 first crops in the 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.660
 disposable nÃ© 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.380
 they receive the black river through the 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:20.080
 tubes that pass the mineral salts and then I 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.090
 I will plant justice for these women. 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.060
 I 'm here in that little box. 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.500
 she is already in the right size are already 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:35.970
 with 28 days of planting 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:38.070
 o in the phenolic foam and there I will plant 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.050
 she shows with the machete planting in the 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.200
 cups pick first non pierce the 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:50.100
 I put the glasses to the knife and I'll show 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:51.690
 You see what I'm going to get a knife and there. 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.700
 I'll have to search and cross that the 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.150
 Cup background can get out of it leaving the 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:11.960
 bottom of the cup I take the knife inside her 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:15.180
 The first cut of the C-team is there and there and there 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.400
 I'm going to plant the pictures of 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.700
 foam but with the phenom ii alloy inside 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.650
 of each copy of itself but before I should 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.800
 pull one of its waters to be able to 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.950
 make it easy to get out 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.720
 there then once I pulled it is 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.970
 open and I'm going to put one of these 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.330
 the cement in here to pick up the first 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:44.610
 seed here you stop here not to 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:47.550
 damage the iraque in the tray some 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.169
 walking changes we are going to plant 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.020
 You can see here some seedlings were 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.729
 planted 28 days in these in these prof 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.460
 which are the squares of a 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:59.540
 centimeter and I'm going to separate one from serve 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.540
 for planting in the disposable cup 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:05.960
 Hello 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.130
 I took the small square that little square 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.009
 here with this world 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.030
 he'll be right here in the background 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:13.210
 of the cup 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.210
 O 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.240
 and then the change will be stuck here with 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:33.300
 here in the bottom of the glass 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:35.370
 It will get easier but look there 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.430
 in this way that it will develop 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.710
 inside the glass and its roots overcome 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.980
 will go out to pop bass how come 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:46.430
 I used to be here, who used to be? 

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:49.350
 talking about it and I'm going to plant here 

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:51.840
 water to the non - light wind 

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:56.100
 holding the ball of the cuts on the lips 

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.570
 that same day she stays like that 

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:02.090
 tuba plant 

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:02.090
 You can see your own
