00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it's got a really weird texture where it

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.520 
it's got a really weird texture where it
feels<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.330> your<00:01:06.479> skin<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.750> peeling<00:01:07.020> off<00:01:07.290> you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
feels like your skin is peeling off you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.260

put<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.430> let<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.610> dry<00:01:08.820> cuz<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.119> dries

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
put it on and let it dry cuz it dries

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.800 
put it on and let it dry cuz it dries
super<00:01:09.659> quick<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.650> i<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:11.040> take<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.189> sponge<00:01:11.810> like

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
super quick so i just take a sponge like

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.570 
super quick so i just take a sponge like
that<00:01:13.020> put<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> tiny<00:01:13.560> bit<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.860> then<00:01:16.400> just<00:01:17.400> grab<00:01:17.549> it

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580

that put a tiny bit on then just grab it
on<00:01:17.759> your<00:01:17.939> lips

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.859 

so<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.790> redness<00:01:26.119> should<00:01:26.240> already<00:01:26.390> be<00:01:26.540> gone<00:01:26.720> by

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
so the redness should already be gone by

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.560 
so the redness should already be gone by
then<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.409> a<00:01:28.280> lot<00:01:28.460> of<00:01:28.490> people<00:01:28.640> just<00:01:29.299> leave<00:01:29.420> it

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:39.820 
then and a lot of people just leave it
like<00:01:29.600> that<00:01:37.689> but<00:01:38.689> that<00:01:39.200> comes<00:01:39.470> off<00:01:39.590> quite

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
like that but that comes off quite

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.950 
like that but that comes off quite
easily<00:01:39.950> if<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:40.399> don't<00:01:40.549> set<00:01:40.820> it<00:01:40.850> now<00:01:41.659> usually

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
because the primary except for another

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.810 
because the primary except for another
10<00:04:56.400> minutes<00:04:56.600> just<00:04:57.600> like<00:04:58.500> dab<00:05:00.200> and<00:05:01.610> then<00:05:02.610> some

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
10 minutes just like dab and then some

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.980 
10 minutes just like dab and then some
of<00:05:02.910> it<00:05:03.030> will<00:05:03.120> come<00:05:03.150> off<00:05:03.270> on<00:05:03.390> your<00:05:03.510> finger<00:05:03.840> and

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
of it will come off on your finger and

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.860 
of it will come off on your finger and
then<00:05:04.200> you<00:05:04.290> turn<00:05:04.350> a<00:05:04.500> ways<00:05:04.620> off<00:05:05.600> you<00:05:06.600> just<00:05:06.750> want

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
then you turn a ways off you just want

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.330 
then you turn a ways off you just want
to<00:05:06.900> keep<00:05:07.020> doing<00:05:07.080> it<00:05:07.380> until<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.920> white<00:05:08.070> new<00:05:08.160> sky

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
to keep doing it until the white new sky

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.650 
to keep doing it until the white new sky
goes<00:05:08.550> we're<00:05:08.760> going<00:05:08.910> to<00:05:08.970> check<00:05:09.060> in<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.270> mirror

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.170 

and<00:05:12.660> then<00:05:13.400> leave<00:05:14.400> it<00:05:14.430> you<00:05:14.610> can<00:05:14.760> also<00:05:14.910> put

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
and then leave it you can also put

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.390 
and then leave it you can also put
another<00:05:15.530> coat<00:05:16.530> so<00:05:16.710> I<00:05:16.770> got<00:05:16.920> to<00:05:16.980> my<00:05:17.040> phone<00:05:17.220> by<00:05:17.370> the

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
another coat so I got to my phone by the

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.550 
another coat so I got to my phone by the
way<00:05:17.490> put<00:05:18.030> another<00:05:18.120> coat<00:05:18.420> of<00:05:18.480> them<00:05:18.840> the<00:05:19.380> pop

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
way put another coat of them the pop

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.210 
way put another coat of them the pop
primer<00:05:19.800> on<00:05:19.950> top<00:05:21.470> which<00:05:22.470> I<00:05:22.620> think<00:05:22.800> helps<00:05:22.950> its

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
primer on top which I think helps its

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.990 
primer on top which I think helps its
take<00:05:24.050> quite<00:05:25.050> a<00:05:25.110> bit<00:05:25.170> more<00:05:25.350> today<00:05:25.530> are<00:05:25.830> and<00:05:26.790> you
