00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.409
 agents that can scratch the car's glass 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.009

 It is rumored that more fluid like this 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.079
 at play time 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.079
 everything passed 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.780
 after 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.030
 to trigger 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.060
 a water glass 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.450
 because that's okay the beginning 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.720
 but now it is late I doubt it is already risky in some cases it is possible 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.720

 for removal of all that 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.140
 so sometimes in an attempt to take something you're going to end up spoiling

 it is recommended that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.940
 where you can 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.760

 at the time of maintenance that could end up losing the third 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.480
