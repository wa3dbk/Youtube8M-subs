unnatural color so I'm hoping that it

website on the under the FAQ if accused

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.510 
website on the under the FAQ if accused
that<00:01:04.640> it<00:01:05.000> only<00:01:05.180> works<00:01:05.360> on<00:01:05.900> hair<00:01:06.860> dye<00:01:07.070> that's

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
that it only works on hair dye that's

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.430 
that it only works on hair dye that's
mixed<00:01:07.850> with<00:01:07.909> developer<00:01:08.420> it<00:01:08.570> does<00:01:08.690> not<00:01:08.990> work<00:01:09.229> on

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
mixed with developer it does not work on

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.510 
mixed with developer it does not work on
just<00:01:09.680> Rodi<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:11.180> I<00:01:11.570> bought<00:01:11.840> raw<00:01:12.470> blue<00:01:13.010> hair<00:01:13.340> dye

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
just Rodi and I bought raw blue hair dye

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.090 
just Rodi and I bought raw blue hair dye
but<00:01:13.939> my<00:01:14.240> sister<00:01:14.600> did<00:01:14.869> it<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.229> she<00:01:15.590> didn't<00:01:15.920> know

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
but my sister did it and she didn't know

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.410 
but my sister did it and she didn't know
that<00:01:16.130> you're<00:01:16.430> not<00:01:16.610> supposed<00:01:16.969> to<00:01:17.030> mix<00:01:17.180> of<00:01:17.360> a

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
that you're not supposed to mix of a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.450 
that you're not supposed to mix of a
developer<00:01:17.869> and<00:01:18.320> she<00:01:18.680> did<00:01:18.950> mix<00:01:19.219> it<00:01:19.369> with

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
developer and she did mix it with

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.880 
developer and she did mix it with
developer<00:01:19.939> so<00:01:20.689> I'm<00:01:20.899> hoping<00:01:21.350> that<00:01:21.409> that<00:01:21.649> means

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
developer so I'm hoping that that means

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.060 
developer so I'm hoping that that means
that<00:01:22.040> this<00:01:22.310> might<00:01:22.579> actually<00:01:22.820> work<00:01:23.560> if<00:01:24.560> not<00:01:24.619> I

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
that this might actually work if not I

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.340 
that this might actually work if not I
