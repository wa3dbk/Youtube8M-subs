00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.370 
here is we'll add some garlic and some
coconut<00:02:42.120> actually<00:02:43.120> coconut<00:02:43.630> can<00:02:43.840> also<00:02:44.050> be

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
coconut actually coconut can also be

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.340 
coconut actually coconut can also be
roasted<00:02:45.340> as<00:02:45.490> in<00:02:45.790> dry<00:02:46.060> roasted<00:02:46.540> but<00:02:46.930> if<00:02:47.050> you<00:02:47.170> add

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
roasted as in dry roasted but if you add

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.560 
roasted as in dry roasted but if you add
little<00:02:47.680> oil<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.550> flavor<00:02:48.850> comes<00:02:49.180> out<00:02:49.300> even

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
little oil the flavor comes out even

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.450 
little oil the flavor comes out even
better<00:02:49.720> so<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.380> is<00:02:50.500> why<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.650> have<00:02:50.800> used<00:02:51.160> some

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
better so that is why I have used some

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.610 
better so that is why I have used some
oil<00:02:51.730> in<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:52.090> otherwise<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.750> can<00:02:52.960> also<00:02:53.170> be

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
oil in this otherwise it can also be

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.680 
oil in this otherwise it can also be
roasted<00:02:55.890> okay<00:02:56.890> so<00:02:56.950> now<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.520> see<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.090> Coco<00:02:58.450> has

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
roasted okay so now I see the Coco has

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.140 
roasted okay so now I see the Coco has
got<00:02:58.900> quite<00:02:59.200> dry<00:02:59.740> which<00:03:00.340> means<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.880> has<00:03:01.030> got

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
got quite dry which means it has got

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.510 
got quite dry which means it has got
sauteed<00:03:01.930> or<00:03:01.960> lightly<00:03:02.350> roasted<00:03:02.980> so<00:03:03.340> we'll

sauteed or lightly roasted so we'll

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.910 
sauteed or lightly roasted so we'll
switch<00:03:03.790> off<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.120> heat<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.600> we<00:03:05.140> will<00:03:05.290> transfer

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
switch off the heat and we will transfer

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.370 
switch off the heat and we will transfer

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
all of this into a mixie jar actually

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.080 
all of this into a mixie jar actually
should<00:03:08.560> not<00:03:08.740> be<00:03:08.890> grinding<00:03:09.310> all<00:03:09.520> these<00:03:09.760> things

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
you if a fish smells too fishy it

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.780 
you if a fish smells too fishy it
definitely<00:04:59.680> is<00:04:59.770> not<00:04:59.950> a<00:05:00.010> good<00:05:00.250> fish<00:05:00.550> which

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
definitely is not a good fish which
