expansion<00:02:57.959> of<00:02:58.050> this<00:02:58.230> niche<00:02:58.620> market<00:02:59.190> within

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
expansion of this niche market within

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.449 
expansion of this niche market within
itself<00:03:00.600> but<00:03:00.780> also<00:03:01.080> it's<00:03:01.470> trying<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.280> break

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
itself but also it's trying to break

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.040 
itself but also it's trying to break
through<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.790> mainstream<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:03.780> think

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
through to the mainstream and I think

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.720 
through to the mainstream and I think
this<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.380> its<00:03:04.560> best<00:03:04.800> chance<00:03:05.100> yet<00:03:05.340> because

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
this is its best chance yet because

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.060 
this is its best chance yet because
they've<00:03:05.910> taken<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.690> faith<00:03:06.930> based<00:03:06.959> story<00:03:07.709> on

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
they've taken a faith based story on

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.280 
they've taken a faith based story on
Left<00:03:08.730> Behind<00:03:09.060> series<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.720> might<00:03:09.870> recall<00:03:10.140> this

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
Left Behind series you might recall this

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.590 
Left Behind series you might recall this
was<00:03:10.470> made<00:03:10.650> as<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.950> film<00:03:11.220> franchise<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.030> couple<00:03:12.540> of

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
was made as a film franchise a couple of

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.170 
was made as a film franchise a couple of
years<00:03:12.780> ago<00:03:12.930> with<00:03:13.170> Kirk<00:03:13.380> Cameron<00:03:13.410> uh<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:15.060> it

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
years ago with Kirk Cameron uh and it

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.970 
years ago with Kirk Cameron uh and it
had<00:03:15.330> some<00:03:15.600> success<00:03:16.020> even<00:03:16.230> there<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.739> mean

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
had some success even there I mean

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.040 
had some success even there I mean
enough<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.310> them<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.520> make<00:03:17.640> sequels<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.450> I

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
enough of them to make sequels but I

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.010 
enough of them to make sequels but I
think<00:03:19.290> obviously<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:20.640> religious<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.360> think

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
think obviously the religious I think

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.729 
think obviously the religious I think
it's<00:03:22.140> like<00:03:22.230> cloud<00:03:22.500> 10<00:03:23.420> company<00:03:24.420> but<00:03:24.600> it's<00:03:24.900> it's

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
it's like cloud 10 company but it's it's

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:26.720 
it's like cloud 10 company but it's it's
a<00:03:25.800> production<00:03:26.070> company<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.610> makes

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
a production company that makes

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.090 
a production company that makes
Christian<00:03:27.150> based<00:03:27.330> films<00:03:27.750> faith-based<00:03:28.709> films

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
Christian based films faith-based films

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.520 
Christian based films faith-based films
they<00:03:29.280> see<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:30.030> there's<00:03:30.299> a<00:03:30.390> new<00:03:30.930> emerging

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
they see that there's a new emerging

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.990 
they see that there's a new emerging
trend<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.100> I<00:03:32.130> think<00:03:32.310> they<00:03:32.370> want<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.580> be<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.730> part

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
trend and I think they want to be a part

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.479 
trend and I think they want to be a part
of<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.420> have<00:03:33.570> such<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.780> big<00:03:34.410> brand<00:03:35.100> here

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
of that and have such a big brand here

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.520 
of that and have such a big brand here
they<00:03:36.180> they<00:03:36.600> should<00:03:36.840> be<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:36.989> part<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.380> it

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
they they should be a part of it

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.070 
they they should be a part of it
although<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.180> very<00:03:39.209> similar<00:03:39.600> obviously

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
although this is very similar obviously

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.539 
although this is very similar obviously
to<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.260> story<00:03:40.560> that's<00:03:40.650> being<00:03:40.769> told<00:03:40.950> currently

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
to the story that's being told currently

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.780 
to the story that's being told currently
over<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.630> HBO<00:03:42.989> with<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.260> leftovers<00:03:43.920> which<00:03:44.670> is

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
over on HBO with the leftovers which is

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.430 
over on HBO with the leftovers which is
also<00:03:44.970> based<00:03:45.239> on<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.540> book<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:45.989> different

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
also based on a book but a different

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.949 
also based on a book but a different
book<00:03:46.590> not<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.860> Left<00:03:47.190> Behind<00:03:47.549> series<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:48.269> guess

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
book not the Left Behind series I guess

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.190 
book not the Left Behind series I guess
you<00:03:49.110> can't<00:03:49.350> copyright<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.070> rapture<00:03:50.549> right<00:03:51.200> so

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
you can't copyright the rapture right so

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.420 
you can't copyright the rapture right so
I<00:03:52.230> guess<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.620> will<00:03:52.680> be<00:03:52.739> interesting<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.220> see

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
I guess it will be interesting to see

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.850 
I guess it will be interesting to see
which<00:03:53.670> kind<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.360> story<00:03:54.600> audiences<00:03:55.230> gravitate

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
which kind of story audiences gravitate

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.680 
which kind of story audiences gravitate
towards<00:03:56.190> but<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.519> leftovers<00:03:57.030> isn't<00:03:57.360> exactly

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
towards but the leftovers isn't exactly

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.229 
towards but the leftovers isn't exactly

how it's being received although will

would make such a movie Chad Michael
Murray's<00:04:15.510> here<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:16.680> know<00:04:16.799> Lea<00:04:17.220> Thompson<00:04:17.549> from

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
the Back to the Future film's obviously

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.650 
the Back to the Future film's obviously
a<00:04:19.769> little<00:04:20.430> bit<00:04:20.579> more<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:20.910> think<00:04:21.329> name

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
a little bit more I think name

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.440 
a little bit more I think name
recognition<00:04:22.440> again<00:04:23.070> but<00:04:23.370> so<00:04:23.820> I<00:04:24.090> don't<00:04:24.270> know

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
recognition again but so I don't know

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.540 
recognition again but so I don't know
quite<00:04:24.810> at<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.110> low<00:04:25.229> I<00:04:25.380> mean<00:04:25.560> I<00:04:25.710> think<00:04:26.190> this<00:04:26.490> is

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
quite at the low I mean I think this is

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.300 
quite at the low I mean I think this is
going<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:26.970> only<00:04:27.330> grow<00:04:27.570> I<00:04:27.960> would<00:04:28.650> think<00:04:28.770> this<00:04:28.979> um

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
going to only grow I would think this um

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.360 
going to only grow I would think this um
this<00:04:29.790> genre<00:04:30.630> I<00:04:30.840> guess<00:04:31.050> you<00:04:31.169> could<00:04:31.349> say<00:04:31.560> and

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
this genre I guess you could say and

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.430 
this genre I guess you could say and
this<00:04:32.550> is<00:04:32.729> certainly<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.120> growth<00:04:33.539> spurt<00:04:33.840> but<00:04:34.410> I

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
this is certainly a growth spurt but I

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.350 
this is certainly a growth spurt but I
don't<00:04:34.650> think<00:04:34.830> it's<00:04:34.919> by<00:04:35.160> any<00:04:35.340> means

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
don't think it's by any means

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.839 
don't think it's by any means
fully-grown<00:04:36.930> it's<00:04:37.530> not<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:38.099> know<00:04:38.220> not<00:04:38.490> adult

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
fully-grown it's not you know not adult
