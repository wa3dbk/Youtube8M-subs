program<00:00:05.100> called<00:00:05.420> android<00:00:06.420> screen<00:00:06.960> capture<00:00:07.379> if

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
program called android screen capture if

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.320 
program called android screen capture if
you<00:00:08.160> google<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.760> sh<00:00:09.750> 0<00:00:10.349> t<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:11.070> works<00:00:11.730> for<00:00:12.030> me<00:00:12.150> to

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330
