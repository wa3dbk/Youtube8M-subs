00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.950 
okay hi my name is Brett and I'm filming
this<00:00:04.770> potato<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:06.029> think<00:00:06.240> it's<00:00:06.359> called<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.600> ribbon

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
this potato I think it's called a ribbon

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.759 
this potato I think it's called a ribbon
cutter<00:00:07.250> one<00:00:08.250> that<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.460> had<00:00:09.090> bought<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.780> had<00:00:10.740> a

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
cutter one that I had bought and I had a

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.770 
cutter one that I had bought and I had a
couple<00:00:11.130> issues<00:00:11.250> with<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:11.790> so<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.000> thought<00:00:12.210> it'll

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
couple issues with it so I thought it'll

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.270 
couple issues with it so I thought it'll
be<00:00:12.870> best<00:00:13.049> just<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.590> quick<00:00:13.950> video<00:00:14.099> and

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
be best just to do a quick video and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.259 
be best just to do a quick video and

I've gone through about five pounds of
these<00:00:18.840> bags<00:00:19.500> five<00:00:20.369> pounds<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.760> these<00:00:20.970> potatoes

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840

and<00:00:22.310> one<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.519> things<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.840> problem

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
and one of the things that is a problem

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.650 
and one of the things that is a problem
is<00:00:25.529> at<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.920> end<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.250> all<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.580> them<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:27.240> end<00:00:27.480> up

is at the end of all of them you end up
with<00:00:27.930> at<00:00:28.260> least<00:00:28.470> three-quarters<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.369> an<00:00:29.640> inch

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
with at least three-quarters of an inch

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.290 
with at least three-quarters of an inch
of<00:00:29.910> potato<00:00:30.240> because<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.560> length<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:32.300> your

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
of potato because the length of your

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.680 
of potato because the length of your
spikes<00:00:33.870> here<00:00:34.250> and<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.550> course<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.940> spike<00:00:36.210> on

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
spikes here and of course the spike on

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.420 
spikes here and of course the spike on
the<00:00:36.750> bottom<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.920> see<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.219> that's

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
the bottom if you can see that that's

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.150 
the bottom if you can see that that's
three-quarters<00:00:39.149> or<00:00:39.629> maybe<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.899> full<00:00:40.170> inch<00:00:40.379> and

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
three-quarters or maybe a full inch and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.510 
three-quarters or maybe a full inch and
that's<00:00:41.370> long<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.540> can't<00:00:43.160> cut<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.370> that

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
that's long and you can't cut in that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.150 
that's long and you can't cut in that
space<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.120> that's<00:00:45.329> that's<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:46.079> issue<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
space so that's that's one issue the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.580 
space so that's that's one issue the
other<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.690> seems<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.230> most

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
other one is that it seems on most

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.360 
other one is that it seems on most
potatoes

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
potatoes

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.400 
potatoes
you<00:00:50.640> hit<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.890> smooth<00:00:52.890> spot<00:00:53.250> or<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.289> in<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
you hit a smooth spot or a in the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.350 
you hit a smooth spot or a in the
neutral<00:00:55.829> zone<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.579> won't<00:00:56.789> come<00:00:57.090> anymore

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
neutral zone and it won't come anymore

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.209 
neutral zone and it won't come anymore
and<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.750> got<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.989> move<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.170> potato<00:00:58.590> around<00:00:58.920> and

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
and you got to move a potato around and

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.250 
and you got to move a potato around and
that's<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.090> real<00:01:00.270> problem<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.780> I'll<00:01:00.989> show<00:01:01.230> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that's a real problem so I'll show you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.020 
that's a real problem so I'll show you
how<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.160> works<00:01:02.670> when<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.030> push<00:01:03.359> down<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.660> this

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
how that works when I push down on this

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.200 
how that works when I push down on this
hopefully<00:01:07.369> this<00:01:08.369> one<00:01:08.549> won't<00:01:08.670> even<00:01:08.909> cut<00:01:09.060> I've

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
hopefully this one won't even cut I've

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.500 
hopefully this one won't even cut I've
already<00:01:09.479> hit<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.260> spot<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.360> see

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
already hit the spot so so you can see

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.800 
already hit the spot so so you can see
that<00:01:12.659> that's<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> problem<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.619> lift<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:13.979> up

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
that that's a problem so I lift this up

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.749 
that that's a problem so I lift this up
see<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.869> hit<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.409> flat<00:01:16.740> spot<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.580> won't

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
see I hit that flat spot and it won't

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.649 
see I hit that flat spot and it won't
cut<00:01:17.970> anymore

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
cut anymore

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.140 
cut anymore
so<00:01:19.229> I'm<00:01:19.290> gonna<00:01:19.409> turn<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.830> over<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.790> do<00:01:21.000> it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
so I'm gonna turn it over and do it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.950 
so I'm gonna turn it over and do it
again

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.310 

and<00:01:27.950> hit<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.310> spot<00:01:28.580> again<00:01:28.760> this<00:01:29.630> happens<00:01:30.050> over

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
and hit the spot again this happens over

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.740 
and hit the spot again this happens over
and<00:01:30.410> over<00:01:30.470> again<00:01:30.710> now<00:01:31.430> if<00:01:31.670> I<00:01:31.790> push<00:01:32.090> down<00:01:32.120> hard

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
and over again now if I push down hard

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.190 
and over again now if I push down hard
on<00:01:32.930> that<00:01:33.820> it<00:01:34.820> just<00:01:34.880> pushes<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.600> potato<00:01:35.900> and

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
on that it just pushes the potato and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.660 
on that it just pushes the potato and
sometimes<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.920> breaks<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.340> goes<00:01:37.490> all<00:01:37.640> over

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
sometimes it breaks and goes all over

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.480 
sometimes it breaks and goes all over
the<00:01:37.910> place<00:01:38.150> I<00:01:38.420> can<00:01:38.900> go<00:01:39.020> fast<00:01:41.680> it<00:01:42.680> doesn't<00:01:43.070> work

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
the place I can go fast it doesn't work

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.510 
the place I can go fast it doesn't work
I<00:01:43.520> found<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:44.660> putting<00:01:45.200> a<00:01:45.440> clock<00:01:45.800> behind<00:01:46.160> this

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
I found that putting a clock behind this

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.510 
I found that putting a clock behind this
is<00:01:46.729> very<00:01:46.940> good<00:01:47.210> because<00:01:47.930> in<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.380> past<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.979> got<00:01:49.490> a

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
is very good because in the past I got a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.300 
is very good because in the past I got a
lot<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:50.060> potato<00:01:50.720> stuff<00:01:51.080> all<00:01:51.320> over<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:51.979> counter

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
lot of potato stuff all over the counter

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.790 
lot of potato stuff all over the counter
so<00:01:52.820> that's<00:01:53.180> why<00:01:53.300> I<00:01:53.330> do<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.600> here<00:01:53.960> yeah<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.560> still

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
so that's why I do it here yeah it still

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.520 
so that's why I do it here yeah it still
flies<00:01:55.010> on<00:01:55.280> front<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:55.790> so<00:01:55.940> forth<00:01:56.270> but<00:01:56.479> you<00:01:57.200> can

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
flies on front and so forth but you can

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.080 
flies on front and so forth but you can
see<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.770> problems<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.190> I'm<00:01:58.280> having<00:01:58.340> on<00:01:58.670> both

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
see the problems that I'm having on both

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.540 
see the problems that I'm having on both
sides<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.690> this<00:01:59.780> potato<00:02:00.170> I<00:02:00.619> hit<00:02:01.040> that<00:02:01.220> flat

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
sides of this potato I hit that flat

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.410 
sides of this potato I hit that flat
spot<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:03.380> third<00:02:03.680> thing<00:02:03.979> is<00:02:04.040> that<00:02:04.759> these<00:02:05.180> are

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
spot the third thing is that these are

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.830 
spot the third thing is that these are
very<00:02:05.869> very<00:02:06.290> very<00:02:06.770> thin<00:02:07.220> now<00:02:07.820> maybe<00:02:08.600> it's

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
very very very thin now maybe it's

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.710 
very very very thin now maybe it's
intended<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.440> be<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.590> way<00:02:09.770> I'm<00:02:10.369> not<00:02:10.610> sure<00:02:10.720> but

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
intended to be that way I'm not sure but

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.380 
intended to be that way I'm not sure but
I<00:02:12.220> prefer<00:02:13.220> them<00:02:13.340> just<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.760> little<00:02:14.000> bit<00:02:14.120> thicker

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
I prefer them just a little bit thicker

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.510 
I prefer them just a little bit thicker
because<00:02:14.989> I've<00:02:15.350> been<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.620> several<00:02:15.800> events<00:02:16.280> in

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
because I've been to several events in

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.220 
because I've been to several events in
bottom<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.120> that's<00:02:17.510> what<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.720> was<00:02:17.930> trying<00:02:18.200> to

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
bottom and that's what I was trying to

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.570 
bottom and that's what I was trying to
recreate<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:20.150> what<00:02:20.360> I<00:02:20.390> did<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:22.130> this<00:02:22.310> again

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
recreate so what I did and this again

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.020 
recreate so what I did and this again
was<00:02:22.730> after<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.239> hit<00:02:23.390> all<00:02:23.450> these<00:02:23.690> flat<00:02:24.020> spots<00:02:24.380> I

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
was after I hit all these flat spots I

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.270 
was after I hit all these flat spots I
very<00:02:26.030> very<00:02:26.360> minimally<00:02:27.020> loosen<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.950> screws

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
very very minimally loosen the screws

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.810 
very very minimally loosen the screws
here<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:29.030> give<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.450> little<00:02:29.750> more<00:02:30.820> hopefully

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
here to give it a little more hopefully

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.670 
here to give it a little more hopefully
room<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.330> make<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.480> little<00:02:32.690> bigger<00:02:32.930> cut

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
room and make a little bigger cut

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.370 
room and make a little bigger cut
but<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.130> did<00:02:34.310> not<00:02:34.489> make<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.760> difference<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:36.080> in

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
but it did not make a difference so in

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.810 
but it did not make a difference so in
anybody<00:02:36.769> I<00:02:36.920> don't<00:02:37.220> know<00:02:37.370> how<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:38.299> resolve<00:02:39.820> this

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
anybody I don't know how to resolve this

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.229 
anybody I don't know how to resolve this
flat<00:02:41.810> spot<00:02:42.200> also<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:42.799> can<00:02:42.950> do<00:02:43.070> this<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:43.430> have

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
flat spot also you can do this I have

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.150 
flat spot also you can do this I have
also<00:02:44.540> tried<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.110> put<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.410> on<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.590> slight<00:02:45.920> angle

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
also tried to put it on a slight angle

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.430 
also tried to put it on a slight angle
and<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:46.790> sometimes<00:02:47.600> just<00:02:47.690> makes<00:02:48.080> a<00:02:48.230> bigger

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
and that sometimes just makes a bigger

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:56.210 
and that sometimes just makes a bigger
mess

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.850 

by<00:02:56.970> pushing<00:02:57.210> that<00:02:57.510> one<00:02:57.690> down<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:58.170> finally<00:02:58.740> got

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
by pushing that one down I finally got

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.710 
by pushing that one down I finally got
it<00:02:58.980> through<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.280> but<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.240> doesn't<00:03:00.600> happen

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
it through it but that doesn't happen

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.530 
it through it but that doesn't happen
all<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.020> time<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.860> I'll<00:03:02.460> try<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:02.790> again

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
all the time so I'll try that again

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.190 
all the time so I'll try that again
oh<00:03:03.570> by<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.380> way<00:03:04.580> there's<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.670> good<00:03:06.060> thing

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
oh by the way there's a good thing

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.380 
oh by the way there's a good thing
there's<00:03:07.200> my<00:03:07.410> 3/4<00:03:08.010> inch<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.520> tailor<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.270> on

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
there's my 3/4 inch of the tailor so on

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.770 
there's my 3/4 inch of the tailor so on
a<00:03:09.420> typical<00:03:09.800> roughly<00:03:10.800> 4<00:03:11.100> inch<00:03:11.340> spot<00:03:11.940> these<00:03:12.630> are

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
a typical roughly 4 inch spot these are

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.210 
a typical roughly 4 inch spot these are
small<00:03:13.050> I<00:03:13.080> understand<00:03:13.710> some<00:03:13.890> things<00:03:13.920> are

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
small I understand some things are

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.570 
small I understand some things are
bigger<00:03:14.340> or<00:03:14.640> 5<00:03:15.150> inch<00:03:15.440> almost<00:03:16.440> 20%<00:03:16.860> your<00:03:17.280> patina

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
bigger or 5 inch almost 20% your patina

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.520 
bigger or 5 inch almost 20% your patina
is<00:03:17.790> wasted<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.810> don't<00:03:18.870> know<00:03:19.140> what<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.410> do

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
is wasted and I don't know what to do

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.890 
is wasted and I don't know what to do
with<00:03:19.650> these<00:03:19.770> I<00:03:19.830> can't<00:03:20.730> think<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.090> use<00:03:21.240> I

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
with these I can't think of a use I

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.580 
with these I can't think of a use I
don't<00:03:22.260> think<00:03:22.770> that<00:03:23.100> bottom<00:03:23.870> spike<00:03:24.870> needs<00:03:25.230> to

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
don't think that bottom spike needs to

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.560 
don't think that bottom spike needs to
be<00:03:25.710> that<00:03:25.890> big<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.310> think<00:03:26.550> if<00:03:26.760> we're<00:03:26.940> half<00:03:27.120> as<00:03:27.390> big

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
be that big I think if we're half as big

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.600 
be that big I think if we're half as big
it<00:03:28.110> when<00:03:28.230> probably<00:03:28.500> hold<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.770> potato<00:03:29.100> just<00:03:29.190> as

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
it when probably hold the potato just as

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.790 
it when probably hold the potato just as
well<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.360> again<00:03:30.900> I'll<00:03:31.170> get<00:03:31.290> into<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.560> small

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
well so again I'll get into the small

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.640 
well so again I'll get into the small
ones<00:03:32.040> why<00:03:32.370> because<00:03:32.790> my<00:03:33.060> kids<00:03:33.390> ate<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.320> lot<00:03:34.500> of

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
ones why because my kids ate a lot of

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.560 
ones why because my kids ate a lot of
potatoes<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.820> made<00:03:36.060> all<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.300> big<00:03:36.330> ones

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
potatoes and I made all the big ones

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:44.340 
potatoes and I made all the big ones
purpose<00:03:36.960> so<00:03:37.140> let's<00:03:37.320> do<00:03:37.470> this<00:03:37.590> again

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.840 

first<00:03:45.220> perfect<00:03:45.670> one<00:03:46.020> I<00:03:47.020> say<00:03:47.500> first<00:03:47.830> time<00:03:48.160> the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
first perfect one I say first time the

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.960 
first perfect one I say first time the
video<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.150> have<00:03:49.450> done<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.690> few<00:03:49.870> months<00:03:50.170> before

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
video I have done a few months before

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.460 
video I have done a few months before
