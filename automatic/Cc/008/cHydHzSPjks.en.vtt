00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.030
 the report to recover part of 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.610
 our memory not a debt that already 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.250
 they are 190 years old or so since the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.560
 judge griesa the little one and of some 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.730
 way you keep holding the time to 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.360
 failure of the argument you had to 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.510
 negotiate some of this not if this three 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.880
 brief comments the first this topic 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.890
 is a strictly legal issue in 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.710
 this time if so and so 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.070
 quackery so many people saying 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.429
 nonsense the government was mishandled in 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.350
 what is the first question that 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:42.359
 I would have to do the cross - examination 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.390
 government was handled badly can you explain me 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:48.390
 please in what second the only 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.550
 criticism that I heard 2003 2004 2005 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.659
 until it's the first exchange is that 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.969
 we could have made a lower offer to 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.550
 what we did will remind you that 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.719
 Argentina offered a cut rate of 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.360
 25 or a remover of 75 well if 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.100
 we would have made a smaller offer more than 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.200
 agreement with what the bonds were worth in 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.780
 the 1815 market 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.630
 there would have been more people who did not enter 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.299
 in the channel ard no less therefore 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.560
 today the problem we would have would be a 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.240
 no less major problem you understand 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.880
 a primary school boy this in the first 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.700
 place second the judge griesa 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.530
 that will be removed very quickly 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.619
 He entered very little time 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.479
 not for no other reason than because 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.289
 his age this gave a very background 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.640
 interesting is a judge who brings them 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:47.369
 a year after being a judge in year 73 he started 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.520
 an investigation against playing and against 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.200
 the fbi because the fb and they had crossed to the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.560
 socialist party workers 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.340
 Americans and ended up condemning the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.039
 fbi invalid that test charged him a 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.829
 fine of 300 thousand dollars and he made 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.890
 will completely change the practices of 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.479
 espionage that the fbi play in that 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.910
 moment when the trials ended no longer 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.300
 I was more taken forward by 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.970
 so I do not find it interesting 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.250
 emphasize the judge griesa pp it 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.230
 it's much more interesting to try to see 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.180
 why this situation was taken and that is 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.909
 the third comment 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.250
 very recently he assumed the new 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.969
 president of the bank of england that 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.829
 it's called meat is of Canadian origin 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:37.349
 last week in his speech of 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.379
 assumption said that this system is 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.989
 unfeasible you say in the report on 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.959
 Dad said that this system is unfeasible 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.659
 A Frenchman studied at school 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.609
 economic london called thomas picart 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.409
 and he took out a book which is being 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.719
 talking a lot and going to talk a lot 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.359
 more is called capitalism in the century 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:03:00.750
 21 where it says that the speed of 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.579
 capital accumulation is faster 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.659
 that the generation speed of 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:09.450
 wealth therefore developed by 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.030
 so it impoverishes people and that 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.090
 that naturally goes to violence and that 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.359
 the system is not sustainable that this 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.329
 book sold out in france was commented 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:24.329
 by Paul Krugman appreciatively they have 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.819
 put all the nicknames good nicknames no 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.829
 the alexis de tocqueville of the 21st century 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.390
 etcetera etcetera what I say of 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.210
 the bowels of the system 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.120
 are appearing voices that look 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.400
 much to the voices that are leading 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.080
 forward cristina fernandez and these are 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.110
 objective issues I am giving 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.910
 names I'm giving ideas I'm saying 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.880
 things that are happening I'm not 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.500
 saying the government mishandled between 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.020
 Parenthesis with great honesty 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.130
 intellectual at the time alfonso 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:59.670
 prat-gay was in favor of dating 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.709
 much lower cutoff rate 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.980
 that the cut rate with the necessary 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:09.000
 therefore stop more holdouts 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.720
 out of the swap not at 93% that we have 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.090
 today very clearly not some data that one 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.739
 wants to drive at the time of 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.079
 various packages who take sides 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.930
 for the vulture funds in exchange for that 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.130
 let's say because there are Argentines who 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.620
 they are in favor of the vulture funds 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.040
 good to see what benefits to see gabriel 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.440
 do not forget mulford was decorated 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.270
 with the highest decoration that the 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.350
 Argentine Republic can impose a 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.720
 foreign decorated and name 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.510
 collection took millions and millions now 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.820
 in the Argentine Republic what the 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.330
 president belt in uruguay ecuador 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.419
 bold and when I was economy minister 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:54.840
 proposed to review the external debt when 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:57.450
 it was president he reviewed it produced a 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.280
 removes a 30 percent cut that the 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:04.020
 exchange or by bonds to 8 percent 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.430
 quickly determined what the debt was 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.280
 illegitimate part 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.520
 illegitimate debt can not be canceled 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.050
 unilaterally but part if there 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.820
 then that would be the answer to the 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.650
 question x you before you have wrong 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.650
 the government is not reviewing the debt I 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.380
 seems sometimes told the former president 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.090
 here the Kirchner president was telling him 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.030
 why do not we do this because we do not do 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.940
 that other had to have lived in 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.820
 a country where in the first assembly 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.540
 General of United Nations September 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:40.140
 2003 they asked us for five bilaterals are 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.390
 the five countries of the 192 countries of 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.480
 United nations were interested in 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:48.420
 talk to Argentina and in 2005 70 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.190
 had to have lived that country that yes 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.110
 that it was a country that was outside the 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.270
 world that I see now speak with 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.370
 lightness to Fernando braga tells him 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.220
 very good actur senegal it but please 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.460
 a bit of decorum a bit of decorum 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.250
 sir you have just been this I have left 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.810
 sideways in a cause by prescription 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.540
 for having contracted the debts of the 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.620
 which now speaks with a lightness 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.820
 absolute then it seems to me that you have to 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.160
 have a little 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.200
 a little more sense of brotherhood of 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.060
 brotherhood it seems to me that behind this 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.630
 defense of the vulture funds 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:25.170
 this naive thing of independence 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:27.270
 policy of no having the designation 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.870
 of a judge of the court usa is a 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:34.290
 political appointment to griesa appointed him 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:37.920
 Mr. Richard Nixon Gray Being 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:41.160
 republican nixon and republican paul 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.610
 singer is republican paul singer supported 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.800
 to matt romney in the last elections 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:50.100
 with money ni but has a nitro club 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.250
 nor does he have a club of billionaires who 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.980
 supports candidates do not support anyone and 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.960
 party because they were losers simply 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:02.010
 why the lord 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:05.670
 singer has a side I do not say that 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:08.100
 whether he is not sincere is not true he 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:12.000
 supports gay marriage because his son 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:13.470
 Andrew is married to his partner with law 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.260
 last name 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.390
 and they married the year 2009 then they have 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.970
 an image that some would say is good 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.580
 image associated with a position between 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:26.040
 between quotes progressive now 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.420
 the 10 million contributions made by the 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.790
 causes the marriage of the sweet 

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:32.040
 taxes because the courteous does not take away what 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.720
 brave this is what is in front there is 

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.310
 to study a little read a little bit 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.770
 speak so much the government was wrong the 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:40.290
 government got it wrong very well thank you 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.150
 Rafael putting some light and 

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.490
 clarity of this topic let's go 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:48.260
 quickly a break I tell you because 

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.260
 we are living it all
