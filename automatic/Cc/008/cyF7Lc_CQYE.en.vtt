this<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.379> cobalt<00:00:16.830> bit<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:18.060> made<00:00:18.210> by<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
this is the cobalt bit it's made by the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.929 
this is the cobalt bit it's made by the
wall<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.990> what<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.010> Walt<00:00:20.220> does<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.670> they<00:00:20.789> go

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939

out and they have somebody design a
drill<00:00:23.310> bit<00:00:23.460> or<00:00:23.490> whatever<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.000> then<00:00:24.119> they<00:00:24.240> put

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
drill bit or whatever and then they put

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.380 
drill bit or whatever and then they put
it<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.660> Walt<00:00:24.930> name<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.439> there<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.210> it's<00:00:27.210> more

research and development thing this

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.280 
research and development thing this
company<00:00:32.610> actually<00:00:32.850> really<00:00:33.630> put<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> lot<00:00:33.930> of

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
company actually really put a lot of

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.200 
company actually really put a lot of
research<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.829> development<00:00:34.890> into<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.760> they

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
research and development into it they

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.049 
research and development into it they
got<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> 135-degree<00:00:37.350> tip<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:38.370> harder<00:00:38.700> alloys

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
got a 135-degree tip for harder alloys

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.470 
got a 135-degree tip for harder alloys
harder<00:00:39.840> steels<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.940> keeps<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.360> edge

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
harder steels and it keeps the edge

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.340 
harder steels and it keeps the edge
longer<00:00:43.050> instead<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.890> 118<00:00:44.579> degree<00:00:45.350> cutting

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
longer instead of 118 degree cutting

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.170 
longer instead of 118 degree cutting
point<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.860> they've<00:00:47.550> also<00:00:47.700> come<00:00:48.030> out<00:00:48.120> with

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
point and they've also come out with

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.940 
point and they've also come out with
this<00:00:48.420> really<00:00:48.629> great<00:00:48.809> lubricant<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.739> like

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
this really great lubricant that I like

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.340 
this really great lubricant that I like
to<00:00:50.629> this<00:00:51.629> cut<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.110> paste<00:00:53.239> you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.539> goes<00:00:55.079> on

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
to this cut it paste you know it goes on

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.529 
to this cut it paste you know it goes on
right<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.489> got<00:00:56.610> some<00:00:56.670> loaded<00:00:57.180> up<00:00:57.329> on

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
right there we got some loaded up on

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.260 
right there we got some loaded up on

there it can stay loaded up on there and

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.910 
there it can stay loaded up on there and
you<00:01:00.329> don't<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.719> constantly<00:01:00.899> oil<00:01:01.530> stuff

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
you don't have to constantly oil stuff

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.700 
you don't have to constantly oil stuff
as<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.730> as<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> drill<00:01:03.629> bit<00:01:03.780> generates<00:01:04.199> heat<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
as it as the drill bit generates heat it

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.649 
as it as the drill bit generates heat it
melts<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.760> kind<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.150> waxy

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
melts it it's kind of like a waxy

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.740 
melts it it's kind of like a waxy
petroleum<00:01:07.439> type<00:01:07.770> material<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:09.119> goes<00:01:09.450> down

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
petroleum type material and it goes down

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.899 
petroleum type material and it goes down
into<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:10.590> work<00:01:10.830> area<00:01:11.220> where<00:01:11.400> your<00:01:11.549> heat<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
into your work area where your heat and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.240 
into your work area where your heat and
your<00:01:12.000> friction<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.479> being<00:01:12.720> generated<00:01:13.250> that's

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
your friction is being generated that's

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.590 
your friction is being generated that's
what<00:01:14.460> I'm<00:01:14.549> talking<00:01:14.850> about<00:01:14.909> what<00:01:15.150> I'm<00:01:15.299> talking

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
about them actually putting forth some

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.810 
about them actually putting forth some
real<00:01:17.670> effort<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.360> research<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.869> development

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820

this<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.030> right<00:01:21.450> now<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:21.689> got<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> DeWalt<00:01:22.290> bit

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
this is right now we got the DeWalt bit

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.980 
this is right now we got the DeWalt bit
loaded<00:01:23.100> up<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.430> here<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.450> got<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> piece<00:01:24.869> of
