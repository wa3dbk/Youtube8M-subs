at the head of the axe here you can see

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.850 
at the head of the axe here you can see
as<00:01:22.360> I<00:01:22.450> mentioned<00:01:22.509> thinner<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:23.259> then<00:01:23.470> widens

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
as I mentioned thinner and then widens

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.560 
as I mentioned thinner and then widens
out<00:01:23.979> toward<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.369> middle<00:01:24.640> at<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.240> widest

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
out toward the middle at the widest

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.940 
out toward the middle at the widest
portion<00:01:25.929> here<00:01:26.110> it's<00:01:26.229> about<00:01:26.410> half<00:01:26.710> an<00:01:26.860> inch

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
portion here it's about half an inch

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.859 
portion here it's about half an inch
across<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.580> so<00:01:28.119> I'm<00:01:28.390> going<00:01:28.479> to<00:01:28.570> put<00:01:28.720> this

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
across and so I'm going to put this

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.389 
across and so I'm going to put this
probably<00:01:29.289> in<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.679> category<00:01:30.100> of<00:01:30.220> something

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
probably in the category of something

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.370 
probably in the category of something
like<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.759> S<00:01:30.909> wing<00:01:31.179> that<00:01:31.420> are<00:01:31.570> reviewed<00:01:31.899> which

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
like the S wing that are reviewed which

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.749 
like the S wing that are reviewed which
is<00:01:32.500> going<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.679> be<00:01:32.770> very<00:01:32.950> effective<00:01:33.220> as<00:01:33.490> a

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
is going to be very effective as a

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.089 
is going to be very effective as a
chopping<00:01:34.330> axe<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:34.869> it<00:01:35.259> can<00:01:35.500> split<00:01:35.890> some

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:36.099 
chopping axe and it can split some

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:37.620 
chopping axe and it can split some
smaller<00:01:36.459> logs<00:01:36.759> but<00:01:37.060> if<00:01:37.149> you're<00:01:37.270> looking<00:01:37.509> for

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
something to split larger logs around

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
so here's the log we just cut through

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.800 
so here's the log we just cut through
and<00:02:34.190> compared<00:02:34.879> to<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.060> size<00:02:35.239> of<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.599> head<00:02:35.720> of

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
and compared to the size of the head of

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.300 
and compared to the size of the head of
the<00:02:35.840> axe<00:02:36.879> talking<00:02:37.879> about<00:02:38.800> probably<00:02:39.800> three<00:02:40.129> to

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
the axe talking about probably three to

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.220 
the axe talking about probably three to
three<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.519> a<00:02:40.610> half<00:02:40.730> inches<00:02:40.940> across<00:02:41.150> here's<00:02:42.140> a

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
three and a half inches across here's a

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.990 
three and a half inches across here's a
look<00:02:42.349> at<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.560> results<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.099> our<00:02:43.430> splitting

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
look at the results of our splitting

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.440 
look at the results of our splitting
test<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:44.599> as<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.349> suspected<00:02:45.980> it's<00:02:46.849> good<00:02:47.239> for

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
test and as I suspected it's good for

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.059 
test and as I suspected it's good for
splitting<00:02:47.690> it's<00:02:47.900> not<00:02:48.019> fantastic<00:02:48.709> I<00:02:48.799> would<00:02:48.920> put

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
splitting it's not fantastic I would put

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.259 
splitting it's not fantastic I would put
it<00:02:49.190> kind<00:02:49.340> of<00:02:49.430> in<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.640> middle<00:02:49.819> of<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.060> pack

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
it kind of in the middle of the pack

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.330 
it kind of in the middle of the pack
compared<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.260> some<00:02:51.379> other<00:02:51.500> camp<00:02:51.769> axes<00:02:52.160> that

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
compared to some other camp axes that

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.490 
compared to some other camp axes that
I've<00:02:52.430> used<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.879> that<00:02:53.360> as<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:53.989> mentioned<00:02:54.260> before

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
I've used and that as I mentioned before

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.750 
I've used and that as I mentioned before
is<00:02:54.590> going<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.799> be<00:02:54.860> due<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:55.430> thinner

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
is going to be due to that thinner

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.210 
is going to be due to that thinner
profile<00:02:56.390> on<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:57.319> head<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.830> axe<00:02:58.010> is

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
profile on the head of the axe is

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.830 
profile on the head of the axe is
definitely<00:02:58.519> gonna<00:02:58.610> be<00:02:58.730> better<00:02:58.849> for<00:02:59.209> you<00:02:59.720> know

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
definitely gonna be better for you know

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.800 
definitely gonna be better for you know
chopping<00:03:00.380> into<00:03:00.590> say<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.489> tree<00:03:02.000> or<00:03:02.299> a<00:03:02.329> log<00:03:02.599> or

chopping into say a tree or a log or
something<00:03:03.049> like<00:03:03.110> that<00:03:03.170> as<00:03:03.470> opposed<00:03:04.099> to

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
something like that as opposed to

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.670 
something like that as opposed to
splitting<00:03:04.819> just<00:03:05.090> because<00:03:05.360> that<00:03:05.540> head<00:03:05.780> doesn't

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
splitting just because that head doesn't

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.289 
splitting just because that head doesn't
widen<00:03:07.190> out<00:03:07.310> as<00:03:07.489> quickly<00:03:07.819> as<00:03:08.000> some<00:03:08.090> of<00:03:08.209> the

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
widen out as quickly as some of the

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.210 
widen out as quickly as some of the
other<00:03:08.390> axes<00:03:08.810> out<00:03:08.930> there<00:03:09.140> on<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.739> market<00:03:10.069> do

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
other axes out there on the market do

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.160 
other axes out there on the market do
we'll<00:03:10.760> make<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:10.940> couple<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.360> quick<00:03:11.569> tent<00:03:11.959> stakes

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
we'll make a couple of quick tent stakes

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.780 
we'll make a couple of quick tent stakes
now<00:03:12.349> and<00:03:12.590> then<00:03:12.739> test<00:03:13.010> out<00:03:13.129> the<00:03:13.250> pommel<00:03:13.579> on<00:03:13.670> the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
now and then test out the pommel on the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:31.860 
now and then test out the pommel on the
axe

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.449 

here's<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.530> look<00:03:32.620> at<00:03:32.739> four<00:03:32.950> different<00:03:33.099> sized

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
here's a look at four different sized

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.650 
here's a look at four different sized
steaks<00:03:33.819> and<00:03:34.060> we'll<00:03:34.180> drive<00:03:34.330> them<00:03:34.450> into<00:03:34.599> the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
steaks and we'll drive them into the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:04:07.369 
steaks and we'll drive them into the
ground<00:03:34.750> using<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.379> pommel

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.479 

you<00:04:08.379> look<00:04:08.590> at<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.769> sheet<00:04:08.950> that's<00:04:09.129> included

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
you look at the sheet that's included

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.970 
you look at the sheet that's included
with<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:09.670> X<00:04:09.819> very<00:04:10.510> nicely<00:04:10.689> made<00:04:10.840> it's<00:04:11.680> molded

nylon<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.670> do<00:04:12.760> have<00:04:12.879> a<00:04:12.939> belt<00:04:13.150> clip<00:04:13.239> here

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
nylon you do have a belt clip here

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.050 
nylon you do have a belt clip here
grommet<00:04:14.650> holes<00:04:14.829> all<00:04:15.159> the<00:04:15.189> way<00:04:15.400> around<00:04:15.730> so<00:04:15.879> you

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
grommet holes all the way around so you

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.400 
grommet holes all the way around so you
can<00:04:16.180> attach<00:04:16.419> it<00:04:16.570> to<00:04:16.660> a<00:04:16.690> pack<00:04:16.930> or<00:04:17.139> something

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
can attach it to a pack or something

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.800 
can attach it to a pack or something
else<00:04:17.590> to<00:04:18.489> take<00:04:18.759> out<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.209> axe<00:04:19.389> you're<00:04:19.630> going<00:04:19.750> to

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
else to take out the axe you're going to

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.110 
else to take out the axe you're going to
slide<00:04:20.019> this<00:04:20.169> back<00:04:20.380> section<00:04:20.620> up<00:04:20.889> and<00:04:21.070> then<00:04:21.459> move

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
slide this back section up and then move

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.510 
slide this back section up and then move
the<00:04:22.330> sheet<00:04:22.600> forward<00:04:23.169> like<00:04:23.500> this<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:23.949> to<00:04:24.370> put

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
the sheet forward like this and to put

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.640 
the sheet forward like this and to put
it<00:04:24.580> back<00:04:24.669> in<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.360> best<00:04:25.570> idea<00:04:25.930> I<00:04:26.020> found<00:04:26.380> is<00:04:26.500> that

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
it back in the best idea I found is that

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.779 
it back in the best idea I found is that
you've<00:04:26.770> actually<00:04:27.070> pushed<00:04:27.310> this<00:04:27.430> all<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.729> way

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
you've actually pushed this all the way

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.909 
you've actually pushed this all the way
to<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:28.030> top<00:04:28.240> like<00:04:28.270> so<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:28.900> then<00:04:29.590> slide<00:04:29.830> it

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
to the top like so and then slide it

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.990 
to the top like so and then slide it
back<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:30.280> then<00:04:30.789> clip<00:04:31.060> this<00:04:31.210> down<00:04:32.910> here's<00:04:33.910> a

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
back and then clip this down here's a

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.400 
back and then clip this down here's a
look<00:04:34.120> at<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.300> sheath<00:04:34.479> attached<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:35.080> my<00:04:35.199> belt

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
look at the sheath attached to my belt

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.990 
look at the sheath attached to my belt
and<00:04:35.500> to<00:04:35.979> remove<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.340> axe<00:04:36.490> are<00:04:36.639> going<00:04:36.759> to<00:04:36.849> flip

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
and to remove the axe are going to flip

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.390 
and to remove the axe are going to flip
up<00:04:37.120> this<00:04:37.300> little<00:04:37.570> back<00:04:38.110> trapdoor<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:38.919> then

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
up this little back trapdoor and then

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.909 
up this little back trapdoor and then
you<00:04:39.580> can<00:04:39.870> slide<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:40.990> axe<00:04:41.139> out<00:04:41.320> like<00:04:41.530> so<00:04:41.710> and

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
you can slide the axe out like so and

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.360 
you can slide the axe out like so and
put<00:04:42.430> it<00:04:42.490> back<00:04:42.580> in<00:04:42.820> just<00:04:44.220> reverse<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.340> process

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
put it back in just reverse the process

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.110 
put it back in just reverse the process
I<00:04:46.889> have<00:04:47.889> been<00:04:48.220> walking<00:04:48.370> around<00:04:48.699> a<00:04:48.789> bit<00:04:48.910> with

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
I have been walking around a bit with

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.300 
I have been walking around a bit with
the<00:04:49.270> axe<00:04:49.419> on<00:04:49.750> my<00:04:50.050> belt<00:04:50.320> like<00:04:50.500> this<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:50.949> I've

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
the axe on my belt like this and I've

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.070 
the axe on my belt like this and I've
noticed<00:04:51.490> that<00:04:51.759> that<00:04:52.060> little<00:04:52.300> trapdoor<00:04:52.599> on<00:04:52.840> the

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
noticed that that little trapdoor on the

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.129 
noticed that that little trapdoor on the
back<00:04:53.259> because<00:04:53.979> open<00:04:54.580> as<00:04:54.820> you<00:04:55.180> can<00:04:55.330> see<00:04:55.570> not

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
back because open as you can see not

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.839 
back because open as you can see not
completely<00:04:56.710> but<00:04:56.919> not<00:04:57.280> with<00:04:57.430> not<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:57.639> lot<00:04:57.820> of

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
completely but not with not a lot of

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.850 
completely but not with not a lot of
movement<00:04:58.090> it'll<00:04:58.539> start<00:04:58.750> to<00:04:58.810> pop<00:04:59.020> open<00:04:59.229> so<00:04:59.830> a

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
movement it'll start to pop open so a

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.860 
movement it'll start to pop open so a
simple<00:05:00.340> modification<00:05:00.610> for<00:05:01.210> SOG<00:05:01.449> would<00:05:01.720> be

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
simple modification for SOG would be

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.610 
simple modification for SOG would be
just<00:05:02.560> put<00:05:02.680> bigger<00:05:02.889> knobs<00:05:03.490> there<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:04.120> as<00:05:05.110> far

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
just put bigger knobs there and as far

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.990 
just put bigger knobs there and as far
as<00:05:05.710> if<00:05:05.860> you're<00:05:06.160> the<00:05:06.310> user<00:05:06.550> and<00:05:06.820> you<00:05:06.910> actually

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
as if you're the user and you actually

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.060 
as if you're the user and you actually
carrying<00:05:07.419> this<00:05:07.509> around<00:05:07.630> you<00:05:08.590> could<00:05:08.770> just<00:05:08.949> run

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
carrying this around you could just run

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.680 
carrying this around you could just run
a<00:05:09.099> little<00:05:09.250> paracord<00:05:09.760> through<00:05:09.970> there<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:10.330> then

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
a little paracord through there and then

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.750 
a little paracord through there and then
just<00:05:11.050> basically<00:05:11.289> tie<00:05:12.010> this<00:05:12.070> off<00:05:12.370> so<00:05:12.580> that

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
just basically tie this off so that

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.670 
just basically tie this off so that
there's<00:05:12.940> pressure<00:05:13.210> pushing<00:05:14.080> back<00:05:14.260> on<00:05:14.289> this

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
there's pressure pushing back on this

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.800 
there's pressure pushing back on this
trapdoor<00:05:14.919> keeping<00:05:15.789> it<00:05:15.940> closed<00:05:16.270> a<00:05:16.510> little<00:05:16.599> bit

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
trapdoor keeping it closed a little bit

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.589 
trapdoor keeping it closed a little bit
more<00:05:16.930> effectively<00:05:18.120> let's<00:05:19.120> wrap<00:05:19.330> up<00:05:19.360> our

other<00:05:40.180> thing<00:05:40.300> I'll<00:05:40.419> mention<00:05:40.510> is<00:05:40.810> that<00:05:40.900> it<00:05:41.050> was

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
other thing I'll mention is that it was

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.379 
other thing I'll mention is that it was
quite<00:05:41.409> efficient<00:05:41.860> at<00:05:42.010> cutting<00:05:42.400> I<00:05:42.580> will<00:05:43.120> remind

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
quite efficient at cutting I will remind

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.330 
quite efficient at cutting I will remind
you<00:05:43.539> it<00:05:43.659> comes<00:05:43.870> in<00:05:44.020> at<00:05:44.139> 33<00:05:44.620> ounces<00:05:44.949> so<00:05:45.130> that<00:05:45.280> may

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
you it comes in at 33 ounces so that may

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.589 
you it comes in at 33 ounces so that may
be<00:05:45.400> a<00:05:45.490> little<00:05:45.610> bit<00:05:45.760> more<00:05:46.060> than<00:05:46.300> your<00:05:46.419> average

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
be a little bit more than your average

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.540 
be a little bit more than your average
camp<00:05:47.020> axe<00:05:47.260> but<00:05:47.800> for<00:05:47.979> me<00:05:48.070> it<00:05:48.190> didn't<00:05:48.400> feel

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
camp axe but for me it didn't feel

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.399 
camp axe but for me it didn't feel
overbearing<00:05:49.449> or<00:05:49.539> really<00:05:49.840> heavy<00:05:50.050> when<00:05:50.229> I<00:05:50.260> was

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409 
overbearing or really heavy when I was

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.010 
overbearing or really heavy when I was
carrying<00:05:50.740> it<00:05:50.889> and<00:05:51.010> that<00:05:51.550> extra<00:05:51.820> heft<00:05:52.180> and<00:05:52.539> the

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
carrying it and that extra heft and the

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.270 
carrying it and that extra heft and the
size<00:05:53.229> of<00:05:53.409> the<00:05:53.470> blade<00:05:53.680> the<00:05:53.830> shape<00:05:54.010> of<00:05:54.070> the<00:05:54.159> blade

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
size of the blade the shape of the blade

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.250 
size of the blade the shape of the blade
just<00:05:54.310> made<00:05:54.610> it<00:05:54.699> a<00:05:54.789> very<00:05:55.120> efficient<00:05:55.810> cutting

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
just made it a very efficient cutting

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.490 
just made it a very efficient cutting
tool<00:05:57.210> one<00:05:58.210> of<00:05:58.300> the<00:05:58.360> downsides<00:05:58.539> of<00:05:58.990> this<00:05:59.139> is<00:05:59.349> not

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
tool one of the downsides of this is not

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.990 
tool one of the downsides of this is not
even<00:05:59.620> the<00:05:59.770> axe<00:05:59.949> or<00:06:00.220> the<00:06:00.340> sheath<00:06:00.610> but<00:06:00.880> in

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
even the axe or the sheath but in

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.490 
even the axe or the sheath but in
particular<00:06:01.360> its<00:06:01.449> the<00:06:01.570> locking<00:06:01.990> mechanism<00:06:02.470> to

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
particular its the locking mechanism to

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.499 
particular its the locking mechanism to
the<00:06:02.620> sheath<00:06:02.889> when<00:06:03.460> I<00:06:03.490> open<00:06:03.759> it<00:06:03.820> up<00:06:03.940> you<00:06:04.120> can<00:06:04.150> see

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
the sheath when I open it up you can see

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:06.689 
the sheath when I open it up you can see
there's<00:06:05.020> a<00:06:05.080> very<00:06:05.229> small<00:06:05.409> little<00:06:06.070> peg<00:06:06.400> there

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
there's a very small little peg there

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.610 
there's a very small little peg there
and<00:06:06.940> there's<00:06:07.090> another<00:06:07.180> one<00:06:07.449> inside<00:06:07.810> and<00:06:08.139> then

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
and there's another one inside and then

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.200 
and there's another one inside and then
if<00:06:08.770> you<00:06:08.860> actually<00:06:09.130> look<00:06:09.340> at<00:06:09.460> this<00:06:09.669> section<00:06:09.940> the

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
if you actually look at this section the

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.580 
if you actually look at this section the
kind<00:06:10.360> of<00:06:10.419> door<00:06:10.630> that<00:06:10.870> closes<00:06:11.080> on<00:06:11.229> the<00:06:11.349> sheath

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
kind of door that closes on the sheath

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.159 
kind of door that closes on the sheath
you<00:06:12.070> can<00:06:12.250> see<00:06:12.490> a<00:06:12.669> hole<00:06:12.940> right<00:06:13.150> there<00:06:13.210> and<00:06:13.599> then

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
you can see a hole right there and then

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:15.959 
you can see a hole right there and then
there's<00:06:14.349> another<00:06:14.440> little<00:06:14.800> divot<00:06:15.099> inside<00:06:15.430> when

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:15.969 
there's another little divot inside when

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:17.490 
there's another little divot inside when
the<00:06:16.090> sheath<00:06:16.300> closes

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
the sheath closes

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.690 
the sheath closes
those<00:06:17.740> are<00:06:17.860> supposed<00:06:17.980> to<00:06:18.130> lock<00:06:18.310> into<00:06:18.580> place

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
those are supposed to lock into place

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.850 
those are supposed to lock into place
and<00:06:19.120> they<00:06:19.690> do<00:06:19.750> click<00:06:20.200> and<00:06:20.440> they<00:06:20.500> do<00:06:20.560> seem<00:06:20.830> to

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
and they do click and they do seem to

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.980 
and they do click and they do seem to
lock<00:06:21.130> slightly<00:06:21.850> but<00:06:22.330> it<00:06:22.420> doesn't<00:06:22.660> take<00:06:22.780> a<00:06:22.810> lot

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
lock slightly but it doesn't take a lot

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.040 
lock slightly but it doesn't take a lot
of<00:06:23.020> effort<00:06:23.380> to<00:06:23.650> just<00:06:24.220> pop<00:06:24.880> that<00:06:24.910> open<00:06:25.180> I<00:06:25.510> did

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
of effort to just pop that open I did

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.480 
of effort to just pop that open I did
find<00:06:26.290> that<00:06:26.440> when<00:06:26.590> the<00:06:26.710> axe<00:06:26.860> is<00:06:27.070> in<00:06:27.100> the<00:06:27.280> sheath

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
find that when the axe is in the sheath

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.550 
find that when the axe is in the sheath
and<00:06:27.760> this<00:06:27.940> is<00:06:28.060> hanging<00:06:28.390> on<00:06:28.540> my<00:06:28.690> belt<00:06:28.930> even<00:06:29.470> if

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
and this is hanging on my belt even if

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.620 
and this is hanging on my belt even if
this<00:06:29.650> pops<00:06:29.920> open<00:06:30.160> it's<00:06:30.940> not<00:06:31.000> like<00:06:31.180> the<00:06:31.270> axe<00:06:31.420> all

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
this pops open it's not like the axe all

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.150 
this pops open it's not like the axe all
of<00:06:31.690> a<00:06:31.720> sudden<00:06:31.930> comes<00:06:32.110> tumbling<00:06:32.500> out<00:06:32.620> but<00:06:32.950> I

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
of a sudden comes tumbling out but I

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.130 
of a sudden comes tumbling out but I
would<00:06:33.640> like<00:06:33.760> to<00:06:33.820> see<00:06:34.090> in<00:06:34.210> the<00:06:34.300> future<00:06:34.420> even

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.140 
would like to see in the future even

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.330 
would like to see in the future even
just<00:06:35.320> something<00:06:35.590> as<00:06:35.680> simple<00:06:35.800> as<00:06:35.950> make<00:06:36.160> these

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
just something as simple as make these

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.220 
just something as simple as make these
two<00:06:36.580> pegs<00:06:36.820> a<00:06:37.060> little<00:06:37.300> bit<00:06:37.420> bigger<00:06:37.570> and<00:06:38.080> then<00:06:38.200> I

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230 
two pegs a little bit bigger and then I

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.300 
two pegs a little bit bigger and then I
think<00:06:38.440> the<00:06:38.560> axe<00:06:38.740> would<00:06:38.950> have<00:06:39.100> better

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
think the axe would have better

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.850 
think the axe would have better
retention<00:06:39.610> and<00:06:40.080> this<00:06:41.080> door<00:06:41.320> would<00:06:41.590> not<00:06:41.650> be

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
retention and this door would not be

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.800 
retention and this door would not be
opening<00:06:42.280> and<00:06:42.460> closing<00:06:42.850> as<00:06:43.000> easily

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
opening and closing as easily

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.780 
opening and closing as easily
overall<00:06:44.440> the<00:06:44.590> SOG<00:06:44.770> base<00:06:44.980> camp<00:06:45.220> axe<00:06:45.400> is<00:06:45.580> getting

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
overall the SOG base camp axe is getting

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.250 
overall the SOG base camp axe is getting
a<00:06:45.850> thumbs<00:06:46.000> up<00:06:46.240> from<00:06:46.360> everyday<00:06:46.600> tactical<00:06:47.080> vids

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
I like its cutting power I like the size

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.180 
I like its cutting power I like the size

the shape the overall feel and then even

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.550 
the shape the overall feel and then even
in<00:06:51.340> general<00:06:51.640> the<00:06:51.790> look<00:06:52.030> of<00:06:52.240> the<00:06:52.450> axe<00:06:52.630> the<00:06:52.960> one

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
in general the look of the axe the one

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.140

main<00:06:53.710> downside<00:06:53.980> I've<00:06:54.310> experienced<00:06:54.700> so<00:06:54.790> far<00:06:55.000> is

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
main downside I've experienced so far is

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.850 
main downside I've experienced so far is
that<00:06:55.180> little<00:06:55.480> trapdoor<00:06:55.780> on<00:06:56.260> the<00:06:56.440> sheath<00:06:56.650> and

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:56.860 
that little trapdoor on the sheath and

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.680 
that little trapdoor on the sheath and
with<00:06:57.310> a<00:06:57.340> slight<00:06:57.610> modification<00:06:57.640> I<00:06:58.360> think<00:06:58.540> that

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
with a slight modification I think that

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.450 
with a slight modification I think that
could<00:06:58.810> be<00:06:58.840> fixed<00:06:59.110> your<00:06:59.830> price<00:07:00.010> point<00:07:00.250> is<00:07:00.370> going

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.460 
could be fixed your price point is going

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.620 
could be fixed your price point is going
to<00:07:00.550> be<00:07:00.640> a<00:07:00.670> little<00:07:00.880> bit<00:07:01.000> higher<00:07:01.210> than<00:07:01.450> your

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
to be a little bit higher than your

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.600 
to be a little bit higher than your
average<00:07:01.780> camp<00:07:02.170> axe<00:07:02.410> out<00:07:02.560> there<00:07:02.830> but<00:07:03.250> I<00:07:03.280> was

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
average camp axe out there but I was

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.890 
average camp axe out there but I was
impressed<00:07:03.970> enough<00:07:04.150> with<00:07:04.390> this<00:07:04.510> that<00:07:04.690> I'd<00:07:04.780> be

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:04.900 
impressed enough with this that I'd be

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.150 
impressed enough with this that I'd be
