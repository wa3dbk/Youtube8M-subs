important<00:01:03.270> thing<00:01:03.480> about<00:01:03.660> very<00:01:04.260> bold<00:01:04.619> lips<00:01:04.949> is

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
important thing about very bold lips is

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.910 
important thing about very bold lips is
the<00:01:05.729> outline<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.630> sure<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.080> probably<00:01:07.320> can

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the outline as I'm sure you probably can

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.469 
the outline as I'm sure you probably can
guess<00:01:08.100> I'm<00:01:08.369> using<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.760> small<00:01:09.030> concealer<00:01:09.330> brush

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
guess I'm using a small concealer brush

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.140 
guess I'm using a small concealer brush
to<00:01:09.659> get<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> sharpest<00:01:10.590> edge<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:11.189> possibly<00:01:11.850> can

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
to get the sharpest edge I possibly can

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.969 
to get the sharpest edge I possibly can
also<00:01:12.540> take<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> color<00:01:13.229> right<00:01:13.590> into<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
also take the color right into the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.440 
also take the color right into the
corner<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> mouth<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.060> careful<00:01:15.420> not

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
corner of the mouth but be careful not

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.270 
corner of the mouth but be careful not
to<00:01:15.659> add<00:01:15.780> too<00:01:15.930> much<00:01:16.140> product<00:01:16.500> there<00:01:16.799> otherwise

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
to add too much product there otherwise

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.010 
to add too much product there otherwise
it<00:01:17.460> will<00:01:17.549> look<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.759> little<00:01:17.880> like<00:01:18.299> untidy<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it will look a little like untidy and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.980 
it will look a little like untidy and
growth<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.650> Cupid's<00:01:20.040> bow<00:01:20.220> needs<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.759> as

symmetrical as possible in this look but

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.450 
symmetrical as possible in this look but
then<00:01:24.869> again<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.170> will<00:01:25.229> never<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.619> 100%<00:01:26.009> perfect

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.219 
then again it will never be 100% perfect
but<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.150> try<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.390> get<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.689> close<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.960> that

but just try and get it as close to that

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.109 
but just try and get it as close to that

about
so<00:03:30.610> then<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:31.060> mix<00:03:31.269> it<00:03:31.390> all<00:03:31.480> together<00:03:31.600> with<00:03:31.870> the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
so then you mix it all together with the

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.500 
so then you mix it all together with the
same<00:03:32.260> little<00:03:32.560> lip<00:03:32.709> brush<00:03:33.000> so<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.120> mix<00:03:34.360> it

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
same little lip brush so it mix it

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.820

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
around until it looks like a sort of

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.130 
around until it looks like a sort of
molten<00:03:36.430> gold<00:03:36.700> sort<00:03:37.269> of<00:03:37.360> consistency<00:03:38.019> like

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
molten gold sort of consistency like

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.330 
molten gold sort of consistency like
that<00:03:38.320> looks<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.560> bit<00:03:38.680> more<00:03:38.799> orange<00:03:39.070> in<00:03:39.220> there

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
that looks a bit more orange in there

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.550 
that looks a bit more orange in there
than<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:39.610> will<00:03:39.730> do<00:03:39.880> so<00:03:40.750> then<00:03:41.140> we<00:03:41.230> take<00:03:41.410> your

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
than it will do so then we take your

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.140 
than it will do so then we take your
back<00:03:41.950> on<00:03:42.130> our<00:03:42.190> lip<00:03:42.370> brush<00:03:42.580> and<00:03:42.760> we<00:03:42.910> just<00:03:43.090> go

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
back on our lip brush and we just go

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.759 
back on our lip brush and we just go
straight<00:03:43.299> into<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.959> center<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.620> bottom

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
straight into the center of the bottom

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.310 
straight into the center of the bottom
lip<00:03:45.010> first<00:03:45.370> it's<00:03:46.030> always<00:03:46.420> easier<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:46.989> start<00:03:47.200> in

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
lip first it's always easier to start in

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.930 
lip first it's always easier to start in
the<00:03:47.440> center<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:47.950> lip<00:03:48.100> and<00:03:48.340> I'm<00:03:48.610> doing

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
the center of the lip and I'm doing

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.060 
the center of the lip and I'm doing
small<00:03:49.239> dab<00:03:49.510> so<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:49.810> don't<00:03:50.049> apply<00:03:50.230> too<00:03:50.350> much<00:03:50.590> gold

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
small dab so I don't apply too much gold

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.490 
small dab so I don't apply too much gold
here<00:03:51.459> apply<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.060> gold<00:03:52.390> as<00:03:52.600> far<00:03:52.870> into<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.320> lips

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500

pinkness<00:03:55.570> is<00:03:55.840> showing<00:03:56.290> through<00:03:56.500> like<00:03:56.709> when

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
pinkness is showing through like when

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.530 
pinkness is showing through like when
you<00:03:56.920> smile<00:03:57.160> or<00:03:57.370> when<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:57.549> speak<00:03:57.790> as<00:03:58.030> you<00:03:58.330> see

you smile or when you speak as you see
here<00:03:58.780> I<00:03:58.959> follow<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.620> sort<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.310> grain<00:04:00.730> of<00:04:00.970> the

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
here I follow the sort of grain of the

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.840 
here I follow the sort of grain of the
lips<00:04:01.269> by<00:04:01.810> doing<00:04:02.110> very<00:04:02.320> small<00:04:02.650> strokes<00:04:03.100> just<00:04:03.400> so

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
lips by doing very small strokes just so

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.280 
lips by doing very small strokes just so
the<00:04:03.970> lip<00:04:04.090> is<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.209> bit<00:04:04.420> more<00:04:04.570> integrated<00:04:05.170> with

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
the lip is a bit more integrated with

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.229 
the lip is a bit more integrated with
the<00:04:05.440> style<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.310> colors<00:04:06.670> and<00:04:06.910> then<00:04:07.120> it's

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
the style and the colors and then it's

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.150 
the style and the colors and then it's
just<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.510> case<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.750> repeating<00:04:08.440> for<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.739> top<00:04:08.950> lip

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
just a case of repeating for the top lip

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.640 
just a case of repeating for the top lip
I<00:04:09.370> prefer<00:04:10.090> my<00:04:10.269> top<00:04:10.540> lip<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.840> be<00:04:10.959> slightly<00:04:11.290> less

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
I prefer my top lip to be slightly less

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.560 
I prefer my top lip to be slightly less
striking<00:04:12.040> than<00:04:12.370> my<00:04:12.459> bottom<00:04:12.730> lip<00:04:12.850> but<00:04:13.299> it<00:04:13.390> is

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
striking than my bottom lip but it is

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.140 
striking than my bottom lip but it is
all<00:04:13.840> about<00:04:14.110> your<00:04:14.380> preference<00:04:14.950> -<00:04:15.250> tada<00:04:15.760> and

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
all about your preference - tada and

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.170 
all about your preference - tada and
then<00:04:16.510> we<00:04:16.660> have<00:04:16.840> molten<00:04:17.530> black<00:04:17.890> and<00:04:18.130> gold<00:04:18.340> lips

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
then we have molten black and gold lips

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.469 
then we have molten black and gold lips
I<00:04:20.400> think<00:04:21.400> this<00:04:21.489> would<00:04:21.639> be<00:04:21.669> perfect<00:04:21.940> if<00:04:22.330> you're

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
I think this would be perfect if you're

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.300 
I think this would be perfect if you're
looking<00:04:23.139> for<00:04:23.290> a<00:04:23.320> kind<00:04:23.530> of<00:04:23.620> like<00:04:23.830> futuristic

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
looking for a kind of like futuristic

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.159 
looking for a kind of like futuristic
look<00:04:24.850> or<00:04:25.210> maybe<00:04:25.419> even<00:04:25.630> kind<00:04:25.930> of<00:04:26.020> like<00:04:26.139> a

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
look or maybe even kind of like a

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.260 
look or maybe even kind of like a
steampunk<00:04:26.590> look<00:04:27.100> I<00:04:27.220> think<00:04:27.310> black<00:04:27.699> and<00:04:27.759> gold<00:04:28.060> go

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
steampunk look I think black and gold go

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.080 
steampunk look I think black and gold go
together<00:04:28.419> so<00:04:29.020> so<00:04:29.560> well<00:04:29.800> and<00:04:30.070> you<00:04:30.580> can<00:04:30.729> even<00:04:30.880> do

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
together so so well and you can even do
