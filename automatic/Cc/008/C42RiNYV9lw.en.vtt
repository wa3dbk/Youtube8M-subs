00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.700 
on Gaikai and play it instantly pudding
is<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.070> lie<00:03:20.520> because<00:03:21.300> it<00:03:21.540> takes<00:03:21.690> mere<00:03:22.080> five

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
is a lie because it takes mere five

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.780 
is a lie because it takes mere five
minutes<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.910> make<00:03:24.000> pudding<00:03:24.390> but<00:03:25.140> Gaikai<00:03:25.790> is
