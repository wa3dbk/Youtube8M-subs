00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.040 

I've<00:00:26.109> had<00:00:26.289> a<00:00:26.320> couple<00:00:26.470> video<00:00:26.859> requests<00:00:27.460> for

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
I've had a couple video requests for

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.970 
I've had a couple video requests for
people<00:00:29.050> wanting<00:00:29.199> to<00:00:29.380> know<00:00:29.529> how<00:00:29.710> I<00:00:29.739> go<00:00:29.949> about

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
people wanting to know how I go about

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.339 
people wanting to know how I go about
doing<00:00:30.460> an<00:00:30.609> engine<00:00:30.939> break-in<00:00:31.300> well<00:00:32.199> it's

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
doing an engine break-in well it's

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.069 
doing an engine break-in well it's
really<00:00:32.469> simple<00:00:32.559> to<00:00:32.949> do<00:00:33.629> the<00:00:34.629> worst<00:00:34.840> thing<00:00:35.019> you

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
really simple to do the worst thing you

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.380 
really simple to do the worst thing you
could<00:00:35.230> do<00:00:35.320> is<00:00:35.610> rebuild<00:00:36.610> an<00:00:36.730> engine<00:00:36.820> and<00:00:37.210> then

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
could do is rebuild an engine and then

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.220 
could do is rebuild an engine and then
just<00:00:38.760> go<00:00:39.760> wide<00:00:39.970> open<00:00:40.239> throttle<00:00:40.449> and<00:00:40.750> just<00:00:40.960> ride

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
just go wide open throttle and just ride

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.049 
just go wide open throttle and just ride
it<00:00:41.350> as<00:00:41.440> hard<00:00:41.589> as<00:00:41.680> you<00:00:41.769> can<00:00:42.010> you<00:00:42.670> need<00:00:42.790> to<00:00:42.850> allow

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
it as hard as you can you need to allow

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.719 
it as hard as you can you need to allow
the<00:00:43.149> engine<00:00:43.659> to<00:00:43.989> have<00:00:44.170> time<00:00:44.470> for<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:45.129> seals

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729 
the engine to have time for the seals

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:47.790 
the engine to have time for the seals
and<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.540> piston<00:00:46.989> rings<00:00:47.170> and<00:00:47.379> everything<00:00:47.440> to

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
and the piston rings and everything to

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.130 
and the piston rings and everything to
seat<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.760> way<00:00:48.970> that<00:00:49.210> they<00:00:49.329> need<00:00:49.540> to<00:00:49.600> seat<00:00:49.930> and

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
seat the way that they need to seat and

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.459 
seat the way that they need to seat and
the<00:00:50.920> way<00:00:51.040> that<00:00:51.190> you<00:00:51.280> do<00:00:51.460> that<00:00:51.640> is<00:00:51.909> by<00:00:52.469> expansion

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
the way that you do that is by expansion

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.249 
the way that you do that is by expansion
and<00:00:53.710> contraction<00:00:53.829> through<00:00:54.460> hot<00:00:54.670> and<00:00:54.820> cold<00:00:55.259> so

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:56.259 
and contraction through hot and cold so

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:58.350 
and contraction through hot and cold so
when<00:00:57.070> I<00:00:57.100> first<00:00:57.369> build<00:00:57.610> an<00:00:57.729> engine<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.150> first

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
when I first build an engine the first

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.240 
when I first build an engine the first
thing<00:00:58.509> I<00:00:58.570> do<00:00:58.629> is<00:00:58.869> fire<00:00:59.110> it<00:00:59.290> up<00:00:59.409> and<00:00:59.619> then<00:00:59.920> I<00:00:59.949> just

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
thing I do is fire it up and then I just

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.130 
thing I do is fire it up and then I just
listen<00:01:00.850> to<00:01:01.000> it<00:01:01.150> to<00:01:01.509> see<00:01:01.659> if<00:01:01.750> there's<00:01:01.930> anything

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
listen to it to see if there's anything

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.600 
listen to it to see if there's anything
out<00:01:02.409> of<00:01:02.439> the<00:01:02.589> ordinary<00:01:02.979> right<00:01:03.250> away<00:01:03.460> if

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
out of the ordinary right away if

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.950 
out of the ordinary right away if
there's<00:01:03.820> a<00:01:03.879> misfire<00:01:04.299> or<00:01:04.330> anything<00:01:04.780> like<00:01:04.930> that

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
there's a misfire or anything like that

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.560 
there's a misfire or anything like that
if<00:01:05.320> it<00:01:05.920> sounds<00:01:06.250> okay<00:01:06.580> then<00:01:07.060> I<00:01:07.150> just<00:01:07.329> let<00:01:07.540> it

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
if it sounds okay then I just let it

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.690 
if it sounds okay then I just let it
idle<00:01:07.780> I'll<00:01:08.320> up<00:01:08.560> hit<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.280> throttle<00:01:09.670> the

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
idle I'll up hit the throttle the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.249 
idle I'll up hit the throttle the
tiniest<00:01:10.119> bit<00:01:10.390> just<00:01:10.630> enough<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:10.990> get<00:01:11.049> it<00:01:11.110> to

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
tiniest bit just enough to get it to

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.660 
tiniest bit just enough to get it to
idle<00:01:11.470> if<00:01:11.560> it<00:01:11.680> won't<00:01:11.740> idle<00:01:12.070> on<00:01:12.159> its<00:01:12.310> own<00:01:12.460> on<00:01:12.640> a

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
idle if it won't idle on its own on a

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.420 
idle if it won't idle on its own on a
cold<00:01:12.939> engine<00:01:13.530> once<00:01:14.530> it's<00:01:14.920> up<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.280> temperature

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
cold engine once it's up to temperature

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.940 
cold engine once it's up to temperature
while<00:01:15.970> idling<00:01:16.450> I<00:01:16.630> just<00:01:17.290> let<00:01:17.439> it<00:01:17.530> sit<00:01:17.710> there<00:01:17.860> in

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
while idling I just let it sit there in

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.880 
while idling I just let it sit there in
idle<00:01:18.220> for<00:01:18.340> another<00:01:18.780> 10<00:01:19.780> minutes<00:01:19.810> or<00:01:20.200> so<00:01:20.229> right

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
idle for another 10 minutes or so right

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.010 
idle for another 10 minutes or so right
around<00:01:21.070> there<00:01:21.390> once<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.570> idles

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
around there once it idles

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.570 
around there once it idles
I<00:01:23.250> shut<00:01:24.250> it<00:01:24.280> off<00:01:24.490> I<00:01:25.560> check<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.740> fluids<00:01:27.100> check

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
I shut it off I check the fluids check

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.030 
I shut it off I check the fluids check
the<00:01:27.840> gas<00:01:28.840> make<00:01:29.229> sure<00:01:29.409> that<00:01:29.560> you<00:01:29.710> didn't<00:01:29.950> need

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
the gas make sure that you didn't need

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.130 
the gas make sure that you didn't need
too<00:01:30.190> much<00:01:30.340> gas<00:01:30.640> check<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.510> radiator<00:01:31.810> make

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
too much gas check the radiator make

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.330 
too much gas check the radiator make
sure<00:01:32.260> the<00:01:32.380> coolant<00:01:32.650> level<00:01:32.680> is<00:01:32.979> still<00:01:33.159> good

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
sure the coolant level is still good

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.780 
sure the coolant level is still good
check<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.650> transmission<00:01:35.650> fluid<00:01:36.190> level<00:01:36.220> make

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
check the transmission fluid level make

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.460 
check the transmission fluid level make
sure<00:01:36.820> everything<00:01:37.300> is<00:01:37.420> still<00:01:37.600> topped<00:01:37.990> off<00:01:38.229> and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
sure everything is still topped off and

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.370 
sure everything is still topped off and
good<00:01:39.090> after<00:01:40.090> that<00:01:40.120> 15<00:01:40.690> minutes<00:01:40.900> idling<00:01:41.290> and

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
good after that 15 minutes idling and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.200 
good after that 15 minutes idling and
after<00:01:41.590> I<00:01:41.620> check<00:01:41.890> all<00:01:42.040> those<00:01:42.159> things<00:01:42.520> I<00:01:42.760> usually

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
after I check all those things I usually

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.690 
after I check all those things I usually
wait<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.420> couple<00:01:43.870> hours<00:01:44.310> for<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.400> engine<00:01:45.640> to

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
wait a couple hours for the engine to

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.760 
wait a couple hours for the engine to
cool<00:01:45.850> back<00:01:46.090> down<00:01:46.120> because<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.930> process<00:01:47.650> of

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
cool back down because the process of

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.289 
cool back down because the process of
expansion<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:48.310> contraction<00:01:48.490> is<00:01:48.940> what<00:01:49.090> breaks

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
expansion and contraction is what breaks

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.810 
expansion and contraction is what breaks
in<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.630> engine<00:01:49.960> so<00:01:50.830> if<00:01:50.979> you<00:01:51.100> fire<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:51.369> up<00:01:51.549> again

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
in the engine so if you fire it up again

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.280 
in the engine so if you fire it up again
before<00:01:52.000> it's<00:01:52.360> cooled<00:01:52.600> down<00:01:52.780> then<00:01:53.080> you're<00:01:53.200> not

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
before it's cooled down then you're not

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.170 
before it's cooled down then you're not
allowing<00:01:53.740> all<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:54.369> expansion<00:01:55.090> and

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
allowing all that expansion and

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.140 
allowing all that expansion and
contraction<00:01:55.299> to<00:01:55.690> take<00:01:55.869> place<00:01:56.760> so<00:01:57.760> after<00:01:58.030> that

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
contraction to take place so after that

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.680 
contraction to take place so after that
then<00:01:59.130> the<00:02:00.130> second<00:02:00.490> time<00:02:00.610> I<00:02:00.640> fire<00:02:00.940> it<00:02:00.970> up<00:02:01.240> I<00:02:01.420> take

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
then the second time I fire it up I take

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.660 
then the second time I fire it up I take
it<00:02:01.840> for<00:02:02.020> very<00:02:02.260> slow<00:02:02.680> like<00:02:03.040> quarter<00:02:03.400> throttle

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
it for very slow like quarter throttle

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.080 
it for very slow like quarter throttle
rides<00:02:04.119> or<00:02:04.390> so<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:05.010> I<00:02:06.010> don't<00:02:06.130> get<00:02:06.549> up<00:02:06.729> high<00:02:06.909> in

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
rides or so and I don't get up high in

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.729 
rides or so and I don't get up high in
the<00:02:07.180> gears<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:07.750> really<00:02:07.960> doesn't<00:02:08.229> matter<00:02:08.379> as

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
the gears that really doesn't matter as

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.619 
the gears that really doesn't matter as
far<00:02:08.950> as<00:02:09.280> engine<00:02:09.640> performance<00:02:10.179> but<00:02:10.390> it<00:02:10.479> will

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
far as engine performance but it will

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.020 
far as engine performance but it will
under<00:02:11.170> engine<00:02:11.709> braking<00:02:11.950> because<00:02:12.790> if<00:02:12.909> you're

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
under engine braking because if you're

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.190 
under engine braking because if you're
going<00:02:13.150> faster<00:02:13.659> and<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.810> let<00:02:13.959> off<00:02:14.080> the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
going faster and you let off the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.020 
going faster and you let off the
throttle<00:02:14.230> that's<00:02:14.739> more<00:02:14.950> force<00:02:15.250> on<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.700> engine

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
throttle that's more force on the engine

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.030 
throttle that's more force on the engine
so<00:02:16.599> I<00:02:16.629> usually<00:02:16.780> keep<00:02:17.049> it<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.260> second<00:02:17.560> don't<00:02:17.950> go

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
so I usually keep it in second don't go

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.380 
so I usually keep it in second don't go
above<00:02:18.189> second<00:02:18.549> or<00:02:18.640> third<00:02:18.819> gear<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.150> don't<00:02:19.239> go

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
above second or third gear and don't go

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.410 
above second or third gear and don't go
above<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.689> quarter<00:02:19.959> throttle<00:02:20.200> or<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:21.819> usually

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
above a quarter throttle or so I usually

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.300 
above a quarter throttle or so I usually
ride<00:02:22.689> that<00:02:22.900> for<00:02:23.170> once<00:02:23.500> again<00:02:23.769> about<00:02:23.950> 10<00:02:24.129> or<00:02:24.220> 15

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
ride that for once again about 10 or 15

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.440 
ride that for once again about 10 or 15
minutes<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.030> then<00:02:27.150> let<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.180> cool<00:02:28.299> down

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
minutes and then let it cool down

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.750 
minutes and then let it cool down
completely<00:02:28.599> again<00:02:29.319> do<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.830> same<00:02:29.860> thing<00:02:30.310> up<00:02:30.609> to

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
completely again do the same thing up to

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.379 
completely again do the same thing up to
half<00:02:30.939> throttle<00:02:31.950> same<00:02:32.950> thing<00:02:33.189> over<00:02:33.669> again<00:02:33.939> let

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:34.389 
half throttle same thing over again let

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.360 
half throttle same thing over again let
it<00:02:34.510> cool<00:02:34.659> down<00:02:34.719> and<00:02:35.109> then<00:02:35.169> up<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.650> three

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
it cool down and then up to three

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.940 
it cool down and then up to three
orders<00:02:36.610> throttle<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.180> then<00:02:38.049> up<00:02:38.319> to<00:02:38.530> full

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
orders throttle and then up to full

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.130 
orders throttle and then up to full
throttle<00:02:39.450> that's<00:02:40.450> going<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.750> total<00:02:41.049> up

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
throttle that's going to total up

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.380 
throttle that's going to total up
probably<00:02:41.590> about<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:42.310> day's<00:02:43.030> worth<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.510> riding

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
probably about a day's worth of riding

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.180 
probably about a day's worth of riding
if<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.540> ride<00:02:46.750> for<00:02:46.989> 15<00:02:47.319> minutes<00:02:47.590> quit<00:02:47.799> 50

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.710 
minutes riding for 15 minutes back and
forth<00:02:50.019> like<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:51.519> longer<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:52.420> let<00:02:52.540> that

forth like that the longer you let that

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.080 
forth like that the longer you let that
process<00:02:52.930> take<00:02:53.500> more<00:02:54.099> than<00:02:54.220> likely<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.730> longer

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
process take more than likely the longer

your<00:02:55.209> engines<00:02:55.569> going<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:56.370> stay<00:02:57.370> with<00:02:58.269> good

compression<00:02:59.549> another<00:03:00.549> thing<00:03:00.760> some<00:03:00.970> people<00:03:01.030> do

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
compression another thing some people do

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.990 
compression another thing some people do
is<00:03:01.690> they<00:03:01.989> mix<00:03:02.349> their<00:03:02.560> gas<00:03:04.290> their<00:03:05.290> gas<00:03:05.620> oil

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
is they mix their gas their gas oil

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.640 
is they mix their gas their gas oil
ratio<00:03:07.000> with<00:03:07.209> more<00:03:07.510> oil<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:08.260> don't<00:03:08.470> want

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
ratio with more oil and you don't want

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.650 
ratio with more oil and you don't want
to<00:03:08.739> do<00:03:08.829> that<00:03:09.010> because<00:03:09.250> when<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:09.879> put<00:03:10.150> more<00:03:10.420> oil

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
to do that because when you put more oil

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.900 
to do that because when you put more oil
in<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.959> gas<00:03:11.170> that<00:03:11.470> means<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:12.010> less<00:03:12.280> gas<00:03:12.670> is

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
in the gas that means that less gas is

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.190 
in the gas that means that less gas is
getting<00:03:13.180> into<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.420> carburetor<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:13.959> you're

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
getting into the carburetor and you're

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.860 
getting into the carburetor and you're
actually<00:03:14.530> making<00:03:14.709> a<00:03:15.069> lean<00:03:15.819> condition<00:03:17.069> so<00:03:18.870> when

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
actually making a lean condition so when

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.170 
actually making a lean condition so when
you<00:03:20.170> rebuild<00:03:20.650> an<00:03:20.859> engine<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.400> want<00:03:21.609> to<00:03:21.849> break

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
you rebuild an engine you want to break

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.819 
you rebuild an engine you want to break
it<00:03:22.329> in<00:03:22.480> on<00:03:22.690> whatever<00:03:22.930> mixture<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.680> whatever

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
it in on whatever mixture and whatever

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.740 
it in on whatever mixture and whatever
oil<00:03:24.190> you're<00:03:24.400> going<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.609> run<00:03:24.849> for<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.390> life<00:03:25.569> of

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
matter if you're going to change oils if

plug<00:03:52.180> chop<00:03:52.620> but<00:03:53.620> also<00:03:54.280> in<00:03:54.700> between<00:03:55.090> each<00:03:55.629> one

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
plug chop but also in between each one

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.670 
plug chop but also in between each one
of<00:03:56.139> those<00:03:56.349> sets<00:03:57.099> of<00:03:58.109> heating<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.200> quad<00:03:59.379> up<00:03:59.530> and

of those sets of heating the quad up and
cooling<00:03:59.919> down<00:04:00.099> I<00:04:00.340> pop<00:04:00.609> out<00:04:00.819> both<00:04:01.030> plugs<00:04:01.359> make

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
cooling down I pop out both plugs make

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.119 
cooling down I pop out both plugs make
sure<00:04:01.959> that<00:04:02.079> they're<00:04:02.260> looking<00:04:02.379> about<00:04:02.980> how

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
sampling a coffee stain kind of tan to

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.890 
sampling a coffee stain kind of tan to
them<00:04:06.250> if<00:04:06.430> they're<00:04:07.150> black<00:04:07.329> you're<00:04:07.660> running

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
them if they're black you're running

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.599 
them if they're black you're running
rich<00:04:08.109> or<00:04:08.410> you're<00:04:08.500> running<00:04:08.590> too<00:04:08.859> much<00:04:09.010> oil<00:04:09.220> or

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
rich or you're running too much oil or

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.129 
rich or you're running too much oil or
you're<00:04:09.849> getting<00:04:10.030> a<00:04:10.060> misfire<00:04:10.449> or<00:04:10.750> something

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
you're getting a misfire or something

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.920 
you're getting a misfire or something
like<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.799> if<00:04:11.919> they're<00:04:12.129> on<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:13.780> other

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
like that and if they're on the other

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.140 
like that and if they're on the other
end<00:04:14.109> of<00:04:14.230> that<00:04:14.290> and<00:04:14.680> they're<00:04:14.919> running<00:04:15.879> lean

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
end of that and they're running lean

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.439 
end of that and they're running lean
then<00:04:16.539> it's<00:04:16.660> going<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.870> be<00:04:17.199> a<00:04:17.760> whiter<00:04:18.760> lighter

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
then it's going to be a whiter lighter

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.879 
then it's going to be a whiter lighter
