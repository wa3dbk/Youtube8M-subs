source<00:01:09.179> you<00:01:09.899> do<00:01:10.080> have<00:01:10.229> these<00:01:10.470> um<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.610> plants

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
source you do have these um the plants

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.460 
source you do have these um the plants
here<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.390> what<00:01:13.020> would<00:01:13.110> be<00:01:13.170> really<00:01:13.410> cool

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
here so what would be really cool

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.350 
here so what would be really cool
challenge<00:01:13.950> would<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.550> survive<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.270> this

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
challenge would be to survive on this

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.480 
challenge would be to survive on this
island<00:01:15.509> without<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:16.289> off<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.649> see<00:01:17.369> how

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
island without going off and see how

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.040 
island without going off and see how
long<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.789> can<00:01:17.880> survive<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.690> where<00:01:18.899> you<00:01:18.959> can

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
long you can survive and where you can

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.380 
long you can survive and where you can
do<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.740> time<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.340> can<00:01:20.459> go<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.880> use<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.149> wood

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
do on time you can go and use the wood

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.630 
do on time you can go and use the wood
from<00:01:21.630> these<00:01:21.810> houses<00:01:22.229> eventually<00:01:23.190> we<00:01:23.310> run<00:01:23.459> out

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
from these houses eventually we run out

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.089 
from these houses eventually we run out
but<00:01:24.380> those<00:01:25.380> are<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.679> crazy<00:01:25.830> right<00:01:26.069> there

00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:26.099 
but those are going crazy right there

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:27.290 
but those are going crazy right there
but<00:01:26.340> eventually<00:01:26.399> you<00:01:26.729> everyone<00:01:26.940> else<00:01:27.060> didn't

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
but eventually you everyone else didn't

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.229 
but eventually you everyone else didn't
use<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.450> pretty<00:01:28.250> pretty<00:01:29.250> scarcely<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.970> you

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:30.239 
use that pretty pretty scarcely and you

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:31.940 
use that pretty pretty scarcely and you
don't<00:01:30.450> want<00:01:30.569> to<00:01:30.630> go<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.050> make<00:01:31.649> a<00:01:31.679> bunch<00:01:31.860> of

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
don't want to go and make a bunch of

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.040 
don't want to go and make a bunch of
gardens<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.759> would<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:32.940> cool<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.810> great

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
gardens and it would be cool the great

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.809 
gardens and it would be cool the great
idea<00:01:34.349> to<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> kind<00:01:35.160> of<00:01:35.190> challenge<00:01:35.610> on

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
idea to do like a kind of challenge on

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.279 
idea to do like a kind of challenge on
this<00:01:36.030> island<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.539> you<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:36.989> we<00:01:37.110> had

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
this island so you can see if we had

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.380 
this island so you can see if we had
this<00:01:37.470> way<00:01:37.709> there<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.489> another<00:01:38.819> island<00:01:39.239> back

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
this way there is another island back

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.330 
this way there is another island back
here<00:01:39.690> there's<00:01:40.470> pretty<00:01:40.709> much<00:01:40.770> nothing<00:01:41.009> honor

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
here there's pretty much nothing honor

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.650 
here there's pretty much nothing honor
there's<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.580> small<00:01:41.819> cave<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.179> think<00:01:42.209> but<00:01:42.599> that's

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
there's a small cave I think but that's

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.229 
there's a small cave I think but that's
