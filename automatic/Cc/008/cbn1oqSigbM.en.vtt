is born you know hard to tell us the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.800 
is born you know hard to tell us the
groundhogs<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.680> coming<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.390> it's<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.539> white

groundhogs just coming in it's so white
you<00:01:10.049> know<00:01:10.170> what<00:01:11.750> what<00:01:12.750> we're<00:01:12.869> trying<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.140> do<00:01:13.259> is

you know what what we're trying to do is

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.649 
you know what what we're trying to do is
it's<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> backflip<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.479> you're

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it's like a backflip but as you're

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.270 
it's like a backflip but as you're
flipping<00:01:15.869> you've<00:01:16.229> got<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.440> twist<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.890> well<00:01:17.039> so

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
flipping you've got to twist as well so

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.830 
flipping you've got to twist as well so
I'm<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.550> go<00:01:17.940> into<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.179> like<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.300> flip<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
I'm going to go into it like a flip and

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.690 
I'm going to go into it like a flip and
twist<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.800> come<00:01:20.130> out<00:01:20.159> pointing<00:01:20.580> this

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
twist it and come out pointing this

00:01:20.700 --> 00:02:06.780 
twist it and come out pointing this
direction<00:01:20.759> down<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.750> hill

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.370 

I've<00:02:07.790> tried<00:02:08.210> to<00:02:08.360> get<00:02:08.780> him<00:02:08.899> in<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.140> soccer

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
I've tried to get him in the soccer

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.010 
I've tried to get him in the soccer
hockey<00:02:09.770> everything<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:12.220> snowmobiling

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
hockey everything and the snowmobiling

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.920 
hockey everything and the snowmobiling
well<00:02:15.020> both<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.350> them<00:02:16.180> one<00:02:17.180> boy<00:02:17.300> was<00:02:17.720> pregnant

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
well both of them one boy was pregnant

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.020 
well both of them one boy was pregnant
she<00:02:18.170> snowmobiled<00:02:18.710> with<00:02:18.890> them<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:19.580> she<00:02:19.880> could

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
she snowmobiled with them so she could

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.670 
she snowmobiled with them so she could
basically<00:02:20.240> say<00:02:20.480> they've<00:02:20.660> had<00:02:21.350> their<00:02:21.530> whole

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
basically say they've had their whole

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:45.479 
basically say they've had their whole
life<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:23.110> can't<00:02:24.110> get<00:02:24.200> him<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.380> do<00:02:24.620> nothing<00:02:24.770> else

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.559 

when<00:02:46.489> you<00:02:46.580> start<00:02:46.849> your<00:02:46.970> snow<00:02:47.180> machine<00:02:47.209> it's

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
when you start your snow machine it's

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.509 
when you start your snow machine it's
just<00:02:47.720> sitting<00:02:47.900> there<00:02:48.110> idling<00:02:48.500> your<00:02:49.099> belt<00:02:49.340> is

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
just sitting there idling your belt is

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.819 
just sitting there idling your belt is
still<00:02:49.700> loose<00:02:49.939> in<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.599> clutches<00:02:50.840> this<00:02:51.560> clutch

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
still loose in the clutches this clutch

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.949 
still loose in the clutches this clutch
will<00:02:51.980> be<00:02:52.099> spinning<00:02:52.340> but<00:02:53.299> it<00:02:53.420> won't<00:02:53.569> grab<00:02:53.780> the

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
will be spinning but it won't grab the

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.289 
will be spinning but it won't grab the
belt<00:02:54.170> until<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:55.040> hit<00:02:55.189> in<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.400> higher<00:02:55.579> rpm<00:02:56.120> and

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
belt until you hit in a higher rpm and

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.960 
belt until you hit in a higher rpm and
the<00:02:56.390> clutch<00:02:56.739> grabs<00:02:57.739> your<00:02:57.950> belt<00:02:58.159> in<00:02:58.610> which

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
the clutch grabs your belt in which

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.410 
the clutch grabs your belt in which
drives<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.450> snow<00:02:59.659> machine

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.570 

so<00:03:06.080> there's<00:03:06.230> no<00:03:06.380> gears<00:03:06.710> you're<00:03:06.950> not<00:03:07.100> shifting

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
so there's no gears you're not shifting

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.240 
so there's no gears you're not shifting
through<00:03:08.480> gears<00:03:08.750> there's<00:03:09.020> no<00:03:09.140> clutch<00:03:09.410> you're

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
through gears there's no clutch you're

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.309 
through gears there's no clutch you're
basically<00:03:10.760> just<00:03:10.850> squeezing<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.959> throttle

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
basically just squeezing the throttle

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.990 
basically just squeezing the throttle
and<00:03:12.440> going<00:03:12.800> there<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.459> lot<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.730> different

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
and going there is a lot of different

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.550 
and going there is a lot of different
styles<00:03:14.330> tracks<00:03:14.780> like<00:03:15.050> I'm<00:03:15.200> gonna<00:03:15.319> sled<00:03:15.530> over

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
styles tracks like I'm gonna sled over

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.559 
styles tracks like I'm gonna sled over
there<00:03:15.830> that<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.040> have<00:03:16.310> it's<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.150> lot<00:03:17.300> narrower

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
there that I have it's a lot narrower

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.110 
there that I have it's a lot narrower
track<00:03:18.050> and<00:03:18.410> then<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:18.860> lugs<00:03:19.490> are<00:03:19.670> only<00:03:19.790> two

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
track and then the lugs are only two

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.270 
track and then the lugs are only two
inch<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:21.530> gives<00:03:21.770> a<00:03:22.010> little<00:03:22.160> more

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
inch so it gives a little more

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.490 
inch so it gives a little more
maneuverability<00:03:23.000> like<00:03:23.690> this<00:03:23.900> tracks<00:03:24.170> fairly

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
maneuverability like this tracks fairly

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.680 
maneuverability like this tracks fairly
wide<00:03:24.650> so<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.580> wider<00:03:25.760> something<00:03:26.180> is<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.510> more

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
wide so the wider something is the more

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.810 
wide so the wider something is the more
stable<00:03:26.810> it'll<00:03:27.290> be<00:03:27.440> I'm<00:03:28.160> not<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.430> one<00:03:28.520> I<00:03:28.580> have

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
stable it'll be I'm not the one I have

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.910 
stable it'll be I'm not the one I have
is<00:03:28.940> narrow<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:29.450> it's<00:03:29.600> easier<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.170> carve<00:03:30.770> around

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
is narrow so it's easier to carve around

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:51.320 
is narrow so it's easier to carve around
and<00:03:31.220> trees<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.760> stuff<00:03:32.270> like<00:03:32.420> that

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.470 

this<00:03:52.330> seat<00:03:52.569> is<00:03:52.750> it'll<00:03:53.530> sit<00:03:53.680> on<00:03:53.739> here<00:03:53.980> like<00:03:54.069> this

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
this seat is it'll sit on here like this

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.600 
this seat is it'll sit on here like this
when<00:03:55.480> it's<00:03:55.599> bolted<00:03:55.780> down<00:03:56.020> and<00:03:56.340> same<00:03:57.340> surface

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
when it's bolted down and same surface

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.790 
when it's bolted down and same surface
same<00:03:57.880> purpose<00:03:58.209> as<00:03:58.300> a<00:03:58.330> seat<00:03:58.599> but<00:03:59.110> it's<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.440> frame

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
same purpose as a seat but it's a frame

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.890 
same purpose as a seat but it's a frame
with<00:03:59.980> a<00:04:00.010> hole<00:04:00.250> there<00:04:00.430> so<00:04:00.550> you<00:04:00.640> can<00:04:00.730> grab<00:04:00.940> so<00:04:01.840> you

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
with a hole there so you can grab so you

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.410 
with a hole there so you can grab so you
can<00:04:02.020> do<00:04:02.110> seat<00:04:02.290> grabs<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.709> tricks<00:04:02.950> off<00:04:03.099> of<00:04:03.250> it

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
can do seat grabs and tricks off of it
