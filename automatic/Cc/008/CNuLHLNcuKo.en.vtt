00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
lights and the lights so let's take a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.490 
lights and the lights so let's take a
look<00:01:03.210> at<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> chassis<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.960> what<00:01:04.199> they've

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
look at the chassis and what they've

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.219 
look at the chassis and what they've
changed<00:01:04.880> if<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.720> take<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> look<00:01:07.110> at<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
changed if you take a look at the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.870 
changed if you take a look at the
chassis<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.770> pretty<00:01:07.979> much<00:01:08.130> looks<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> same<00:01:08.670> as

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
chassis it pretty much looks the same as

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.080 
chassis it pretty much looks the same as
the<00:01:09.060> previous<00:01:09.240> version<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.400> I<00:01:11.400> do<00:01:11.520> see<00:01:11.850> an<00:01:11.939> F

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the previous version the I do see an F

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.380 
the previous version the I do see an F
HSS<00:01:12.689> receiver<00:01:13.200> system<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.770> that's<00:01:13.950> new<00:01:14.390> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
HSS receiver system so that's new the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.870 
HSS receiver system so that's new the
radio<00:01:15.659> system<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.290> an<00:01:17.070> improvement<00:01:17.400> over<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
radio system is an improvement over the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.249 
radio system is an improvement over the
old<00:01:18.030> version<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.659> actually<00:01:19.200> a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
old version it's actually a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.370 
old version it's actually a
frequency-hopping<00:01:20.509> system<00:01:21.509> 2.4<00:01:22.140> gigahertz

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
frequency-hopping system 2.4 gigahertz

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.590 
frequency-hopping system 2.4 gigahertz
and<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:25.439> most<00:01:26.040> notable<00:01:26.479> improvement<00:01:27.479> would

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and the most notable improvement would

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.200 
and the most notable improvement would
be<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.020> brushless<00:01:28.259> system<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.979> see<00:01:29.850> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
be the brushless system I see a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.149 
be the brushless system I see a

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.880 
brushless motor it looks like a 380 size
motor<00:01:37.979> well<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.880> 380<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.750> size<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.770> it's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
motor well it's a 380 can size but it's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.840 
motor well it's a 380 can size but it's
a<00:01:40.950> little<00:01:41.040> longer<00:01:41.310> than<00:01:41.460> your<00:01:41.729> traditional

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
a little longer than your traditional

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.010 
a little longer than your traditional
380<00:01:42.600> motor<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.770> rated<00:01:44.070> at<00:01:44.360> 3000<00:01:45.360> KB<00:01:45.720> so

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
I'm going to plug that up

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.420 
I'm going to plug that up
and<00:02:12.410> we'll<00:02:13.410> take<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.590> look<00:02:13.800> at<00:02:13.980> how<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.160> lights

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
and we'll take a look at how the lights

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:29.980 
and we'll take a look at how the lights
look<00:02:19.760> all<00:02:20.760> right<00:02:20.820> got<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:22.100> plug<00:02:23.100> this<00:02:23.310> up

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:37.450 

put<00:02:30.990> that<00:02:31.200> on<00:02:31.380> there<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:33.510> turn<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.840> lights<00:02:34.050> on

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.040 

okay<00:02:38.460> so<00:02:38.520> all<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.570> headlights<00:02:39.930> and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
okay so all the the headlights and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.770 
okay so all the the headlights and
taillights<00:02:40.200> are<00:02:40.530> flashing<00:02:41.510> it's<00:02:42.510> kind<00:02:42.720> of

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
taillights are flashing it's kind of

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.500 
taillights are flashing it's kind of
strobing<00:02:43.400> maybe<00:02:44.400> they<00:02:44.640> were<00:02:44.700> going<00:02:45.090> for<00:02:45.330> the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
strobing maybe they were going for the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.710 
strobing maybe they were going for the
pace<00:02:45.720> car<00:02:45.960> look<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:47.210> as<00:02:48.210> you'll<00:02:48.390> see<00:02:48.450> the

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
pace car look and as you'll see the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.970 
pace car look and as you'll see the
taillights<00:02:48.960> are<00:02:49.260> also<00:02:49.530> struggling<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:51.980> you

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
taillights are also struggling and you

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.980 
taillights are also struggling and you
got<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.340> blue<00:02:53.520> under<00:02:53.790> glow<00:02:53.940> lights<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:54.510> the

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
got the blue under glow lights and the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.230 
got the blue under glow lights and the
amber<00:02:55.790> roof<00:02:56.790> lights<00:02:58.550> let's<00:02:59.550> see<00:02:59.700> if<00:02:59.850> we<00:03:00.030> can

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
amber roof lights let's see if we can

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.360 
amber roof lights let's see if we can
get<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.380> headlights<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.800> taillights<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.250> go

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
get the headlights and taillights to go

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.150 
get the headlights and taillights to go
solid<00:03:02.670> if<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.540> guys<00:03:03.740> don't<00:03:04.740> want<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.040> be

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
solid if you guys don't want it to be

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.600 
solid if you guys don't want it to be
flashing<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.820> maybe<00:03:06.950> not<00:03:07.950> really<00:03:08.190> fond<00:03:08.490> of

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
flashing and maybe not really fond of

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.860 
flashing and maybe not really fond of
that<00:03:08.790> roof<00:03:09.000> light<00:03:09.240> so<00:03:09.420> I'm<00:03:09.480> going<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.630> try<00:03:09.810> to

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
that roof light so I'm going to try to

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.280 
that roof light so I'm going to try to
turn<00:03:10.110> that<00:03:10.380> off<00:03:10.850> so<00:03:11.850> let's<00:03:12.510> take<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> look<00:03:13.110> in

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
turn that off so let's take a look in

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.240 
turn that off so let's take a look in
here<00:03:13.850> okay<00:03:14.850> what's<00:03:15.000> different<00:03:15.390> about<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.780> is

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
here okay what's different about this is

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.530 
here okay what's different about this is
the<00:03:17.250> receiver<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:18.240> mean<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.050> ESC<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.770> servo

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
the receiver I mean the ESC and servo

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.640 
the receiver I mean the ESC and servo
instead<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.660> running<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.020> receiver<00:03:22.470> it

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
instead of running to the receiver it

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.590 
instead of running to the receiver it
looks<00:03:22.800> like<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.100> runs<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.700> this<00:03:23.880> module<00:03:24.480> it

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
looks like it runs to this module it

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.150 
looks like it runs to this module it
looks<00:03:24.780> like<00:03:24.930> that's<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.200> central<00:03:25.680> unit<00:03:26.010> that

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
looks like that's the central unit that

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.680 
looks like that's the central unit that
controls<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:26.730> lights<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:29.090> ESC<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.390> the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
controls the lights the ESC and the

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.220 
controls the lights the ESC and the
servo<00:03:31.110> and<00:03:31.350> this<00:03:32.250> module<00:03:32.810> actually<00:03:33.810> connects

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
servo and this module actually connects

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.130 
servo and this module actually connects
to<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.650> receiver<00:03:34.770> so<00:03:35.810> I'm<00:03:36.810> just<00:03:36.959> going<00:03:37.110> to

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
to the receiver so I'm just going to

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.050 
to the receiver so I'm just going to
turn<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.500> off<00:03:37.650> before<00:03:37.890> I<00:03:38.160> start<00:03:38.730> messing<00:03:38.880> with

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
turn it off before I start messing with

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.890 
turn it off before I start messing with
some<00:03:39.300> wiring<00:03:41.630> turn<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:42.810> off<00:03:44.720> unplug<00:03:45.720> the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
some wiring turn that off unplug the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.620 
some wiring turn that off unplug the
battery<00:03:46.190> oops<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:48.590> I'm<00:03:49.590> just<00:03:49.709> going<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:49.950> see<00:03:50.190> I

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
battery oops and I'm just going to see I

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.360 
battery oops and I'm just going to see I
can<00:03:51.630> make<00:03:51.750> these<00:03:51.959> go<00:03:52.230> solid<00:03:52.560> instead<00:03:53.250> of

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
can make these go solid instead of

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.060 
can make these go solid instead of
strobing<00:03:54.380> okay<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:55.440> you're<00:03:55.680> looking<00:03:55.770> at<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
strobing okay so you're looking at the

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.920 
strobing okay so you're looking at the
chip<00:03:56.250> board<00:03:56.459> inside<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.910> body<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.330> if<00:03:57.810> you'll

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
chip board inside the body and if you'll

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.600 
chip board inside the body and if you'll
notice<00:03:58.230> it's<00:03:58.470> getting<00:03:58.770> power<00:03:58.920> from<00:03:59.220> these<00:03:59.370> two

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
notice it's getting power from these two

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.280 
notice it's getting power from these two
leads<00:03:59.880> it's<00:04:00.180> actually<00:04:00.630> plugged<00:04:00.870> into<00:04:01.050> the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
leads it's actually plugged into the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.790 
leads it's actually plugged into the
receiver<00:04:02.390> or<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.450> throttle<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.380> steering

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
receiver or the throttle and steering

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.580 
receiver or the throttle and steering
channel<00:04:05.430> on<00:04:05.520> your<00:04:05.640> receiver<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:07.350> comes

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
channel on your receiver and it comes

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.320 
channel on your receiver and it comes
out<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:08.040> you're<00:04:08.280> there's<00:04:08.790> two<00:04:08.940> more<00:04:09.090> leads

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
out and you're there's two more leads

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.010 
out and you're there's two more leads
and<00:04:09.800> your<00:04:10.800> ESC<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:11.370> steering<00:04:12.209> servo<00:04:12.600> actually

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
and your ESC and steering servo actually

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.539 
and your ESC and steering servo actually
plug<00:04:13.260> into<00:04:13.550> these<00:04:14.550> two<00:04:14.730> adapters

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
plug into these two adapters

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.020 
plug into these two adapters
so<00:04:17.329> this<00:04:17.859> box<00:04:18.859> is<00:04:19.099> actually<00:04:19.459> acting<00:04:19.849> like<00:04:19.970> a

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
so this box is actually acting like a

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.270 
so this box is actually acting like a
central<00:04:20.509> unit<00:04:20.739> distributing<00:04:21.739> power<00:04:21.949> to<00:04:22.190> your

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
central unit distributing power to your

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.080 
central unit distributing power to your
lights<00:04:22.550> and<00:04:22.789> your<00:04:23.289> serve<00:04:24.289> on<00:04:24.500> your<00:04:24.680> ESC<00:04:25.099> if<00:04:26.000> you

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
lights and your serve on your ESC if you

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.520 
lights and your serve on your ESC if you
take<00:04:26.240> a<00:04:26.270> closer<00:04:26.539> look<00:04:26.690> you'll<00:04:27.050> notice<00:04:27.379> this

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
take a closer look you'll notice this

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.510 
take a closer look you'll notice this
grid<00:04:27.860> here<00:04:27.889> with<00:04:29.289> numbers<00:04:30.289> D<00:04:30.710> one<00:04:31.009> two<00:04:31.220> three

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
grid here with numbers D one two three

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
why because it has a brushless system

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.480 
why because it has a brushless system
it's<00:06:11.780> got<00:06:11.900> the<00:06:12.110> brushless<00:06:12.350> esc<00:06:12.710> the<00:06:13.220> brushless

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
it's got the brushless esc the brushless

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.580 
it's got the brushless esc the brushless
motor<00:06:13.940> and<00:06:14.150> it's<00:06:14.840> even<00:06:15.080> lithium<00:06:15.440> polymer

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
ready so if you do throw a lipo in here

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.689 
ready so if you do throw a lipo in here
you<00:06:18.110> just<00:06:18.229> got<00:06:18.350> to<00:06:18.380> program<00:06:18.830> it<00:06:19.010> make<00:06:19.430> sure<00:06:19.460> you

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
you just got to program it make sure you

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:22.930 
you just got to program it make sure you
turn<00:06:19.850> on<00:06:20.030> that<00:06:20.210> lipo<00:06:20.510> cutoff<00:06:20.690> and<00:06:21.130> a<00:06:22.130> lot<00:06:22.760> more
