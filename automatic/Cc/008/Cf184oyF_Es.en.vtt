which<00:01:43.899> leads<00:01:44.140> me<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:44.590> my<00:01:44.619> question<00:01:44.740> of<00:01:45.369> the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
which leads me to my question of the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.639 
which leads me to my question of the
game<00:01:45.820> because<00:01:46.240> Ben<00:01:46.450> andris<00:01:46.960> said<00:01:47.229> oh<00:01:47.259> well

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
game because Ben andris said oh well

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.080 
game because Ben andris said oh well
maybe<00:01:47.859> if<00:01:48.070> you<00:01:48.159> beat<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.460> crap<00:01:48.670> out<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:48.909> this

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
maybe if you beat the crap out of this

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.209 
maybe if you beat the crap out of this
guy<00:01:49.149> doesn't<00:01:49.630> happen<00:01:49.930> again<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.649> Ben<00:01:50.859> andris

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
guy doesn't happen again and Ben andris

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:52.830 
guy doesn't happen again and Ben andris
brings<00:01:51.520> up<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.789> good<00:01:51.939> point<00:01:52.000> about<00:01:52.390> fighting

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
brings up a good point about fighting

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.660 
brings up a good point about fighting
because<00:01:53.170> it's<00:01:53.500> sort<00:01:53.799> of<00:01:53.890> like<00:01:54.039> a<00:01:54.100> vigilante

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
because it's sort of like a vigilante

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.810 
because it's sort of like a vigilante
justice<00:01:55.149> code<00:01:56.020> thing<00:01:56.590> between<00:01:56.859> players<00:01:57.460> and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
justice code thing between players and

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.029 
justice code thing between players and
even<00:01:58.390> though<00:01:58.689> I<00:01:58.719> disagree<00:01:59.079> with<00:01:59.500> fighting<00:01:59.890> I

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
even though I disagree with fighting I

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.649 
even though I disagree with fighting I
don't<00:02:00.429> think<00:02:00.520> it'll<00:02:00.820> be<00:02:00.939> in<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.179> game<00:02:01.359> for<00:02:01.630> the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
don't think it'll be in the game for the

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.529 
don't think it'll be in the game for the
long<00:02:01.899> run<00:02:02.170> but<00:02:02.799> I<00:02:03.039> get<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.789> because<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.329> seemed

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
long run but I get it because it seemed

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.840 
long run but I get it because it seemed
to<00:02:04.630> me<00:02:04.750> andris<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.590> Ron<00:02:05.799> Wilson<00:02:06.100> and<00:02:06.549> I<00:02:06.640> guess

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
to me andris and Ron Wilson and I guess

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.400 
to me andris and Ron Wilson and I guess
the<00:02:06.969> whole<00:02:07.119> he'd<00:02:07.329> spent<00:02:07.600> were<00:02:07.780> getting<00:02:08.050> mad<00:02:08.200> at

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
the whole he'd spent were getting mad at

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.560 
the whole he'd spent were getting mad at
the<00:02:08.530> non<00:02:08.710> calls<00:02:09.130> with<00:02:09.399> Tampa<00:02:09.820> and<00:02:09.970> so<00:02:10.390> they

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
the non calls with Tampa and so they

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.700 
the non calls with Tampa and so they
were<00:02:10.630> going<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.869> settle<00:02:11.200> matters<00:02:11.320> with<00:02:11.530> a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
were going to settle matters with a

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.710 
were going to settle matters with a
scrap<00:02:12.070> which<00:02:12.580> finally<00:02:13.060> brings<00:02:13.240> me<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.630> the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
scrap which finally brings me to the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.930 
scrap which finally brings me to the
question<00:02:13.800> would<00:02:14.800> fight<00:02:15.300> decrease<00:02:16.300> if<00:02:16.630> refs

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
question would fight decrease if refs

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.070 
question would fight decrease if refs
didn't<00:02:18.940> suck<00:02:19.209> because<00:02:19.450> that's<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.900> point

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
didn't suck because that's the point

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.960 
didn't suck because that's the point
isn't<00:02:20.379> it<00:02:20.560> because<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.220> thought<00:02:21.400> process

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
isn't it because the thought process

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.860 
isn't it because the thought process
seems<00:02:22.269> to<00:02:22.420> be<00:02:22.480> okay

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
seems to be okay
