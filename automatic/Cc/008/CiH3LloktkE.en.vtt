00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
in with a filler well done is I'm taking

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.179 
in with a filler well done is I'm taking
off<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.420> taken<00:00:18.420> off<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.630> lock<00:00:18.840> off<00:00:19.080> do<00:00:19.980> that

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
off the taken off the lock off do that

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.519 
off the taken off the lock off do that
that<00:00:20.970> much<00:00:22.100> should<00:00:23.840> cover<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> dent<00:00:25.260> that

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
that much should cover the dent that

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:34.700 
that much should cover the dent that
we've<00:00:25.920> got<00:00:27.380> put<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.560> lid<00:00:28.769> back<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:29.039> there<00:00:33.710> for

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
we've got put the lid back on there for

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.280 
we've got put the lid back on there for
this<00:00:34.890> much<00:00:36.950> fill<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.390> think<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.660> should<00:00:39.989> use<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
this much fill I think you should use a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.590 
this much fill I think you should use a
roughly<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
roughly this is that this is the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.510 
roughly this is that this is the
hardener<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:45.170> try<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.200> use<00:00:46.320> about<00:00:46.739> think

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
hardener so I try to use about think

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.490 
hardener so I try to use about think
about<00:00:49.520> that<00:00:50.520> much<00:00:50.700> harden<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.239> should<00:00:51.539> cover<00:00:52.170> it

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
about that much harden I should cover it

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.520 
about that much harden I should cover it
hopefully<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.719> I'm<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.289> go<00:00:55.410> ahead

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
hopefully and if I'm going to go ahead

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
painted the middle bit because the dent

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.100 
painted the middle bit because the dent
was<00:05:15.730> right<00:05:16.000> there<00:05:16.650> is<00:05:17.650> because<00:05:17.980> I<00:05:18.070> wanted<00:05:18.310> to

the<00:05:24.880> whole<00:05:25.060> tank<00:05:25.470> because<00:05:26.470> if<00:05:26.590> so<00:05:26.890> up<00:05:28.530> here<00:05:29.530> we

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
the whole tank because if so up here we

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.390 
the whole tank because if so up here we
have<00:05:29.920> it<00:05:30.100> that's<00:05:31.800> so<00:05:32.800> it's<00:05:32.950> looking<00:05:33.280> right<00:05:33.460> now

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400

learnt a lot and I'm sure there's a lot

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.500 
learnt a lot and I'm sure there's a lot
of<00:05:41.200> things<00:05:41.380> I<00:05:41.500> would<00:05:41.590> have<00:05:41.620> done<00:05:41.830> differently

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510
