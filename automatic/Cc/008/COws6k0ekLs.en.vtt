you've<00:06:40.970> got<00:06:41.240> okay<00:06:42.170> so<00:06:42.830> say<00:06:43.250> you<00:06:43.430> got<00:06:43.610> three

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
you've got okay so say you got three

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.170 
you've got okay so say you got three
squares<00:06:44.390> of<00:06:44.540> water<00:06:44.720> and<00:06:45.910> like<00:06:46.910> there's<00:06:47.120> a

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
squares of water and like there's a

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:58.110 
squares of water and like there's a
corner<00:06:47.600> here<00:06:49.990> hold<00:06:50.990> on<00:06:51.110> let<00:06:51.140> me<00:06:51.680> demonstrate<00:06:51.890> I

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.600 

have<00:06:59.120> just<00:06:59.360> made<00:06:59.510> an<00:06:59.720> infinite<00:07:00.320> water<00:07:00.560> device

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.150 

if<00:07:04.610> I<00:07:05.510> put<00:07:05.720> water<00:07:05.990> in<00:07:06.350> all<00:07:06.590> three<00:07:06.920> of<00:07:06.950> those

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 
if I put water in all three of those

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:13.930 
if I put water in all three of those
squares<00:07:10.690> actually<00:07:12.040> now<00:07:13.040> a<00:07:13.070> better<00:07:13.340> infinite

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
squares actually now a better infinite

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.340 
squares actually now a better infinite
water<00:07:14.150> device<00:07:14.540> would<00:07:14.810> probably<00:07:15.470> be<00:07:15.650> that

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:17.350 
water device would probably be that

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.840 
water device would probably be that
there<00:07:18.350> I<00:07:18.710> didn't<00:07:19.010> even<00:07:19.070> need<00:07:19.220> to<00:07:19.400> add<00:07:19.550> any<00:07:19.580> more

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.850 
there I didn't even need to add any more

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.690 
there I didn't even need to add any more
water<00:07:20.620> now<00:07:21.620> you<00:07:21.680> can<00:07:21.830> take<00:07:22.070> water<00:07:22.430> from

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:22.700 
water now you can take water from

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.930 
water now you can take water from
anything<00:07:24.100> you<00:07:25.100> know<00:07:25.220> there<00:07:25.520> and<00:07:25.730> it'll<00:07:25.850> just

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:25.940 
anything you know there and it'll just

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:33.770 
anything you know there and it'll just
it'll<00:07:26.690> just<00:07:26.960> come<00:07:27.140> right<00:07:27.380> back

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:33.780 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.029
