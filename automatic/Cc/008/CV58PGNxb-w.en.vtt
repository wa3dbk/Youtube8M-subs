00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
I'm sure the MS designer had a good time

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.510 
I'm sure the MS designer had a good time
putting<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.649> together<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.040> getting<00:02:02.310> lots

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
putting this together and getting lots

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.700 
putting this together and getting lots
of<00:02:02.700> laughs<00:02:02.939> around<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.360> office<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.930> terms<00:02:04.560> of

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
of laughs around the office in terms of

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.719 
of laughs around the office in terms of
the<00:02:04.799> waist<00:02:04.950> though<00:02:05.159> you're<00:02:05.340> not<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> be

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
the waist though you're not going to be

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.980 
the waist though you're not going to be
able<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.939> move<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> hips<00:02:06.299> they're<00:02:06.570> just<00:02:06.780> solid

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
able to move the hips they're just solid

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.529 
able to move the hips they're just solid
and<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.530> skirts<00:02:07.920> here<00:02:08.340> are<00:02:08.550> non<00:02:08.970> independent

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
and the skirts here are non independent

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.790 
and the skirts here are non independent
so<00:02:09.690> they're<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.020> going<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.259> move<00:02:10.349> like

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
so they're just going to move like

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.770 
so they're just going to move like

you've<00:03:58.350> also<00:03:58.470> got<00:03:58.770> these<00:03:58.920> gray<00:03:59.160> ones<00:03:59.370> which<00:03:59.640> I

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
you've also got these gray ones which I

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.860 
you've also got these gray ones which I
don't<00:03:59.820> really<00:04:00.000> mind<00:04:00.300> because<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:00.540> can't<00:04:00.720> make

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
don't really mind because you can't make

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.910 
don't really mind because you can't make
any<00:04:01.020> mistakes<00:04:01.170> when<00:04:01.530> you're<00:04:01.620> putting<00:04:01.800> those

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
any mistakes when you're putting those

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.680 
any mistakes when you're putting those
on<00:04:02.100> as<00:04:02.280> long<00:04:02.400> as<00:04:02.550> you<00:04:02.640> put<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.850> right<00:04:03.000> ones<00:04:03.240> in

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
on as long as you put the right ones in

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.050 
on as long as you put the right ones in
the<00:04:04.050> right<00:04:04.170> place<00:04:04.440> down<00:04:05.280> here<00:04:05.520> for<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.760> forum

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
the right place down here for the forum

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.520 
the right place down here for the forum
so<00:04:06.270> there<00:04:06.480> are<00:04:06.570> some<00:04:06.750> missing<00:04:06.959> color<00:04:07.290> wraps

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
so there are some missing color wraps

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.840 
so there are some missing color wraps
these<00:04:07.770> should<00:04:07.980> be<00:04:08.010> done<00:04:08.130> in<00:04:08.400> orange<00:04:08.670> if<00:04:08.760> you

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
these should be done in orange if you

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.280 
these should be done in orange if you
look<00:04:09.030> at<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.180> pro<00:04:09.330> painted<00:04:09.720> one<00:04:09.870> on<00:04:09.990> the<00:04:10.080> side

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
look at the pro painted one on the side

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.930 
look at the pro painted one on the side
they<00:04:10.920> could<00:04:10.980> have<00:04:11.190> gone<00:04:11.310> along<00:04:11.550> with<00:04:11.610> these

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
they could have gone along with these

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.280 
they could have gone along with these
ones<00:04:12.209> kind<00:04:12.450> of<00:04:12.570> thing<00:04:12.690> if<00:04:12.840> they<00:04:12.959> have<00:04:13.080> taken

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
ones kind of thing if they have taken

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.710 
ones kind of thing if they have taken
the<00:04:13.470> time<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:14.790> include<00:04:15.120> some<00:04:15.300> orange<00:04:15.540> pieces

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
the time to include some orange pieces

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.570 
the time to include some orange pieces
though<00:04:16.109> and<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.890> just<00:04:17.070> seems<00:04:17.250> like<00:04:17.340> this

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
though and it just seems like this

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.890 
though and it just seems like this
manipulator<00:04:18.060> is<00:04:18.209> going<00:04:18.330> to<00:04:18.390> be<00:04:18.480> coming<00:04:18.720> out<00:04:18.810> at

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
manipulator is going to be coming out at

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.810 
manipulator is going to be coming out at
a<00:04:18.960> little<00:04:19.200> bit<00:04:19.320> of<00:04:19.410> an<00:04:19.500> awkward<00:04:19.620> angle<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:20.549> that

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
a little bit of an awkward angle so that

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.190 
a little bit of an awkward angle so that
really<00:04:21.180> can't<00:04:21.359> be<00:04:21.450> helped<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:21.810> think<00:04:21.840> with<00:04:22.109> the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
really can't be helped I think with the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.290 
really can't be helped I think with the
overall<00:04:22.530> arcade

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
overall arcade

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.059 
overall arcade
but<00:04:23.900> overall<00:04:24.199> I'd<00:04:24.470> say<00:04:24.500> that<00:04:24.800> they're<00:04:24.919> really

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:25.069 
but overall I'd say that they're really

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:26.529 
but overall I'd say that they're really
positive<00:04:25.310> really<00:04:25.759> fun<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.210> easy<00:04:26.330> to

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
positive really fun and easy to

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.600 
positive really fun and easy to
transform<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.349> I<00:04:27.800> suppose<00:04:28.099> you'll<00:04:28.280> pop<00:04:28.430> those

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
transform and I suppose you'll pop those

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.490 
transform and I suppose you'll pop those
off<00:04:28.789> for<00:04:28.819> the<00:04:29.030> transformation<00:04:29.750> way<00:04:30.020> and<00:04:30.229> you

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
off for the transformation way and you

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.980 
off for the transformation way and you
can<00:04:30.680> just<00:04:30.860> pop<00:04:31.009> in<00:04:31.159> the<00:04:31.250> binders<00:04:31.639> here<00:04:32.000> which

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
can just pop in the binders here which

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.659 
can just pop in the binders here which
are<00:04:33.139> looking<00:04:33.259> really<00:04:33.680> really<00:04:33.889> sharp<00:04:34.250> I'd<00:04:34.430> say

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
are looking really really sharp I'd say

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.040 
are looking really really sharp I'd say
just<00:04:34.940> for<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.150> fact<00:04:35.389> that<00:04:35.539> they've<00:04:35.720> got<00:04:35.900> this

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
just for the fact that they've got this

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.050 
just for the fact that they've got this
gray<00:04:36.500> on<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:37.039> green<00:04:37.250> which<00:04:37.460> I'm<00:04:37.580> a<00:04:37.669> big<00:04:37.699> fan<00:04:38.030> of

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
gray on the green which I'm a big fan of

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.300 
gray on the green which I'm a big fan of
this<00:04:38.270> combination<00:04:38.900> white<00:04:39.530> seals<00:04:39.830> over<00:04:40.129> here

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
this combination white seals over here

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.740 
this combination white seals over here
these<00:04:40.460> are<00:04:40.639> some<00:04:40.789> of<00:04:40.909> the<00:04:40.970> less<00:04:41.240> off-putting

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
these are some of the less off-putting

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.180 
these are some of the less off-putting
ones<00:04:42.020> though<00:04:42.199> although<00:04:42.500> they<00:04:42.650> didn't<00:04:42.889> bend

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
ones though although they didn't bend

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.070 
ones though although they didn't bend
around<00:04:43.370> often<00:04:44.000> Bend<00:04:44.330> I<00:04:44.449> will<00:04:44.569> give<00:04:44.690> you<00:04:44.810> a<00:04:44.840> part

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
around often Bend I will give you a part

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.140 
around often Bend I will give you a part
that<00:04:45.229> bends<00:04:45.590> if<00:04:45.919> it<00:04:46.370> bends<00:04:46.580> it's<00:04:46.819> gonna<00:04:46.970> cover

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
that bends if it bends it's gonna cover

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.520 
that bends if it bends it's gonna cover
up<00:04:47.270> more<00:04:47.539> but<00:04:47.720> then<00:04:47.810> it's<00:04:47.930> more<00:04:48.110> likely<00:04:48.409> to

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
up more but then it's more likely to

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.689 
up more but then it's more likely to
come<00:04:48.680> off<00:04:48.860> so<00:04:49.039> I<00:04:49.099> suppose<00:04:49.400> that<00:04:49.550> this<00:04:49.639> is

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
come off so I suppose that this is

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.520 
come off so I suppose that this is
better<00:04:49.970> here<00:04:50.300> you<00:04:50.449> aren't<00:04:51.050> gonna<00:04:51.169> be<00:04:51.319> able<00:04:51.349> to

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
better here you aren't gonna be able to

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.020 
better here you aren't gonna be able to
move<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.800> binders<00:04:52.099> up<00:04:52.280> and<00:04:52.490> down<00:04:52.639> you<00:04:52.789> can<00:04:52.909> see

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
move the binders up and down you can see

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.700 
move the binders up and down you can see
that<00:04:53.180> it's<00:04:53.300> a<00:04:53.419> nice<00:04:53.569> smooth<00:04:54.050> slide<00:04:54.440> in<00:04:54.590> there

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
that it's a nice smooth slide in there

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.540 
that it's a nice smooth slide in there
which<00:04:54.830> is<00:04:54.860> gonna<00:04:55.039> be<00:04:55.129> used<00:04:55.340> for<00:04:55.490> the

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
which is gonna be used for the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.430 
which is gonna be used for the
transformation<00:04:56.180> and<00:04:56.330> this<00:04:56.840> gray<00:04:57.080> part<00:04:57.319> down

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
transformation and this gray part down

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.260 
transformation and this gray part down
here<00:04:57.740> at<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:57.889> end<00:04:57.919> is<00:04:58.370> actually<00:04:58.610> made<00:04:58.940> up<00:04:59.090> of

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
here at the end is actually made up of

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.610 
here at the end is actually made up of
two<00:04:59.419> parts<00:04:59.629> although<00:04:59.990> they<00:05:00.169> are<00:05:00.319> pretty

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
two parts although they are pretty

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.850 
two parts although they are pretty
nondescript<00:05:02.080> outside<00:05:03.080> of<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.229> binders<00:05:03.650> it's

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
nondescript outside of the binders it's

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.110 
nondescript outside of the binders it's
the<00:05:03.979> beam<00:05:04.129> savers<00:05:04.580> that<00:05:04.699> are<00:05:04.819> going<00:05:05.000> to

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
the beam savers that are going to

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.640 
the beam savers that are going to
provide<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.629> only<00:05:05.810> armament<00:05:06.259> here<00:05:06.469> and<00:05:06.590> you

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
provide the only armament here and you

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.990 
provide the only armament here and you
can<00:05:06.770> see<00:05:06.919> that<00:05:07.039> they're<00:05:07.219> looking<00:05:07.520> pretty<00:05:07.550> cool

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
can see that they're looking pretty cool

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.730 
can see that they're looking pretty cool
with<00:05:08.210> these<00:05:08.360> oversized<00:05:08.780> parts<00:05:09.139> there<00:05:09.379> and

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
with these oversized parts there and

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.379 
with these oversized parts there and
you've<00:05:10.069> got<00:05:10.219> nice<00:05:10.490> long<00:05:10.729> ones<00:05:11.000> here<00:05:11.150> and<00:05:11.300> these

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
you've got nice long ones here and these

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.270 
you've got nice long ones here and these
are<00:05:11.539> the<00:05:11.599> round<00:05:11.780> variety<00:05:12.289> not<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:12.680> flat<00:05:12.919> kind

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
are the round variety not the flat kind

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.700 
are the round variety not the flat kind
I'm<00:05:14.210> becoming<00:05:14.599> a<00:05:14.719> bigger<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.110> bigger<00:05:15.199> fan<00:05:15.530> of

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
I'm becoming a bigger and bigger fan of

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.409 
I'm becoming a bigger and bigger fan of
these<00:05:15.830> fist<00:05:16.219> type<00:05:16.490> manipulators<00:05:17.150> here

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
these fist type manipulators here

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.029 
these fist type manipulators here
instead<00:05:17.719> of<00:05:17.810> using<00:05:18.020> these<00:05:18.259> ones<00:05:18.560> these<00:05:18.770> ones

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
instead of using these ones these ones

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:20.350 
instead of using these ones these ones
are<00:05:19.190> great<00:05:19.370> for<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.610> weapons<00:05:19.940> and<00:05:20.090> you'll<00:05:20.210> use

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
are great for the weapons and you'll use

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.149 
are great for the weapons and you'll use
them<00:05:20.509> for<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:20.750> beam<00:05:20.870> sabers<00:05:21.349> but<00:05:21.620> I<00:05:21.650> just<00:05:22.009> if

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
them for the beam sabers but I just if

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:23.890 
them for the beam sabers but I just if
they're<00:05:22.280> gonna<00:05:22.400> give<00:05:22.580> you<00:05:22.669> a<00:05:22.699> for<00:05:22.969> outside<00:05:23.810> of

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
they're gonna give you a for outside of

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.540 
they're gonna give you a for outside of
the<00:05:23.960> dynamic<00:05:24.409> open<00:05:24.590> hand<00:05:25.039> one<00:05:25.159> if<00:05:25.280> they<00:05:25.370> want

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
the dynamic open hand one if they want

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.980 
the dynamic open hand one if they want
to<00:05:25.610> go<00:05:25.699> for<00:05:25.879> a<00:05:25.909> fifth<00:05:26.210> I'd<00:05:26.389> say<00:05:26.539> that<00:05:26.690> this<00:05:26.810> is

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
to go for a fifth I'd say that this is

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.510 
to go for a fifth I'd say that this is
probably<00:05:27.139> the<00:05:27.380> coolest<00:05:27.560> combination<00:05:28.370> they

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
probably the coolest combination they

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.969 
probably the coolest combination they
could<00:05:28.669> do<00:05:28.849> and<00:05:29.360> lots<00:05:29.990> of<00:05:30.199> attachments<00:05:30.830> which

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
could do and lots of attachments which

could do and lots of attachments which
are<00:05:31.069> going<00:05:31.159> to<00:05:31.250> be<00:05:31.310> used<00:05:31.520> in<00:05:31.669> Mobile<00:05:32.000> Suit<00:05:32.240> mode

your<00:05:47.599> jeggings<00:05:47.960> get<00:05:48.199> them<00:05:48.349> on<00:05:48.440> top<00:05:48.650> and<00:05:48.710> they

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
your jeggings get them on top and they

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.709 
your jeggings get them on top and they
can<00:05:49.159> go<00:05:49.279> for<00:05:49.490> a<00:05:49.520> ride<00:05:49.699> thanks<00:05:50.300> to<00:05:50.449> the<00:05:50.539> fact

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:50.719 
can go for a ride thanks to the fact

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:52.180 
can go for a ride thanks to the fact
that<00:05:50.810> they've<00:05:50.990> got<00:05:51.110> these<00:05:51.229> handles<00:05:51.680> which<00:05:51.949> are

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
that they've got these handles which are

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.249 
that they've got these handles which are
not<00:05:53.000> included<00:05:53.449> all<00:05:53.539> the<00:05:53.569> time<00:05:53.870> though<00:05:54.020> so<00:05:54.050> you

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:54.259 
not included all the time though so you

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:55.510 
not included all the time though so you
can<00:05:54.319> just<00:05:54.529> throw<00:05:54.680> those<00:05:54.830> in<00:05:54.979> a<00:05:55.039> zip<00:05:55.219> lock<00:05:55.279> and

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
can just throw those in a zip lock and

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.909 
can just throw those in a zip lock and
hopefully<00:05:55.789> they<00:05:55.909> won't<00:05:56.120> go<00:05:56.240> missing<00:05:56.629> I

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
hopefully they won't go missing I

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.899 
hopefully they won't go missing I
already<00:05:57.919> talked<00:05:58.099> about<00:05:58.219> the<00:05:58.460> arms<00:05:58.729> being

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:58.909 
already talked about the arms being

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:00.399 
already talked about the arms being
reason<00:05:59.300> enough<00:05:59.479> to<00:05:59.509> buy<00:05:59.750> this<00:05:59.810> kit<00:06:00.199> but

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
reason enough to buy this kit but

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:02.140 
reason enough to buy this kit but
ultimately<00:06:00.949> it's<00:06:01.219> gonna<00:06:01.370> come<00:06:01.639> down<00:06:01.849> to<00:06:02.000> this

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
ultimately it's gonna come down to this

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.390 
ultimately it's gonna come down to this
ridiculous<00:06:02.900> looking<00:06:03.169> head<00:06:03.440> and<00:06:03.620> for<00:06:03.800> me<00:06:03.889> it's
