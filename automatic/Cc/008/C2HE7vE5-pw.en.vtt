00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
rest of this video talking about the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.620 
rest of this video talking about the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
get a type of block format I think that

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.580 
get a type of block format I think that
the<00:00:31.560> block<00:00:31.800> format<00:00:32.250> would<00:00:32.610> be<00:00:32.850> good<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:34.440> most

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the block format would be good for most

these<00:01:01.170> things<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.190> vacuum<00:01:02.870> certain

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
these things and in a vacuum certain

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.750 
these things and in a vacuum certain
cards<00:01:04.170> seem<00:01:04.409> better<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.710> or<00:01:05.129> worse<00:01:05.339> than<00:01:05.640> they

are<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.720> bigger<00:01:06.900> space<00:01:07.170> i<00:01:07.439> think<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.369> would

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
are in a bigger space i think that would

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.640 
are in a bigger space i think that would
be<00:01:08.580> good<00:01:08.610> for<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.030> game<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.900> bad<00:01:10.140> thing<00:01:10.170> would

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
be good for the game one bad thing would

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.789 
be good for the game one bad thing would
be<00:01:11.060> obviously<00:01:12.060> more<00:01:12.510> money<00:01:12.780> needed<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> be

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
be obviously more money needed to be

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.520 
be obviously more money needed to be

no none of that shit I'm not saying
buying<00:02:31.110> them<00:02:31.260> fuck<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.970> will<00:02:33.120> make

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
buying them fuck that but it will make

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.910 
buying them fuck that but it will make
some<00:02:33.390> sense<00:02:33.600> so<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.870> know<00:02:34.170> which<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.800> can

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
some sense so you know which you can

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.770 
some sense so you know which you can
actually<00:02:35.070> play<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.670> think<00:02:36.240> that's<00:02:36.420> one<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
actually play I think that's one of the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.170 
actually play I think that's one of the
reasons<00:02:37.170> why<00:02:37.320> pokemon<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.160> mazda<00:02:38.790> gathering

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
reasons why pokemon and mazda gathering

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.040 
reasons why pokemon and mazda gathering
i'm<00:02:39.270> not<00:02:39.360> saying<00:02:39.540> that's<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.720> only<00:02:39.930> reason

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
i'm not saying that's the only reason

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.570 
i'm not saying that's the only reason
but<00:02:40.320> i<00:02:40.380> think<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.650> is<00:02:40.830> one<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.130> reasons

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
but i think that is one of the reasons

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.840 
but i think that is one of the reasons
why<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.330> games<00:02:42.630> have<00:02:42.990> lasted<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.100> long<00:02:44.130> now

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
why the games have lasted so long now

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.600 
why the games have lasted so long now
Yugi<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.600> consider<00:02:46.530> pretty<00:02:46.800> damn<00:02:47.040> fortunate

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
Yugi I consider pretty damn fortunate

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.950 
Yugi I consider pretty damn fortunate
that<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.790> has<00:02:47.970> lasted<00:02:48.360> as<00:02:48.450> long<00:02:48.480> as<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.840> has

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
that it has lasted as long as it has

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.440 
that it has lasted as long as it has
every<00:02:49.950> tournament<00:02:50.370> most<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.090> them<00:02:51.240> at<00:02:51.420> least

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
every tournament most of them at least

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.220 
every tournament most of them at least
our<00:02:53.060> advanced<00:02:54.060> format<00:02:54.390> does<00:02:54.810> anybody<00:02:55.200> even

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
our advanced format does anybody even

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.580 
our advanced format does anybody even
play<00:02:55.620> traditional<00:02:56.930> exactly<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.080> don't<00:02:58.530> think

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
play traditional exactly I don't think

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.260 
play traditional exactly I don't think
that<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.220> advanced<00:02:59.550> format<00:02:59.970> should<00:03:00.150> be

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
that the advanced format should be

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.510 
that the advanced format should be
abolished<00:03:00.510> immediately<00:03:01.140> no<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:01.530> think<00:03:02.010> that

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
abolished immediately no I think that

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.980 
abolished immediately no I think that
the<00:03:02.670> block<00:03:02.880> format<00:03:03.270> should<00:03:03.450> at<00:03:03.600> least<00:03:03.720> be

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
the block format should at least be

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.810 
the block format should at least be
introduced<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:04.860> would<00:03:05.340> say<00:03:05.490> one<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.700> the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
introduced I would say one of the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.240 
introduced I would say one of the
biggest<00:03:06.000> issues<00:03:06.540> with<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.900> game<00:03:07.110> one<00:03:07.980> there's

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
biggest issues with the game one there's

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.730 
biggest issues with the game one there's
really<00:03:08.490> no<00:03:08.700> consideration<00:03:09.180> set<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:10.020> set<00:03:10.230> sure

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
really no consideration set to set sure

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.040 
really no consideration set to set sure
you<00:03:10.980> can<00:03:11.160> debut<00:03:11.940> an<00:03:12.180> hour<00:03:12.270> type<00:03:12.510> here<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:12.960> then

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
you can debut an hour type here and then

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.870 
you can debut an hour type here and then
in<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.230> next<00:03:13.380> set<00:03:13.710> you<00:03:14.100> can<00:03:14.280> put<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.760> like<00:03:14.850> a

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
in the next set you can put it like a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.480 
in the next set you can put it like a
card<00:03:15.240> that's<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.540> portion<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.840> our<00:03:15.960> type<00:03:16.200> but<00:03:16.710> it

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
card that's a portion of our type but it

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.740 
card that's a portion of our type but it
doesn't<00:03:17.790> seem<00:03:17.940> like<00:03:17.970> there's<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.450> lot<00:03:18.690> of

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
doesn't seem like there's a lot of

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.810 
doesn't seem like there's a lot of
consideration<00:03:19.530> for<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:20.010> format<00:03:20.459> that<00:03:20.490> you're

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
consideration for the format that you're

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.990 
consideration for the format that you're
in<00:03:20.940> right<00:03:21.150> because<00:03:22.050> you<00:03:22.170> have<00:03:22.350> cards<00:03:22.860> way<00:03:23.610> back

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
in right because you have cards way back

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.990 
in right because you have cards way back

when that are usable index today if

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.310 
when that are usable index today if
they're<00:03:27.480> not<00:03:27.510> banned<00:03:27.870> or<00:03:28.050> something

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
they're not banned or something

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.280
