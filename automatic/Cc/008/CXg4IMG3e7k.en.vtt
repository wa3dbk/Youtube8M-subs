so yeah I think I might have another
exam<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.830> week<00:00:28.980> after<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:30.260> then<00:00:31.260> yeah

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and then I might have to frustrate a bit

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.729 
and then I might have to frustrate a bit
