00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.570
 let's start with a 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.700
 small introduction to what has been programmed and subdivisions and artist books 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.959
 the how can you see in this project that is very small is one is a set 2 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.640
 case has only one level 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.289
 we can not see what we have on top floor 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:21.400
 low level 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.400
 we have a series of disappointments 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.589
 we have some elevations 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.629
 yes some this 3d definition elements 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.260
 not like m 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.390
 No perspective cut 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.460
 in with his thinking he is a prisoner we want him to know how to ride a 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.320
 quiet 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.470
 you what we have to understand is that here each includes a program 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.200
 the irp that got rid of planes 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.220
 in which usually there will already be a series of examples 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.410
 these examples 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.410
 and they come with the girl you can obviously throw away 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.000
 but for the moment we're going to leave them and we're just going to pull a new set 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.500
 Of elements 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.800
 here what is important to recognize are two main groups that are the 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.030
 drawing sets 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.250
 cole planes 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.250
 i the masters that are paper sizes 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.700
 and the different sheet designs that the user can have 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.610
 percent to be able to assemble a plan 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.810
 I want to start with the master, they generate our own paper 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.420
 let's burn a paper is going to call three 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.940
 for example 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.940
 which can be a double letter size that interests us 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.640
 when entering here what we are going to see is that there is a specific size but 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.220
 that size does not necessarily add three 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.300
 that's why it's very important 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.160
 and the definitions to be able to have 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.020
 the exact measurements that the paper will have 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.960
 in this case we are going to give you 3 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.200
 i margins is the limitation a printer has to use paper 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.610
 full 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.660
 in this case they are 15 millimeters per edge if costs are greatly exaggerated 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.100
 they can avoid it 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.100
 so that the guti area of ​​the paper 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.140
 be a little wider use as much as possible because the existing 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.109
 obviously you can choose vertical horizontal paper 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:19.799
 we have the paper redefined in size 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.079
 and everything inside the 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.709
 of boxes ue 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.579
 is going to print correctly because you were 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.579
 depending on the printer you have, you can 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.739
 or not have this conflict 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.409
 within the role of the master we have the option 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:41.119
 to draw those things that we want to be common as a paper background 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.739
 in this case today as an example for saying that the wounded to a plot 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.689
 if the one of the color that I want is an example simply 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.480
 yes the one that can serve to put a frame more 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:58.909
 more stylized 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.909
 but that could be 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:01.860
 percent 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.860
 then the design of eminem and poster 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:09.329
 that here for example efe I'm going to 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.719
 to suppress these points 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:15.149
 to be able to apply 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:17.219
 a curvature 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.590
 and in this way, I have some specific design 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.359
 percent in addition to this then you can and 10 percent 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.359
 use these same elements to go to put 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:35.829
 in some lines that will allow me to put my titles a memento series 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.139
 obviously this is because the same user is a 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.229
 I'm not denying the overall design that they have vih my very flat stance 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.319
 I can influence texts 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.499
 efe texts 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.499
 personal as your project 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.999
 meant and filling in some more advanced variables for example 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:06.999
 put a text with the right mouse button 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:13.509
 to be able to be this information variables of projects of plane or of 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:14.359
 system 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.789
 a critical system variable the date 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.799
 for example date to the arcane 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.930
 yes then automatically with your cap this line 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.490
 is going to put the date 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.490
 of the day the plan is printed automatically 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:33.710
 once designed the master 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.449
 usually my plans 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.440
 for which percent supports 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.660
 although it ignores the planes that are contained as well as example 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.410
 I'm going to put a new group 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.410
 or they are new because it was bad right now 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:56.180
 in st for example is a double or ardor the planes that interest me can be 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.770
 new plane 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.620
 I have to confirm what kind of master I'm going to support, obviously I'm interested in using 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.599
 the master 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.809
 to three for example 

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:11.659
 and I generate the note min where the background is the master 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.089
 therefore everything that was in it in the master 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:20.400
 percent to be in red tone that does not mean that you know how to print red 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.539
 is simply a way of indicating what belongs to the most 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:29.449
 so that if I like some of the masters had to return to the master 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.389
 and edit it right here 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.389
 if for example an idea that could have 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:40.490
 I want a background perspective for all the plans I will place drawing 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.210
 external 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.860
 and is that he took a kiva thesis of this project 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:49.439
 let's take some 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.490
 i in this element 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.509
 wolf and climb 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.470
 to a size can be 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.849
 percent obviously 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:01.849
 integrated inside of my flat foot 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:06.710
 and once the position the perspective then to return to the plane 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.189
 and it can happen to pull 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:13.779
 all the documents that you want to include in the plan for example if you want a 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:15.409
 plant jaló 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:17.330
 Paco loco 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.669
 i will not teach all the information that is part of that 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.969
 now it is important to see how we can 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.759
 reduce the area 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:30.129
 of selecting a drawing 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:31.469
 in such a way 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:35.959
 that only included those details of the full stretch that I 

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:37.960
 interesting for this element 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.699
 these to this plan 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.320
 in this case it did not include the entire skull but only one of the 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.449
 modules 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:49.470
 in turn, percent of the kia market to the planes and decide what 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:51.659
 Additionally 

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:53.899
 I require percent 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:57.369
 maybe a section 

00:06:57.369 --> 00:06:59.149
 another section 

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:04.299
 these elements the with the arrow that can be in this can be accommodated to the 

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:07.759
 be 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:11.729
 5 also include drawings as per hundred 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:14.979
 perspective elements or two 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:16.039
 in this case 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:19.270
 I'm going to put him in the palleter spain 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.839
 but exceeds the size of the sheet 

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:23.659
 Thus 

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:25.499
 selected the drawing 

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:27.319
 and I go 

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:29.759
 drawing definitions 

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:33.180
 team changes the kiss scale decided that this element 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.009
 leave each one at 200 

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:41.129
 so that it is already of a size that I can incorporate it into 

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:45.379
 emile yao of documents 

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:47.279
 'I do want' another additional plane
