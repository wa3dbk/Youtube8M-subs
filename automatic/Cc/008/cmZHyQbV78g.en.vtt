to practice with me on the different

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.760 
to practice with me on the different
patterns<00:03:03.630> probably<00:03:04.630> three<00:03:05.020> four<00:03:05.410> sometimes

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770

five<00:03:06.040> hours<00:03:06.520> a<00:03:06.550> day<00:03:06.959> right<00:03:07.959> now<00:03:08.140> it's<00:03:08.380> probably

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
five hours a day right now it's probably

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.650 
five hours a day right now it's probably
maybe<00:03:08.950> three<00:03:09.310> hours<00:03:09.459> in<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.820> given<00:03:09.850> week<00:03:10.270> that<00:03:10.630> I

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
maybe three hours in a given week that I

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.630 
maybe three hours in a given week that I
actually<00:03:10.930> spend<00:03:11.320> on<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.500> link<00:03:11.709> but<00:03:11.890> now<00:03:12.040> I've

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
actually spend on a link but now I've

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.550 
actually spend on a link but now I've
learned<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.090> practice<00:03:13.510> for<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.959> quality

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
learned to practice for the quality

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.660 
learned to practice for the quality
instead<00:03:15.100> of<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.310> quantity<00:03:19.380> in<00:03:20.520> about<00:03:21.520> two

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
instead of the quantity in about two

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:30.290 
instead of the quantity in about two
hours<00:03:21.850> in<00:03:22.090> evolving<00:03:22.450> sensor<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.110> then<00:03:28.560> yes

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
hours in evolving sensor and then yes

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.370 
hours in evolving sensor and then yes
this<00:03:31.300> is<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.480> full-time<00:03:31.750> job

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
this is a full-time job

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.020 
this is a full-time job
there's<00:03:32.800> no<00:03:32.980> reason<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.340> practice<00:03:33.760> she<00:03:33.880> just

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
there's no reason to practice she just

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.550 
there's no reason to practice she just
bought<00:03:34.180> Goodwin<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.570> left<00:03:34.810> wall<00:03:34.989> that's

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
bought Goodwin the left wall that's

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.170 
bought Goodwin the left wall that's
everybody<00:03:35.860> else<00:03:36.040> thinks<00:03:36.280> anyway<00:03:36.550> so<00:03:36.610> let's

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
everybody else thinks anyway so let's

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.610 
everybody else thinks anyway so let's
just<00:03:37.360> do<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:40.570> know<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:41.320> try<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.530> stay

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
just do that you know I try to stay

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.160 
just do that you know I try to stay
sharp<00:03:42.070> you<00:03:42.580> know<00:03:42.610> I<00:03:42.700> think<00:03:43.060> it's<00:03:43.300> more<00:03:43.420> quality

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
sharp you know I think it's more quality

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.960 
sharp you know I think it's more quality
versus<00:03:44.500> quantity<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:45.190> it<00:03:45.340> just<00:03:45.519> depends<00:03:45.790> on

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
versus quantity so it just depends on

00:03:45.970 --> 00:04:14.180 
versus quantity so it just depends on
you<00:03:46.209> know<00:03:46.330> how<00:03:46.360> my<00:03:46.600> game<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:46.930> at<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.140> time

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.229 

spend<00:04:15.190> a<00:04:15.250> little<00:04:15.430> more<00:04:15.610> time<00:04:15.850> on<00:04:15.910> length

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
spend a little more time on length

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.620 
spend a little more time on length
making<00:04:16.510> sure<00:04:16.660> everything<00:04:17.080> is<00:04:17.640> sharp<00:04:18.640> feels

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
making sure everything is sharp feels

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.539

the most personable I can I can possibly

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
be because out here on tour you can't be

be because out here on tour you can't be
one-dimensional<00:04:48.100> so<00:04:49.000> I'm<00:04:49.930> working<00:04:50.200> really

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
one-dimensional so I'm working really

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.630 
one-dimensional so I'm working really
hard<00:04:50.560> on<00:04:50.830> getting<00:04:50.860> my<00:04:51.130> game<00:04:51.310> better<00:04:51.520> and
