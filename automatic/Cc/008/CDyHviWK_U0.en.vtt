00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.160
 hard to say when I started 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.350
 to paint because I paint for that 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:02.059
 always since I was a small memory of 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:06.890
 have loved to draw to do full things 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:12.649
 of animal people did them in a 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.810
 horrible way however it was it was beautiful and the 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.420
 meaning that has changed as well as having 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.960
 acquired a bit of technique over time 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.990
 sense of painting I don't believe those that 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.479
 they say you paint only for yourself 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.350
 I don't know if I can conceive 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.350
 personally painting as a fact 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.280
 only personnel seconded from the 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.170
 communication 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.960
 I love the movies everybody knows the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.159
 television, however, and looking at an image 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.450
 fixed that you learn to travel 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.450
 in the image go deep and to the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.950
 at the same time they are recovered with 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.149
 items you need to travel 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.149
 inside oneself 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:01.189
 these are the secret corner of the corner 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.469
 of the poetry of music is a place 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.930
 small closed a little like the corner of the 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.750
 children under the table hidden in the 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.269
 room in his little room the child yes 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.950
 closes and the corner is found I believe that 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.950
 let it be the same for me too 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.820
 when we talk about titles we talk about 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.390
 periods 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:27.250
 I think it's hard for me to define 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:31.850
 of the periods there has always been a thread 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.970
 I believe constant or at least after 25 years 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.920
 which was what let's call it 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.020
 social 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.459
 this last production would say 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:47.690
 someone here is the shears and I do it 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:50.989
 I wanted to call the new poor because it is 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.450
 a picture that represents the problem 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.340
 today's at the bottom of this one 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.160
 fracture between the increasingly rich and 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:03.400
 always less bourgeois and always poorer 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.970
 critics argue that i 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.530
 poor new poor are unpainted 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.580
 completely because looking for 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:16.360
 I leave this identity to them 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.460
 personally and it doesn't matter if I do 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.330
 I feel more with the new poor 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.790
 beyond how much money we have 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.900
 I feel because there is a search for 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.110
 identity because they will be the ones to solve 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.200
 the problem of the future tomorrow will not 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.900
 really those in their comfort 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.270
 they do not realize the change 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.060
 once I did things to her to laugh 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:48.010
 even in the evening when it worked 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.890
 guitar and not like now and it doesn't matter 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:55.380
 what comes does not matter if a beautiful thing 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:59.880
 or if something sighed if something 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:05.890
 improvised is still a little bit 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:10.570
 in my reality there is everything in it 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:14.620
 the idea of ​​the march is in everyone 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.810
 of rights arose from an activity that took place 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:23.460
 he was doing with the guys in the group 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:27.640
 a network group open to everyone where 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.669
 young authors directors the actors are 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:35.580
 went to live the experience on the street 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:39.580
 interviewing beggars homeless 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.460
 window cleaner taking their place for 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.110
 live the experience of the marginalized 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.260
 naturally they came back to me 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.720
 model to offer me their experience 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.110
 also physically with attitudes 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:57.640
 etc. and while he was drawing he came 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.610
 out of this idea to take those that 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:05.380
 they had really fought for rights 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:08.470
 of others and make a huge canvas was 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:12.850
 a bit of a way to bring them together if 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:16.750
 that is, we want to show that even i 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:19.210
 big and small could all stay 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.880
 in the imagination of all and making history 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.320
 alike 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:29.520
 a canvas of six meters where they are at first 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:33.630
 were depicted of the characters who 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:37.680
 alas there are no more and then from now on 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.060
 then each show is invited a 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.520
 eminent character who has 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.010
 really fought for 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.080
 rights of others 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:50.150
 it is photographed and for the next show 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.150
 I retract it on the canvas 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:07.180
 I don't know when you started the relationship 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:09.820
 arts sciences or when I am 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.220
 realized that I was not just an artist 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.320
 the beginning 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:19.510
 let's say I dedicated myself to something else at 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:22.500
 social because I had an undeserved 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.660
 success as an artist for which 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:31.180
 professionalism is what in others 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:36.640
 times I would have called wanting I would 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:38.650
 called voluntary it professionalises it 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.720
 ii I dedicated myself to speech therapy at 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:45.670
 psychomotricity then I chose in that field 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.550
 to take care of training more than 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:51.360
 of therapy because it seemed to me 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:55.390
 correct to do only one of two things 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:59.350
 when the voice abandons you 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:02.470
 you feel more yourself and look in 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.540
 others a compromise you are looking for in the 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.880
 the less obvious relationship you are looking for 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.520
 the most sincere emotion more 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:14.470
 intrusive glow circles in the emotion that 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:18.100
 you don't know how to contain it 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:21.520
 insufficient thought in a thought a 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:26.260
 a bit disturbing of a tomorrow that is not 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:28.980
 only 2 of the people who do it anyway 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.880
 part of you 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.880
 that life 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:47.720
 that dream is an art that is born and ultimately 

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:47.720
 die with you
