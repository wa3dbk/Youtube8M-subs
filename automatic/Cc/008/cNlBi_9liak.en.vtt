00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
I didn't wanna spend too much time on

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.440 
I didn't wanna spend too much time on
these<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.820> looks<00:01:54.770> because<00:01:55.770> um<00:01:56.240> it's<00:01:57.240> not

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
these on the looks because um it's not

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.590 
these on the looks because um it's not
something<00:01:58.040> that<00:01:59.040> has<00:01:59.250> changed<00:01:59.549> way<00:02:00.090> too<00:02:00.150> much

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
something that has changed way too much

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.580 
something that has changed way too much
it's<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.340> about<00:02:02.340> having<00:02:02.540> pieces<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.869> studs

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it's just about having pieces and studs

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.340 
it's just about having pieces and studs
I<00:02:04.740> usually<00:02:05.460> don't<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.509> all<00:02:07.049> that

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
I usually don't really like the all that

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.840 
I usually don't really like the all that
having<00:02:08.300> having<00:02:09.300> all<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.660> studs<00:02:10.069> but<00:02:11.069> um<00:02:11.400> I

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
having having all the studs but um I

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.790 
having having all the studs but um I
guess<00:02:12.239> it's<00:02:12.600> fine<00:02:12.810> sometimes<00:02:14.569> so<00:02:15.569> yeah<00:02:16.230> that's

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
guess it's fine sometimes so yeah that's

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.300 
guess it's fine sometimes so yeah that's
about<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.870> for<00:02:18.870> our<00:02:18.930> reviews<00:02:19.830> we<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.160> tell

playability<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:45.000> don't<00:02:45.780> know<00:02:45.900> nah<00:02:46.230> we<00:02:46.440> could

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
playability I don't know nah we could

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.070 
playability I don't know nah we could
say<00:02:46.739> makes<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.610> legs<00:02:47.790> walk<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.390> that's<00:02:48.780> not

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
say makes the legs walk so that's not

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.050 
say makes the legs walk so that's not
the<00:02:49.350> best<00:02:49.380> feature<00:02:50.100> because<00:02:50.580> here<00:02:50.819> you<00:02:50.940> know

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
the best feature because here you know

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.479 
the best feature because here you know
anything<00:02:51.360> there's<00:02:52.170> some<00:02:52.410> things<00:02:53.100> like<00:02:53.250> this

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
anything there's some things like this

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.800 
anything there's some things like this
you<00:02:54.120> can<00:02:54.269> have

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
you can have

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.350 
you can have
movements<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:55.980> then<00:02:56.579> we<00:02:56.760> can<00:02:56.910> play<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.120> by

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
movements and then we can play it by

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.400 
movements and then we can play it by
yourself<00:02:57.750> but<00:02:57.930> here<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.470> it's<00:02:59.310> just<00:03:00.320> it<00:03:01.320> just

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
yourself but here this it's just it just

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.120 
yourself but here this it's just it just
doesn't<00:03:01.880> work<00:03:02.880> correctly<00:03:03.209> like<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:04.130> once

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
doesn't work correctly like I once

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.130 
doesn't work correctly like I once
preferred<00:03:05.519> to<00:03:05.640> have<00:03:05.730> something<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.810> turn<00:03:06.989> the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
preferred to have something to turn the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.500 
preferred to have something to turn the
head<00:03:07.350> instead<00:03:07.739> of<00:03:07.859> having<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.220> move<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.120> head

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
head instead of having to move the head

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.509 
head instead of having to move the head
that<00:03:10.079> half<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.530> time<00:03:10.709> doesn't<00:03:11.070> return

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
that half of the time doesn't return

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.259 
that half of the time doesn't return
well<00:03:12.320> so<00:03:13.320> yeah<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.880> would<00:03:14.880> have<00:03:14.970> much<00:03:15.209> rather

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
well so yeah I would have much rather

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.449 
well so yeah I would have much rather
like<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:17.660> little<00:03:18.660> kind<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.870> discipline

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
like a little kind of discipline

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.080 
like a little kind of discipline
now<00:03:21.459> here<00:03:21.849> we<00:03:22.030> have<00:03:22.060> a<00:03:22.450> little<00:03:22.920> opening

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
now here we have a little opening

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.809 
now here we have a little opening
opening<00:03:25.090> that's<00:03:25.540> not<00:03:25.719> your<00:03:25.900> opening<00:03:26.819> like

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
opening that's not your opening like

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.619 
opening that's not your opening like
this<00:03:29.700> actually<00:03:30.700> I'm<00:03:30.969> just<00:03:31.150> going<00:03:31.389> to<00:03:31.480> go<00:03:31.540> ahead

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
this actually I'm just going to go ahead

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.149 
this actually I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:03:31.840> show<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.019> here<00:03:32.769> we<00:03:32.859> have<00:03:32.889> a<00:03:33.010> little

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
and show you here we have a little

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.729 
and show you here we have a little
opening<00:03:33.639> that's<00:03:34.030> very<00:03:34.359> basic<00:03:34.930> hard<00:03:35.469> to<00:03:35.560> put<00:03:35.709> a

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
opening that's very basic hard to put a

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.449 
opening that's very basic hard to put a
figure<00:03:35.920> in<00:03:36.189> and<00:03:36.430> if<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:37.109> make<00:03:38.109> a<00:03:38.189> piece<00:03:39.189> fall

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
figure in and if you make a piece fall

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.050 
figure in and if you make a piece fall
off<00:03:39.579> it's<00:03:39.819> not<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.239> easiest<00:03:40.689> to<00:03:41.379> take<00:03:41.409> it<00:03:41.650> out

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
off it's not the easiest to take it out

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.869 
off it's not the easiest to take it out
meanwhile<00:03:43.060> here<00:03:43.329> we<00:03:43.540> have<00:03:43.689> an<00:03:44.349> opening<00:03:44.859> and<00:03:45.069> an
