00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
spots that the base fits flush you also

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.350 
spots that the base fits flush you also
want<00:00:33.830> to<00:00:33.860> make<00:00:34.010> sure<00:00:34.040> that<00:00:34.430> your<00:00:34.640> case<00:00:34.970> split

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
want to make sure that your case split
