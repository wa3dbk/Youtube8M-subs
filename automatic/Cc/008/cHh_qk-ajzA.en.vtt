that's<00:00:56.030> where<00:00:56.900> the<00:00:56.990> gas<00:00:57.170> tank<00:00:57.610> situated<00:00:58.610> 37

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
that's where the gas tank situated 37

that's where the gas tank situated 37
litre<00:00:59.420> gas<00:01:00.320> tank<00:01:00.820> so<00:01:01.820> you<00:01:01.910> can<00:01:02.210> fill<00:01:02.990> it<00:01:03.080> to

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
litre gas tank so you can fill it to

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.150 
litre gas tank so you can fill it to
about<00:01:04.480> 32<00:01:05.480> or<00:01:05.750> 33<00:01:06.110> liters<00:01:06.680> because<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:06.980> allow

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
about 32 or 33 liters because it allow

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.590 
about 32 or 33 liters because it allow
10%<00:01:08.120> for<00:01:08.680> expansion<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:11.750> it's<00:01:11.870> a<00:01:11.900> five-door

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
10% for expansion so it's a five-door

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.980 
10% for expansion so it's a five-door
once<00:01:14.600> you<00:01:14.660> get<00:01:15.340> to<00:01:16.340> where<00:01:16.700> inertia<00:01:17.240> seatbelts
