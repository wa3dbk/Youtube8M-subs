mountain

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.400 
mountain
you<00:00:44.400> keep<00:00:44.670> jumping<00:00:44.870> and<00:00:45.870> then<00:00:45.990> you<00:00:46.140> hit<00:00:46.320> this

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
you keep jumping and then you hit this

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.930 
you keep jumping and then you hit this
building<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.280> try<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.640> hit<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
building and you have to try and hit the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.880 
building and you have to try and hit the
roof<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.330> building<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.650> fall

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
roof of that building and then you fall

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.050 
roof of that building and then you fall
down<00:00:50.040> to<00:00:50.250> hear<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.520> might<00:00:50.670> take<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> few

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
down to hear it might take you a few

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.670 
down to hear it might take you a few
tries<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:51.980> I've<00:00:52.980> done<00:00:53.220> it<00:00:53.310> quite<00:00:53.490> a<00:00:53.550> few<00:00:53.700> times

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
tries but I've done it quite a few times

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.280 
tries but I've done it quite a few times
and<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.250> route<00:00:56.580> is<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.480> lot<00:00:57.780> easier<00:00:57.960> than

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
and then the route is a lot easier than

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.590 
and then the route is a lot easier than
before<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:59.130> want<00:00:59.310> to<00:00:59.400> do<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.850> just<00:00:59.910> stay

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
before we want to do is just stay

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.740 
before we want to do is just stay
grounded<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.640> then<00:01:02.640> kind<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.390> want<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.630> go

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
grounded and then kind of want to go

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.710 
grounded and then kind of want to go
into<00:01:03.900> if<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.260> will<00:01:04.380> ditch<00:01:04.830> over<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:05.730> and<00:01:06.540> make

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
into if it will ditch over here and make

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
into if it will ditch over here and make
sure<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.050> stay<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.320> them<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.950> now<00:01:08.550> you<00:01:08.610> should
