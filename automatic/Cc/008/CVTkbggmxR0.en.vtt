my<00:00:51.660> opinion<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:53.399> best<00:00:53.579> way<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.910> do<00:00:54.149> front

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
my opinion the best way to do front

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.779 
my opinion the best way to do front
squats<00:00:54.840> actually<00:00:55.590> even<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.430> take<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
squats actually even if you can take a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.240 
squats actually even if you can take a
clean<00:00:57.180> grip<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.750> clean<00:00:58.469> grip<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.770> like<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> power

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
clean grip a clean grip is like a power

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.330 
clean grip a clean grip is like a power
clean<00:00:59.750> this<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.930> probably<00:01:01.260> better<00:01:01.739> because

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
clean this is probably better because

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.250 
clean this is probably better because
it's<00:01:02.520> much<00:01:02.789> less<00:01:03.059> stressful<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.750> your<00:01:03.960> elbow

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
it's much less stressful on your elbow

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.070 
it's much less stressful on your elbow
and<00:01:04.909> eventually<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.330> catch<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.990> you

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
and eventually it can catch up to you

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.440 
and eventually it can catch up to you
the<00:01:07.680> more<00:01:07.890> traditional<00:01:08.580> grip<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.030> take

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the more traditional grip you can take

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.070 
the more traditional grip you can take
is<00:01:09.799> the<00:01:10.799> cross<00:01:11.100> body<00:01:11.520> grip<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.930> actually

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
is the cross body grip I don't actually

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.679 
is the cross body grip I don't actually
really<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:14.760> several<00:01:15.270> reasons

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
really like that one for several reasons

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.810 
really like that one for several reasons
I'm<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.990> show<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.200> why<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.310> still<00:01:17.610> some

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
I'm going to show you why but still some

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.399 
I'm going to show you why but still some
people<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.540> put<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.810> bar<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.229> Krita

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
people do it so you put the bar in Krita

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.530 
people do it so you put the bar in Krita
still<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> shoulder<00:01:20.130> shelf<00:01:20.400> put<00:01:21.119> them<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.390> your

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
still a shoulder shelf put them on your

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.660 
still a shoulder shelf put them on your
front<00:01:21.840> deltoid<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.890> cross<00:01:23.159> your<00:01:23.310> hands

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
front deltoid and you cross your hands

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.780 
front deltoid and you cross your hands
to<00:01:23.790> stabilize<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.979> step<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.220> move<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.549> I

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
to stabilize and step just move it I

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.940 
to stabilize and step just move it I
look<00:01:27.509> at<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> bag<00:01:27.960> because<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.380> want<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.650> invest

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
look at the bag because I want to invest

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.520 
look at the bag because I want to invest
as<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> point<00:01:29.340> later

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.930 

there<00:01:37.530> are<00:01:37.620> several<00:01:37.830> reasons<00:01:38.130> why<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.850> don't

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
there are several reasons why I don't

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.600 
there are several reasons why I don't
really<00:01:39.510> like<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.020> position<00:01:40.680> look<00:01:41.340> at<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
really like that position look at the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.820 
really like that position look at the
position<00:01:41.910> of<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.060> scapula<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.930> creating<00:01:43.650> a

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
position of the scapula it's creating a

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.790 
position of the scapula it's creating a
rounded<00:01:44.640> upper<00:01:45.090> back<00:01:45.270> position<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.410> can't

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
rounded upper back position so you can't

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.910 
rounded upper back position so you can't
create<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.490> strong<00:01:47.940> base<00:01:48.300> here<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.230> as<00:01:49.380> fatigue

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
create a strong base here so as fatigue

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.180 
create a strong base here so as fatigue
set<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:51.210> will<00:01:51.450> around<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.650> that

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
set in you will around that and that

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.970 
set in you will around that and that
will<00:01:53.400> become<00:01:53.550> hard<00:01:54.120> on<00:01:54.390> your<00:01:55.080> upper<00:01:55.320> spine<00:01:55.530> and

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
will become hard on your upper spine and

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.410 
will become hard on your upper spine and
you<00:01:56.310> will<00:01:56.430> actually<00:01:56.520> start<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.150> keel<00:01:57.390> over

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
you will actually start to keel over

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.510 
you will actually start to keel over
forward<00:01:58.080> so<00:01:58.320> that's<00:01:58.500> not<00:01:58.650> good<00:01:58.920> that's<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
forward so that's not good that's the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.290 
forward so that's not good that's the
first<00:01:59.760> reason

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
first reason

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.510 
first reason
the<00:02:00.540> second<00:02:00.930> reason<00:02:01.080> is<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.650> cannot<00:02:02.100> use

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the second reason is that you cannot use

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.550 
the second reason is that you cannot use
your<00:02:02.790> upper<00:02:03.210> body<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.540> help<00:02:03.930> yourself<00:02:04.440> and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
your upper body to help yourself and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.590 
your upper body to help yourself and
that<00:02:05.040> won't<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.550> made<00:02:05.760> into<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> full<00:02:06.330> body

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
that won't be made into a full body

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600 
that won't be made into a full body
movement<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.500> third<00:02:07.770> reason<00:02:08.010> is<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.280> you

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
movement the third reason is that you

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.669 
movement the third reason is that you
are<00:02:08.700> really<00:02:08.880> not<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.540> stable<00:02:09.840> here<00:02:10.320> because

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
are really not that stable here because

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.130 
are really not that stable here because
let's<00:02:11.490> for<00:02:11.700> exact<00:02:11.970> let's<00:02:12.120> go<00:02:12.270> it's<00:02:12.600> half<00:02:12.840> your

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
let's for exact let's go it's half your

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.320 
let's for exact let's go it's half your
sweating<00:02:13.500> your<00:02:13.800> shirt<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.190> where<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.209> bow

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
sweating your shirt is where the bow

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.760 
sweating your shirt is where the bow
will<00:02:15.510> tend<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.870> slip<00:02:16.110> away<00:02:16.290> from<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:16.709> you

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
will tend to slip away from you if you

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.650 
will tend to slip away from you if you
don't<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.070> don't<00:02:17.160> have<00:02:17.340> any<00:02:17.520> stability<00:02:18.120> so

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
don't you don't have any stability so

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.570 
don't you don't have any stability so
you<00:02:19.080> won't<00:02:19.320> be<00:02:19.500> as<00:02:19.590> strong<00:02:19.920> with<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.280> grip

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
you won't be as strong with that grip

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.390 
you won't be as strong with that grip
and<00:02:20.730> it's<00:02:21.330> not<00:02:21.720> as<00:02:21.900> safe<00:02:22.320> for<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.010> upper<00:02:23.250> back

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
and it's not as safe for the upper back

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.850 
and it's not as safe for the upper back
whereas<00:02:24.180> if<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.540> use<00:02:24.570> like<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.590> with<00:02:25.709> the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
whereas if you use like that with the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.370 
whereas if you use like that with the
straps<00:02:26.330> your<00:02:27.330> shoulder<00:02:27.690> blades<00:02:27.959> will<00:02:28.230> be

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
straps your shoulder blades will be

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.500 
straps your shoulder blades will be
pulled<00:02:28.709> down<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.250> compressed<00:02:30.030> against<00:02:30.330> your

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
pulled down and compressed against your

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.360 
pulled down and compressed against your
creating<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.900> strong<00:02:31.200> base<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.709> push<00:02:31.920> up<00:02:32.100> from

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
creating a strong base to push up from

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.610 
creating a strong base to push up from
so<00:02:32.970> that's<00:02:33.090> actually<00:02:33.450> much<00:02:33.570> safer<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
so that's actually much safer and the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.130 
so that's actually much safer and the
last<00:02:34.830> grip<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.459> use<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.970> exactly<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> same<00:02:36.990> as

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
last grip to use is exactly the same as

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.840 
last grip to use is exactly the same as
in<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.590> power<00:02:37.830> clean<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:38.520> or<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> push<00:02:39.360> press

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
in a power clean so or a push press

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
in a power clean so or a push press
creating<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.910> shoulder<00:02:42.269> shell<00:02:42.570> for<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
creating a shoulder shell for the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.180 
creating a shoulder shell for the
shoulders<00:02:43.260> elbows<00:02:43.739> forward<00:02:45.950> here<00:02:46.950> and

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
shoulders elbows forward here and

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.180 
shoulders elbows forward here and
squatting<00:02:48.090> down<00:02:50.090> that's<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.239> now<00:02:52.170> as<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:53.070> can

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
squatting down that's it now as you can

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.560 
squatting down that's it now as you can
see<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:56.100> have<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.250> pretty<00:02:56.610> good<00:02:56.670> flexibility

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
see you have a pretty good flexibility

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.870 
see you have a pretty good flexibility
for<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.870> guy<00:02:57.989> your<00:02:58.260> size<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.800> with<00:02:59.459> your<00:02:59.640> harm

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
for a guy your size and with your harm

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.030 
for a guy your size and with your harm
length<00:03:00.090> but<00:03:00.690> even<00:03:01.019> new<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.350> have<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> problem

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
length but even new you have a problem

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.460 
length but even new you have a problem
putting<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.850> bar<00:03:03.030> on<00:03:03.269> your<00:03:03.420> shoulders<00:03:03.750> now<00:03:04.170> as

putting the bar on your shoulders now as

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.560 
putting the bar on your shoulders now as
the<00:03:04.950> weight<00:03:05.160> gets<00:03:05.430> heavier<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:06.120> will<00:03:06.420> be

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
the weight gets heavier it will be

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.660 
the weight gets heavier it will be
compressed<00:03:07.170> into<00:03:07.560> reaching<00:03:07.890> your<00:03:08.220> shoulder

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
compressed into reaching your shoulder

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.580 
compressed into reaching your shoulder
but<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.360> will<00:03:09.540> create<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.930> tremendous<00:03:10.080> amount

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
but that will create a tremendous amount

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.710 
but that will create a tremendous amount
of<00:03:10.620> stress<00:03:10.860> on<00:03:11.010> your<00:03:11.070> elbow<00:03:11.489> joint<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.390> for<00:03:12.690> a

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
muscle that's not the best position over

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.120 
muscle that's not the best position over
time<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.420> can<00:03:18.600> take<00:03:18.810> its<00:03:18.989> toll<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:19.739> unless

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
time it can take its toll so unless
