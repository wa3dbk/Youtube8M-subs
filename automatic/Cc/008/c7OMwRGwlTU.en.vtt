25<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:23.190> the<00:01:23.220> ps4<00:01:23.670> figured<00:01:24.360> i'd<00:01:24.510> go<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.930> this

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
25 on the ps4 figured i'd go with this

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.800 
25 on the ps4 figured i'd go with this
year<00:01:25.470> since<00:01:26.010> i<00:01:26.160> will<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.550> playing<00:01:26.760> 15<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
year since i will be playing 15 on the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.280 
year since i will be playing 15 on the
ps4<00:01:28.320> primarily<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.670> then<00:01:30.270> something<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.140> keep

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
ps4 primarily and then something to keep

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.700 
ps4 primarily and then something to keep
in<00:01:31.440> mind<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:32.100> had<00:01:32.369> two<00:01:32.880> covers<00:01:33.600> i<00:01:33.900> guess<00:01:34.140> for

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
in mind we had two covers i guess for

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.820 
in mind we had two covers i guess for
men<00:01:34.890> 25<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:35.850> gen<00:01:36.180> 3<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.810> was<00:01:36.960> Barry<00:01:37.259> Sanders

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
men 25 so on gen 3 it was Barry Sanders

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.910 
men 25 so on gen 3 it was Barry Sanders
on<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.280> cover<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.820> Jan<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.660> Adrian<00:01:40.350> Peterson

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
on the cover on Jan for Adrian Peterson

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.700 
on the cover on Jan for Adrian Peterson
because<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.700> are<00:01:41.880> playing<00:01:42.240> gin<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.080> figured

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
because we are playing gin for I figured

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.590 
because we are playing gin for I figured
I'd<00:01:43.890> use<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.130> Vikings<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.940> take<00:01:45.150> on<00:01:45.360> that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
I'd use the Vikings and take on that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.380 
I'd use the Vikings and take on that
challenge<00:01:45.920> kind<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.130> rough<00:01:47.460> offense<00:01:48.090> and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
challenge kind of a rough offense and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.480 
challenge kind of a rough offense and
team<00:01:48.630> aside<00:01:49.080> from<00:01:49.290> AP<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:49.980> he's<00:01:50.220> definitely

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
last 10 11 12 months so there isn't a

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.160 
last 10 11 12 months so there isn't a
lot<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.640> specific<00:02:09.239> stuff<00:02:09.540> that<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:10.019> really

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
lot of specific stuff that I can really

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.530 
lot of specific stuff that I can really
delve<00:02:10.470> into<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.070> explain<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.150> won't

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
delve into and explain that you won't

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.930 
delve into and explain that you won't
already<00:02:12.989> have<00:02:13.230> on<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.590> top<00:02:13.769> of<00:02:13.950> your<00:02:14.070> head<00:02:14.130> but

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
already have on the top of your head but

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.880 
already have on the top of your head but
a<00:02:14.970> huge<00:02:15.330> thing<00:02:15.630> here<00:02:15.989> as<00:02:16.140> we<00:02:16.290> are<00:02:16.440> playing<00:02:16.739> on

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
a huge thing here as we are playing on

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.090 
a huge thing here as we are playing on
the<00:02:16.980> ps4<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.000> guess<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.750> motion<00:02:19.380> system<00:02:19.860> so

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
the ps4 is I guess the motion system so

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.789 
the ps4 is I guess the motion system so
on<00:02:20.220> gen<00:02:20.489> 3<00:02:20.820> there<00:02:21.480> was<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.750> infinity<00:02:22.260> engine<00:02:22.410> 2

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
on gen 3 there was the infinity engine 2

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.060 
on gen 3 there was the infinity engine 2
point<00:02:23.100> 0<00:02:23.280> on<00:02:23.549> gen<00:02:24.269> 4<00:02:24.690> there<00:02:25.320> was<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.650> ignite

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
point 0 on gen 4 there was the ignite

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.820 
point 0 on gen 4 there was the ignite
engine<00:02:26.370> which<00:02:26.940> EA<00:02:27.510> was<00:02:27.780> able<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.230> use<00:02:28.470> because

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
engine which EA was able to use because

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.070 
engine which EA was able to use because
of<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.340> upgraded<00:02:30.000> power<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.510> compatibility

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
of the upgraded power and compatibility

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.729 
of the upgraded power and compatibility
with<00:02:31.500> those<00:02:32.190> next<00:02:32.640> gen<00:02:32.820> systems<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.410> did

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
with those next gen systems but it did

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.250 
with those next gen systems but it did
kind<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.310> make<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.700> player<00:02:35.970> movement<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.870> bit

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
kind of make the player movement a bit

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.100 
kind of make the player movement a bit
rough<00:02:37.620> with<00:02:37.650> true<00:02:38.370> step<00:02:38.730> though<00:02:39.060> for<00:02:39.330> men<00:02:39.480> 15

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
rough with true step though for men 15

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.670 
rough with true step though for men 15
it<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:40.910> revamped<00:02:41.910> in<00:02:42.180> kind<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.600> got<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:43.080> mesh<00:02:43.440> of

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
it is revamped in kind of got a mesh of

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.520 
it is revamped in kind of got a mesh of
what<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.310> was<00:02:44.489> on<00:02:44.730> gen<00:02:44.940> 3<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.360> gen<00:02:45.570> 4<00:02:45.900> but<00:02:46.290> right

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
what it was on gen 3 and gen 4 but right

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.720 
what it was on gen 3 and gen 4 but right
here<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.370> players<00:02:47.670> do<00:02:48.030> move<00:02:48.360> well<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.200> it

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
here the players do move well and it

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.880 
here the players do move well and it
better<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.390> tackle<00:02:50.810> animations<00:02:51.409> are<00:02:51.620> good

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
better the tackle animations are good

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.520 
better the tackle animations are good
but<00:02:52.550> then<00:02:52.760> there<00:02:52.970> also<00:02:53.000> are<00:02:53.659> some<00:02:53.989> troubles

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
but then there also are some troubles

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.380 
but then there also are some troubles
when<00:02:54.830> players<00:02:55.250> are<00:02:55.489> cutting<00:02:55.879> and<00:02:56.060> making

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
when players are cutting and making

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.149 
when players are cutting and making
adjustments<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:57.230> I'm<00:02:57.349> sure<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.620> lot<00:02:57.769> of<00:02:57.950> you

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
adjustments and I'm sure a lot of you

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.490 
adjustments and I'm sure a lot of you
guys<00:02:58.220> have<00:02:58.340> experienced<00:02:59.239> that<00:02:59.510> stuff<00:02:59.930> but

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
guys have experienced that stuff but

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.920 
guys have experienced that stuff but
anyway<00:03:00.890> also<00:03:01.489> if<00:03:01.760> we're<00:03:01.970> talking<00:03:02.120> about<00:03:02.480> modes

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
anyway also if we're talking about modes

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.350 
anyway also if we're talking about modes
and<00:03:03.290> connected<00:03:03.890> franchise<00:03:04.159> you<00:03:05.090> weren't<00:03:05.269> able

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
and connected franchise you weren't able

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.020 
and connected franchise you weren't able
to<00:03:05.569> be<00:03:06.230> an<00:03:06.410> owner<00:03:06.680> of<00:03:06.830> a<00:03:07.040> team<00:03:07.280> with<00:03:07.519> that<00:03:07.730> stuff

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
to be an owner of a team with that stuff

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.820 
to be an owner of a team with that stuff
and<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.299> could<00:03:08.599> move<00:03:09.080> them<00:03:09.410> to<00:03:09.680> different

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
and you could move them to different

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.339 
and you could move them to different
cities<00:03:10.340> so<00:03:11.060> if<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.390> wanted<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.780> take<00:03:11.989> a<00:03:12.019> team

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
cities so if you wanted to take a team

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.650 
cities so if you wanted to take a team
and<00:03:12.620> move<00:03:12.799> them<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.220> Toronto<00:03:13.849> or<00:03:14.030> London<00:03:14.480> or

and move them to Toronto or London or

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.720 
and move them to Toronto or London or
something<00:03:15.140> like<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.349> you<00:03:16.129> were<00:03:16.250> able<00:03:16.430> to

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
something like that you were able to

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.670 
something like that you were able to
make<00:03:16.849> that<00:03:16.910> decision<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.840> have<00:03:18.170> some<00:03:18.440> control

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
make that decision and have some control

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.399 
make that decision and have some control

connected careers but I didn't get into
that<00:03:28.849> a<00:03:29.030> lot<00:03:29.359> but<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:29.930> know<00:03:30.049> there<00:03:30.379> are<00:03:30.530> some

that a lot but I know there are some
people<00:03:30.890> who<00:03:31.250> enjoyed<00:03:31.849> it<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.269> definitely<00:03:32.720> had

people who enjoyed it and definitely had
a<00:03:33.260> lot<00:03:33.349> of<00:03:33.530> fun<00:03:33.829> with<00:03:34.010> that<00:03:34.250> and<00:03:34.519> then<00:03:34.910> also<00:03:35.120> as

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
a lot of fun with that and then also as

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.140 
a lot of fun with that and then also as
far<00:03:35.480> as<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.200> other<00:03:36.349> main<00:03:36.650> mode<00:03:36.920> but<00:03:37.640> it<00:03:37.940> was

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
far as the other main mode but it was

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.400 
far as the other main mode but it was
definitely<00:03:38.420> changed<00:03:39.260> we<00:03:39.500> had<00:03:39.769> a<00:03:40.129> lot<00:03:40.519> of<00:03:40.549> big

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
definitely changed we had a lot of big

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.259 
definitely changed we had a lot of big
adjustments<00:03:42.410> first<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.549> foremost<00:03:43.760> the

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
adjustments first and foremost the

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.660 
adjustments first and foremost the
overalls<00:03:44.780> they<00:03:45.140> started<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.590> lot<00:03:45.829> lower<00:03:46.160> and

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
overalls they started a lot lower and

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.400 
overalls they started a lot lower and
it's<00:03:46.849> going<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.180> continue<00:03:47.239> on<00:03:47.810> with<00:03:47.989> that<00:03:48.109> path

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
it's going to continue on with that path

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.979 
it's going to continue on with that path
for<00:03:48.709> future<00:03:49.099> months<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:49.549> assume<00:03:50.000> but<00:03:50.660> that<00:03:50.870> was

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
for future months I assume but that was

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.770 
for future months I assume but that was
a<00:03:51.019> huge<00:03:51.349> change<00:03:51.709> from<00:03:51.950> men<00:03:52.250> 12<00:03:52.640> men<00:03:52.940> 13<00:03:53.510> with

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
a huge change from men 12 men 13 with

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.409 
a huge change from men 12 men 13 with
ultimate<00:03:54.230> team<00:03:54.590> not<00:03:55.280> having<00:03:55.880> a<00:03:56.030> bunch<00:03:56.209> of

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
ultimate team not having a bunch of

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.020 
ultimate team not having a bunch of
crazy<00:03:56.630> 99s<00:03:57.470> or<00:03:57.620> anything<00:03:58.040> like<00:03:58.069> that<00:03:58.280> day<00:03:58.730> one

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
crazy 99s or anything like that day one

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.059 
crazy 99s or anything like that day one
and<00:03:59.299> then<00:03:59.750> also<00:03:59.959> we<00:04:00.319> did<00:04:00.530> have<00:04:00.829> the

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
and then also we did have the

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.120 
and then also we did have the
collections<00:04:01.849> I<00:04:02.090> guess<00:04:02.329> not<00:04:02.690> as<00:04:02.900> good<00:04:03.290> hacks

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
collections I guess not as good hacks

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.000 
collections I guess not as good hacks
maybe<00:04:04.880> not<00:04:05.150> as<00:04:05.419> effective<00:04:06.109> though<00:04:06.530> some<00:04:06.919> of

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
maybe not as effective though some of

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.159 
maybe not as effective though some of
that<00:04:07.130> is<00:04:07.310> due<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:07.669> the<00:04:07.700> overalls<00:04:08.329> and<00:04:08.630> that's

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
that is due to the overalls and that's

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.259 
that is due to the overalls and that's
definitely<00:04:09.650> something<00:04:09.950> they<00:04:10.340> worked<00:04:10.639> on<00:04:10.970> and

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
definitely something they worked on and

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.360 
definitely something they worked on and
i<00:04:11.329> believe<00:04:11.630> is<00:04:11.870> more<00:04:12.200> balanced<00:04:12.739> in<00:04:12.859> madden<00:04:13.250> 15

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
i believe is more balanced in madden 15

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.319 
i believe is more balanced in madden 15
ultimate<00:04:14.150> team<00:04:14.419> but<00:04:15.079> there<00:04:15.380> was<00:04:15.709> i<00:04:16.099> guess<00:04:17.060> some
