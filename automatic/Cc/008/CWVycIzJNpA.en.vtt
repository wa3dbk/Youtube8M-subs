00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.970
 anyone 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.490
 in a minecraft map like I wanted 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.950
 for the decoration of my zoo that 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.190
 it was the winning map of the top 5 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.440
 rabah but must magazine in videos and 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.600
 now I'm going to do this here that is 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.059
 put an image on a map as well as 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.230
 This is the god of Olympus craft 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:49.900
 this is a few bathrooms the logo of the 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.019
 bathrooms that serves very well for economies 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.270
 and from a public place or for example is 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.370
 difficult of reptiles 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.800
 it's pretty good that I'm going 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.870
 well honey like this one that I have here in the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.700
 hand that from sharp not something like that and what 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.299
 first they have to do 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.590
 then to say is to make a new world of 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:19.460
 brands and we give you save and exit and 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.500
 We believe that we can create a new 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.200
 world here I already had this place erase 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.479
 because the tutorial starts but it 's something 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.690
 bad so the new world is left and let's go 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.260
 to put 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.260
 maps maps 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.500
 let's create a world we hope that 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.710
 dry of this 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.370
 and then I'll leave the download link 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.620
 of the email map x which is a program that 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.720
 does not weigh much so it's necessary to 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.229
 do this from the maps is pretty 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.720
 easy 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.200
 Now wait for me to leave the world and 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.759
 I tell them how 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.759
 generating land still 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.770
 The first thing we have to do is to 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.470
 let's have the map created is the map in the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.970
 world is better because the whole the 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.140
 world created what we are going to do is 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:16.340
 make a map like that is not so creative 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.340
 fuck had to be the street of these 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.900
 he did not turn back because I put it in 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.299
 his game well we are now yes in the 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.709
 creative world and as I said the new thing that 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.750
 we have to do is castell to the map and 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.079
 that is not so educational let's grab 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.650
 paper now if we are here we can 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.840
 do it team I hope 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.500
 it's easy and thanks for watching 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.150
 anyhow as it is we did not get here the 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.519
 compass and this here 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.740
 well what are we going to punish our 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.470
 Map 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.810
 which is with paper around 8 o'clock 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.250
 I grabbed 1 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.250
 thanks to our map 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.340
 A) Yes 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.500
 that is to say something covered 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.800
 we put paper around 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.110
 and the compass in the middle not as we have 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.930
 our map is what we are going to see 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:22.310
 reveal it so that it shows me 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:25.140
 the area is waiting for all to be revealed 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.810
 we were brave we waited 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.620
 and what has been revealed what we are going to 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.069
 to do is close minecraft so let's 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.170
 minimize then and let's go to percentage 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.900
 app data present that of these brands 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.910
 they all arrived they know it I created the 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.060
 awaken all 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.910
 we are going roaming 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.430
 already the folder point come let's go to 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.549
 the maps 26 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.870
 and we look for our map that is our 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:59.900
 world as chips we give data and 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.329
 here is going to say urban map 0 point is 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.969
 the map that we just revealed now what 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:09.049
 what we are going to do is open our email 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:11.599
 system we're going to open it that I did not have it 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:16.160
 prepared but good maybe and meis tuma 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:18.430
 ppd we open in this system px and the 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.430
 application 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.010
 let's wait for it to open 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.690
 you'll see that a pretty easy tutorial and 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.690
 pretty good as well as the heads 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.910
 let's give an open frame that is this 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.550
 let's give file and open 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.650
 here we will choose the place where you are 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.120
 located our image that we want here 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.920
 in this case to use this stay here 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.560
 which is the one of the thorn that I did 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.470
 thrown by its 800 subs we are going to give 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.030
 open and that's how you 're going to see the truth 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.620
 is that he does not know very well but it's because 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.890
 does not have all the colors well so 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.090
 he named black makes him green but that's what 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.450
 that there is no good from afar 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.060
 then we will give it to 6 and here it goes to 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.430
 say rather goes with 0 points if it's the 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.270
 first map that we reveal is 0 without the 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.410
 second 1 and so on we are not going to 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.800
 let them be saved on the desktop and 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.440
 save 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.789
 we closed this and here we are going to have this 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.550
 thing here the dot image format 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:29.400
 we go to the data folder where 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.180
 we had this and we put in the image 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.990
 point we substitute it and now we're going to 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.980
 our other minecraft is to the matitas 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.980
 and our world 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.560
 and all here we have the red one of our 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.740
 Map 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.020
 it's good enough we can do it 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.320
 many equation things with this that 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.770
 for example we do not have our 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:02.280
 entrance so our gateway and 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.840
 here we put it is not contemplated that is what 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.000
 necessary so that you see water and the map 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.000
 by the cold of the entrance 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:14.689
 but we put a frame item in the entry 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:19.219
 and the map does not and there is angry in the 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:20.530
 entrance doing everything tutorial I hope 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:23.629
