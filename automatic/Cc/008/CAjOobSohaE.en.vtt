00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.249 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.719> what<00:00:00.870> you<00:00:01.129> see<00:00:02.129> on<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.310> tour<00:00:02.639> today

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:03.259 
I think what you see on the tour today

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.920 
I think what you see on the tour today
is<00:00:04.259> almost<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.220> fruition<00:00:05.460> of<00:00:05.850> what<00:00:06.810> we

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
is almost the fruition of what we

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.680 
is almost the fruition of what we
started<00:00:07.350> out<00:00:07.529> over<00:00:07.950> 10<00:00:08.189> years<00:00:08.400> ago<00:00:08.690> to

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
started out over 10 years ago to

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.070 
started out over 10 years ago to
construct<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.260> state<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.830> art<00:00:11.010> school<00:00:12.080> to

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080

students<00:00:15.379> and<00:00:16.379> do<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.949> in<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.760> manner<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.660> which

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
students and do it in a manner in which

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.130 
students and do it in a manner in which
we<00:00:19.109> tried<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.770> achieve<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.369> goals<00:00:20.609> and

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
we tried to achieve the goals and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.470 
we tried to achieve the goals and
directives<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.439> what<00:00:23.010> came<00:00:23.279> out<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.939> program

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
directives of what came out of a program

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.050 
directives of what came out of a program
of<00:00:24.810> getting<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.680> school<00:00:25.980> built<00:00:26.279> with<00:00:26.519> natural

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
of getting a school built with natural

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.109 
of getting a school built with natural
light<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.570> ventilation<00:00:28.730> cited<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.849> such<00:00:30.090> a

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
light with ventilation cited in such a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.060 
light with ventilation cited in such a
way<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.420> would<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.050> least<00:00:31.260> impact<00:00:31.470> on

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
way that would have the least impact on

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.430 
way that would have the least impact on
people<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.730> think<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:33.600> talked<00:00:33.899> about<00:00:34.170> going

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
people I think we talked about going

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.220 
people I think we talked about going
through<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.420> sighting<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> school<00:00:36.960> and

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
through the sighting of the school and

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.920 
through the sighting of the school and
why<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.829> put<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.129> when<00:00:38.309> we<00:00:38.460> did<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.629> we

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
why we put it when we did is that we

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.450 
why we put it when we did is that we
certainly<00:00:40.440> didn't<00:00:40.680> want<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.950> do<00:00:41.100> what

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
certainly didn't want to do what

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.910 
certainly didn't want to do what
happened<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.940> Lowell<00:00:42.329> Street<00:00:42.710> when<00:00:43.710> that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
happened on Lowell Street when that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.920 
happened on Lowell Street when that
school<00:00:44.250> was<00:00:44.370> built<00:00:44.579> there<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.180> put<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> hard

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
school was built there and put a hard

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.779 
school was built there and put a hard
edge<00:00:46.170> we've<00:00:46.829> set<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> building<00:00:47.550> back<00:00:47.760> there

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
edge we've set the building back there

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.209

skeptical<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> right<00:00:49.050> directions<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.160> I

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
skeptical in the right directions and I

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.010
