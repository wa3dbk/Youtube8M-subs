it could benefit not only Ric Flair in
the<00:01:58.409> WWE<00:01:58.950> no<00:01:59.009> ratings<00:01:59.460> potentially<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.750> Dolph

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the WWE no ratings potentially but Dolph

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.039 
the WWE no ratings potentially but Dolph
Ziggler<00:02:01.829> because<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.149> Vickie<00:02:03.450> Guerrero<00:02:03.780> I

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
Ziggler because I like Vickie Guerrero I

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.780 
Ziggler because I like Vickie Guerrero I
mean<00:02:04.409> she's<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> great<00:02:05.009> heel<00:02:05.189> she<00:02:05.399> gets<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.640> hell

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
mean she's a great heel she gets a hell

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.540 
mean she's a great heel she gets a hell
of<00:02:05.820> reaction<00:02:06.829> but<00:02:07.829> i<00:02:07.860> don't<00:02:07.920> think<00:02:08.160> she's

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
of reaction but i don't think she's

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.339

what's<00:02:08.819> needed<00:02:09.149> when<00:02:09.479> Dolph<00:02:09.750> gets<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.140> title

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
what's needed when Dolph gets the title

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.190 
what's needed when Dolph gets the title
I<00:02:10.649> think<00:02:11.280> he<00:02:11.489> needs<00:02:11.730> more<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.150> mentor<00:02:12.569> more

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
I think he needs more of a mentor more

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.940 
I think he needs more of a mentor more
of<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.319> person

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
of a person

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.210 
of a person
