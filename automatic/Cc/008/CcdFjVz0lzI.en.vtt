00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.780
 you already know that according to the code of the 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.400
 road a user and anyone who 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.199
 uses the public highway 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.480
 pedestrians cyclists and 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.310
 motor vehicle drivers are 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.310
 so all road users 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.810
 according to the rules of the road a driver 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.820
 is a person who drives a vehicle 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.340
 which can be either without motor as 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.460
 in this example be a vehicle to 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.380
 motor as you see here someone 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.780
 who puts us watch animals from 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.280
 related charges or mount on 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.110
 public road is also a 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.060
 driver 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.060
 the man walking next to this young 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.740
 jumper is so a driver all 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.530
 like the one driving a cart 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.200
 harnessed or the farmer who accompanies his 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.210
 cows on the road 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.309
 you already know that a person who 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.040
 push a moped is not a 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.080
 driver but a pedestrian 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.540
 so should not wear the helmet and he 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.610
 must walk on the sidewalk 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.550
 on the other hand a person who pushes a 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.890
 motorcycle is a driver and must 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.730
 so wear the headphones walk on the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.920
 road and have a driving license 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.630
 sounds coming down from his car and the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.939
 push is also a driver 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.640
 although both in the following lessons 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.320
 we mention the users we 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.880
 let's talk about all the people who 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.490
 use the public highway 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.560
 this includes pedestrians and 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.100
 drivers of vehicles without or with 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.590
 engine 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.200
 when we talk about drivers this 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.549
 does not include pedestrians 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.979
 certain traffic rules at 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.259
 some signs are not valid 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.750
 for all drivers but only 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.299
 for some of them for example 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.310
 here you can see some panels 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.740
 which concerns only certain 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.740
 drivers you will find their 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.979
 exact meaning on this page under 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.140
 the video the following lessons will deal 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.850
 mainly drivers of 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.959
 vehicles whose maximum mass 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.790
 allowed does not exceed 3 and a half tons 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.290
 it may sound complicated but these are 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.390
 the vehicles you can drive 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.360
 when you have a license to 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.819
 driving b provisional or final 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.000
 you'll find out more in the lesson 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.000
 next
