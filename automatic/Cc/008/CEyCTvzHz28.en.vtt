00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
this generator that I got typically you

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.770 
this generator that I got typically you
get<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.189> at<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> first<00:00:32.610> set<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
get it at the first set of the the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.120 
get it at the first set of the the
beginning<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.260> map<00:00:34.500> sorry<00:00:34.860> about<00:00:35.100> that

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
beginning of the map sorry about that

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.979 
beginning of the map sorry about that
but<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.730> didn't<00:00:36.030> pick<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.540> time<00:00:36.750> around

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
but I didn't pick it up this time around

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.090 
but I didn't pick it up this time around
because<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.530> my<00:00:37.649> first<00:00:37.770> time<00:00:38.010> ever

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
because this is my first time ever

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.920 
because this is my first time ever
attempting<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.030> pack<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> punch<00:00:39.540> open

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
attempting to get the pack a punch open

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.380 
attempting to get the pack a punch open
so<00:00:40.649> once<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.190> turbine<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.879> don't

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
came over here and I really didn't know

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.319 
came over here and I really didn't know
what<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.219> with<00:00:47.309> these<00:00:47.430> keys<00:00:47.700> at<00:00:47.879> first<00:00:48.090> cuz

what to do with these keys at first cuz

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.760 
what to do with these keys at first cuz
this<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.629> my<00:00:48.660> first<00:00:48.960> time<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.379> said<00:00:49.559> going

this is my first time like I said going
around<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.399> you're<00:00:50.789> gonna<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.149> how<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.329> fail

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
around and you're gonna see how a fail

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.869 
around and you're gonna see how a fail
leads<00:00:51.960> up<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.260> something<00:00:52.680> pretty<00:00:52.829> neat<00:00:53.190> like

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
leads up to something pretty neat like

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.400 
leads up to something pretty neat like
this<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.180> my<00:00:54.300> first<00:00:54.449> time<00:00:54.690> ever<00:00:54.719> playing<00:00:55.140> this

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
this is my first time ever playing this

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.470 
this is my first time ever playing this
map<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:56.820> cooked<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> grenade

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
map and I just cooked the grenade

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.299 
map and I just cooked the grenade
towards<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> zombie<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.559> blew<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.949> door

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
towards the zombie and it blew the door

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.250 
towards the zombie and it blew the door
open<00:00:59.340> because<00:00:59.879> that's<00:01:00.660> how<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.899> open<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
open because that's how you open the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.810 
open because that's how you open the
door<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.590> needed<00:01:02.010> by<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> keys<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.789> keys

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
door you needed by the keys and the keys

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.140 
door you needed by the keys and the keys
will<00:01:03.270> open<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> door<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> way<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:05.150> once

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
will open the door in the way and once

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.000 
will open the door in the way and once
you're<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> Raygun<00:01:07.860> you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
you're here if you have a Raygun you

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.260 
you're here if you have a Raygun you
could<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.280> blast<00:01:08.670> through<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.000> door<00:01:09.240> you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
could just blast through this door you

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.210 
could just blast through this door you
just<00:01:09.720> throw<00:01:09.900> another<00:01:10.020> grenade<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.560> didn't<00:01:11.100> do

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
just throw another grenade I didn't do

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.890 
just throw another grenade I didn't do
it<00:01:11.400> right<00:01:11.430> away<00:01:11.700> after<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.570> that's<00:01:12.750> why<00:01:12.869> I

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
it right away after that so that's why I

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.590 
it right away after that so that's why I
cut<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.320> scene<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> once<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.299> have<00:01:15.420> both

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
cut that scene so once you have both

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.810 
cut that scene so once you have both
doors<00:01:16.200> open<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.560> see<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> logo<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.250> go<00:01:17.490> back

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
doors open you see the logo to go back

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.510 
doors open you see the logo to go back
to<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.299> power<00:01:18.930> station<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> third<00:01:20.159> stop

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
to the power station it's the third stop

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.960 
to the power station it's the third stop
on<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.060> bus<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:23.100> once<00:01:23.460> you're<00:01:23.610> at<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> power

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
on the bus so once you're at the power

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.490 
on the bus so once you're at the power
station<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.509> want<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.750> get<00:01:24.869> off<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> bus<00:01:25.350> and

turbine<00:01:31.079> right<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.710> get<00:01:32.009> out<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
turbine right there and get out the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.179 
turbine right there and get out the
other<00:01:32.759> way<00:01:33.000> through<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.479> back<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.040> don't

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
other way through the back so you don't

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.399 
other way through the back so you don't
attract<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.299> zombies<00:01:36.329> cousin<00:01:36.900> zombies<00:01:37.259> do

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
attract the zombies cousin zombies do

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.920 
attract the zombies cousin zombies do
destroy<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.890> turbine<00:01:38.280> over<00:01:38.520> time<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.689> after

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
destroy the turbine over time so after

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.390 
destroy the turbine over time so after
that<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.530> want<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.740> go<00:01:40.860> back<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
that you just want to go back to the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.730 
that you just want to go back to the
last<00:01:41.610> map<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.299> way<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:43.140> last<00:01:43.170> map<00:01:43.560> here

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
last map in a way the last map here

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.230 
last map in a way the last map here
that's<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.100> last<00:01:44.250> one<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.640> then<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.030> just

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
that's the last one and then you just

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.639 
that's the last one and then you just
want<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.479> go<00:01:45.600> back<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> vault<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.500> you

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
want to go back to the vault that you

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.490 
want to go back to the vault that you
open<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.100> look<00:01:47.310> there's<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.390> door<00:01:48.810> now<00:01:49.049> that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
open and look there's a door now that

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.859 
open and look there's a door now that
door<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.340> hatch<00:01:50.640> leads<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.329> bottom<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
door that hatch leads to the bottom and

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.120 
door that hatch leads to the bottom and
this<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.170> pretty<00:01:52.350> much<00:01:52.530> what<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.740> pack<00:01:52.979> of

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
this is pretty much what the pack of

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.060 
this is pretty much what the pack of
punches<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:55.020> pack<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.380> punches<00:01:55.649> broken<00:01:55.979> up

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
punches the pack of punches broken up

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.649 
punches the pack of punches broken up
into<00:01:56.250> different<00:01:56.399> pieces<00:01:56.880> down<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:57.509> so

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
into different pieces down here so

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.209 
into different pieces down here so
you're<00:01:57.810> gonna<00:01:57.899> have<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.140> arm<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.530> like<00:01:58.710> most<00:01:59.040> of

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
you're gonna have to arm it like most of

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.670 
you're gonna have to arm it like most of
everything<00:01:59.549> in<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.270> map<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.469> got

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
everything in this map so you just got

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.469 
everything in this map so you just got
to<00:02:01.799> look<00:02:01.950> really<00:02:02.579> sharp<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.060> pieces

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
to look really sharp for the pieces

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.910 
to look really sharp for the pieces
because<00:02:03.689> not<00:02:04.049> every<00:02:04.350> time<00:02:04.530> they're<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.799> this

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
because not every time they're in this

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.319 
because not every time they're in this
order<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.460> I'm<00:02:05.549> picking<00:02:05.850> them<00:02:05.939> up<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.270> it

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
order that I'm picking them up with it

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.789 
order that I'm picking them up with it
but<00:02:06.600> I'm<00:02:06.750> showing<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.259> order<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.560> picked

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
but I'm showing you the order I picked

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.020 
but I'm showing you the order I picked
them<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:08.039> with<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.399> there's<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.789> battery

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
them up with like there's the battery

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.540 
them up with like there's the battery
then<00:02:09.929> behind<00:02:10.289> me<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.069> stand

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
then behind me it's like the stand

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.040 
then behind me it's like the stand
because<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.910> need<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.150> stand<00:02:12.420> also<00:02:12.660> as<00:02:12.900> like

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
because you need to stand also as like

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.940 
because you need to stand also as like
three<00:02:13.230> pieces

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
three pieces

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.220 
three pieces
and<00:02:14.459> that's<00:02:15.090> pretty<00:02:15.270> much<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.540> guys<00:02:15.720> once<00:02:16.140> you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
and that's pretty much it guys once you

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.780 
and that's pretty much it guys once you
guys<00:02:16.349> open<00:02:16.770> this<00:02:16.890> door<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.370> pretty<00:02:17.610> much

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
guys open this door it's pretty much

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.120 
guys open this door it's pretty much
easy<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.209> build<00:02:18.599> all<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.020> pieces<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.440> get

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
easy to build all the pieces and get

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.059 
easy to build all the pieces and get
your<00:02:20.370> pack<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.880> punching<00:02:21.209> on<00:02:21.349> but<00:02:22.349> one<00:02:22.650> thing<00:02:22.920> I

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
your pack of punching on but one thing I

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.370 
your pack of punching on but one thing I
will<00:02:23.130> tell<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:23.790> over<00:02:24.420> time<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.140> thing

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
will tell you that over time the thing

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.890 
will tell you that over time the thing
the<00:02:25.650> generator<00:02:26.069> does<00:02:26.370> go<00:02:26.700> away<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.390> after<00:02:27.780> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
the generator does go away and after the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.479 
the generator does go away and after the
generator<00:02:28.290> does<00:02:28.530> go<00:02:28.650> away<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:29.040> bolt<00:02:29.310> door

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
generator does go away the bolt door

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.580 
generator does go away the bolt door
closes<00:02:30.060> again<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.540> little<00:02:30.780> hatch<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.410> you're

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
closes again the little hatch so you're

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.199 
closes again the little hatch so you're
gonna<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:31.950> get<00:02:32.069> another<00:02:32.160> generator<00:02:32.880> back

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
gonna have to get another generator back

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.530 
gonna have to get another generator back
from<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> spawn<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.170> put<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.530> back<00:02:34.650> in<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.100> in

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
from the spawn and put it back in the in

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.690 
from the spawn and put it back in the in
the<00:02:36.540> place<00:02:36.870> at<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.200> power<00:02:37.410> station<00:02:37.739> so<00:02:38.220> that's

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
the place at the power station so that's

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.680 
the place at the power station so that's
kind<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.090> little<00:02:39.239> bummer
