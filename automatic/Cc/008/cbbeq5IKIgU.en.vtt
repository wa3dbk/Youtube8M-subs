sight<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.759> feel<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.390> gun<00:01:18.600> they

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
sight but I feel like on this gun they

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.420 
sight but I feel like on this gun they
have<00:01:18.869> made<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.200> dot<00:01:19.380> way<00:01:19.650> too<00:01:19.710> big<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.340> it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
have made the dot way too big so it

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.980 
have made the dot way too big so it
makes<00:01:20.640> aiming<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.240> targets<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.659> are<00:01:21.780> far

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
makes aiming at targets that are far

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.780 
makes aiming at targets that are far
away<00:01:22.080> rather<00:01:22.530> difficult<00:01:22.890> normally<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> red

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
away rather difficult normally the red

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.160 
away rather difficult normally the red
dot<00:01:23.909> sight<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.270> pretty<00:01:24.509> good<00:01:24.720> at<00:01:24.810> acquiring

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
dot sight is pretty good at acquiring

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.840 
dot sight is pretty good at acquiring
targets<00:01:25.590> from<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.860> long<00:01:26.040> distance<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.580> find

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
targets from a long distance but I find

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.490 
targets from a long distance but I find
it<00:01:26.939> way<00:01:27.060> too<00:01:27.119> difficult<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.869> size<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> dot

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
it way too difficult the size of the dot

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.170 
it way too difficult the size of the dot
can<00:01:28.799> almost<00:01:29.070> basically<00:01:29.400> take<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> entire

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
it is on the red dot sight this makes it

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.510 
it is on the red dot sight this makes it
much<00:01:46.170> more<00:01:46.380> functional<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:46.920> close<00:01:47.280> and

much more functional for close and

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
of the dot I'm not entirely sure the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.200 
of the dot I'm not entirely sure the
purpose<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.250> those<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.520> real<00:01:53.670> life<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.090> be

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.700 
purpose of those in real life to be
honest<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.810> does<00:01:54.930> make<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> site<00:01:55.470> look<00:01:55.619> a

honest but it does make the site look a
lot<00:01:55.860> cooler<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.369> doesn't<00:01:56.700> interfere<00:01:56.939> with

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
site in the game but unfortunately I

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.730 
site in the game but unfortunately I
think<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.960> most<00:02:18.170> useless<00:02:18.380> site

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
think it's the most useless site

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.590 
think it's the most useless site
available<00:02:19.160> for<00:02:19.370> this<00:02:19.460> gun<00:02:19.700> first<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.180> all<00:02:20.300> this

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
available for this gun first of all this

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950

where<00:02:22.490> as<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.670> gun<00:02:22.820> is<00:02:22.970> most<00:02:23.150> effective<00:02:23.600> from

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
where as the gun is most effective from

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.480 
where as the gun is most effective from
long<00:02:23.900> range<00:02:23.930> also<00:02:24.530> I<00:02:24.710> find<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.010> reflex<00:02:25.340> sight

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
long range also I find the reflex sight

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.040 
long range also I find the reflex sight
to<00:02:25.610> be<00:02:25.700> rather<00:02:25.910> inaccurate<00:02:26.210> for<00:02:26.630> this<00:02:26.870> gun

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
to be rather inaccurate for this gun

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.720 
to be rather inaccurate for this gun
only<00:02:27.380> because<00:02:27.650> if<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:27.920> fire<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.310> burst<00:02:28.490> fire

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
only because if you fire and burst fire

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.160 
only because if you fire and burst fire
like<00:02:28.910> you're<00:02:29.060> supposed<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.600> gun<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:30.110> very

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
like you're supposed to the gun is very

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.780 
like you're supposed to the gun is very
stable<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.980> there<00:02:31.160> won't<00:02:31.220> be<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.400> whole<00:02:31.460> lot<00:02:31.580> of

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
stable and there won't be a whole lot of

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.130 
stable and there won't be a whole lot of
recoil<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.300> you<00:02:32.390> really<00:02:32.630> don't<00:02:32.780> need<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.020> have

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
recoil so you really don't need to have

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.350 
recoil so you really don't need to have
a<00:02:33.170> generalized<00:02:33.650> area<00:02:34.040> as<00:02:34.220> long<00:02:34.430> as<00:02:34.640> your<00:02:34.850> sight

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
a generalized area as long as your sight

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.670 
a generalized area as long as your sight
is<00:02:35.510> on<00:02:35.630> target<00:02:35.870> you'll<00:02:36.170> be<00:02:36.290> okay

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
is on target you'll be okay

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.020 
is on target you'll be okay
so<00:02:36.980> that's<00:02:37.130> pretty<00:02:37.250> much<00:02:37.370> gonna<00:02:37.610> do<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:37.880> for

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
so that's pretty much gonna do it for

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.360 
so that's pretty much gonna do it for
the<00:02:38.090> overview<00:02:38.210> of<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.750> u-100<00:02:39.290> LMG<00:02:39.890> as<00:02:40.070> I've

lot of them the first thing that I want
to<00:03:22.519> talk<00:03:22.670> about<00:03:22.910> is<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.269> noise<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.720> gun<00:03:23.900> is

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
to talk about is the noise the gun is

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.600 
to talk about is the noise the gun is
very<00:03:24.170> loud<00:03:24.530> as<00:03:24.769> we've<00:03:24.950> already<00:03:25.100> discussed

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
very loud as we've already discussed

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.400 
very loud as we've already discussed
there<00:03:26.000> is<00:03:26.030> no<00:03:26.269> being<00:03:26.480> stealthy<00:03:26.900> with<00:03:27.049> this<00:03:27.200> gun

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
there is no being stealthy with this gun

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.170 
there is no being stealthy with this gun
as<00:03:27.620> previously<00:03:28.250> stated<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.670> gun<00:03:28.820> is<00:03:28.970> most

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
as previously stated the gun is most

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.000 
as previously stated the gun is most
useful<00:03:29.360> if<00:03:29.750> you<00:03:29.930> have<00:03:29.959> blown<00:03:30.410> your<00:03:30.530> cover<00:03:30.590> and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
useful if you have blown your cover and

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.350 
useful if you have blown your cover and
you're<00:03:31.160> no<00:03:31.310> longer<00:03:31.340> hidden<00:03:31.820> from<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.090> enemy

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
you're no longer hidden from the enemy

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.460 
you're no longer hidden from the enemy
or<00:03:32.570> from<00:03:32.870> long<00:03:33.080> range

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
or from long range

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.930 
or from long range
probably<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.130> shittiest<00:03:34.400> thing<00:03:34.610> about<00:03:34.820> this

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
probably the shittiest thing about this

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.180 
probably the shittiest thing about this
gun<00:03:35.120> is<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.510> ammo<00:03:35.870> ammo<00:03:36.049> is<00:03:36.410> very<00:03:36.709> expensive

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
gun is the ammo ammo is very expensive

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.640 
gun is the ammo ammo is very expensive

the<00:03:41.570> ammo<00:03:41.780> is<00:03:41.930> very<00:03:42.200> hard<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.470> find<00:03:42.530> on<00:03:42.830> enemies

I<00:03:43.190> have<00:03:43.430> noticed<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:43.820> some<00:03:43.910> heavies<00:03:44.390> will

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
I have noticed that some heavies will

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.210 
I have noticed that some heavies will
carry<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:44.930> but<00:03:45.170> other<00:03:45.350> than<00:03:45.590> that<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.950> have<00:03:46.070> yet

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
carry it but other than that I have yet

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.949 
carry it but other than that I have yet
to<00:03:46.280> encounter<00:03:46.640> it<00:03:46.880> at<00:03:47.030> all<00:03:47.239> outside<00:03:47.540> of<00:03:47.810> the

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.640 
store having an ammo capacity 400 may
sound<00:03:50.299> like<00:03:50.420> a<00:03:50.510> lot<00:03:50.690> but<00:03:50.720> when<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.019> have<00:03:51.230> 60

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650

400<00:03:54.350> rounds<00:03:54.620> is<00:03:54.739> easy<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:55.100> burn<00:03:55.250> through<00:03:55.489> and

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
400 rounds is easy to burn through and

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.520 
400 rounds is easy to burn through and
with<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.090> price<00:03:56.299> of<00:03:56.330> ammo<00:03:56.750> or<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.140> rarity<00:03:57.500> of

with the price of ammo or the rarity of

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.380 
with the price of ammo or the rarity of
it<00:03:57.739> it's<00:03:58.070> definitely<00:03:58.489> not<00:03:58.610> as<00:03:58.820> much<00:03:58.880> as<00:03:59.299> you

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
it it's definitely not as much as you

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.060 
it it's definitely not as much as you
might<00:03:59.540> think<00:03:59.600> while<00:04:00.140> compared<00:04:00.500> to<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.650> PKM

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
might think while compared to the PKM

this<00:04:01.250> gun<00:04:01.400> does<00:04:01.580> reload<00:04:01.910> much<00:04:02.060> faster<00:04:02.510> in

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
this gun does reload much faster in

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.330 
this gun does reload much faster in
reality<00:04:03.080> it<00:04:03.200> is<00:04:03.230> still<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.560> very<00:04:03.799> slow<00:04:04.010> reload

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
reality it is still a very slow reload

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.860 
reality it is still a very slow reload
so<00:04:04.670> if<00:04:04.820> you<00:04:04.940> are<00:04:05.060> gonna<00:04:05.180> use<00:04:05.239> this<00:04:05.480> weapon

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
so if you are gonna use this weapon

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.420 
so if you are gonna use this weapon
especially<00:04:06.290> as<00:04:06.380> a<00:04:06.440> primary<00:04:06.830> weapon<00:04:07.010> you'll

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
especially as a primary weapon you'll

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.590 
especially as a primary weapon you'll
want<00:04:07.610> to<00:04:07.640> make<00:04:07.760> sure<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:08.000> get<00:04:08.150> better<00:04:08.330> at

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
want to make sure you get better at

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.420 
want to make sure you get better at
being<00:04:08.900> able<00:04:09.019> to<00:04:09.230> reload<00:04:09.560> at<00:04:09.829> the<00:04:10.040> appropriate

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
being able to reload at the appropriate

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.340 
being able to reload at the appropriate
times<00:04:10.640> that<00:04:11.000> also<00:04:11.150> leads<00:04:11.600> me<00:04:11.780> into<00:04:11.930> my<00:04:12.110> final

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
times that also leads me into my final

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.050 
times that also leads me into my final
point<00:04:12.680> for<00:04:12.829> this<00:04:12.950> gun<00:04:13.130> which<00:04:13.489> is<00:04:13.640> that<00:04:13.790> it<00:04:13.940> is

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
point for this gun which is that it is

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.539 
point for this gun which is that it is
not<00:04:14.269> ideal<00:04:14.810> for<00:04:15.049> frequent<00:04:15.560> reloaders<00:04:16.190> what<00:04:16.519> I

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
not ideal for frequent reloaders what I

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.860 
not ideal for frequent reloaders what I
mean<00:04:16.790> by<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:16.910> is<00:04:17.209> if<00:04:17.359> you're<00:04:17.479> the<00:04:17.510> kind<00:04:17.810> of

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
mean by that is if you're the kind of

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.449 
mean by that is if you're the kind of
person<00:04:18.200> who<00:04:18.320> will<00:04:18.410> engage<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.680> few<00:04:18.950> enemies<00:04:19.280> and

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
person who will engage a few enemies and

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.430 
person who will engage a few enemies and
then<00:04:19.579> reload<00:04:19.940> regardless<00:04:20.479> of<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.930> ammo<00:04:21.200> count

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
then reload regardless of the ammo count

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.050 
then reload regardless of the ammo count
that's<00:04:21.620> left<00:04:21.830> in<00:04:21.919> the<00:04:21.950> chamber<00:04:22.400> I<00:04:22.520> must<00:04:22.849> admit

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
that's left in the chamber I must admit

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.670 
that's left in the chamber I must admit
I<00:04:23.150> am<00:04:23.360> very<00:04:23.570> bad<00:04:23.780> for<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.140> and<00:04:24.320> it's<00:04:24.500> a<00:04:24.560> good

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
I am very bad for that and it's a good

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.020 
I am very bad for that and it's a good
thing<00:04:24.830> to<00:04:24.919> do<00:04:25.039> in<00:04:25.190> shooters<00:04:25.520> but<00:04:25.669> with<00:04:25.789> a<00:04:25.820> gun

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
to have one attachment for the gun so I

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.630 
to have one attachment for the gun so I

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
suggest you choose wisely if it were me

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.340 
suggest you choose wisely if it were me
I<00:04:41.820> would<00:04:42.090> go<00:04:42.210> with<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.420> extended<00:04:42.840> mags<00:04:43.020> as<00:04:43.230> I

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
I would go with the extended mags as I

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.660 
I would go with the extended mags as I
find<00:04:43.560> all<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.800> sites<00:04:44.040> to<00:04:44.130> be<00:04:44.280> relatively

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
find all the sites to be relatively

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.370 
find all the sites to be relatively
useless<00:04:44.970> but<00:04:45.360> if<00:04:45.450> you<00:04:45.570> want<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.810> use<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:45.930> site<00:04:46.230> I

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
useless but if you want to use a site I

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.690 
useless but if you want to use a site I
would<00:04:46.470> either<00:04:46.710> use<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.980> red<00:04:47.280> dot<00:04:47.460> or<00:04:47.610> the

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
would either use the red dot or the

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.310 
would either use the red dot or the
optical<00:04:48.030> sight<00:04:48.300> but<00:04:48.900> that's<00:04:49.080> pretty<00:04:49.200> much

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
optical sight but that's pretty much

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.840 
optical sight but that's pretty much
gonna<00:04:49.620> do<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.860> for<00:04:50.010> this<00:04:50.130> gun<00:04:50.280> review<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.610> hope
