00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
strange the right trigger is fire which

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.340 
strange the right trigger is fire which
on<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> ps3<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.190> us<00:00:41.309> see<00:00:41.460> far<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.420> don't

far<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:45.809> not<00:00:45.960> fair<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:46.770> switched

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
far and it's not fair so it's switched

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.560 
far and it's not fair so it's switched
around<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.300> remember
