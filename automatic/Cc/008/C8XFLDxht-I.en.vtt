00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.340
 hello everyone guys are needles from ne 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.910
 is today we are here in the fourth episode of the 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.590
 rat max as in every broken max 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.720
 let's start immediately with the improvements that 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.759
 I have done during this week but not 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.289
 I want you to show it as well as for 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.390
 example this hell tower at level 2 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.949
 that really epic but let's start right away 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.949
 with a beautiful clean 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.930
 ok guys here you see me committed the 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.809
 second tower inferno at 2 the third al 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.690
 kolossal 2 and our friend bar baron 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.790
 on the 15th it will really be a rover thing 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.570
 power then I'll do the reggina 15 and so 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.549
 Street 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.860
 we also see that last night he has 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.509
 finished this beautiful 3 hell to 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.250
 2 which is devastating 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.930
 I honestly don't know if I will try to 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.030
 to do it is immediately others because then 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.799
 so I do it immediately at the most e 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.780
 meritorious from the boxes so let's see 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.720
 but maybe I feel a bit like 2 and then 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.070
 we see 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.819
 today's goal so guys will stay 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.530
 to do the barbarians and to the set indeed or 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:36.920
 5,800,000 dialysis and then to do i 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.479
 barbarians at 7 it takes 6 million well 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.130
 I'm making attacks, let's say 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.380
 completely randomly to take for 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.170
 the little to say that there is around part 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.909
 guys really can't find for the maybe 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.069
 so now maybe I'll try a little more 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.069
 of villages and we'll see if I can 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.670
 take 170 thousand elixirs then 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.190
 let's hope 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.959
 I would therefore say in not to get lost in 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.459
 chat because it's not that I have much to do 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.840
 tell you regarding the village 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.580
 that is what I had to say to you I have it 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.550
 already said and then we go immediately to 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.619
 look for a village to attack 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.200
 ok guys we found the player 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.170
 which is in fact the case for as many as 227 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.810
 thousand of elixirs and we will try to steal it 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.520
 then we see that most of the 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.890
 deposits are up here so me 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.810
 I would say to attack from above and then ce 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.790
 there is one here so maybe we take 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.610
 first the one here so we do so 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.019
 with some rough beard then we put 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.340
 behind then jail 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.110
 then there are the troops of the evil clan 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.720
 we destroy easily because they are 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.670
 only a few fair thugs let us reward immediately 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.879
 quite a lot of elixir very very much 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.080
 well ok I would say very well this 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.019
 troops should be enough for 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.090
 destroy the deposit so they are not 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.580
 guys now anyway I decided to 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.709
 make the barbarians and at 7 fail to set 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.959
 because apart from the fact that they cost of 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.390
 less the barbarians at 7 improve more 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.190
 compared to archers at 7 and then 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.080
 I think it was better to do the first thing 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.870
 barbarians at 7 also because in any case use 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.830
 both barbaric arches so in the end not 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.440
 it's that it changes a lot 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.510
 they take 14 days I saw then there 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.060
 they will put a lot and then I will 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.520
 I will definitely put the archers on the 7th 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.410
 however I will do the dragons I do not know see with 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.230
 calm at least wanted to try a troupe a 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.150
 7 just to see what they were like 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.040
 They did various things 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.020
 now guys are really random 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.120
 because if I speak then I attack very badly 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.830
 but I hope to be able to catch at least 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.240
 two of these deposits 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.190
 yes yes then so much we have the maximum 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.590
 queen of archers I have for ultra 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.400
 mega power so we're riding 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.209
 yes yes yes yes yes yes ok very good 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.209
 very well then it was made and made 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.930
 well done ok we didn't steal everyone 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.220
 But we did a nice swag 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.690
 we also put the queen of archers 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.220
 the queen of prisons really gives us one 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.319
 nice hand we take that money that 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.150
 we need and we are on horseback is called 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.830
 horse very well 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.630
 we activate the special ability of the 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.670
 we have 6 million queen of archers 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.670
 perfect we can go home there 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.110
 we also take the league bonus 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.270
 crystal that won thousand we have 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.830
 got 200 thousand in this or this 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.500
 we are really attacked 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.240
 very well then to the east to return to 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.370
 home sorry if I don't go home right away 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.599
 but this is a conversion of Africa for 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.180
 who really guys these days 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:21.500
 Inter is going badly for me yesterday 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.599
 I couldn't even go to April on YouTube 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.370
 to see how many subscribers had many 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.900
 visualization I had only done last 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.080
 Czech video you wanted to see for a moment 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.389
 like rowe, youtube wouldn't open because 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.430
 guys, so it's ok with part of mine 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.259
 connection of Africa I would say that there 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.370
 let's see when it will deign to do me 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:44.210
 go home connection host indeed 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.180
 guys it almost felt like a lap if he got me 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.090
 made to miss the attack I swear it is 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.610
 really the big challenge 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.400
 here is perfect yes there has made me make a 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.240
 random attack does nothing to kids 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.849
 we have god for a nap but you know what 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.449
 let's do you know now guys we do 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:07.789
 found it we have 5 million 980 thousand 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.780
 but we have to extract the barbarians 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:15.490
 archers so we kind of like that 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.479
 let's do to type so let's see if they are enough 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.590
 archers are those that cost 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:23.210
 so let's see guys I'm pretty 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.190
 by removing the troops from the houses they were 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.620
 so they give me back the elixir e 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.469
 very well ok we have 6 million boys 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.020
 so I would say that the time has come 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:38.199
 time to put the barbarians in 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.199
 level 7 12 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.520
 in the fourth decision from now 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.599
 barbarians at 7 will really be one thing 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.910
 or real power 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.610
 look how nice the lab is 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.630
 there is an epic thing with a blade that 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.610
 add up to a wow stuff and then I would say that 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.500
 we are in absolutely great shape 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.199
 because more or less a month than to 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.970
 town hall at 10 and I have done on Hell 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.770
 almost all of them at level 2 of arc 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.580
 hicks was already at level 2 then I will put it 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.560
 immediately at level 3 and king barbarian in the 15th 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.720
 and I'm also doing the barbarians at 7 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.430
 so we are more than fine 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.620
 obviously the road is still young 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.740
 long but if I continue like this we will arrive 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:23.860
 soon it will take even more 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.270
 or less a 250 episodes more or less and not 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.090
 I'm kidding 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.400
 I don't know maybe we'll get to the 40 episodes 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.740
 I don't know so just to shoot a 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.289
 random number already that we wanted 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.330
 also tell you an important thing a news 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.550
 in the world of clash of class indeed 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.319
 halloween is approaching and like every year 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.669
 there will be the halloween update of 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:45.159
 clash of france 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:47.099
 then I read the news for a moment 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:49.539
 now they gave nothing but him 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:51.669
 obstacles and therefore bushes trees 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:53.289
 and so more or less in halloween style 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.419
 therefore with for example the pumpkins 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:55.930
 draw the faces of irony that things 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:57.969
 various 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.130
 and then there was also an obstacle like la 

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:02.800
 pumpkin that like the Christmas tree if 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.110
 take it off you pay him like twenty thousand 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.630
 branched from 80mm visir a stuff of the 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.789
 therefore kind of these updates of 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.740
 halloween has also spoken of a new one 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:13.620

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.389
 halloween period but i'm not yet
