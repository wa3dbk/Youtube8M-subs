Lee<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:53.150> know<00:02:53.270> I<00:02:53.540> think<00:02:53.780> it'd<00:02:53.900> be<00:02:53.930> hard

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
Lee you know I think it'd be hard

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.800 
Lee you know I think it'd be hard
arguing<00:02:54.500> when<00:02:54.710> you<00:02:55.340> know<00:02:55.430> at<00:02:56.090> least<00:02:56.150> arguably

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
arguing when you know at least arguably

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.630 
arguing when you know at least arguably
one<00:02:57.530> of<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.650> best<00:02:57.740> players<00:02:58.130> if<00:02:58.310> not<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.520> best

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
one of the best players if not the best

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.250 
one of the best players if not the best
player<00:02:58.850> on<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:58.970> field<00:02:59.120> today<00:02:59.330> how<00:02:59.840> well<00:03:00.050> did

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
thought of the second third course they

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.370 
thought of the second third course they
did<00:03:07.070> a<00:03:07.130> great<00:03:07.250> job<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:08.090> then<00:03:08.420> we're<00:03:09.170> screwed

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
did a great job and then we're screwed

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.590 
did a great job and then we're screwed
up<00:03:09.590> sometimes<00:03:10.040> may<00:03:10.280> we<00:03:10.430> convert<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.120> third-down

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
up sometimes may we convert a third-down

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.630 
up sometimes may we convert a third-down
it's<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.930> big<00:03:12.140> momentum<00:03:12.500> third<00:03:12.710> down<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.190> our

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
it's a big momentum third down and our

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.190 
it's a big momentum third down and our
linemen<00:03:13.820> had<00:03:14.030> just<00:03:14.180> barely<00:03:14.420> gone<00:03:14.630> down<00:03:14.870> before

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
linemen had just barely gone down before
