00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:35.370

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.550
 professional to do service 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.399
 I think this question of plastic and are 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.219
 very sensitive may break the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.469
 moment you are using 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.460
 beauty that is an original piece itself 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.379
 renowned 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.880

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.650
 the ground the sandero and I will show you how 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.240
 that makes the substitution 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.479
 first you will need a key 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.090
 a pair of reference pliers from 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.040
 spout and an insulation tape 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.220
 the insulation tape is just to put in the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.200
 tip of the pliers so that you 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.390

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.030
 I will not get a light fixture 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.689
 That's when I put some weight on the mass. 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.130
 come to break a light bulb after the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.330
 lamp is broken regrets a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.650
 People need to take this layer off the 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.450
 it is in the front where you press and in it 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.390
 one of the plastic pins then 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.470
 be careful you will put 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.640
 for sale the side well on the side here 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:02.960
 forcing pushing up 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.960
 there are those who come to the withdrawal 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.080
 I can make this withdrawal very easy. 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.050
 I searched on youtube the staff did not have 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.620

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.930
 inside you can see the lamp 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.700
 You can also see a bit of 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.620
 Grace in there. 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.760
 this grace is just for notification 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.750
 when you move contact table to 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.630
 show you 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.940
 this is how it turns out if you do 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.190
 she pulls off she makes a move 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.670
 for top - down and feeds the 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.470

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.630
 the pliers a little light care to 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:07.470

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.780
 withdrawal of the lamp 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.270
 you can see that the original lamp 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.290
 It is still a much better light only 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.510
 regional power 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.910

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.100
 We have contacts to anyone who wants to do 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.860
 substitution to make another future 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.770

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.310
 form another color or simply go 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.550

 other color 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.959
 will have to buy a parallel button 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.750

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.930

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.300
 any other tool that already has a 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:28.729
 angle on the sides where you will be 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.729

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.919
 before putting on this cover is good to put 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.120
 in the car and test to see if she is 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.000

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.520
 it's in the right polarity maybe you 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.620
 put in another position does not work 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.770
