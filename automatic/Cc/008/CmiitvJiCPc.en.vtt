slowly disappears add a few drops of
universal<00:01:32.170> indicator<00:01:32.410> solution<00:01:33.010> and<00:01:33.430> you

universal indicator solution and you

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.390 
universal indicator solution and you
will<00:01:34.240> see<00:01:34.480> that<00:01:34.870> it<00:01:35.080> turns<00:01:35.350> blue<00:01:35.710> or<00:01:35.980> purple

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
will see that it turns blue or purple

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.210 
will see that it turns blue or purple
this<00:01:37.300> is<00:01:37.480> why<00:01:37.630> they<00:01:37.930> are<00:01:37.960> called<00:01:38.220> alkali

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
this is why they are called alkali

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.910 
this is why they are called alkali

when<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.660> are<00:02:32.810> done

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.670 

you<00:02:38.610> will<00:02:38.760> find<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.150> potassium<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:40.110> softer

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
you will find that potassium is softer

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.360 
you will find that potassium is softer
than<00:02:40.829> sodium<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.610> easier<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.510> cut<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.620> reacts

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
than sodium and easier to cut it reacts

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.959 
than sodium and easier to cut it reacts
more<00:02:44.760> vigorously<00:02:45.329> with<00:02:45.689> water<00:02:45.959> than<00:02:46.439> sodium

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:46.969 
more vigorously with water than sodium

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.089 
more vigorously with water than sodium
however<00:02:47.969> an<00:02:48.269> important<00:02:49.170> observation<00:02:49.379> is<00:02:50.069> made

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
however an important observation is made

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.530 
however an important observation is made
it<00:02:50.640> burns<00:02:51.299> with<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.870> lilac<00:02:52.439> flame<00:02:53.299> ensure<00:02:54.299> that

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
it burns with a lilac flame ensure that

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.899 
it burns with a lilac flame ensure that
a<00:02:54.569> very<00:02:54.930> small<00:02:55.109> piece<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.620> potassium<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.640> used

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
a very small piece of potassium is used

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.800 
a very small piece of potassium is used
and<00:02:57.209> stand<00:02:57.900> far<00:02:58.170> back<00:02:58.409> as<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:59.069> may<00:02:59.250> spit<00:02:59.810> you

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
and stand far back as it may spit you

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.949 
and stand far back as it may spit you
may<00:03:00.959> also<00:03:01.200> hear<00:03:01.829> a<00:03:02.010> small<00:03:02.640> popping<00:03:03.150> noise<00:03:03.329> due

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
may also hear a small popping noise due

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.280 
may also hear a small popping noise due
to<00:03:04.109> the<00:03:04.230> combustion<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:05.069> hydrogen<00:03:05.430> all<00:03:06.290> alkali
