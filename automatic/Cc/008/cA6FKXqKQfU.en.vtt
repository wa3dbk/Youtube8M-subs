00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
this one either it's getting worse every

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.630 
this one either it's getting worse every
day<00:01:15.360> Alexis<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.500> obvious<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.310> Fed<00:01:17.610> is

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
day Alexis and it's obvious the Fed is

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.980 
day Alexis and it's obvious the Fed is
right<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.119> middle<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.509> perhaps

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
right in the middle of it perhaps

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.050 
right in the middle of it perhaps
they're<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.979> solution<00:01:20.189> they're<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
they're not the solution they're the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.149 
they're not the solution they're the
problem<00:01:21.299> okay<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:21.900> when<00:01:22.350> look<00:01:22.680> there's<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.040> lot

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
problem okay so when look there's a lot

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.440 
problem okay so when look there's a lot
of<00:01:23.189> people<00:01:23.369> who<00:01:23.640> would<00:01:23.729> agree<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.210> that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
