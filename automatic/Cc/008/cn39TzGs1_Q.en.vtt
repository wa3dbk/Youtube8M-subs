00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
this is what you want to be playing when

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.779 
this is what you want to be playing when
somebody<00:00:16.170> else<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.410> taking<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.859> solo<00:00:17.070> or<00:00:17.580> if

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.700 
somebody else is taking a solo or if
you're<00:00:17.970> just<00:00:18.240> building<00:00:19.020> up<00:00:19.260> your<00:00:19.470> jam

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
you're just building up your jam

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.689 
you're just building up your jam
together<00:00:20.010> with<00:00:20.400> everybody<00:00:22.100> funk<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> pretty

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
together with everybody funk is a pretty

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.960 
together with everybody funk is a pretty
broad<00:00:24.240> title<00:00:25.099> so<00:00:26.099> there's<00:00:26.250> actually<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.670> lot<00:00:26.910> of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
broad title so there's actually a lot of

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.250 
broad title so there's actually a lot of
different<00:00:27.390> styles<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.810> rhythms<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.170> I

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
different styles and rhythms that I

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.200 
different styles and rhythms that I
think<00:00:28.439> really<00:00:28.680> fall<00:00:28.890> under<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.400> umbrella<00:00:29.730> of

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
think really fall under this umbrella of

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.799 
think really fall under this umbrella of
funk<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.560> we're<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.040> look<00:00:32.130> at<00:00:32.279> one

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
funk so we're just going to look at one

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.030 
funk so we're just going to look at one
pattern<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.050> should<00:00:34.290> take<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.590> really<00:00:34.829> far

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
pattern that should take you really far

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.790 
pattern that should take you really far
in<00:00:35.550> many<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.000> these<00:00:36.090> different<00:00:36.270> styles<00:00:36.800> let's

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
in many of these different styles let's

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.979 
in many of these different styles let's
do<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.610> C<00:00:39.180> minor<00:00:39.570> pentatonic<00:00:40.579> so

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
do it in the C minor pentatonic so

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.360 
do it in the C minor pentatonic so
there's<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.079> pattern<00:00:43.379> here<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.890> we're<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.250> we

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
there's a pattern here so we're if we

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.110 
there's a pattern here so we're if we
were<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.640> start<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.680> C<00:00:46.680> minor<00:00:47.219> just

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
were to just start with a C minor just

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.930 
were to just start with a C minor just
plain-old<00:00:48.600> triad<00:00:49.520> we<00:00:50.520> would<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.760> these

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
plain-old triad we would have these

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.500 
plain-old triad we would have these
notes<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.260> wanted<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:53.090> slide<00:00:54.090> into

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
notes and then if I wanted to slide into

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.450 
notes and then if I wanted to slide into
the<00:00:54.629> major<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.320> could<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.010> get<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.309> effect

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the major I could just get that effect

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.270 
the major I could just get that effect
real<00:00:56.910> easy<00:00:57.649> do<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.710> up<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> little

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
real easy do it up here so it's a little

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.729 
real easy do it up here so it's a little
less<00:00:59.520> muddy<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:01.820> yeah<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.300> would<00:01:03.449> be

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
less muddy for you yeah so that would be

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.649 
less muddy for you yeah so that would be
the<00:01:04.739> first<00:01:05.299> position<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.420> we're<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the first position that we're going to

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.570 
the first position that we're going to
have<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.830> all<00:01:08.070> we're<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.369> do

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
have for this then all we're going to do

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.050 
have for this then all we're going to do
is<00:01:09.439> move<00:01:10.439> our<00:01:10.619> three<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.159> five<00:01:11.430> they're<00:01:11.820> both

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
is move our three and five they're both

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.170 
is move our three and five they're both
going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> go<00:01:12.600> up<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:13.049> step<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:14.760> we've

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
going to go up a step so now we've

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.539 
going to go up a step so now we've
really<00:01:15.360> got<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.110> G<00:01:16.290> even<00:01:16.530> though<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.740> slid

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
really got a and G even though we slid

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.340 
really got a and G even though we slid
into<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.909> e<00:01:18.180> now<00:01:18.840> we're<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.229> go

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
into that e now we're just going to go

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.070 
into that e now we're just going to go
up<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.680> F<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.270> then<00:01:21.479> we're<00:01:21.600> going<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.750> take<00:01:21.930> it

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
up to F and then we're going to take it

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.800 
up to F and then we're going to take it
even<00:01:22.259> one<00:01:22.530> higher<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.820> F<00:01:24.000> an<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.390> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
even one higher so we have F an a and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.050 
even one higher so we have F an a and
now<00:01:25.409> we're<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> go<00:01:25.830> up<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:26.340> more<00:01:26.369> we're

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
now we're going to go up one more we're

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.870 
now we're going to go up one more we're
going<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.240> go<00:01:27.390> up<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.750> G<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.439> B<00:01:28.530> flat<00:01:29.460> because

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
going to go up to G and B flat because

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.810 
going to go up to G and B flat because
since<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.720> we're<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.860> C<00:01:32.220> minor<00:01:32.490> zone

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
since it's a we're in that C minor zone

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.870 
since it's a we're in that C minor zone
that's<00:01:33.030> why<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:33.299> need<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.689> flat<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.170> there

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
that's why we need to be flat in there

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.120 
that's why we need to be flat in there
so<00:01:35.880> all<00:01:36.090> three<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.509> them<00:01:36.630> would<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:40.130> then

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
so all three of them would be and then

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.800 
so all three of them would be and then
we'll<00:01:41.579> do<00:01:41.759> them<00:01:41.939> coming<00:01:42.180> down<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.570> well<00:01:42.780> so

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
we'll do them coming down as well so

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.889 
we'll do them coming down as well so
it'll<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.439> coming<00:01:43.860> up<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:45.390> then<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.869> back

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
it'll be coming up and then going back

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.660 
it'll be coming up and then going back
down<00:01:46.320> again<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:48.950> adding<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.159> slide<00:01:50.430> note

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
down again and adding in that slide note

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.730 
down again and adding in that slide note
use<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.689> your<00:01:51.810> own<00:01:51.899> discretion<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.560> can

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
use it at your own discretion it can

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.469 
use it at your own discretion it can

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
with the feel right to use it so we've

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.280 
with the feel right to use it so we've
got<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.530> pattern<00:01:59.299> then<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.780> really<00:02:01.110> give<00:02:01.259> it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
got that pattern then to really give it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.260 
got that pattern then to really give it
that<00:02:01.409> funk<00:02:01.979> feel<00:02:02.280> what<00:02:02.520> we're<00:02:02.640> going<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.790> do<00:02:03.030> is

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
that funk feel what we're going to do is

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.469 
that funk feel what we're going to do is
now<00:02:03.540> add<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.560> our<00:02:04.710> thumb<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.340> C<00:02:05.939> which<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
now add in our thumb on C which is the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.919 
now add in our thumb on C which is the
one<00:02:07.640> every<00:02:08.640> other<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.330> between<00:02:09.420> every

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
one every other so in between every

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.390 
one every other so in between every
chord<00:02:10.170> we<00:02:10.289> play<00:02:10.500> we're<00:02:10.679> going<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.830> also<00:02:11.220> play

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
chord we play we're going to also play

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.180 
chord we play we're going to also play
this<00:02:11.580> C<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.060> we<00:02:12.180> would<00:02:12.270> have

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.860 

and<00:02:20.880> because<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.150> one's<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.450> little<00:02:21.540> bit<00:02:21.750> more

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
and because this one's a little bit more

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.150 
and because this one's a little bit more
complicated<00:02:22.170> I'm<00:02:22.440> going<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.650> do<00:02:22.710> it<00:02:22.800> one<00:02:22.980> more

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
complicated I'm going to do it one more

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.560 
complicated I'm going to do it one more
time<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.550> can<00:02:23.700> really<00:02:23.970> see<00:02:24.120> what's<00:02:24.300> going

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
time so you can really see what's going

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:32.630 
time so you can really see what's going
on

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.009 

okay<00:02:33.640> now<00:02:33.939> let's<00:02:34.390> see<00:02:34.480> what<00:02:34.569> it<00:02:34.659> sounds<00:02:34.959> like

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
okay now let's see what it sounds like

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:42.869 
okay now let's see what it sounds like
sped<00:02:35.349> up<00:02:35.469> a<00:02:35.560> little<00:02:35.709> bit<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.310> we<00:02:36.400> would<00:02:36.519> have<00:02:41.879> so

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
sped up a little bit so we would have so

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.849 
sped up a little bit so we would have so
just<00:02:43.150> from<00:02:43.269> that<00:02:43.359> alone<00:02:43.560> again<00:02:44.560> it's<00:02:44.709> already

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
just from that alone again it's already

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.199 
just from that alone again it's already
starting<00:02:45.219> to<00:02:45.310> create<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.549> little<00:02:45.760> bit<00:02:45.939> of<00:02:46.060> that

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
starting to create a little bit of that

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.440 
starting to create a little bit of that
like<00:02:46.390> funk<00:02:46.689> feel<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:48.099> really<00:02:48.400> from<00:02:48.819> there<00:02:49.090> you

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
like funk feel and really from there you

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.539 
like funk feel and really from there you
can<00:02:49.629> make<00:02:49.989> so<00:02:50.349> many<00:02:50.409> different<00:02:50.590> variations<00:02:51.400> on

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
can make so many different variations on

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.179 
can make so many different variations on
either<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.209> rhythm<00:02:52.569> or<00:02:53.439> even<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.769> order<00:02:54.069> that

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:54.189 
either the rhythm or even the order that

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:59.789 
either the rhythm or even the order that
your<00:02:54.310> appointment<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:54.909> maybe<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.620> there<00:02:59.769> I

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
your appointment is so maybe so there I

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.530 
your appointment is so maybe so there I
was<00:02:59.950> doing<00:03:00.370> our<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.849> G<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.389> the<00:03:01.510> B<00:03:01.540> flat<00:03:01.900> twice

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
was doing our the G and the B flat twice

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.990 
was doing our the G and the B flat twice
maybe<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.930> do<00:03:05.200> two<00:03:05.950> of<00:03:05.980> these<00:03:06.220> before<00:03:06.549> you<00:03:06.879> go

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
maybe you do two of these before you go

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.720 
maybe you do two of these before you go
back<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.420> C<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:08.709> you<00:03:08.769> could<00:03:09.220> have<00:03:14.730> so

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
back to the C so you could have so

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.159 
back to the C so you could have so
there's<00:03:15.909> a<00:03:15.970> lot<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.359> variation<00:03:16.840> but<00:03:16.959> if<00:03:17.049> you

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.169 
there's a lot of variation but if you

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.289 
there's a lot of variation but if you
get<00:03:17.409> this<00:03:17.739> feeling<00:03:18.220> under<00:03:18.669> your<00:03:18.790> fingers<00:03:19.150> of

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
get this feeling under your fingers of

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.229 
get this feeling under your fingers of
just<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:20.169> two<00:03:20.439> notes<00:03:20.680> back<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.519> C<00:03:21.790> two

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
just the two notes back to the C two

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.420 
just the two notes back to the C two
notes<00:03:22.480> back<00:03:22.659> to<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.870> C<00:03:23.129> you're<00:03:24.129> going<00:03:24.189> to<00:03:24.340> be

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
notes back to the C you're going to be

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.649 
notes back to the C you're going to be
in<00:03:24.519> really<00:03:24.849> good<00:03:24.970> shape<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.299> come<00:03:25.450> up<00:03:25.569> with

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
in really good shape to come up with

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.330 
in really good shape to come up with
your<00:03:25.810> own<00:03:25.930> rhythms<00:03:26.349> that<00:03:26.470> feel<00:03:26.769> really<00:03:27.040> good

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
your own rhythms that feel really good

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.280 
your own rhythms that feel really good
so<00:03:28.209> let's<00:03:28.629> see<00:03:28.689> what<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.870> sounds<00:03:28.959> like<00:03:29.109> with

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
so let's see what it sounds like with

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.560 
so let's see what it sounds like with
some<00:03:29.319> music
