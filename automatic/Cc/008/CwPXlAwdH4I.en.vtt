00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:07.160
 i want to tweet 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.160
 my friend 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.230
 when I applied the makeup I like 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.910
 start with the mascara because sometimes I 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.200
 plus I water it all over my face 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:47.600
 so it's easier to clean it 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:49.250
 and then applied concealer for dark circles 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.470
 but also to cover some 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.150
 spots on my face the advice that I 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.550
 I always give is that when applied 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.710
 something in the part of the eyes never be 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.050
 the effort since that will only bring as 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.910
 that premature wrinkles and then it's not very 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:12.140
 good for the skin that is so sensitive and 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:13.009
 more in the face then I move on to apply 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.960
 base 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.660
 I always use only one base 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.430
 which is the mousse and is also mate but 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.470
 I recently bought a the liquid and 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.720
 I wanted to try in this video along with the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.460
 another then like I mix them 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.220
 I'm falling, I'm showing you a lot 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.360
 the products that I'm using but 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.160
 in the street of description I'm going to 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.590
 leave all the names and all those 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.940
 things if they want to know and also if 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.119
 they want later I'm going to make them 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.250
 like a video where they share my 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.400
 opinion of some new products that 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.040
 I have been buying 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.870
 I also have this sponge that I have seen 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.090
 that many people use in this video the 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.950
 is using for the first time and the truth 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.590
 which is not very comfortable but I will follow 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.670
 giving opportunities and we can not forget 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.670
 Eyebrows 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.520
 how can you see this video in the beginning 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.950
 I made it a little more I go over well 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.020
 because I feel like I did not want to do like 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.020
 that the video makeup made to measure 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.250
 but from here on they can be 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.650
 more conquerors you because 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.290
 I almost end up even after longer 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.380
 I sit down I am makeup I like to apply 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.630
 the powders and I know it's preferable 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.660
 apply for the powders and then line 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.400
 silver but I always do everything at 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.290
 backwards I have heard that many people 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.460
 they say that the powders to seal the 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.010
 makeup I do not know how many more things 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.830
 then but it is not any 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.860
 It changes like I've drawn attention 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:51.520
 makeup that fraifer than with tournament 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.740
 that the shadows with the glitter of 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.780
 frost or all the colors although you 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.200
 that there are people that exist more than 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.540
 every day because I was before but 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.490
 it never looks simpler and I am the 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.140
 same I will stay as always and for 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.270
 Sometimes I can not even makeup I am 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.090
 as well towards me I do not feel sorry and I 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.550
 I feel that no woman at all 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.360
 person 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.730
 the image is beautiful but the person 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.870
 natural and also let your skin 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.420
 breathe 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.640
 so I feel that everyone should 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.500
 feel in your own skin that I do not 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.570
 matter what the other person thinks 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:36.020
 say so I was using this one 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.020
 knicks 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.530
 also on camera as it exaggerates a 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.390
 little bit like in all the colors the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.920
 camera but super banking does not look 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.069
 nor my skin- colored skin color is 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.900
 darker than that you do not owe them 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.030
 import what other people think and 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.379
 what we lost the point of my 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.900
 channel or with the motivation of my channel is 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:03.870
 inspire you to be 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.060
 yourselves and that they want as they are 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:12.269
 and have you 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:14.700
 after that first about the hand 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.099
 where more than that I applied this one 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.579
 exfoliating the then apply it in 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.579
 the lips 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.979
 applied again a thousand balm 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.960
 with my lip moisturizer 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:45.680
 the walk 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.110
 and so 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.580
 I think I still do not learn how to apply it 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.830
 that's all for my makeup as 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.159
 you can see the makeup that with the 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.229
 health or my videos that I probably 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:15.770
 opposed almost everything I see it lacks 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.460
 maquillo and this is how I am with my 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.310
 essence 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.830
 then now in what I do space 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.719
 the arts because it is not related there are many 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.969
 boys how to combine clothes and 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:29.560
 colors and all then right now you 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:31.650
 can you teach how he loves me 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.650
 i 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.100
 for my outfit I wear this jean and 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.930
 lost highway this are my favorites if 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.030
 you look at my videos and insurance 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.620
 you have to know this I feel that they are carving 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.820
 super good and I can use them with 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.860
 any product 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.120
 other than that this shade of blue is very 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.120
 popular for these seasons 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:02.349
 and as you may have already noticed 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.240
 putting a cro white actor I like 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.550
 use light colors when I'm going to wear 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.499
 a coat of dark tone on top I feel 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.870
 that the contrast looks very beautiful and 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:13.029
 chic us in their countries like this the 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.819
 weather but here barely and the snow went 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:17.770
 but it's raining a lot and it makes 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:22.319
 pretty cold then if you ask 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.319
 why I bring good coat that's why 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.240
 and if you were wondering where is my 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.280
 shelter is aeropostal 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.190
 just like these shoes of which 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.840
 I'm in love they make all my 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.840
 cars look super good 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.260
 by the way it has many many far 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.240
 this video if you wanted me to do them 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.310
 a video part where you share how 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.100
 that my tips and advice on how I 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.949
 I organize when traveling by car by bus 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.870
 by plane or whatever, I can also 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:14.000
 share how I want my suitcase or 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.840
 in my portfolio in my bag then 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.480

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:23.230
 and similar would be that up to them the 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.020
 beautiful of this horrible and if it hurts 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:28.160
 much 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.160
 my plan 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.360
 35
