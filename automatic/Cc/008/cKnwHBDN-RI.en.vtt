00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.670
 the award before we get to the third 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.710
 Come on, let's have a look 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.890
 the score by his victory in 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.330
 2 game has caught up so michelle safe 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.680
 and overtakes the bernd leads with 2 1 the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.230
 third game for that there are three points 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.230
 and that means rolling goal we have 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.910
 here a quite adventurous 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.619
 constellation built up a pipe 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.899
 We will be balls this pipe 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.700
 send the balls come roll out 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.559
 along the table and you have to 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.210
 try with your bat and with 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.260
 a ball rolling the ball 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.879
 insurance 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.290
 it does not have to fall down it is enough 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.539
 even if he somehow touches him 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.460
 We do that in eleven passes each 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.410
 So he has eleven attempts and we are looking 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.730
 simply who of you the most 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.559
 I'll show you how that works 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.420
 We're just thinking about sending it 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.800
 a ball by this you look exactly 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.289
 also in which speed he 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.270
 out comes exactly and then you have to 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.370
 meet as soon as he is on the table 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.409
 if the ball leaves the table, it is off 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.049
 the game and you have no chance ok 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.830
 did you continue to understand that 11 through 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.479
 there we go by three points for that 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.439
 game rolling goal and we have to 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.619
 trigger again 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:26.540
 who starts tommy red or green red 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:30.180
 I thought he was greenish green with green 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.170
 starts what did you say well then may 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.450
 start the bernd 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.860
 you are already in the balls too 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.950
 throw important task 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:44.030
 So let 's go through the first 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.030
 cameraman have you ever met 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:54.200
 no hit 0 to 0 after the first 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:59.680
 Passage took that was not so far 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:12.530
 not away with the second passage of the 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:14.810
 werbekreis slowly out not so far 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.800
 still no hit in three passes 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:30.650
 Now we come to the fourth passage 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:32.680
 even the election just gets now 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:43.730
 a bit under pressure 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:46.959
 fifth passage was already over world 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.959
 the ten was not the one you do again 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.430
 also nothing 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.549
 Now we come to the sixth passage 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.099
 for the seventh I'm currently listening to seventh 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.280
 passage and evening can compensate 1 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:11.829
 1 everything open again 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:15.220
 sitter try not for schumi either 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:19.510
 hit eighth pass remains 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:29.049
 exciting are this third duel no 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:31.060
 point for Bern's ninth pass that 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.650
 is the two to one of her for bernd 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.410
 in the evening with zombie under pressure this 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:42.579
 Do not recycle clock behind passage 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:47.489
 So you 're gonna try 22 12 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:54.790
 still for each this was an eleven meters 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:56.200
 were turned into hate jealousy and 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.329
 Now is the last attempt you make 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.299
 both of you not very short you both meet 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.700
 bernd has not won 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.829
 bernd won ' t meet bernd can not 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.690
 compensate johnny then it goes 1 1 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:12.549
 continue so last two tries 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.560
 At first, let's not hit it 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:22.419
 so close june can still be compensated as 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:27.350
 nervous failed one wins amber 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:32.110
 this game gets three points for it 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:34.970
 and is again in the lead with 4 to 2 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.530
 we are looking forward to the next game and 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.530
