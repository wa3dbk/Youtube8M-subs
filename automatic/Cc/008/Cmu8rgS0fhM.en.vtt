through economics very subtly we work
many<00:01:08.070> different<00:01:08.220> ways<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.119> perhaps<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.750> most

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
many different ways but perhaps the most

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.130 
many different ways but perhaps the most
common<00:01:10.619> one<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.820> will<00:01:12.060> identify<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
common one is is that we will identify a

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.780 
common one is is that we will identify a
third<00:01:13.770> world<00:01:13.979> country<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.610> has<00:01:14.760> resources

our corporations covet such as oil and

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.840 
our corporations covet such as oil and
then<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:18.900> arrange<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.560> huge<00:01:20.189> loan<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.580> that

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850

and during my last year in college and I

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.460 
and during my last year in college and I
think<00:03:00.120> it's<00:03:00.209> fair<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.540> say<00:03:00.599> that<00:03:00.959> they<00:03:01.140> they

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
think it's fair to say that they they

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.199 
think it's fair to say that they they
identified<00:03:02.220> me<00:03:02.430> as<00:03:02.549> a<00:03:02.579> good<00:03:02.819> potential

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
identified me as a good potential

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.660 
identified me as a good potential
economic<00:03:03.510> hitman<00:03:04.230> they<00:03:04.860> also<00:03:05.069> identified<00:03:05.640> a

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
economic hitman they also identified a

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.520 
economic hitman they also identified a
number<00:03:05.880> of<00:03:06.060> weaknesses<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:06.930> my<00:03:07.049> character

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
number of weaknesses and my character

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.380 
number of weaknesses and my character
that<00:03:07.709> would<00:03:07.860> make<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.190> relatively<00:03:09.030> easy<00:03:09.269> for

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
that would make it relatively easy for

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.770 
that would make it relatively easy for
them<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.989> hook<00:03:10.410> me<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.829> bring<00:03:11.040> me<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.780> I

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
them to hook me to bring me in and I

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.390 
them to hook me to bring me in and I
think<00:03:12.930> those<00:03:13.230> weaknesses<00:03:13.470> account<00:03:14.010> we<00:03:14.220> might

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
think those weaknesses account we might

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.190 
think those weaknesses account we might

interesting<00:04:21.390> about<00:04:22.020> this<00:04:22.140> whole<00:04:22.380> system<00:04:22.620> Amy

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
interesting about this whole system Amy

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.190 
interesting about this whole system Amy
is<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:23.460> there's<00:04:23.760> no<00:04:23.910> direct<00:04:24.390> connection<00:04:24.840> the

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200

private corporation it's a very subtle
and<00:04:33.780> very<00:04:33.870> smart<00:04:34.410> system<00:04:34.950> whereby<00:04:35.640> it's<00:04:36.180> the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
and very smart system whereby it's the

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.390 
and very smart system whereby it's the
private<00:04:36.810> industry<00:04:37.110> that<00:04:37.350> goes<00:04:37.680> out<00:04:37.950> and<00:04:38.250> does

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
private industry that goes out and does
