breath<00:02:51.480> in<00:02:51.690> as<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:51.960> exhale<00:02:52.230> press<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.310> foot

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
breath in as you exhale press the foot

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.280 
breath in as you exhale press the foot
forward<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.120> out<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.480> let<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.660> pull<00:02:55.080> your

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
forward and out and let it pull your

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:06.570 
forward and out and let it pull your
body<00:02:55.440> back<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:55.770> bird<00:02:57.140> sounds

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.559 

it's<00:03:07.120> all<00:03:07.450> that

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.760 

interest

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.740 

in<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.100> studio

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.479 

so<00:03:22.750> we<00:03:22.870> start<00:03:23.140> with<00:03:23.260> both<00:03:23.650> hands<00:03:23.920> off<00:03:24.129> the<00:03:24.250> time

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
so we start with both hands off the time

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:31.229 
so we start with both hands off the time
and<00:03:25.269> then<00:03:26.610> belly<00:03:27.610> ribs<00:03:28.239> upper<00:03:28.720> chest<00:03:30.239> big

hamstring the ability that hamstring
muscles<00:04:33.390> now<00:04:34.390> again<00:04:34.690> that<00:04:35.080> circular<00:04:35.680> movement

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
muscles now again that circular movement

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.240 
muscles now again that circular movement
starts<00:04:36.580> with<00:04:36.670> the<00:04:36.760> tiny<00:04:37.000> circle<00:04:37.480> and<00:04:38.250> circle

opens up into a spiral open the breath
with<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.990> spiral<00:04:44.970> cobra<00:04:45.970> newbridge<00:04:46.450> body<00:04:46.870> as

with the spiral cobra newbridge body as

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.590 
with the spiral cobra newbridge body as
the<00:04:47.470> range<00:04:47.710> of<00:04:47.890> motion<00:04:48.100> expense<00:04:49.620> at<00:04:50.620> this<00:04:51.280> time

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
the range of motion expense at this time

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.290 
the range of motion expense at this time
let<00:04:52.600> go<00:04:52.870> of<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.320> time<00:04:53.830> of<00:04:54.190> day<00:04:54.400> right<00:04:54.730> hand<00:04:55.060> it

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
let go of the time of day right hand it

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.050 
let go of the time of day right hand it
just<00:04:55.600> home<00:04:56.130> so<00:04:57.130> it's<00:04:57.280> easier<00:04:57.700> as<00:04:59.130> the<00:05:00.130> range<00:05:00.850> of

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
just home so it's easier as the range of

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.050 
just home so it's easier as the range of
the<00:05:01.210> circle<00:05:01.600> opens<00:05:02.020> more<00:05:02.820> eventually<00:05:03.820> the

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
the circle opens more eventually the

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.760 
the circle opens more eventually the
foot<00:05:04.300> will<00:05:04.450> be<00:05:04.570> brushing<00:05:04.870> close<00:05:05.530> to<00:05:05.710> the

foot will be brushing close to the
