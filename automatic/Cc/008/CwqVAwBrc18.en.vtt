00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.499 

let's<00:01:40.259> see<00:01:40.439> what<00:01:40.590> else<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:41.729> has<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.880> great<00:01:42.180> pivot

let's see what else it has a great pivot
adjustment<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.470> had<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.710> adjust<00:01:43.920> it

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
adjustment here I have had to adjust it

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.380 
adjustment here I have had to adjust it
only<00:01:45.540> once<00:01:46.070> but<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.579> nice<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.000> has<00:01:48.150> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
only once but it's it's nice it has the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.660 
only once but it's it's nice it has the
it's<00:01:48.780> flush<00:01:49.049> mount<00:01:49.320> right<00:01:49.380> here<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.610> was

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
it's flush mount right here so I was

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.410 
it's flush mount right here so I was
just<00:01:50.850> one<00:01:51.030> side<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.649> adjust

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
just one side that you have to adjust

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.429 
just one side that you have to adjust
that's<00:01:54.420> how<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> lanyard<00:01:54.780> hole<00:01:55.049> back<00:01:55.229> here

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
that's how a lanyard hole back here

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.910 
that's how a lanyard hole back here
which<00:01:56.220> is<00:01:56.369> convenient<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.500> does<00:01:58.649> is

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
which is convenient and it does is

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.560 
which is convenient and it does is
pillar<00:01:59.310> construction<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.270> easy<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
pillar construction so it is easy to

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.109 
pillar construction so it is easy to
clean<00:02:00.750> out<00:02:01.020> if<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.070> need<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:03.860> now<00:02:04.860> see<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.430> it

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
has two ways to deploy to the blade you

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.729 
has two ways to deploy to the blade you
can<00:02:08.759> use<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.239> flipper<00:02:09.479> back<00:02:09.630> here<00:02:09.929> or<00:02:10.110> these

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
like that flipper better it's a little

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.100 
like that flipper better it's a little
bit<00:02:15.720> easier

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
bit easier

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.949 
bit easier
it's<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.760> comes<00:02:17.880> out<00:02:18.120> nice<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.329> fast

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959

anything

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
anything

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.650 
anything
if<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.620> close<00:02:22.799> it<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.970> try<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.180> open<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.540> with

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
if you close it and try to open it with

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
the thumb studs you can do it it's just

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.460 
the thumb studs you can do it it's just
a<00:02:29.579> little<00:02:29.699> more<00:02:30.570> difficult<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.169> take<00:02:31.320> some

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
a little more difficult and take some

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.839 
a little more difficult and take some
practice

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849
