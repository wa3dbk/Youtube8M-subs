and i was thinking well its first of all
it<00:00:19.890> was<00:00:20.010> just<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.340> day<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.760> mean<00:00:21.650> not<00:00:22.650> much<00:00:22.859> much

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220

it was just a day I mean not much much
has<00:00:23.400> happened<00:00:23.789> yet<00:00:23.939> but<00:00:24.529> yeah<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.560> always<00:00:26.279> think

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
has happened yet but yeah I always think

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.890 
has happened yet but yeah I always think
it's<00:00:26.580> dangerous<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.180> know<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.449> put<00:00:27.720> all<00:00:27.869> our

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
it's dangerous you know to put all our

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.529 
it's dangerous you know to put all our
face<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.529> leader<00:00:28.740> thinking<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.760> somebody

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
face in a leader thinking that somebody

can<00:00:30.960> give<00:00:31.140> us<00:00:31.260> change<00:00:32.030> because<00:00:33.030> ultimately

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
can give us change because ultimately

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.850 
can give us change because ultimately
needs<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> come<00:00:34.079> from<00:00:34.230> within<00:00:34.410> balance<00:00:35.270> yeah

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
thinking about not talked about this

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.930 
thinking about not talked about this
earlier<00:00:41.629> it<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.660> all<00:00:42.960> about<00:00:43.230> stuff<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.700> see

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
earlier it is all about stuff and we see

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.200 
earlier it is all about stuff and we see
all<00:00:45.239> these<00:00:45.570> stuff<00:00:45.960> all<00:00:46.230> these<00:00:46.440> things<00:00:47.090> that<00:00:48.090> we

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
all these stuff all these things that we

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.049 
all these stuff all these things that we
try<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.450> acquire<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.620> are<00:00:49.680> producing<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.910> that

try to acquire we are producing and that

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.299 
try to acquire we are producing and that
is<00:00:51.210> basic<00:00:51.750> Paragon<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.469> always<00:00:52.649> questioned

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
is basic Paragon but I always questioned

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.729 
is basic Paragon but I always questioned
what<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.449> life<00:00:54.629> about<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.050> live<00:00:55.199> only<00:00:55.410> about

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
what is life about is live only about

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.670 
what is life about is live only about
production<00:00:56.100> or<00:00:56.309> consumption<00:00:57.140> or<00:00:58.140> rather<00:00:58.320> if

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
production or consumption or rather if

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.439 
production or consumption or rather if
life<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.039> only<00:00:59.550> about<00:00:59.789> production<00:01:00.239> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
life is only about production and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.660 
life is only about production and
consumption<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:01.109> lose<00:01:01.320> sight<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.250> what<00:01:02.579> it

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
consumption we lose sight of what it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.060 
consumption we lose sight of what it
means<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.030> human<00:01:03.500> because<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.799> become

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
means to be human because we become

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.980 
means to be human because we become

with the wheels that goes around around

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.289 
with the wheels that goes around around
around<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.689> are<00:01:24.780> kind<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:26.299> you

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
around and we are kind of like this you

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.230 
around and we are kind of like this you
be<00:01:27.390> trying<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.900> ahead<00:01:28.229> but<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:29.240> that's

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
be trying to get ahead but we that's

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.660 
be trying to get ahead but we that's
that's<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.840> illusion<00:01:31.710> basic<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.430> can

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
that's the illusion basic is that we can

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.760 
that's the illusion basic is that we can
get<00:01:32.850> ahead<00:01:33.119> now<00:01:33.840> losing<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.200> winners<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
get ahead now losing the winners and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.040 
get ahead now losing the winners and
losers

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.570 

because<00:01:39.050> it<00:01:39.170> creates<00:01:39.590> alienation<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:40.460> you

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
because it creates alienation and you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.200 
because it creates alienation and you
create<00:01:40.850> separation<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:41.570> anxiety<00:01:43.060> and<00:01:44.060> they

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
create separation and anxiety and they

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.910 
create separation and anxiety and they
are<00:01:44.390> some<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.930> course<00:01:45.200> we<00:01:45.320> live<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:45.530> good<00:01:45.710> life

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
are some of course we live a good life

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.400 
are some of course we live a good life
and<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:47.090> happy<00:01:47.360> life<00:01:47.540> because<00:01:48.110> they<00:01:48.230> have

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
and a happy life because they have

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.550 
and a happy life because they have
things<00:01:49.150> but<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.420> majority<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:51.050> people<00:01:51.440> are

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
things but the majority of people are

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.590 
things but the majority of people are
alienated<00:01:52.280> when<00:01:52.940> our<00:01:53.150> anxious<00:01:53.660> and<00:01:53.930> they<00:01:54.710> are

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.660 

yeah<00:01:59.290> they<00:01:59.619> have<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.799> difficult<00:02:00.310> time<00:02:00.340> keeping
