00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.679
 Hello everyone 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:17.780
 we prepare the recipe of the Pope we take 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.780
 our manitoba flour and sugar 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.710
 add the salt and the yeast 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.880
 choose 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.130
 add the eggs a little at a time 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.329
 if we maximize speed 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.329
 of the car 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.620
 let's lower to speed and add 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.620
 butter 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.030
 we incorporate to the last two eggs worth 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.570
 the dough will have life increase 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.570
 the speed 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.430
 ok but it's ready we see the structure is 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.409
 this therefore beautiful not elastic 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.690
 very soft but not too hard the dough is 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.400
 ready we let it rest rise 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.420
 about twenty minutes depending 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.820
 of the heat in our kitchen there 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.890
 we put a cloth over it covered and it 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.619
 we leave our pope there ready 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.619
 better avoided we put it back in the car 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.939
 air purchased another time of the 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:58.149
 first company 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:02:01.149
 we take our of thank or 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:07.360
 spray or oil grease or 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:10.119
 of the melted butter put the 15 with some 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.530
 of water we bathe the right hand and with the 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.000
 left we are going to pick up the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.580
 compound so we take the quantity 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.050
 enough to fill about one 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.050
 half of the mold even less 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:40.390
 murray is ready to make me small more or 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:43.870
 less is this quantity of a small one 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.730
 ball once we put the 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.920
 composed in the forms of see avoid 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.569
 where we put them in an oven turned off in 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:56.409
 so that not for the film on 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:58.569
 do not rely on leavened dough let's go to 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:01.170
 Bake in oven preheated to degrees 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.170
 200 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.950
 our small beards are ready and 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.950
 let's turn out 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.550
 we are expecting that even the 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:50.760
 large we put them aside and after shores 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:52.080
 we finish with the wet now we make you 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.710
 cool that after we go 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:03.660
 engaged prepare the wet blob 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:06.000
 I call water sugar and ours 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.930
 liqueur that can be limoncello witch 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.930
 room what you like 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.950
 let's light the fire 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.950
 the syrup must be well warm about 50 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.950
 degrees 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.510
 we take our babas and then i 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.240
 the little ones have a beautiful shape 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.070
 no and we notice a certain height difference of 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.270
 shape that we see them by cutting off the excess 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:42.720
 so that when we lean on 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:46.850
 bank are quite straight ours 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.850
 bank is ready Italian in shape 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.150
 they should be soaked until not 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.760
 they soften we go to prepare 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.990
 also our pasta school but if dad 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.360
 They are small 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.360
 simply lay them down with the 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.190
 hand in our pong while if i am a 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.680
 slightly larger they have to be turned around every now and then 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.690
 temperature always on the 50 grams of ponds e 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.170
 it gets cold but we remember it 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.170
 another time 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.530
 we finish the bath of the babÃ s having 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.930
 the foresight as I said to stay 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.530
 always at a temperature of 50 degrees 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.720
 because if lower we have the risk 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.720
 that are not wet enough 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:46.460
 the contrary, the opposite is the case 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:48.230
 to even cook and squeeze far 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.650
 quit excess immoral liquid not 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.650
 coli 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:00.499
 but it is removed from the pot when 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:02.449
 just and soft he lost his 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:05.539
 initial consistency that was nice hard 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:09.489
 and are put to drain with the hard w 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.489
 below we squeeze the others 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.080
 let's cool ok our dad yes 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.420
 are cooled now we smear a 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.120
 bit of cold jelly or if not 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.160
 found in the apricot puree a 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:33.210
 warm and heated on the fire with one 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:36.080
 small percentage of water decoration 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.080
 of custard 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.140
 a little advice to those who like it 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.940
 wets more alcohol than we have 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.500
 prepared 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.960
 add to the cold of the syrup 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.800
 absolute therefore directly of care 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:02.550
 without direction we go to bathe 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.610
 little can not be based ready good 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.610
