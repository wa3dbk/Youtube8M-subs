00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.540
Hey, I'm Foe!

00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:09.014
Let's get this crap over with!

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.600
All right, you all ready for the Velveteen Band tonight?

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.700
I'm not. I just want to go home.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.820
I'm going for a stroll, and I'm never coming back!

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.980
I've got no suitcases or bags, 'cause there's nothing left to pack!

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.840
COME ON!!!

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.820
[ROAR!!]

00:00:58.054 --> 00:01:01.334
Is it possible for a [unintelligible question]? 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.840
I might leave in a car, or a boat, or a choo-choo train.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.380
I want to find a place to escape from inside of my brain.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.080
This god-foresaken world's gone a-rolling off the track.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.220
That's why I'm going for a stroll, and I'm never coming back!

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.600
GOOD BYE!!

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.080
[ROAR!!]

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.335
[GUTTERAL SCREAM]

00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:03.895
[GRUNT]

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.160
I'm going for a stroll and I ain't coming back!

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.740
I'm going for a stroll and I ain't coming back!

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.300
I'm going for a stroll and I ain't coming back!

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.540
I'm going for a stroll, and I'm never coming back!

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.520
I wouldn't blame you guys for leaving, either.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.240
Oh, not the trumpet!

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.380
Aaugh!

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:55.020
[TRUMPET GROOVE]

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.200
You put in forty hours to keep a roof over your head.

00:03:02.113 --> 00:03:06.593
Keep your nose against the grindstone, and work until you're dead.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.900
I've seen the finish line, and it's no place I want to be.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.400
Walking straight into the ocean, and floating out to sea.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.880
[COME ON!!]

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.060
[ROAR!!]

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.880
No, really.  One more verse, and I'm getting the hell out of here.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.840
This time, I mean it!

00:03:55.934 --> 00:04:00.094
I'm walking off the planet, heading out through endless space

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.540
'til I'm far enough away that I don't see your stupid face.

00:04:10.795 --> 00:04:14.815
This god-forsaken world's gone a-rolling off the track.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.440
That's why I'm going for a stroll, and I'm never coming back!

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.640
Buh-bye!!

00:04:32.014 --> 00:04:33.314
[ROAR!!]

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.540
All right, screw you guys!  I'm out of here.
