00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.340

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
I think that's more to do with China and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.899 
I think that's more to do with China and
Chinese<00:01:39.649> regime<00:01:39.950> as<00:01:40.310> opposed<00:01:40.579> to<00:01:40.670> world<00:01:40.850> of

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
Chinese regime as opposed to world of

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.880 
Chinese regime as opposed to world of

an<00:01:45.289> ax<00:01:45.319> and<00:01:46.000> dedicate<00:01:47.000> as<00:01:47.119> much<00:01:47.270> about<00:01:47.479> times

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
an ax and dedicate as much about times

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.419 
an ax and dedicate as much about times
as<00:01:47.810> possible<00:01:47.990> then<00:01:48.350> that's<00:01:48.469> bad<00:01:48.619> choice<00:01:48.829> any

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
as possible then that's bad choice any

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.370 
as possible then that's bad choice any
country<00:01:50.149> with<00:01:50.299> limits<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:50.689> freedom<00:01:51.079> and<00:01:51.170> its

the<00:01:54.259> internet<00:01:54.590> I<00:01:54.679> think<00:01:54.890> has<00:01:55.039> really<00:01:55.069> got<00:01:55.579> the

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
the internet I think has really got the

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.069 
the internet I think has really got the
wrong<00:01:55.939> end<00:01:55.969> of<00:01:56.179> the<00:01:56.209> stick<00:01:56.299> when<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.719> comes<00:01:56.899> to

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
wrong end of the stick when it comes to

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.959 
wrong end of the stick when it comes to
humans<00:01:58.069> are<00:01:58.189> going<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.399> progress<00:01:58.549> in<00:01:58.880> the

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
humans are going to progress in the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.709 
humans are going to progress in the
future<00:01:59.329> I<00:01:59.509> feel<00:01:59.959> for<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:00.500> local<00:02:00.859> resident

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
it's a lot more than it was prior to

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.180 
it's a lot more than it was prior to
november<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.150> 24<00:02:29.569> of<00:02:29.690> last<00:02:29.870> year<00:02:30.079> and<00:02:30.349> so<00:02:31.129> i

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
november the 24 of last year and so i

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.130

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
think and it has you know it's kind of

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.680
