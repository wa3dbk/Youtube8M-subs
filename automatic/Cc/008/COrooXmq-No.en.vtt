mr.<00:00:06.150> toil<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.720> about<00:00:07.020> tree<00:00:07.500> farming<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.610> this

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
mr. toil is about tree farming and this

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.390 
mr. toil is about tree farming and this
is<00:00:09.210> how<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.330> build<00:00:09.630> all<00:00:09.750> my<00:00:09.809> tree<00:00:10.110> farms<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:11.190> is

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
is how I build all my tree farms it is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.610 
is how I build all my tree farms it is
the<00:00:11.519> most<00:00:11.700> compact<00:00:12.210> tree<00:00:12.450> farm<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.870> know<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.290> and

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
the most compact tree farm I know of and

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.010 
the most compact tree farm I know of and
it's<00:00:14.490> really<00:00:14.730> useful<00:00:15.000> I'll<00:00:15.509> show<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.839> how<00:00:15.960> it

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
it's really useful I'll show you how it

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.380 
it's really useful I'll show you how it
works<00:00:16.199> okay<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:17.369> you're<00:00:17.699> gonna<00:00:17.789> want<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.119> build

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
works okay so you're gonna want to build

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.000 
works okay so you're gonna want to build
a<00:00:20.210> dirt<00:00:21.210> hole<00:00:21.830> thing<00:00:23.480> with<00:00:24.480> space<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.170> three

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
a dirt hole thing with space for three

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.200 
a dirt hole thing with space for three
by<00:00:26.189> three<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.699> middle

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
by three in the middle

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.040 
by three in the middle
oops<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.349> did<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.560> wrong<00:00:29.390> so<00:00:30.390> three<00:00:30.660> by<00:00:30.779> three<00:00:30.990> in

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
oops I did it wrong so three by three in

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.950 
oops I did it wrong so three by three in
the<00:00:31.109> middle<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.340> build<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.610> smaller<00:00:32.930> but

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.119 

but<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.079> bet<00:00:37.380> better<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.890> bigger<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
but it's bet better have it bigger and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.020 
but it's bet better have it bigger and
then<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.460> place<00:00:38.700> torches<00:00:39.860> on<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.460> middle<00:00:41.760> in

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
then you place torches on the middle in

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.270 
then you place torches on the middle in
the<00:00:42.180> inside<00:00:45.950> of<00:00:46.950> each<00:00:47.219> side<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.890> then<00:00:49.890> you

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the inside of each side and then you

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.340 
the inside of each side and then you
plant<00:00:50.610> your<00:00:51.090> saplings<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.930> they<00:00:52.020> should<00:00:52.230> be

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
plant your saplings and they should be

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.740 
plant your saplings and they should be
oak<00:00:52.530> because<00:00:52.829> oak<00:00:53.129> works<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.910> best<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
oak because oak works the best and I

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.619 
oak because oak works the best and I
like<00:00:55.110> Oaks<00:00:55.320> wood<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.309> best<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:56.940> okay

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
like Oaks wood the best but okay

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.830 
like Oaks wood the best but okay
Elk<00:00:58.230> seems<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.039> work<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> best<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:01.050> then

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
Elk seems to work to the best and then

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.630 
Elk seems to work to the best and then
you<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.140> stop<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.710> stop<00:01:04.739> big<00:01:05.189> Oaks<00:01:05.430> from

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
you to stop to stop big Oaks from

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.070 
you to stop to stop big Oaks from
growing<00:01:05.880> which<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> pain<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> cut<00:01:06.900> down

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
growing which can be a pain to cut down

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.460 
growing which can be a pain to cut down
you<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.500> build<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.930> sapling

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
you have to build up so the sapling

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.730 
you have to build up so the sapling
which<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.979> two<00:01:11.490> three<00:01:12.380> four<00:01:14.330> five<00:01:15.330> six<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
which is one two three four five six and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.010 
which is one two three four five six and
seven

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
seven

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.810 
seven
okay<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.650> two<00:01:20.009> three<00:01:20.420> four<00:01:21.420> five<00:01:21.990> six

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
okay so one two three four five six

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.609 
okay so one two three four five six
okay<00:01:23.820> seven<00:01:24.420> blocks<00:01:24.659> with<00:01:24.869> dirt<00:01:25.049> plus<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
okay seven blocks with dirt plus the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.890 
okay seven blocks with dirt plus the
sapling<00:01:26.009> which<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.250> eight<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.759> then<00:01:27.659> build

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
sapling which is eight and then build

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.219 
sapling which is eight and then build
that<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.500> around<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> matches<00:01:30.750> up<00:01:30.930> with

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
that all around so it matches up with

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.550 
that all around so it matches up with
where<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> saplings<00:01:32.009> are

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.160 

okay<00:01:39.460> and<00:01:39.850> make<00:01:40.150> sure<00:01:40.360> make<00:01:40.659> sure<00:01:40.840> it's<00:01:41.020> all

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
okay and make sure make sure it's all

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.969 
okay and make sure make sure it's all
the<00:01:41.290> right<00:01:41.409> size<00:01:41.740> right<00:01:46.229> yep<00:01:47.229> that's<00:01:47.500> nice<00:01:47.770> and

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
the right size right yep that's nice and

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.609 
the right size right yep that's nice and
make<00:01:48.159> sure<00:01:48.250> it's<00:01:48.400> right<00:01:48.549> over<00:01:49.000> it<00:01:49.440> yeah<00:01:50.440> you

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
make sure it's right over it yeah you

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.540 
make sure it's right over it yeah you
can<00:01:50.799> put<00:01:50.950> there<00:01:51.610> so<00:01:52.240> monsters<00:01:52.690> can<00:01:52.869> spawn<00:01:53.140> but

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
can put there so monsters can spawn but

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.980 
can put there so monsters can spawn but
okay<00:01:54.550> and<00:01:54.850> then<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.450> would<00:01:55.540> usually<00:01:55.690> just

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
okay and then you would usually just

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.359 
okay and then you would usually just
wait<00:01:56.110> for<00:01:56.259> them<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.409> grow<00:01:56.590> but<00:01:56.920> I'm<00:01:57.070> gonna<00:01:57.190> use

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
wait for them to grow but I'm gonna use

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.070 
wait for them to grow but I'm gonna use
bone<00:01:57.640> meal<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.680> saplings

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
bone meal on the saplings

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.780 
bone meal on the saplings
so<00:02:02.080> when<00:02:02.470> they<00:02:02.590> grow<00:02:02.860> they<00:02:03.070> will<00:02:03.190> all<00:02:03.460> grow

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
so when they grow they will all grow

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.710 
so when they grow they will all grow
like<00:02:04.030> this<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:06.159> don't<00:02:06.280> need<00:02:06.490> saplings<00:02:07.299> but

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
like this you don't need saplings but

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.160 
like this you don't need saplings but
they<00:02:08.170> will<00:02:08.319> all<00:02:08.440> grow<00:02:08.649> like<00:02:08.860> this<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.899> this<00:02:11.050> is

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
they will all grow like this so this is

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.509 
they will all grow like this so this is
how<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.380> will<00:02:11.470> look<00:02:11.530> fully<00:02:11.920> grown<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:15.310> it's

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
how it will look fully grown and it's

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:22.290 
how it will look fully grown and it's
lagging<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:16.090> bit<00:02:20.790> okay<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:22.060> how<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.239> will

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
lagging a bit okay this is how it will

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.720 
lagging a bit okay this is how it will
look<00:02:22.360> fully<00:02:22.690> grown<00:02:22.989> and<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.980> course<00:02:24.190> no<00:02:24.459> big

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
look fully grown and of course no big

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:34.350 
look fully grown and of course no big
oak<00:02:24.910> screw<00:02:25.390> because<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:34.330> can

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
oak screw because of that and you can

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.320 
oak screw because of that and you can
just<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.950> can<00:02:39.130> chop<00:02:39.340> them<00:02:39.459> down<00:02:39.519> as<00:02:39.910> you<00:02:40.120> chop

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
just you can chop them down as you chop

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.530 
just you can chop them down as you chop
down<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:42.100> leaves<00:02:42.310> obviously<00:02:42.820> despawn<00:02:43.209> and

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
down the leaves obviously despawn and

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.250 
down the leaves obviously despawn and
