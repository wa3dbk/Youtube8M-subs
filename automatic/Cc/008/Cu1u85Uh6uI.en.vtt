00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.140
 hello friends today we have a 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.440
 small tutorial on how to install 09 in 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.190
 a galaxy s2 we have 9 as you will know is the 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.530
 most popular custom rom version 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.990
 based on ice cream sandwich but I 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.560
 encouragement is so far to install it since 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.090
 came out the rc 19 mod versions that are 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.590
 the salt and scania that is the latest version 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.510
 of tests that comes out before the release 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.830
 definitive of the rom means that 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.000
 let's have a lot of stability is not going 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.759
 to work all the options of 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.200
 phone with total peace of mind 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.460
 as he always heals the bikes and 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.630
 updating almost every week 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.520
 and up to two days in a row so 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:44.060
 has very good support even better 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.980
 that the descent is to say my galaxy s2 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.930
 is with your stock rom with the phone 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.020
 installed is a lunch that I told you 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.100
 on the page a couple of days ago but 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.720
 as you can see here in the menu 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.430
 configuration is the same rom that is 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.370
 on the phone the only difference is 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.920
 that I have it rooted this function 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.500
 animation four points 0.3 official 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.120
 I think it does not look very good here 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.320
 but I have it rooted then what 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.900
 first thing we have to do is 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.540
 install from the web play the application 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.600
 road manager is free that tape the me 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.060
 I leave the link of the article and a 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.250
 Once we have it, we have access to 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.690
 she 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.550
 of course we have to have the 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.870
 phone rooted and we have to have 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.390
 all the files that you leave the 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.560
 downloaded links that are the rom 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.560
 doing 9 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.760
 and the google apps that are the archives 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.030
 then we download in it 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.030
 the 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.820
 the Roman already 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.560
 and we proceed to press this button that 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.149
 says flashing clockwork mod recovery 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.159
 he will give us the options of the 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.110
 different samsung galaxy that there are by 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.600
 course in my case and you too 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.230
 they will select samsung galaxy s2 without 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.880
 no code on any operator next 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.300
 the same procedure serves for the 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.820
 at &amp; t and the spring but but the other 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.640
 vowels the original galaxy s2 the 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.050
 traditional and 9,100 I will not do 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.220
 again because I already did it but this 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.960
 only I've done the other steps that 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.880
 I'm going to do next, it's going to be 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.040
 first time 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.440
 the installation of the rome while he recorded 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.240
 the video once we already stated that 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.670
 I recommend having the phone in mode 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.620
 plane nothing more with the wife on that 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.150
 they need it to download the balloon mod 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.470
 so that we do not bother any 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.470
 notification or anything like that 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.640
 we enter the recovery by pressing the 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.640
 option to restart the tour 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:52.690
 to start from trying to place 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.660
 somewhere because I'm recording with 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.540
 the tablet is a bit heavy 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.950
 although it is restarting in recovery 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.629
 here we enter 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.640
 we have different options the first 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.310
 it says restart the system now all 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.310
 clear the second apply update 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.230
 from the sd card the third wild data and 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.870
 billed reset which is to erase all of the 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.450
 phone the fourth white cache of the 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.870
 fifth install zip promise of cars to 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:26.860
 install a yes from the memory a-3 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.860
 the next goes with the rector support and 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.040
 resume the support we made and the 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.310
 others honestly we do not care for 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.080
 what else we should touch to something else 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.850
 to do this procedure 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.410
 we need a sd card towards the 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.550
 phone have 16 or 32 gigs of 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.410
 storage 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.740
 the boat is made on an sd card 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.180
 then have an sd card 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.850
 introduced in the phone and in it in 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.230
 the root we put the two files that are 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.910
 the Roman google apps but that the 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.709
 I explain better in the post 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.750
 The first thing we are going to do is go to 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.600
 the ship option to the rector I know that no 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.620
 it would be much 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.040
 but no 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.200
 I will go accepting the road ok we 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.220
 move with the volume buttons and 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.040
 we select with the off button 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.989
 protective white is first thing the 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.750
 first option is low and that's what we're going 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.579
 to select and he will be a ship of 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.380
 everything or be an endorsement of all the 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.449
 phone like this one from the original rome 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.919
 which was awaited by a lawyer very 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.080
 pendrive in the cloud where they want 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.100
 because the day that we want to do between 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.370
 the phone and we want to sell it 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.020
 original we can recover how he was and 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.289
 leave it exactly the same with this rom 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.810
 and if we advance, we screw up 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.849
 we have a small accident installing 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.150
 the balls in 929 this is the one that's going 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.150
 to save 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:50.879
 and we go to the phone as if nothing happened 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:55.289
 this is going to take a little bit because the 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:58.169
 phone from a lot of data a lot 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.009
 try to let me introduce 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.719
 on the phone to do the 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.719
 procedure is at least 4 GB 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.030
 good while doing the boat 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.400
 I commented 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.990
 how am I repeating the steps but I 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.320
 we unload everything we need 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.630
 which is the rice file and the google 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.420
 apps 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.350
 those are like 180 and some mega in 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.420
 total more much 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.830
 we introduce them to the root of the ex of 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.260
 kart the root of sdk 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.330
 it's just like putting them in any 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.330
 folder or the first thing that appears 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.130
 and enter the exceed in the 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.130
 computer 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.620
 the next thing is to download rumba from yesterday 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:46.620
 from the google play hector 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.370
 then install the new arrows the 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.290
 club huergo recovery from the same 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.490
 application taking permissions safe route 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.700
 If we do not have a course to be able to do 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.700
 nothing 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.520
 and later 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.780
 enter the recovery 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.160
 this is giving a little more than what 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.160
 I thought there I think I'm not going to record 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:13.050
 all the video run because if it's not going to 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.050
 last a long time in your breakfast 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.540
 but what is working is 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.340
 working because the bar is not 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.510
 has started to fill but they're going 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.640
 appearing more and more options 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.570
 first he said supporting the image of 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.950
 glute 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.240
 then backing the system and now 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.240
 is backing the data 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:44.219
 I will hope that it is also the 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:44.219
 backup for then for the video when 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.729
 when you are installing the rom that 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.820
 It will also take a little longer to 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:54.080
 that a whole rather long process 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:56.599
 this more like router to the phone 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.030
 that was quickie if you remember the 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:00.980
 tutorial if any did it with what 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.500
 we indicate on the page 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.740
 or install the four point version 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.050
 0.33 before it also takes a few minutes 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.330
 plus 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.220
 but not as much as scaling a 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.419
 rice because we are restoring the 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.310
 phone totally from factory 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:17.990
 install something new 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.240
 but fat in cloud mode applications 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.180
 and that kind of application is something 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.500
 totally safe 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.419
 another fact that I have forgotten 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.040
 mention them but only to mention 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:30.130
 in the article 

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.960
 is to have the total battery and 

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:36.139
 absolutely charged 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:39.020
 because the worst thing that could happen is that 

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:41.449
 run out of battery while we're 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.360
 installing the rom 

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:46.289
 or doing the backup or restoring a 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.779
 backup in any case 

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:50.779
 that is something terrible that should not happen 

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.900
 so good while you're doing the 

00:07:53.320 --> 00:08:00.110
 boat I'm going to stop the video and in a 

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:03.550
 second part I will continue as you 

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.550
 thanks for
