00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 a devil is that the brothers of minecraft 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.370
 I am a piece and today I am here for 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.860
 to present you a new fashion the fashion of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.049
 today it is very simple called demones 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.740
 mob what this fashion introduces to us 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.539
 practically introduces us to different mobs 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.939
 inspired by demons this furniture 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.439
 but we can only find it in never 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.180
 that is even if we are going to look for them in 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.150
 normal world excused me donated not 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.070
 make you not find them because why 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.860
 are findable are in the header that is spa 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.260
 a were normally we say 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.719
 I 'm automatically in the see though 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.629
 through their spammers we can 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.010
 also find strength of the never thing 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.050
 we have these for example 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.829
 masks with which we can shoot him in 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.770
 normal world 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.469
 Meanwhile, let us take a diamond sword 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.300
 yes, a diamond blade then 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.730
 a shoulder strap lover or the well-known ships times 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.359
 the inchanto by clicking hicks and putting 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.489
 the maximum level already 10 even 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.320
 shopping 10 and see the mobs there 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.570
 there are so many certain there are also 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.010
 for example of the fires of the types of 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.400
 fire to see the first to the first 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.080
 is the gold home b so then meanwhile 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.909
 you see they burn the sunlight in fact 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.740
 must star nenÃ¨ der once dead 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.049
 this doesn't give us too much nothing 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.909
 the experience certain mobs are a moment 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.009
 more visuals that are beautiful to look at but 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.259
 I must tell you that some are really but 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.850
 really strong then look better 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.250
 let's put an armor on it 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.220
 then we have a diamond armor 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.560
 let's try with this look see 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.600
 when it hits me mida poison and it is 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.159
 quite strong even with blows ie 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.470
 pulls me away two or three hearts and I have a 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.720
 diamond owner therefore imagine the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.270
 damage that makes me is very, very strong 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.850
 years to see according to that is the cras that 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.130
 the crus look at the textures when they are 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.689
 do this well here at a very worm 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.390
 nice too this done really well 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.159
 we see the harm that this does to us 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.719
 it does as much damage as you see to have it 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.740
 even pincers animation a lot 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.020
 hard to hit 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.700
 you see I can't do enough to hit him and he is 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.780
 even more resistant than normal ie 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.659
 three shots 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.060
 and once dead c.da winters flint e 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.370
 play we repair life for a moment 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.950
 perfect years to see next mob ie 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.830
 the crypt dom b instead this what does there 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.660
 hunger hunger would give hunger and 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.670
 let's say practically nothing 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.110
 cita de rang costumes is this here too 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.700
 this one is strong enough because two 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.400
 shots with a sharpless 10 ie 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.680
 remember that I have a sharpless 10 ie 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.480
 it's not like I'm using a sword 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.400
 maiano any backcountry ski that does not 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.319
 exists and is very strong 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.209
 at 9 o'clock fair also this one 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.980
 texture done really well what it does 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.260
 practically throws us these words of 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.660
 fire calls doom fire sergi that 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.269
 remained for now I was going to bet 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.630
 how they work we can create fire 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.190
 just like the shared file 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.450
 we kill is quite difficult to 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.489
 kill him also because he cares 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.400
 distance through these balls however is 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.989
 very weak because with a blow he dies 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.870
 we see that he finds us alone 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.260
 the experience and nothing else so I don't know 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.090
 how useful can we say 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.500
 but killing him is also very difficult 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.880
 because it keeps us at a distance with the balls 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.680
 of fire and consider that I have a 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.989
 diamond owner a certain in the ten 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.079
 let's see now the bim oct 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.420
 how it works indeed of albi move is a 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.530
 really great monster that launch us of 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.200
 these fireballs really is 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.750
 details why these balls 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.250
 of fire are green 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.900
 practically the fire that generates green 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.260
 how the other keeps us at a distance too 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.410
 he 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.489
 you see it is quite difficult to 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.019
 build a little bit easier to 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.230
 kill but more life 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.989
 you see two shots and the drop dies too 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.370
 here nothing alone experience I do not know what 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.630
 serve these new then there are those 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.940
 which will give us the objects instead 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.269
 ok so this is what you find 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.370
 that is, the elf floats how it works 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.620
 practically at an infinite blue fire 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.900
 very beautiful that is not really infinite 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.670
 oh well it lasts for some time but the 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.380
 nice thing is not blue like I said before 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.150
 but it's green 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.700
 then now let's see the trade 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.040
 the drive retract what sort of 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.380
 mini spider that when it touches us c dal 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.299
 with her that is, it gives us for itself is like the 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.000
 poison for those unfamiliar with power 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.590
 of the leader that is how the poison is also 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.959
 very difficult to kill because else 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.010
 half block is like laying a but there 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.960
 that is, kill 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.180
 let half your heart destroy us 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.130
 and this spider is very, very strong 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.630
 because they attack us en masse and it's a lot 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.640
 but very difficult to succeed in 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.260
 survive and c after a string 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.270
 we then have neversoft 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.720
 this one here too very beautiful here 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.570
 the texture look or a devil and how 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.270
 it works look now if i can 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.700
 hit him when we kill him bursts 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.280
 as you can see how you could see us 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.050
 find a good let's say it's enough 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.580
 difficult because even these here spa 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.020
 not in a group even if they are weak 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.300
 we say that the new and weakest are 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:56.460
 those that shoot in groups and make you 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.980
 just the big butt a year a 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:04.440
 see how nice pinky pink but oh hee 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:06.540
 my own malformed pinky god we turn 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.630
 in a moment the damage done two 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:13.470
 hearts are there but two shots are deformed between 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.760
 about 123 backlashes see you too 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.620
 the drop experience 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.740
 subsequently we have the damon caco a 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:25.250
 name a lousy legend looks like a 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:28.770
 flying eye, however, or shit 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.950
 how much heart takes me to no oh well then 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.510
 I was already damaged before wait takami 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.190
 a heart goes well 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.170
 and then there is that there are what dots 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.450
 breaking it in the area we kill it 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.960
 very easy to kill a little bit with 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:45.990
 gas lies what the blade road 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.060
 the blitz power sorry that you need then 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.770
 let's say it would be the dust of the 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.590
 bridge road what you get from 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.410
 blazers the latest furniture is introduced is 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.170
 the small plasmids I have not yet understood 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:01.620
 what is it because it would be a brainy spider 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:03.300
 who fires these bolts in bursts 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.910
 it's practically difficult because in the 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.740
 nether we do not have the grass and therefore there 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.260
 these are always coming at them 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.270
 balls and it is very difficult to kill him 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.220
 because it practically keeps us at a distance 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.620
 in a way we only have to turn 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.990
 around however also quite difficult 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.350
 kill him because with four shots 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.660
 see after being after we killed him 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.710
 span speak all the mini spiders that 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.170
 they are the ones I showed you before 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.370
 that give us the winter so if already 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.900
 we are damaged by the 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:36.220
 the battle with the giant spider 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.199
 children sprout and make us their own 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.060
 sit as big as a house 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:42.729
 see that I can't turn it off because the 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.199
 fire here is infinite you see is a fire 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.669
 infinite now I don't know why I 'm not 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:48.610
 I don't even catch fire anymore 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:49.060
 is a graphic bug anyway I believe 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.280
 own 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.949
 wait i can't even smash 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.400
 blog loves because I'm playing well but fans 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:59.350
 drink is not an infinite fire you see it is not 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.780
 a little infinite is an infinite game 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.720
 how bio is an infinite fire is a 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.070
 infinite game just to take it off 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.199
 we have to smash under because if me 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.479
 try for example destroy here you see 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:13.150
 it doesn't work I have to destroy 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:16.360
 below and or my god if I go here it's a bug 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:18.580
 graph catches fire ok he discovered a 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.020
 fashion bugs so guys this is 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.410
 all that introduces us this new one 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.479
