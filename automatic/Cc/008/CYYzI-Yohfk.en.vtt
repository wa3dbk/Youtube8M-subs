00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
look like the original and quite frankly

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.570 
look like the original and quite frankly
from<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.810> photograph<00:01:25.740> when<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:25.979> get<00:01:26.220> them<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
from a photograph when I get them on the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.710 
from a photograph when I get them on the
internet<00:01:26.880> sometimes<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.360> can't<00:01:27.630> tell

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
internet sometimes you can't tell

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.130 
internet sometimes you can't tell
because<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.520> Charlie<00:01:30.509> Russell<00:01:30.720> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
because it can be a Charlie Russell and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.780 
because it can be a Charlie Russell and
it<00:01:31.350> looks<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> Charlie<00:01:32.189> Russell<00:01:32.340> because

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
it looks like a Charlie Russell because

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.399 
it looks like a Charlie Russell because
hey<00:01:33.119> guess<00:01:33.390> what<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.930> is

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
hey guess what it is

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.999 
hey guess what it is
but<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.189> copy<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.180> G<00:01:36.479> clay<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.560> when

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
but it's a copy it's a G clay so when

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.370 
but it's a copy it's a G clay so when
you<00:01:38.130> look<00:01:38.490> at<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> piece<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.210> person<00:01:39.810> you

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
to the paint those u clays will often

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.950 
to the paint those u clays will often
have<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.850> brushstrokes<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:48.630> you'll<00:01:48.750> see

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.000 
very last thing that I take into
consideration<00:03:32.270> because<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:33.200> signature<00:03:33.620> is

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
consideration because the signature is

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.910 
consideration because the signature is
easier<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.460> fake<00:03:34.790> than<00:03:35.420> style<00:03:36.080> composition

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
easier to fake than style composition

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.980 
easier to fake than style composition
and<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.130> way<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.490> painting<00:03:37.850> looks<00:03:38.060> like<00:03:38.240> you

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
and the way the painting looks like you

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.450 
and the way the painting looks like you
know<00:03:39.080> they<00:03:39.230> can<00:03:39.380> be<00:03:39.500> a<00:03:39.530> good<00:03:39.710> forger<00:03:40.190> of<00:03:40.340> the

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
know they can be a good forger of the

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.340 
know they can be a good forger of the
name<00:03:40.640> Maynard<00:03:41.000> Dixon<00:03:41.150> but<00:03:41.510> they<00:03:41.810> can't<00:03:42.050> do<00:03:42.200> the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
name Maynard Dixon but they can't do the

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.200 
name Maynard Dixon but they can't do the
palette<00:03:42.770> they<00:03:42.950> can't<00:03:43.190> do<00:03:43.340> this<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:43.850> structure

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
palette they can't do this the structure

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.480 
palette they can't do this the structure
of<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.510> composition<00:03:44.870> of<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.350> painting<00:03:45.590> even

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
of the composition of the painting even

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.760 
of the composition of the painting even
if<00:03:46.610> it's<00:03:46.730> an<00:03:46.850> old<00:03:47.000> painting<00:03:47.330> it<00:03:47.930> just<00:03:48.380> doesn't

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
if it's an old painting it just doesn't

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.250 
if it's an old painting it just doesn't
hack<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.160> so<00:03:49.310> when<00:03:50.270> you<00:03:50.420> look<00:03:50.660> at<00:03:50.810> these<00:03:50.960> things

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
hack it so when you look at these things

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.180 
hack it so when you look at these things
be<00:03:51.860> very<00:03:52.160> critical<00:03:52.960> look<00:03:53.960> for<00:03:54.230> age<00:03:54.410> especially

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
be very critical look for age especially

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.490 
be very critical look for age especially
on<00:03:55.310> old<00:03:55.610> pieces<00:03:56.060> they<00:03:56.270> should<00:03:56.660> have<00:03:56.990> a<00:03:57.020> certain

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
on old pieces they should have a certain

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.860 
on old pieces they should have a certain
sensibility<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:58.430> if<00:03:58.820> they<00:03:58.970> don't<00:03:59.300> get<00:03:59.720> an

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
sensibility and if they don't get an

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.900 
sensibility and if they don't get an
expert<00:04:00.470> to<00:04:00.500> look<00:04:00.860> at<00:04:01.040> it<00:04:01.160> before<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:01.550> ever

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
expert to look at it before you ever

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:11.770 
expert to look at it before you ever
purchase<00:04:02.420> it

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.810 

Oh
