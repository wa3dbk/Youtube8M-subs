00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
acid so you shouldn't have that heart of

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.410 
acid so you shouldn't have that heart of
a<00:02:43.260> time<00:02:43.530> blending<00:02:44.190> everything<00:02:45.030> in<00:02:45.209> together

a time blending everything in together
shake<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.629> few<00:02:48.840> more<00:02:48.959> times<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:51.230> their

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
shake it a few more times and their

00:02:53.359 --> 00:03:02.000 
shake it a few more times and their
solution<00:02:54.359> should<00:02:54.599> be<00:02:54.709> clear<00:02:59.329> and<00:03:01.010> the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
solution should be clear and the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.670 
solution should be clear and the
glycerin<00:03:02.549> is<00:03:02.670> what<00:03:02.879> holds<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:03.510> serum<00:03:03.959> together

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
glycerin is what holds a serum together

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.800 
glycerin is what holds a serum together
