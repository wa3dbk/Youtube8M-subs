00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.120
 tonight 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.940
 About list reflex camera 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:14.719
 I would like to talk a little. 14 f Camera can do various shooting. 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.680
 Like a video that I raised the function 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.130
 Interval video 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.880
 I'm going to release the shutter at regular intervals 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.880
 How to shoot 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.090
 High speed continuous shooting 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.930
 There are a lot of things that can be video shooting 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.680
 by the way 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.460
 Do you know by bulb photography 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.149
 a yes 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:57.809
 I think that adversaries are things like not so much ear 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:59.260
 Simply put, the shutter opens and releases 3 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:07.030
 For example 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:15.970
 A normal photo shutter speed of 1/100 seconds will open for only 1/100 of a second 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:19.250
 Mosquitoes shut and just now is one hundredth of a second is but one over to Panashin open it for 5 seconds Sha 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.020
 I 12345 Kasha' whether mode 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:30.440
 10 seconds for a little longer 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:34.140
 When was the can or long guy's I mean bought the 13 types increase Kusumi crumpling I Kasha 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.930
 One hour or several hours 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.430
 You can decide on this photo 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:46.810
 Take broadcast of 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:51.130
 I wonder if I use it for shooting starry sky or shooting in dark places 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:59.420
 Where is it necessary to use it like this 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:04.640
 For example, if you open the shutter in 1 / 100th of a second, light strikes the sensor 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.350
 The time is 1/100 second so it is very short time 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.740
 So for a moment I met other companies 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.130
 It's over but 5 seconds 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.310
 When I hit it , I opened it 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:22.830
 Apply here 12345 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:31.170
 In so wear I Kasha can be much 5 seconds continue to shed light 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:34.120
 Even if there is so little like a starry sky, it will be perfect to stay there for 5 seconds 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:40.650
 An image appears on the sensor 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:42.930
 But I really want to see an example from now on 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.829
 First of all 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.890
 Please see the image here 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.890
 eh 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:03:00.560
 The shutter speed was just watching Yes now one hundredth of a second 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.590
 The ISO sensitivity raised 12800 Mari 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.950
 It was an image and if the instinct level goes up 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:13.090
 The brighter the image 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:16.450
 It was so dark as you saw it no matter how much it was raised to 12800 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.540
 It is clear that the lights are clear to understand 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.019
 I think it was only reflected 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:31.530
 The present shutter speed 1/100 seconds 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:31.530
 Please refer to the following image in it's time take Te Kasha' when Well take an ordinary photo 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:47.360
 Yes ISO sensitivity now to the left open the shutter speed 5 seconds 5 seconds shutter 200 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:54.090
 I think that the noise is very little because it is lowered to 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:58.520
 Open for 5 seconds as you can see in comparison with the previous one, but the same scenery with light vortices 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:02.360
 I feel so bright that much because I take in 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.590
 In Please refer to the opening 10 seconds to the next 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.590
 Please 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:16.370
 I think it's a little brighter again compared to 5 seconds 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:23.780
 Whether this is referred to as the power of the bulb shooting 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:26.690
 What was the light all the time in the sensor depending on how Hiratsuka what seconds is is asleep Do not feel 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:32.490
 Or a moment whether they match putt 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:39.889
 I can do something like this. 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:39.889
 Ema I have a look at some of the photos I opened for a few seconds 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.269
 2 minutes 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.680
 Hmm 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.680
 7 

00:04:51.999 --> 00:05:03.259
 I think you got 23 photos 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:06.199
 It is quite impossible to shoot with a normal condÃ© or something like this SLR or something like that 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:11.910
 Camera-specific shooting method 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:12.750
 If you have a single-lens reflex or single-lens mirrorless, 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.840
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:22.170
 Little or try to take the starry sky 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:24.630
 Taking place a little dim or tried to take a month Mitari Toka of such a thing is also taking 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.780
 I think the breadth will be broadened 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:32.770
 Those who think that single-lens Do kinda want is 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:36.580
 Hey Well wonder if should I Tsunagare also purchase motivation a little 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:41.789
 In I thought you once in a while asleep Do not feel 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.789
 Well now when you can talk by little
