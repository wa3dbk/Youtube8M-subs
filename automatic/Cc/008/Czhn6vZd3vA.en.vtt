00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.550 
actually spawn and differently on this
map<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.600> shangri-la<00:01:19.020> when<00:01:19.409> they

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
map just like shangri-la when they

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.380 
map just like shangri-la when they
alternate<00:01:20.040> locations<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.360> be

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
alternate locations so you have to be

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.570 
alternate locations so you have to be
really<00:01:21.750> careful<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.259> which<00:01:22.500> door<00:01:22.799> not<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.460> open

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
really careful on which door not to open

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.580 
really careful on which door not to open
a<00:01:23.820> waste<00:01:24.000> door<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.630> open<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.020> find<00:01:25.259> your<00:01:25.409> purse

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
a waste door to open to find your purse

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.899 
a waste door to open to find your purse
because<00:01:25.799> sometimes<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.520> actually<00:01:26.670> have

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
because sometimes you can actually have

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.490 
because sometimes you can actually have
a<00:01:26.939> strategy<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:28.020> map<00:01:28.200> where<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.409> can

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
a strategy on this map where you can

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.469 
a strategy on this map where you can
keep<00:01:28.650> one<00:01:28.829> door<00:01:29.070> closed<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.759> all<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.299> gotta

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
keep one door closed and all you gotta

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.940 
keep one door closed and all you gotta
do<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:30.900> stay<00:01:31.110> behind<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> little

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950

on<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:57.030> map<00:01:57.240> which<00:01:57.479> really<00:01:57.719> sucks<00:01:58.049> because

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
on this map which really sucks because

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.080 
on this map which really sucks because
that's<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> only<00:01:59.100> reason<00:01:59.340> why<00:01:59.610> probably<00:01:59.880> I

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
that's the only reason why probably I

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.399 
that's the only reason why probably I
want<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.390> guess<00:02:00.509> for<00:02:00.750> us<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:00.990> would<00:02:01.229> like

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
want to guess for us that I would like

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.109 
want to guess for us that I would like
