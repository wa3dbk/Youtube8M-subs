00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
tabbing so they slide so here is with a

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.740 
tabbing so they slide so here is with a
size<00:00:35.880> comparison<00:00:36.260> to<00:00:37.370> bumblebee<00:00:38.370> ha<00:00:38.820> who<00:00:39.570> is

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
size comparison to bumblebee ha who is

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.990 
size comparison to bumblebee ha who is
the<00:00:39.989> same<00:00:40.170> sizes<00:00:40.910> movie<00:00:41.910> 1<00:00:42.090> bumblebee<00:00:42.600> if<00:00:42.690> not

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
figures cuz if you have the leaders with

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.270 
figures cuz if you have the leaders with
figures<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.950> or<00:00:59.190> skids<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:01.280> size

ranges are off completely his

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.590 
ranges are off completely his
articulation<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.740> amazing<00:01:08.279> and<00:01:08.459> if<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.359> press

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
articulation is amazing and if you press

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.459 
articulation is amazing and if you press
a<00:01:09.840> button<00:01:09.929> and<00:01:10.529> is<00:01:10.889> inner<00:01:11.609> arm<00:01:12.259> just<00:01:13.259> slide

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
a button and is inner arm just slide

back two swords will pop forward and

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.330 
back two swords will pop forward and
there<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.630> actually<00:01:19.170> Cybertronian<00:01:19.950> writing

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
there is actually Cybertronian writing

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.330 
there is actually Cybertronian writing
on<00:01:20.459> it<00:01:22.009> right<00:01:23.009> yeah<00:01:23.209> if<00:01:24.209> you<00:01:24.329> can<00:01:24.509> see<00:01:24.959> it<00:01:25.340> you

on it right yeah if you can see it you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.190 
on it right yeah if you can see it you
probably<00:01:26.369> can't<00:01:26.999> but<00:01:27.119> there<00:01:27.359> is<00:01:27.509> actually<00:01:28.109> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
probably can't but there is actually a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.440 
probably can't but there is actually a
fat<00:01:28.409> throne<00:01:28.709> Ian<00:01:28.920> letter<00:01:29.299> right<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.569> it<00:01:30.979> um<00:01:32.450> for

fat throne Ian letter right on it um for

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.599 
fat throne Ian letter right on it um for
once<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.840> actually<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.349> an<00:01:34.499> accurate<00:01:35.039> head

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
once we actually have an accurate head

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.260 
once we actually have an accurate head
mold<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.779> Prime<00:01:37.169> I<00:01:37.819> don't<00:01:38.819> know<00:01:38.939> why<00:01:39.090> they

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
mold for Prime I don't know why they

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.649 
mold for Prime I don't know why they
don't<00:01:39.450> they<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.109> the<00:01:40.409> face<00:01:41.659> mask<00:01:43.249> work<00:01:44.659> over

with just the mouth more accurate a

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:58.819 
with just the mouth more accurate a
little<00:01:51.479> bit<00:01:52.130> um<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:54.919> here<00:01:55.919> he<00:01:56.039> is<00:01:56.069> with<00:01:57.829> nut

little bit um so here he is with nut
Jetfire<00:02:00.169> Megatron<00:02:01.169> so<00:02:01.649> these<00:02:01.950> two<00:02:02.189> are<00:02:02.219> going

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.489 
Jetfire Megatron so these two are going

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.820 
Jetfire Megatron so these two are going
to<00:02:02.549> battle<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.939> out

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
to battle it out

to<00:02:05.190> have<00:02:05.370> a<00:02:05.420> very<00:02:06.420> accurate<00:02:07.350> figure<00:02:08.570> like<00:02:09.570> this

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
to have a very accurate figure like this

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.690 
to have a very accurate figure like this
Optimus<00:02:10.259> Prime<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:11.000> then<00:02:12.000> another<00:02:13.700> amazingly

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
Optimus Prime and then another amazingly

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.740 
Optimus Prime and then another amazingly
accurate<00:02:16.550> leave<00:02:17.550> your<00:02:17.700> combines<00:02:18.180> with<00:02:18.600> each

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
accurate leave your combines with each

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.290 
accurate leave your combines with each
others<00:02:19.080> which<00:02:19.980> I'm<00:02:20.190> referring<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.700> jet<00:02:21.060> pyre

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
others which I'm referring to a jet pyre

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.190 
others which I'm referring to a jet pyre
I<00:02:21.770> think<00:02:22.770> as<00:02:22.920> far<00:02:22.950> as<00:02:23.250> I've<00:02:23.370> done<00:02:23.580> themselves

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
I think as far as I've done themselves

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.540 
I think as far as I've done themselves
I'm<00:02:25.200> not<00:02:25.620> going<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.830> take<00:02:25.980> away<00:02:26.250> from<00:02:26.310> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
I'm not going to take away from the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.170 
I'm not going to take away from the
figure<00:02:26.790> because<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.240> this<00:02:27.420> back<00:02:28.350> problem<00:02:29.180> I'm

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
figure because of this back problem I'm

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.150 
figure because of this back problem I'm
sure<00:02:30.450> they're<00:02:31.020> not<00:02:31.230> going<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.500> snap<00:02:31.710> off<00:02:31.920> if

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
sure they're not going to snap off if

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.100 
sure they're not going to snap off if
you<00:02:32.250> bend<00:02:32.490> them<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:33.000> just<00:02:33.030> doesn't<00:02:33.720> look<00:02:33.840> nice

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
you bend them it just doesn't look nice

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.530 
you bend them it just doesn't look nice
with<00:02:34.380> these<00:02:34.620> white<00:02:35.400> fracture<00:02:36.030> marks<00:02:36.330> around

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
with these white fracture marks around

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.420 
with these white fracture marks around
it<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.770> overall<00:02:38.190> this<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.390> amazing<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:40.080> it

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
it but overall this is amazing to it

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.520 
it but overall this is amazing to it
