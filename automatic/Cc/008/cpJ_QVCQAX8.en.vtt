box then we have the Dei exhaust

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.689 
box then we have the Dei exhaust
manifold<00:00:22.109> wrap<00:00:22.350> I've<00:00:22.980> actually<00:00:23.189> got<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> full

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
manifold wrap I've actually got a full

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.970 
manifold wrap I've actually got a full
kit<00:00:23.970> here<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.630> wanted<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> show<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.289> these

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
in this kit is the wrap itself you see

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.160 
in this kit is the wrap itself you see
that<00:00:35.700> there<00:00:36.950> some<00:00:37.950> stainless<00:00:38.579> steel<00:00:39.180> ties<00:00:39.480> you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
that there some stainless steel ties you

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.700 
that there some stainless steel ties you
can<00:00:40.350> see<00:00:40.500> those<00:00:40.680> here<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:42.379> then<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> high

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
can see those here and then the high

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.330 
can see those here and then the high

thing I wanted to cover was the heat
wrap<00:00:51.449> itself<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> main<00:00:52.469> part<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
wrap itself this is the main part of the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.520 
wrap itself this is the main part of the
kit<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.210> course<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.539> black<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.170> it's

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
kit this of course is black we have it's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.410 
kit this of course is black we have it's
two<00:00:55.829> inches<00:00:56.010> by<00:00:56.340> 50<00:00:56.760> feet<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.149> should<00:00:57.300> be

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
two inches by 50 feet this should be

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.660 
two inches by 50 feet this should be
enough<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.289> full<00:00:58.829> manifold<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.489> should

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
enough to do a full manifold you should

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.029 
enough to do a full manifold you should
actually<00:00:59.820> have<00:01:00.090> some<00:01:00.329> left<00:01:00.539> over<00:01:00.980> I'm<00:01:01.980> not

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
actually have some left over I'm not

did want to show you guys the package
here<00:01:09.409> alright<00:01:10.409> then<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.189> course<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.610> comes

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
here alright then of course this comes

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.730 
here alright then of course this comes
with<00:01:13.880> stainless<00:01:14.880> steel<00:01:15.090> ties<00:01:15.320> right<00:01:16.320> here<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
with stainless steel ties right here and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.240 
with stainless steel ties right here and
act<00:01:17.009> she<00:01:17.280> can't<00:01:17.549> open<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:17.970> ones<00:01:18.240> up<00:01:19.250> show

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
act she can't open these ones up show

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.490 
act she can't open these ones up show
you<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.610> them<00:01:20.810> now<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.869> benefit<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you one of them now the benefit of a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.859 
you one of them now the benefit of a
stainless<00:01:22.920> steel<00:01:22.950> tie<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:24.360> fact<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.720> of

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
stainless steel tie the fact that of

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.240 
stainless steel tie the fact that of
course<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.229> stainless<00:01:25.439> steel<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.130> is

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
course it's stainless steel this is

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.520 
course it's stainless steel this is
going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> help<00:01:26.610> prevent<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.090> from<00:01:27.210> rusting

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
going to help prevent it from rusting

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.600 
going to help prevent it from rusting
that<00:01:28.530> kind<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.799> stuff<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.280> also<00:01:29.460> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that kind of stuff and then also you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.069 
that kind of stuff and then also you
can't<00:01:29.850> use<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> normal<00:01:30.119> zip<00:01:30.540> tie<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:30.840> because

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
can't use a normal zip tie just because

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.660 
can't use a normal zip tie just because
the<00:01:31.229> heat<00:01:31.380> involved<00:01:31.680> will<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.189> melt<00:01:32.369> away<00:01:32.490> so

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the heat involved will just melt away so

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.620 
the heat involved will just melt away so
we<00:01:33.299> do<00:01:33.390> have<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.630> use<00:01:33.750> stainless<00:01:33.990> steel<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
we do have to use stainless steel and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.760 
we do have to use stainless steel and
then<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.720> course<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.350> high<00:01:37.500> temp

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
then of course you have the high temp

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.830 
then of course you have the high temp
silicone<00:01:38.159> coating<00:01:38.579> here<00:01:38.759> now<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.540> going

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
silicone coating here now this is going

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.719 
silicone coating here now this is going
to<00:01:39.900> be<00:01:40.020> after<00:01:40.380> you've<00:01:40.530> already<00:01:41.369> installed<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
to be after you've already installed the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.940 
to be after you've already installed the
wrap<00:01:41.970> you've<00:01:42.240> wrapped<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.810> manifold<00:01:43.590> all<00:01:43.740> up

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
wrap you've wrapped the manifold all up

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.399 
wrap you've wrapped the manifold all up
you<00:01:44.490> are<00:01:44.610> going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:45.119> spray<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.170> nice

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
you are going to spray this on it nice

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.649 
you are going to spray this on it nice
even<00:01:46.710> coating<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.240> will<00:01:48.390> help<00:01:48.420> protect

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
even coating and this will help protect

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.460 
even coating and this will help protect
the<00:01:49.280> here<00:01:50.280> app<00:01:50.430> itself<00:01:50.790> from<00:01:51.119> moisture<00:01:51.750> water

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the here app itself from moisture water

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.440 
the here app itself from moisture water
oil<00:01:52.619> anything<00:01:53.549> like<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.329> on

fire it's more of a safety thing and

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.830 
fire it's more of a safety thing and
it'll<00:01:58.890> help<00:01:59.250> keep<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.969> manifold<00:02:00.390> lasting<00:02:00.780> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
