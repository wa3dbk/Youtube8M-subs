00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.420
 Hello everyone in this video I want 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.330
 talk a little in one inconvenience 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.580
 which is almost in all knives 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.550
 the victoroks say almost because 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.310
 In principle, all of course the model I do not 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.010
 saw here but actually 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.250
 most of which I was holding in my hands 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.439
 they are in all this inconvenience and also 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.500
 this inconvenience is grandson clicking here 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.269
 wenger here but in Germany it is not and 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.730
 even frankly if it was something 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:36.190
 at least in my case it can 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.399
 would fix 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.129
 means the words foot we are talking about exactly what 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:47.120
 it is about the displacement of the blade that is about 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.039
 the offset of the main blade in my 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.190
 wrong side so basically 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.550
 most people on this planet are right handed 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.190
 that is, they work with the right hand, of course 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.770
 it would be much more convenient to work if 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.680
 the blade, that is, the blade 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.860
 sides let 's say that's how it is done in 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.080
 case with a small blade 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.210
 I take the knife hand is not admissible here I sharpen 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.960
 some kind of wand i mean i do something 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.939
 I have something undercut and so on or here 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.530
 let's say on the plane between trying everything 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.150
 this shifted let's say this some 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.970
 planes see how comfortable I am 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.070
 work at the same time I still close this 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.950
 the blade itself did not interfere here 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.619
 at the same time due to the fact that if the handle 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.079
 the artist's pen is pretty 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.640
 wide here let's say see me what 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.740
 need longer libya there is something 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.390
 clean you see how much I do n't 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.130
 comfortable that is, I almost can't 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.970
 Leaning against the course I can do it 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.159
 to myself 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.229
 but not always it is much more convenient 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.479
 sometimes do it at home again 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.119
 minutes for something to drag and let's say here 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.920
 I want to spend this part here 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.170
 I already rested my fingers that is 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.920
 of course you can get out you can 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.149
 do anything but this inconvenience 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.439
 inconvenience also let's say we take 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.659
 larger model 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.969
 here we see the same thing here in principle 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.130
 the pen is again pretty wide and 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.170
 again this is the offset and 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.480
 again of course thanks for 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.950
 blade we can do something but in 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.480
 principle is not as convenient as 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.250
 if only the blade was ten here 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.410
 this is my 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.330
 quiz xi in principle basically the same 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.790
 the very thing is the blade is shifted to the wrong 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.870
 which side I would like to be here 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.350
 pen world is not at all wide so here 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.690
 this one can I just put in for 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.099
 sample not as an example because well in 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.230
 Basically due to the fact that actually quite 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:47.180
 Turk handle I clean it and in 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.680
 principle you see the same new items 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.319
 Of course I have a small model 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.980
 winger or rather I have a small wenger 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.200
 this model here but on other venger 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.390
 which I also did not have to use but 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.280
 I saw in the stores which is also a set 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.910
 some tools of course this is not 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.799
 so advanced they are as 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.569
 Viktorinoks and here but still all the same 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.970
 there are such models 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.670
 and bring too the blade is displaced for some reason 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.070
 the wrong side of course if i was 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.609
 left-handed I would be much more comfortable but 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.799
 yet i'm right handed i work with my right hand and 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.640
 thanks to this there are certain 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.590
 inconvenience 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.959
 of course I will tell you again this is not 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.230
 deadly it is not as critical as 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.630
 Here I am right now, but I still have 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.390
 inconvenience let this fog if we 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.829
 notice that the blade is displaced 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.470
 I think in the right direction and me them 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:43.130
 work much more convenient than she was 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.980
 it was 10 and besides, I'll close it first 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.980
 on invert and on the other hand 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.829
 serrated blade is also located 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.049
 In my strange with the right side 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.569
 here but but there is another nuance 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.510
 all this here is my waterman at least 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:02.260
 surzh my he collapsible and even if I 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.630
 I was left-handed, I can easily make out 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.730
 take this instrument with her here 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.889
 these here unscrew the screw and take out the sleeve and 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.250
 swap by swap 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:15.200
 scissors director if you even you 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.970
 look then they stand on the same axis 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.250
 because they even move 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:24.710
 a little bit here evening the sleeve is taken out and 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.860
 just swapping tools 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.660
 and maybe they will not change places and 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.060
 mirror relationship well i mean i think 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.880
 that they can be swapped at 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.340
 as far as the knives are possible, perhaps saw and 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.620
 scissors to put on one side of the legs 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.080
 and the Syrians to another one 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.090
 I think that you can change here 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.780
 yet nevertheless I want to say that 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.760
 quizzes xx have it in venger by 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.340
 I have 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:56.960
 the flaw is that the blade is shifted to 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.180
 right side here in principle now 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.940
 work for yourself of course it would 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.650
 convenient but from myself there is 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.780
 certain inconveniences that hold up 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.380
 to need something to cut the convenient 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.120
 uncomfortable for many things 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.140
 naturally i think you understand what we are 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.740
 do from yourself 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.750
 Well , of course you need 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.460
 say that was a huge plus a huge 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.300
 plus that if you could take it off 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.190
 these are the linings 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.460
 when you steam it is done fight 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:30.380
 lingerie is such a glue 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:34.400
 I will try to remove no problems but they are not 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.470
 starred if you open bringer 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.720
 it can be seen that he combed there a minute 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.610
 lining are removed and also say that I 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.620
 I see the Kosovo quiz designers 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.510
 that is what could be removed 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.660
 lining of course we can now 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:50.300
 cut that rivets swap 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.430
 tools I'll even tell you what to remove 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.220
 superfluous but still it will be no longer 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.320
 victorinox it already here will be deleted 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.520
 some tools and this will be 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.190
 certain amenities 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.229
 inconvenience of course we will not do so 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.260
 cool as it was done in the factory 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:11.320
 Now the backlash will start 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:13.450
 something starts here like this 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.340
 well, actually this is all 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.920
 I have to say that is again 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.740
 I will say that the Victorians and there and see 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.630
 there are certain inconveniences here they are not 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.050
 critical they are not deadly but still 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.050
 they are
