figured no big deal you just take the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.530 
figured no big deal you just take the
thermostat<00:00:41.520> off<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> wall<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.210> pull<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
thermostat off the wall you pull the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.720 
thermostat off the wall you pull the
wires<00:00:42.750> out<00:00:43.050> take<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> new<00:00:44.040> thermostat<00:00:44.370> link

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
wires out take the new thermostat link

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.610 
wires out take the new thermostat link
with<00:00:44.820> all<00:00:45.030> matches<00:00:45.450> up<00:00:45.600> move<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> wires<00:00:46.260> over

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
with all matches up move the wires over

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.830 
with all matches up move the wires over
and<00:00:46.739> I'll<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.920> fine<00:00:47.180> yeah<00:00:48.180> most<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.690> time

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
above 50 degrees I don't know what's

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.520 
above 50 degrees I don't know what's
going<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:56.910> she<00:00:57.570> had<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> bring<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.989> contractor

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
going on she had to bring a contractor

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.709 
going on she had to bring a contractor
in<00:00:58.620> because<00:00:58.770> she<00:00:58.890> lives<00:00:59.070> two<00:00:59.219> hours<00:00:59.250> away

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
figured out that the wires were swapped

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.140 
figured out that the wires were swapped
down<00:01:03.239> at<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> unit<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.880> obviously<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.090> in

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
down at the unit and obviously I'm up in

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.910 
down at the unit and obviously I'm up in
the<00:01:06.240> hallway<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.810> don't<00:01:07.049> know<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.439> I'm<00:01:07.770> not

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the one who wired the equipment 10 years

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.260 
the one who wired the equipment 10 years
ago<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.229> if<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.530> was<00:01:10.619> wired<00:01:10.830> perfectly<00:01:11.430> my

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
ago so if it was wired perfectly my

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.020 
ago so if it was wired perfectly my
little<00:01:12.570> process<00:01:13.020> would<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.320> worked<00:01:13.560> but

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030
