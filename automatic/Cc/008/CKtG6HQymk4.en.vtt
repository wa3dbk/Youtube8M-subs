down door traffic where if you will and
the<00:00:13.349> way<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.530> works<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:13.920> basically<00:00:14.070> stand

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
the way it works is you basically stand

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.099 
the way it works is you basically stand
up<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:14.670> block<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.750> got<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> lever

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
up this block and you got a lever

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.660 
up this block and you got a lever

that<00:00:26.130> took<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> few<00:00:26.609> tries<00:00:26.910> while<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.960> was

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
that took a few tries while I was

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.589 
that took a few tries while I was
recording<00:00:28.410> I'm<00:00:28.859> not<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.250> lie<00:00:29.599> but

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
recording I'm not going to lie but

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.630 
recording I'm not going to lie but
without<00:00:31.019> recording<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.619> do<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.890> almost<00:00:32.099> every

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
without recording I do it almost every

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.639 
without recording I do it almost every
time<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.750> I'm<00:00:34.020> going<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.260> attempt<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.300> make<00:00:36.300> a

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
time so I'm going to attempt to make a

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.979 
time so I'm going to attempt to make a
step-by-step<00:00:37.649> tutorial<00:00:38.190> here<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.430> second

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
step-by-step tutorial here in a second

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.560 
step-by-step tutorial here in a second
but<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.829> getting<00:00:41.309> kind<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.489> choppy<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.000> it

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
but it's getting kind of choppy and it

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.910 
but it's getting kind of choppy and it
may<00:00:42.690> not<00:00:42.780> work<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.200> doesn't<00:00:43.410> work<00:00:43.559> I'm<00:00:43.800> not

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
may not work and it doesn't work I'm not

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.410 
may not work and it doesn't work I'm not
going<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.129> put<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> video<00:00:44.670> we're<00:00:45.239> going<00:00:45.360> to

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
going to put in the video we're going to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.880 
going to put in the video we're going to
build<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.660> right<00:00:45.719> here<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.469> basically<00:00:46.680> when<00:00:46.829> I

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
build it right here so basically when I

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.850 
build it right here so basically when I
put<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.219> here<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.829> need<00:00:49.829> some

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
put this here like so I need some

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.229 
put this here like so I need some
redstone<00:00:50.480> this<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.809> some<00:00:51.960> dust<00:00:53.510> right<00:00:54.510> here

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
redstone this and some dust right here

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.510 
redstone this and some dust right here
right<00:00:57.239> here<00:00:57.270> right<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.020> right<00:00:59.210> there<00:01:01.520> this

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
right here right here right there this

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.899 
right here right here right there this
is<00:01:02.609> going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.250> turn<00:01:05.489> some<00:01:05.670> power

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
is going to be on so you turn some power

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.530 
is going to be on so you turn some power
on<00:01:06.180> right<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:07.369> like<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.700> that's<00:01:08.790> our<00:01:09.000> so

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
on right here like that so that's our so

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.969 
on right here like that so that's our so
this<00:01:09.720> lever<00:01:09.990> right<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.710> act<00:01:10.860> as

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
this lever right here is going to act as

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.450 
this lever right here is going to act as
this<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:12.439> off<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.500> side<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.220> is

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
this one up here off the side of this is

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
this one up here off the side of this is
going<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> repeater<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.900> sticky

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
going to go a repeater with a sticky

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.469 
going to go a repeater with a sticky
piston<00:01:18.049> off<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.320> side<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:21.380> like<00:01:22.380> that

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
piston off the side of it like that

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.789 
piston off the side of it like that
they're<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.689> put<00:01:24.810> full<00:01:25.200> power<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.590> Peter

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
they're going to put full power to Peter

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.990 
they're going to put full power to Peter
power<00:01:26.729> over<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.420> goes<00:01:27.540> out<00:01:27.750> here

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
power over that so it goes out here

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.929 
power over that so it goes out here
comes<00:01:30.000> back<00:01:30.299> out<00:01:30.570> n<00:01:32.990> put<00:01:33.990> repeater<00:01:34.290> here

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
comes back out n put repeater here

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:41.149 
comes back out n put repeater here
pulling<00:01:35.939> right<00:01:36.090> there<00:01:37.460> something<00:01:38.460> dust<00:01:40.159> and

pulling right there something dust and
put<00:01:41.340> some<00:01:41.430> crap<00:01:41.670> right<00:01:41.909> there<00:01:42.829> at<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:43.920> point

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
put some crap right there at this point

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.710 
put some crap right there at this point
in<00:01:44.250> time<00:01:44.340> we're<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.640> put<00:01:44.729> our<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.570> on

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
in time we're going to put our this on

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.120 
in time we're going to put our this on
top<00:01:45.899> there's<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.680> narrow<00:01:46.890> one<00:01:47.009> up

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
top there's going to be a narrow one up

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.830 
top there's going to be a narrow one up
here<00:01:48.680> which<00:01:49.680> has<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.250> piston<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.030> which<00:01:51.780> is

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
here which has a piston that which is

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.260 
here which has a piston that which is
going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> have<00:01:52.259> its<00:01:52.290> own<00:01:52.619> repeater<00:01:53.119> set<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
going to have its own repeater set the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.020 
going to have its own repeater set the
full<00:01:54.659> power<00:01:55.170> believed<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> third

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
full power believed to the third

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.240 
full power believed to the third
position<00:01:58.820> also<00:01:59.820> going<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.060> one<00:02:00.210> over<00:02:00.390> here

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
position also going to one over here

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.319 
position also going to one over here
alright<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.399> basically<00:02:02.640> going<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> line<00:02:03.149> over

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
alright so basically going to line over

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.419 
alright so basically going to line over
here<00:02:04.640> all<00:02:05.640> right<00:02:05.820> here<00:02:06.469> going<00:02:07.469> out<00:02:07.680> we're
