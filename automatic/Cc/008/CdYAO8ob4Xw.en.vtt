00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
is kind of the an example of a great

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.880 
is kind of the an example of a great
entry-level<00:00:58.790> dive<00:00:59.239> watch<00:00:59.540> or<00:00:59.890> more

entry-level dive watch or more

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.890 
entry-level dive watch or more
importantly<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.400> new<00:01:01.730> iteration<00:01:02.300> of<00:01:02.330> a<00:01:02.690> great

importantly the new iteration of a great
entry-level<00:01:03.230> dive<00:01:03.650> watch<00:01:04.000> so<00:01:05.000> this<00:01:05.150> new<00:01:05.300> model

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
entry-level dive watch so this new model

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.370 
entry-level dive watch so this new model
retains<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.170> 43<00:01:06.740> millimeter<00:01:07.130> case<00:01:07.570> it's<00:01:08.570> 13

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
retains the 43 millimeter case it's 13

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.480 
retains the 43 millimeter case it's 13
millimeters<00:01:09.950> tall<00:01:11.020> 40<00:01:12.020> 7.5<00:01:12.800> millimeters<00:01:13.190> from

millimeters tall 40 7.5 millimeters from
lug<00:01:13.730> to<00:01:13.880> lug<00:01:14.030> so<00:01:14.210> if<00:01:14.270> you've<00:01:14.360> got<00:01:14.480> a<00:01:14.540> smaller

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
lug to lug so if you've got a smaller

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.270 
lug to lug so if you've got a smaller
wrist<00:01:15.230> this<00:01:15.380> one<00:01:15.560> still<00:01:15.770> does<00:01:15.950> pretty<00:01:16.190> well

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
wrist this one still does pretty well

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.840 
wrist this one still does pretty well

looking at a total weight of about 113

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.120 
looking at a total weight of about 113
grams<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:22.850> not<00:01:23.030> too<00:01:23.180> bad<00:01:23.360> in<00:01:23.540> any<00:01:23.690> way<00:01:23.810> at<00:01:23.930> all

the big update to this model which we'll

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.680 
the big update to this model which we'll
get<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.410> first<00:01:27.770> is<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.430> addition<00:01:29.420> of<00:01:29.480> a<00:01:29.570> new

movement<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.440> seven<00:01:30.830> seven<00:01:31.130> nine<00:01:31.160> and

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
movement so the seven seven nine and

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.480 
movement so the seven seven nine and
seven<00:01:31.760> eight<00:01:31.970> one<00:01:32.150> skx<00:01:32.990> models<00:01:33.440> they<00:01:34.100> relied

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
seven eight one skx models they relied

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.240 
seven eight one skx models they relied
on<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:35.060> 7s<00:01:35.600> 26<00:01:36.230> movement<00:01:36.650> which<00:01:36.800> is<00:01:36.920> a<00:01:36.950> fine

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
on the 7s 26 movement which is a fine

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.460 
on the 7s 26 movement which is a fine
workhorse<00:01:37.850> movement<00:01:38.240> very<00:01:38.390> cheap<00:01:38.720> but<00:01:39.230> very

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
workhorse movement very cheap but very

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.050 
workhorse movement very cheap but very
reliable<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:40.280> goes<00:01:40.430> a<00:01:40.460> long<00:01:40.670> time<00:01:40.940> without

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
reliable and goes a long time without

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.930 
reliable and goes a long time without
service<00:01:41.660> not<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.770> most<00:01:42.920> accurate<00:01:43.190> and<00:01:43.700> it

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
service not the most accurate and it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.000 
service not the most accurate and it
didn't<00:01:44.210> feature<00:01:44.420> hacking<00:01:44.990> or<00:01:45.170> hand<00:01:45.560> winding

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
didn't feature hacking or hand winding

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.100 
didn't feature hacking or hand winding
so<00:01:46.250> if<00:01:46.790> you<00:01:46.940> wanted<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:47.330> try<00:01:47.510> and<00:01:47.660> stop<00:01:47.900> the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
so if you wanted to try and stop the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.840 
so if you wanted to try and stop the
movement<00:01:48.320> to<00:01:48.650> set<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:48.980> directly<00:01:49.310> with<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.550> point

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
movement to set it directly with a point

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.310 
movement to set it directly with a point
in<00:01:50.030> time<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:50.450> kind<00:01:50.570> of<00:01:50.660> had<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.900> apply<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.170> bit

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
in time you kind of had to apply a bit

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.380 
in time you kind of had to apply a bit
of<00:01:51.380> back<00:01:51.590> pressure<00:01:51.620> on<00:01:52.010> the<00:01:52.100> crown<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:52.790> got

excellent fantastic bracelet for this
price<00:04:01.130> point<00:04:01.160> I<00:04:01.550> really<00:04:02.390> wanted<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.780> three

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
price point I really wanted the three

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.140 
price point I really wanted the three
one<00:04:03.110> three<00:04:03.260> because<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:03.530> like<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:03.920> red<00:04:04.150> hands

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
and markers and and I think that gives

and markers and and I think that gives
you<00:04:07.400> a<00:04:07.430> good<00:04:07.610> look<00:04:07.760> at<00:04:07.940> what<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.239> the<00:04:08.600> new<00:04:08.720> dial

that<00:04:19.700> you've<00:04:19.820> now<00:04:20.000> they've<00:04:20.359> removed<00:04:20.660> the

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
that you've now they've removed the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.780 
that you've now they've removed the
minute<00:04:21.200> scaling<00:04:21.919> that<00:04:22.100> was<00:04:22.220> done<00:04:22.430> on<00:04:22.460> the

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
minute scaling that was done on the

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.909 
minute scaling that was done on the
inside<00:04:23.270> of<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.630> markers<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.229> they've<00:04:24.770> also

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
inside of the markers and they've also

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.500 
inside of the markers and they've also
changed<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.430> marker<00:04:25.760> shape<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.150> be<00:04:26.240> more<00:04:26.390> of<00:04:26.450> a

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
changed the marker shape to be more of a

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.390 
changed the marker shape to be more of a
tooth<00:04:26.720> style<00:04:27.110> I<00:04:27.320> think<00:04:27.590> works<00:04:28.010> really<00:04:28.100> well

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
tooth style I think works really well

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.550 
tooth style I think works really well
and<00:04:29.270> I<00:04:29.510> really<00:04:29.690> like<00:04:29.930> it<00:04:30.050> there's<00:04:30.229> obviously

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
and I really like it there's obviously

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.770 
and I really like it there's obviously
some<00:04:30.800> dissenters<00:04:31.250> online<00:04:31.700> but<00:04:32.390> overall<00:04:32.630> I

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
some dissenters online but overall I

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.270 
some dissenters online but overall I
think<00:04:32.900> it's<00:04:33.140> a<00:04:33.200> great<00:04:33.380> update<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:33.919> you<00:04:34.160> get

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
think it's a great update and you get

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.980 
think it's a great update and you get
the<00:04:34.400> new<00:04:34.550> movement<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.120> it's<00:04:35.360> not<00:04:35.510> that<00:04:35.780> much

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
the new movement and it's not that much

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.140 
the new movement and it's not that much
more<00:04:36.169> money<00:04:36.440> than<00:04:36.710> the<00:04:36.800> old<00:04:36.919> version<00:04:37.040> which<00:04:38.030> is

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
more money than the old version which is

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.330 
more money than the old version which is
especially<00:04:38.450> great<00:04:38.810> now<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.680> big<00:04:39.919> concern

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
especially great now the big concern

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.310 
especially great now the big concern
with<00:04:40.610> these<00:04:40.820> is<00:04:41.090> obviously<00:04:41.240> with<00:04:41.720> with<00:04:42.050> people

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320

easily stands up to my double-oh-seven
and<00:04:58.320> to<00:04:58.500> my<00:04:58.710> memory<00:04:59.130> of<00:04:59.160> the<00:04:59.400> 779<00:05:00.210> it's<00:05:00.480> very

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750

but it is very bright and it lasts for a

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.870 
but it is very bright and it lasts for a
very<00:05:06.240> long<00:05:06.600> time<00:05:06.630> I<00:05:06.900> easily<00:05:07.730> charged<00:05:08.730> it

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
very long time I easily charged it

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.220 
very long time I easily charged it
before<00:05:09.150> going<00:05:09.330> into<00:05:09.570> a<00:05:09.690> movie<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.140> other

a 2 hour film and and then was still

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.840 
a 2 hour film and and then was still
plenty<00:05:16.560> usable<00:05:16.950> throughout<00:05:17.190> the<00:05:17.310> evening<00:05:17.460> so

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
plenty usable throughout the evening so

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.210 
plenty usable throughout the evening so
it's<00:05:18.000> typical<00:05:18.420> Seiko<00:05:18.980> luma<00:05:19.980> brighter

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
it's typical Seiko luma brighter

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.130 
it's typical Seiko luma brighter
application<00:05:21.000> there<00:05:21.210> nice<00:05:21.510> and<00:05:21.720> bright<00:05:21.870> and

extend<00:05:39.690> over<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:39.930> sides<00:05:40.200> I<00:05:40.440> do<00:05:40.500> think<00:05:40.770> the

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
extend over the sides I do think the

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.440 
extend over the sides I do think the
strap<00:05:41.160> is<00:05:41.370> a<00:05:41.400> bit<00:05:41.550> too<00:05:41.700> long<00:05:41.880> but<00:05:42.240> then<00:05:42.360> again

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
strap is a bit too long but then again

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.870 
strap is a bit too long but then again
it's<00:05:42.690> designed<00:05:42.810> for<00:05:43.050> diving<00:05:43.370> so<00:05:44.370> I<00:05:44.400> would<00:05:44.730> wear

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
it's designed for diving so I would wear

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.820 
it's designed for diving so I would wear

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750

winding<00:06:04.020> that<00:06:04.680> I<00:06:04.710> believe<00:06:05.070> to<00:06:05.100> be<00:06:05.280> a<00:06:05.310> bit<00:06:05.490> more

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
winding that I believe to be a bit more

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.440 
winding that I believe to be a bit more
accurate<00:06:06.060> than<00:06:06.180> the<00:06:06.360> 7s<00:06:06.840> 26<00:06:07.440> versions<00:06:07.919> and<00:06:08.450> on

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
accurate than the 7s 26 versions and on

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.850 
accurate than the 7s 26 versions and on
top<00:06:09.720> of<00:06:09.750> that<00:06:09.990> you<00:06:10.229> can<00:06:10.380> choose<00:06:10.590> from<00:06:10.680> a<00:06:10.830> few

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
top of that you can choose from a few

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.920 
top of that you can choose from a few
new<00:06:11.190> styles<00:06:11.700> and<00:06:11.910> like<00:06:12.240> three<00:06:12.570> one<00:06:12.690> three<00:06:12.840> or

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
new styles and like three one three or

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.010 
new styles and like three one three or
rather<00:06:13.200> like<00:06:13.440> the<00:06:13.650> red<00:06:13.860> accents<00:06:14.490> I<00:06:15.020> think

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
rather like the red accents I think

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.990 
rather like the red accents I think
honestly<00:06:16.380> still<00:06:16.710> holds<00:06:17.340> up<00:06:17.430> to<00:06:17.580> the<00:06:17.669> monster

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
honestly still holds up to the monster

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.320 
honestly still holds up to the monster
legacy<00:06:18.419> this<00:06:18.540> is<00:06:18.690> huge<00:06:19.050> value<00:06:19.110> for<00:06:19.680> a<00:06:20.610> simple

look<00:06:23.250> like<00:06:23.460> a<00:06:23.490> much<00:06:23.729> else<00:06:23.940> on<00:06:24.120> the<00:06:24.210> market<00:06:24.360> and

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
look like a much else on the market and

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.010 
look like a much else on the market and
should<00:06:25.890> be<00:06:25.979> a<00:06:26.010> reliable<00:06:26.640> and<00:06:26.870> wearable<00:06:27.870> watch

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020
