00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.360
 In this video I want to demonstrate how you ... 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.200
 ... cleaning counter of a Brother MFP can reset ... 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.080
 ... eg if the multifunctional displays an error 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.480
 First switch on the device ... 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.460
 ... maybe you read an error message or not ... 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.020
 ... then you enter maintenance mode 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.040
 To do this you have to ... 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.620
 press the "Menu" "*" "2" "8" "6" "4" keys 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.520
 Forward 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.340
 "Menu" 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.180
 "*" 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.680
 "2" 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.200
 "8" 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.700
 "6" 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.200
 "4" 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.620
 All four lights are now blinking 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.480
 Now you have to press the "8" "0" keys ... 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.760
 ... and you are in maintenance mode 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.680
 In the maintenance mode you can ... 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.780
 ... show or change settings 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.360
 You can navigate with the arrow keys ... 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.160
 ... until you find the menu item 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.920
 "Purge" shows the number of cleanings ... 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.200
 ... of the printhead 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.800
 It is best that there is&gt; zero returns &lt;... 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.220
 If you want to reset, you have to 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.060
 enter the numbers "2" "7" "8" "3" 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.560
 "2" 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.060
 "7" 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.560
 "8" 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.060
 "3" 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.360
 Now the cleaning counter is already at zero 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.220
 In this menu you can make other settings 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.560
 There are other counters ... 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.580
 ... eg the number of paper jams 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.120
 You can also reset this counter with ... 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.600
 "2" "7" "8" "3" 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.080
 Counter is now at zero 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.700
 To leave the maintenance mode ... 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:32.740
 ... press "STOP" and "9" and "9" 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.160
 "Stop" 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.160
 "9" "9" 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.180
 The printer is now back in normal mode 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.820
 Now you are done
