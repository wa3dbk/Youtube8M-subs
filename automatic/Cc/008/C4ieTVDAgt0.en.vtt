which<00:01:30.369> makes<00:01:30.729> it<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.479> little<00:01:31.990> bit<00:01:32.170> strange<00:01:33.900> but

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
which makes it a little bit strange but

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.210 
which makes it a little bit strange but
I'm<00:01:35.770> adapting<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:38.110> far<00:01:38.350> I've<00:01:38.470> only<00:01:38.590> drove<00:01:38.979> on

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
I'm adapting so far I've only drove on

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.080 
I'm adapting so far I've only drove on
the<00:01:39.310> wrong<00:01:39.490> side<00:01:39.820> of<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.030> road<00:01:40.210> twice<00:01:42.090> it's

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
the wrong side of the road twice it's

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.520 
the wrong side of the road twice it's
kind<00:01:43.300> of<00:01:43.390> terrifying<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:44.050> realize<00:01:44.320> you're

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
kind of terrifying to realize you're

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.350 
kind of terrifying to realize you're
doing<00:01:44.800> that<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:48.369> know<00:01:48.490> I<00:01:48.520> figured<00:01:49.090> most

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
doing that but you know I figured most

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.590 
doing that but you know I figured most
people<00:01:49.810> will<00:01:50.110> swerve<00:01:50.860> or<00:01:51.070> stop<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:52.509> I'm

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
people will swerve or stop and I'm

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.510 
people will swerve or stop and I'm
really<00:01:52.810> counting<00:01:53.020> on<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.350> if<00:01:55.890> should<00:01:56.890> I<00:01:56.920> make

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
really counting on that if should I make

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.649 
really counting on that if should I make
that<00:01:57.729> mistake<00:01:57.910> again

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.330
