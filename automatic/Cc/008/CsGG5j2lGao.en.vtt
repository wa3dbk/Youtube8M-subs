00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.549
 on ceramic compounds keramik pro 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.590
 now guys make a table to 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.960
 to establish 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.890
 miter saw on which we will 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.390
 sawing beams size doing 80 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.640
 85 height approximately 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.640
 and a meter wide twenty meter thirty 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.920
 jigsaw left at home so straight hands 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:01:00.149
 wait I want it now will do 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.220
 first jar to sip all we have 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.610
 size 3 here is red yellow and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.320
 green with the size i am all for myself 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.640
 wrote now doing the first markup 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.640
 make the first green 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.030
 here we have a beginning 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.380
 this we throw this part we throw out 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.180
 because it will burst and then 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:41.040
 we are coming here thats you the right angle 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:47.800
 according to aki drawing house three forty one 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:51.620
 millimeter then do risk 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.320
 this is the angle at which to which 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.750
 there is a connector of thousands from us to collect 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.750
 first do the drink down guys hold on 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.120
 check on the eye 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:43.750
 fix it our corner then we donâ€™t 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:47.590
 on the green beam the corners are the same 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:53.079
 forty one millimeter from the brink 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:03:00.690
 according to figure 41 so the total length is 400 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:03:03.690
 at the door 2688 millimeters we shift 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.690
 a couple 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.210
 2688 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:58.390
 1 green ready one corner 1 now 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:05.519
 let's do the second beam she goes with us 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.519
 we change the yellow corner and gash 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.690
 so that 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:47.849
 it is 2 meters 30 centimeters long 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:47.849
 2 mm 2 no no no 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:09.090
 lived so yellow so 1 1 and 3 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:24.990
 turn over then two meters 30 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.990
 centimeters 2 millimeters 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.960
 work is identical we get 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:09.169
 the green beam will find the same full 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.840
 yellow and red has its corners 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:14.440
 that is, choose the beam and immediately 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.440
 file down 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:35.780
 in 40 minutes we made 30 beams did 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.340
 15 yellow 15 northern most convenient 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:42.440
 such is done by Peter one sits on 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:45.180
 Saw 2 hold and the whole jar and 2 brings 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.319
 then call speed is the speed 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.030
 our all from teamwork of course 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:55.159
