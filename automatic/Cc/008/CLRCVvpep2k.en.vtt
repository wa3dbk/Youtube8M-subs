right now I'm working

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.660 
right now I'm working
on<00:02:44.930> finding<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.590> way<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.770> record<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.489> screen

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
on finding a way to record the screen

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.770 
on finding a way to record the screen
along<00:02:47.450> with<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.989> frames<00:02:48.560> per<00:02:48.770> second<00:02:49.250> um<00:02:49.780> on

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
along with the frames per second um on

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.210 
along with the frames per second um on
steamos<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:53.180> i<00:02:54.080> heard<00:02:54.830> that<00:02:55.069> they're

steamos and i heard that they're

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.339 
steamos and i heard that they're
supposed<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.730> be<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:55.910> couple<00:02:56.780> record<00:02:57.170> my<00:02:57.290> screen

OS<00:03:03.380> is<00:03:03.800> based<00:03:04.099> on<00:03:04.310> so<00:03:05.300> as<00:03:05.690> soon<00:03:05.959> as<00:03:06.019> I<00:03:06.380> figure

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
OS is based on so as soon as I figure

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.750 
OS is based on so as soon as I figure
out<00:03:06.950> how<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.750> get<00:03:08.750> those<00:03:08.989> installed<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:10.069> and

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
out how to get those installed and and

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.740 
out how to get those installed and and
recording<00:03:11.569> you<00:03:11.959> know<00:03:12.550> so<00:03:13.550> flawlessly<00:03:14.150> I'll<00:03:14.480> go

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
recording you know so flawlessly I'll go

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.500 
recording you know so flawlessly I'll go
ahead<00:03:15.190> get<00:03:16.190> those<00:03:17.110> benchmark<00:03:18.110> videos<00:03:18.500> put<00:03:18.980> up

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
ahead get those benchmark videos put up

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.640 
ahead get those benchmark videos put up
but<00:03:20.510> right<00:03:20.720> now<00:03:20.900> I'm<00:03:21.049> just<00:03:21.110> going<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.440> go<00:03:21.560> ahead

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
but right now I'm just going to go ahead

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.610 
but right now I'm just going to go ahead
load<00:03:22.069> up<00:03:22.370> metro<00:03:23.269> last<00:03:23.450> light<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.410> widget

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
load up metro last light and the widget

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.840 
load up metro last light and the widget
too<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.670> I'm<00:03:26.630> gonna<00:03:26.780> play<00:03:27.019> both<00:03:27.350> games<00:03:27.850> very

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
too and I'm gonna play both games very

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.160 
too and I'm gonna play both games very
horribly<00:03:29.510> with<00:03:29.810> one<00:03:30.170> hand<00:03:30.590> so<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:32.450> guys<00:03:32.959> can

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
horribly with one hand so you guys can

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
horribly with one hand so you guys can
just<00:03:33.349> see<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.650> running<00:03:34.340> around<00:03:35.500> one<00:03:36.500> thing<00:03:36.799> and

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
just see it running around one thing and

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.059 
just see it running around one thing and
I've<00:03:37.340> seen<00:03:37.580> this<00:03:37.730> in<00:03:37.910> other<00:03:38.650> videos<00:03:39.650> about

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
I've seen this in other videos about

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.430 
I've seen this in other videos about
steam<00:03:40.340> OS<00:03:40.569> it's<00:03:41.569> really<00:03:41.840> not<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.049> big<00:03:42.260> surprise

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
steam OS it's really not a big surprise

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.289 
steam OS it's really not a big surprise
to<00:03:42.739> me<00:03:43.069> but<00:03:43.310> some<00:03:43.670> of<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:43.849> guys<00:03:43.970> probably

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
to me but some of you guys probably

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.780 
to me but some of you guys probably
didn't<00:03:44.840> see<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:45.380> before<00:03:45.500> but<00:03:46.400> if<00:03:46.519> we<00:03:46.640> go<00:03:46.760> down

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
didn't see it before but if we go down

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.440 
didn't see it before but if we go down

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
most of you know all of the sentence

00:03:58.519 --> 00:03:59.830 
most of you know all of the sentence
that<00:03:58.609> you<00:03:58.760> would<00:03:58.910> typically<00:03:59.239> see<00:03:59.570> in<00:03:59.600> the

videos<00:04:00.200> options<00:04:00.769> section<00:04:01.239> are<00:04:02.239> not<00:04:02.600> there

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989

under<00:04:03.709> linux<00:04:04.220> um<00:04:05.120> I<00:04:05.709> do<00:04:06.709> um<00:04:07.870> notice<00:04:08.870> a<00:04:09.220> little

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
under linux um I do um notice a little

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.590 
under linux um I do um notice a little
bit<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.459> a<00:04:10.730> performance<00:04:11.180> boost<00:04:12.910> running<00:04:13.910> these

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
bit of a performance boost running these

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.940 
bit of a performance boost running these
two<00:04:14.900> games<00:04:15.549> with<00:04:16.549> steamos<00:04:17.060> and<00:04:18.019> I<00:04:18.350> think

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
two games with steamos and I think

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.390 
two games with steamos and I think
that's<00:04:19.669> mainly<00:04:20.060> because<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.680> lot<00:04:21.680> of<00:04:21.709> the<00:04:21.919> DX

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
that's mainly because a lot of the DX

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.600 
that's mainly because a lot of the DX
features<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:23.630> some<00:04:24.440> of<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.650> physics<00:04:25.280> stuff

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
features and some of the physics stuff

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.409

by default or linux are either disabled

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.279 
by default or linux are either disabled
or<00:04:29.539> turn<00:04:29.780> down<00:04:30.050> real<00:04:30.410> low<00:04:31.600> so<00:04:32.600> that<00:04:32.630> you<00:04:33.110> know

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
or turn down real low so that you know

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.810 
or turn down real low so that you know
it<00:04:33.590> would<00:04:33.860> perform<00:04:34.340> faster<00:04:36.160> but<00:04:37.160> uh<00:04:37.190> like<00:04:37.669> I

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
it would perform faster but uh like I

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.390 
it would perform faster but uh like I
said<00:04:37.850> that<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.810> know<00:04:38.960> as<00:04:39.169> I<00:04:39.350> learn<00:04:39.620> more<00:04:40.039> I'll

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
said that you know as I learn more I'll

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.900 
said that you know as I learn more I'll
loan<00:04:40.880> you<00:04:41.180> know<00:04:41.960> make<00:04:42.200> more<00:04:42.440> videos<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:43.220> and

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
loan you know make more videos and and

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.629 
loan you know make more videos and and
get<00:04:44.150> those<00:04:44.360> bad<00:04:44.720> boys<00:04:44.750> out<00:04:45.289> to<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:46.010> guys<00:04:46.039> but

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
get those bad boys out to you guys but

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.860 
get those bad boys out to you guys but
as<00:04:46.850> it<00:04:47.270> stands<00:04:47.600> right<00:04:47.750> now<00:04:49.330> you<00:04:50.330> know<00:04:50.479> this

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
as it stands right now you know this

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.640 
as it stands right now you know this
it's<00:04:51.320> it<00:04:51.860> looks<00:04:52.070> pretty<00:04:52.460> good<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:54.140> library<00:04:54.590> of

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
it's it looks pretty good the library of

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.490 
it's it looks pretty good the library of
games<00:04:54.890> that<00:04:55.460> are<00:04:56.240> compatible<00:04:56.599> with<00:04:56.900> steamos

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
games that are compatible with steamos

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.420 
games that are compatible with steamos
those<00:04:57.950> are

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
those are

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.510 
those are
constantly<00:04:58.880> getting<00:04:59.090> bigger<00:04:59.950> but<00:05:00.950> I<00:05:01.160> think

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
constantly getting bigger but I think

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.760 
constantly getting bigger but I think
they<00:05:01.670> have<00:05:01.790> a<00:05:01.820> really<00:05:02.540> really<00:05:02.750> long<00:05:03.110> way<00:05:03.440> to<00:05:03.500> go

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
they have a really really long way to go

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.830 
they have a really really long way to go
in<00:05:04.100> terms<00:05:04.250> of<00:05:04.820> getting<00:05:05.060> everybody<00:05:05.570> that

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
in terms of getting everybody that

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.080 
in terms of getting everybody that
completely<00:05:06.350> just<00:05:06.680> dumped<00:05:07.010> windows<00:05:07.520> and<00:05:07.910> and

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
completely just dumped windows and and
