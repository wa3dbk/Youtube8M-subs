00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
hey guys def con door and vape 666 here

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.769 
hey guys def con door and vape 666 here
we're<00:00:04.170> just<00:00:04.259> going<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.529> try<00:00:05.370> out<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.879> little

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
we're just going to try out a little

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.560 
we're just going to try out a little
test<00:00:07.170> explosion<00:00:07.880> we've<00:00:08.880> backed<00:00:09.090> up<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.389> world

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
test explosion we've backed up the world

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.540 
test explosion we've backed up the world
and<00:00:09.870> we<00:00:10.530> want<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.769> start<00:00:10.950> blaming<00:00:11.130> nuclear

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
and we want to start blaming nuclear

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.279 
and we want to start blaming nuclear
reactors<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.480> want<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.259> see<00:00:13.519> what<00:00:14.519> damage

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
reactors so I want to see what damage

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.960 
reactors so I want to see what damage
our<00:00:16.289> nuclear<00:00:16.770> reactor<00:00:17.100> will<00:00:17.190> do<00:00:17.310> if<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.760> blows

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
our nuclear reactor will do if it blows

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.990 
our nuclear reactor will do if it blows
up<00:00:18.210> which<00:00:18.390> hopefully<00:00:18.810> shouldn't<00:00:19.910> so<00:00:20.910> what

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
up which hopefully shouldn't so what

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.009 
up which hopefully shouldn't so what
I've<00:00:21.090> done<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.240> I've<00:00:21.420> set<00:00:21.630> up<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:22.580> redstone<00:00:23.580> line

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
I've done is I've set up a redstone line

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.920 
I've done is I've set up a redstone line
from<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.350> switch<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.539> that<00:00:27.539> goes<00:00:27.720> all<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
from the switch and that goes all the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.200 
from the switch and that goes all the
way<00:00:28.439> over<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.340> mountain<00:00:29.490> which<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.060> our

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
way over to this mountain which is our

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.520 
way over to this mountain which is our
nuclear<00:00:30.630> mountain<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:32.180> hopefully<00:00:33.530> what

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
nuclear mountain and hopefully what

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.470 
nuclear mountain and hopefully what
we've<00:00:34.710> got<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> setup<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.820> we're<00:00:36.000> aiming

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
we've got is the setup that we're aiming

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.139 
we've got is the setup that we're aiming
for<00:00:36.690> which<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.170> three<00:00:37.800> reactors<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:41.149> we're

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
for which is three reactors and we're

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.160 
for which is three reactors and we're
only<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.540> run<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.710> begin<00:00:43.980> with<00:00:44.160> on

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
only going to run it to begin with on

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.529 
only going to run it to begin with on
four<00:00:46.280> quadri<00:00:47.280> rhenium<00:00:47.640> which<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.239> what

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
four quadri rhenium which is what

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.630 
four quadri rhenium which is what
direwolf<00:00:49.289> seems<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.649> have<00:00:49.770> running<00:00:50.039> fairly

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
direwolf seems to have running fairly

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.790 
direwolf seems to have running fairly
stable<00:00:51.079> so<00:00:52.079> what<00:00:52.230> I've<00:00:52.289> done<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.440> I've<00:00:52.530> loaded

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
stable so what I've done is I've loaded

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.930 
stable so what I've done is I've loaded
up<00:00:53.070> three<00:00:53.550> nuclear<00:00:53.910> reactors<00:00:54.980> with<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:58.760> 16<00:00:59.760> of

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
up three nuclear reactors with a 16 of

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.610 
up three nuclear reactors with a 16 of
these<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.600> four<00:01:00.960> times<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.379> amount

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
these so this is four times the amount

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.020 
these so this is four times the amount
that<00:01:01.920> will<00:01:02.100> actually<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.699> them<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that will actually be in them and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.060 
that will actually be in them and
there's<00:01:03.629> no<00:01:03.780> cooling<00:01:04.229> plates<00:01:06.409> so<00:01:07.409> hopefully

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
there's no cooling plates so hopefully

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.020 
there's no cooling plates so hopefully
they'll<00:01:08.220> go<00:01:08.310> critical<00:01:08.700> within<00:01:09.330> seconds<00:01:11.030> let's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
they'll go critical within seconds let's

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.460 
they'll go critical within seconds let's
go<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.390> what<00:01:12.659> happens<00:01:12.990> when<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.260> set<00:01:13.439> it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
go and see what happens when we set it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.010 
go and see what happens when we set it
off<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:14.040> want<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.000> see<00:01:15.150> how<00:01:15.420> big<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> crater

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
off I want to see how big the crater

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.649 
off I want to see how big the crater
I'll<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.380> see<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.920> actually<00:01:17.330> destroys<00:01:18.330> any

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
I'll be see if it actually destroys any

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.690 
I'll be see if it actually destroys any
of<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.049> important<00:01:19.920> stuff<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> quarry

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
of the important stuff like the quarry

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.390 
of the important stuff like the quarry
over<00:01:21.030> there<00:01:21.210> or<00:01:21.420> our<00:01:21.600> base<00:01:21.780> here<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.860> let's<00:01:23.220> see

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
over there or our base here so let's see

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.789 
over there or our base here so let's see
if<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.640> destroys<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.720> entire<00:01:24.750> server<00:01:25.380> or

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
if this destroys the entire server or

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.670 
if this destroys the entire server or
just<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.850> big<00:01:27.119> hole<00:01:27.330> there<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.049> go<00:01:28.200> three<00:01:28.530> two

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
just a big hole there we go three two

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.950 
just a big hole there we go three two
one<00:01:31.700> signals<00:01:32.700> on

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:45.840 

see<00:01:37.770> what<00:01:37.920> happens

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.650 

looks<00:01:46.850> like<00:01:47.000> we're<00:01:47.120> having<00:01:47.210> a<00:01:47.390> bit<00:01:47.510> of<00:01:47.540> a

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
looks like we're having a bit of a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.450 
looks like we're having a bit of a
meltdown<00:01:47.840> here<00:01:48.350> we<00:01:48.470> go

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.160 

all<00:01:55.970> right<00:01:56.180> let's<00:01:56.450> see<00:01:56.659> what<00:01:56.690> sort<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.110> damage

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
all right let's see what sort of damage

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.660 
all right let's see what sort of damage
has<00:01:57.650> occurred

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.730 

mostest<00:02:04.509> mind<00:02:04.780> system<00:02:05.140> was<00:02:05.320> already<00:02:05.590> here

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
mostest mind system was already here

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.020 
mostest mind system was already here
before<00:02:06.100> we<00:02:06.189> started<00:02:06.610> by<00:02:06.759> the<00:02:06.820> way<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:07.530> really

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
before we started by the way so really

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.280 
before we started by the way so really
it<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.270> quite<00:02:11.160> devastating<00:02:12.660> but<00:02:13.660> just<00:02:13.930> sort<00:02:14.170> of

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
it is quite devastating but just sort of

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.510 
it is quite devastating but just sort of
took<00:02:14.590> out<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:15.010> area<00:02:15.459> here<00:02:16.770> so<00:02:17.770> nothing

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
took out this area here so nothing

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.930 
took out this area here so nothing
crucial<00:02:18.910> is<00:02:19.209> actually<00:02:19.480> been<00:02:19.630> damaged<00:02:20.050> our

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
crucial is actually been damaged our

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.500 
crucial is actually been damaged our
quarry<00:02:21.940> systems<00:02:23.489> slime<00:02:24.489> farms<00:02:25.030> all<00:02:25.209> still

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
quarry systems slime farms all still

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.270 
quarry systems slime farms all still
look<00:02:25.690> intact<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:31.030> yeah<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:31.510> looks<00:02:31.660> like

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
look intact so yeah that looks like

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.130 
look intact so yeah that looks like
that<00:02:33.280> looks<00:02:33.430> like<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.760> safe<00:02:34.000> distance<00:02:34.239> that

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
that looks like a safe distance that

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.930 
that looks like a safe distance that
test<00:02:35.470> over<00:02:35.739> let's<00:02:35.920> hope<00:02:36.069> we<00:02:36.190> can<00:02:36.340> reset<00:02:36.910> the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
test over let's hope we can reset the

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.900 
test over let's hope we can reset the
world<00:02:37.150> now<00:02:37.300> cheers<00:02:37.780> guys
