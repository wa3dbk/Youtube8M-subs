same<00:01:25.170> thing<00:01:25.350> over<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:25.590> 1d<00:01:26.250> 2d<00:01:26.970> 3d<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.530> creates

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
same thing over here 1d 2d 3d it creates

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.530 
same thing over here 1d 2d 3d it creates
kind<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.250> little<00:01:29.520> stairway<00:01:29.759> now<00:01:30.390> what's

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
kind of a little stairway now what's

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.760 
kind of a little stairway now what's
gonna<00:01:30.630> need<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.140> grab<00:01:31.290> your<00:01:31.530> redstone

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
gonna need to do is grab your redstone

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.590 
gonna need to do is grab your redstone
and<00:01:31.890> later<00:01:32.280> redstone<00:01:32.759> down<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.150> stairway

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
and later redstone down that stairway

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.289 
and later redstone down that stairway
and<00:01:33.659> go<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.409> other<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.710> um<00:01:35.340> it's

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
and go do it on the other one um it's

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.210 
and go do it on the other one um it's
fairly<00:01:36.540> simple<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.049> hide<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.530> gonna<00:01:37.860> go<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
fairly simple to hide this gonna go and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.280 
fairly simple to hide this gonna go and
dig<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> hole<00:01:38.549> 22<00:01:39.329> height<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.049> walk<00:01:40.259> in

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
dig a hole 22 height so you can walk in

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.920 
dig a hole 22 height so you can walk in
it<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.710> attach<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.579> redstone<00:01:41.880> now<00:01:42.450> somewhere

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
it and attach a redstone now somewhere

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.929 
it and attach a redstone now somewhere
in<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.409> um<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.250> need<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.490> put<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> redstone

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
in here um you need to put a redstone

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.210 
in here um you need to put a redstone
repeater<00:01:45.479> because<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> little<00:01:47.040> bit

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
repeater because this is a little bit

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.760 
repeater because this is a little bit
more<00:01:47.340> redstone<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.290> without<00:01:49.290> hiding<00:01:49.560> it

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
more redstone in the without hiding it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.499 
more redstone in the without hiding it
because<00:01:49.979> you've<00:01:50.729> got<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.030> make<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> longer

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
because you've got to make a longer

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.020 
because you've got to make a longer
distance<00:01:51.659> links<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.979> things<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.399> so

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
distance links and things like that so

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.730 
distance links and things like that so
anyways<00:01:54.360> now<00:01:54.869> what<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.110> guys<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.439> do<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.649> you

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
anyways now what you guys can do is you

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.050 
anyways now what you guys can do is you
can<00:01:55.770> actually<00:01:55.890> cover<00:01:56.310> up<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.579> third<00:01:56.880> hole

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
can actually cover up this third hole

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.730 
can actually cover up this third hole
with<00:01:57.240> dirt<00:01:57.479> or<00:01:57.659> whatever<00:01:57.899> grass<00:01:58.290> whatever

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
with dirt or whatever grass whatever

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.249 
with dirt or whatever grass whatever
your<00:01:59.100> option<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.700> building<00:02:00.030> block<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.450> then

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
your option of a building block and then

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.510 
your option of a building block and then
whatever<00:02:01.469> your<00:02:01.710> other<00:02:01.829> building<00:02:02.159> block<00:02:02.340> is

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
whatever your other building block is

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.469 
whatever your other building block is
that<00:02:02.729> you're<00:02:02.820> actually<00:02:02.969> building<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
that you're actually building the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.940 
that you're actually building the
structure<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.899> you're<00:02:04.409> going<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.590> do<00:02:04.770> this

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
structure out of you're going to do this

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.039 
structure out of you're going to do this
put<00:02:05.640> one<00:02:05.790> here<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.149> then<00:02:06.390> attach<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.960> and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
put one here and then attach it and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.449 
put one here and then attach it and
cover<00:02:07.229> up<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.439> second<00:02:07.860> hole<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.220> then<00:02:08.280> just

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
cover up that second hole and then just

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.790 
cover up that second hole and then just
undo<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.509> cover<00:02:09.989> up<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.229> second<00:02:10.649> hole

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
undo it so cover up that second hole

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.290 
undo it so cover up that second hole
like<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.039> that's<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.610> easiest<00:02:11.849> way<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.120> do

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
like that that's the easiest way to do

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.050 
like that that's the easiest way to do
that

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
that

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.949 
that
and<00:02:13.150> now<00:02:13.330> you're<00:02:13.450> just<00:02:13.569> going<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.780> kind<00:02:13.930> of

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
and now you're just going to kind of

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.440 
and now you're just going to kind of
jump<00:02:14.230> up<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.680> make<00:02:15.489> these<00:02:15.760> attached<00:02:16.180> like

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
jump up and make these attached like

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.620 
jump up and make these attached like
this<00:02:16.840> as<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:18.010> can<00:02:18.250> see<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.430> stuck<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.090> block<00:02:19.480> on

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
this as you can see I stuck a block on

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.930 
this as you can see I stuck a block on
the<00:02:19.780> sticky<00:02:20.140> piston<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.739> then<00:02:21.400> oops<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.880> then

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
the sticky piston and then oops and then

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.320 
the sticky piston and then oops and then
kind<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:22.720> went<00:02:23.020> out<00:02:23.110> three<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.880> made<00:02:25.120> this

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
kind of went out three and it made this

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.500 
kind of went out three and it made this
l-shape<00:02:26.250> if<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.430> guys<00:02:27.550> can<00:02:27.760> see<00:02:27.880> that<00:02:28.030> l<00:02:28.239> like

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
l-shape if you guys can see that l like

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.300 
l-shape if you guys can see that l like
that<00:02:28.780> we're<00:02:29.110> half<00:02:29.349> you<00:02:29.680> or<00:02:29.830> whatever<00:02:30.099> you<00:02:30.220> guys

that we're half you or whatever you guys
want<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.610> call<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:31.120> your<00:02:31.239> call<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.660> now

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
want to call it to your call and now

want to call it to your call and now
this<00:02:33.459> is<00:02:33.610> pretty<00:02:33.819> simple<00:02:34.060> you're<00:02:34.480> just<00:02:34.599> gonna

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
this is pretty simple you're just gonna

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.600 
this is pretty simple you're just gonna
aim<00:02:34.959> at<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.170> bookshelves<00:02:35.620> as<00:02:36.160> it's<00:02:36.459> not

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
aim at the bookshelves as it's not

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.080 
aim at the bookshelves as it's not
operated<00:02:37.209> on<00:02:37.269> in<00:02:37.510> stacks<00:02:38.260> three<00:02:38.730> as<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.970> can

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
operated on in stacks three as you can

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.759 
operated on in stacks three as you can
see<00:02:40.269> now<00:02:40.420> we've<00:02:40.630> already<00:02:40.870> got<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.200> red<00:02:41.560> stone

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
see now we've already got the red stone

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.290 
see now we've already got the red stone
hidden<00:02:41.980> inside<00:02:42.310> it's<00:02:42.760> still<00:02:42.970> not<00:02:43.090> hidden

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
hidden inside it's still not hidden

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.539 
hidden inside it's still not hidden
outside<00:02:43.540> yet<00:02:43.989> but<00:02:44.560> uh<00:02:44.590> there's<00:02:45.250> just<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.519> few

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
outside yet but uh there's just a few

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.220 
outside yet but uh there's just a few
minor<00:02:45.850> adjustments<00:02:46.000> it's<00:02:46.569> not<00:02:46.750> hard<00:02:47.019> at<00:02:47.140> all

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
minor adjustments it's not hard at all

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.110 
minor adjustments it's not hard at all

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
don't do that and what I do is I just go

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.449 
don't do that and what I do is I just go
for<00:03:52.359> high<00:03:52.780> like<00:03:53.049> this<00:03:53.319> and<00:03:53.590> kind<00:03:53.980> of<00:03:54.100> just<00:03:54.250> all

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
for high like this and kind of just all

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.309 
for high like this and kind of just all
the<00:03:54.579> way<00:03:54.670> around<00:03:54.819> it's<00:03:55.569> just<00:03:55.810> basically<00:03:56.139> going

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
the way around it's just basically going

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.379 
the way around it's just basically going
to<00:03:56.380> be<00:03:56.440> like<00:03:56.709> a<00:03:56.739> stone<00:03:57.130> wall<00:03:57.489> around<00:03:57.700> here<00:03:58.090> no

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
to be like a stone wall around here no

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.360 
to be like a stone wall around here no
one's<00:03:58.569> even<00:03:58.690> going<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:58.959> really<00:03:59.319> notice<00:03:59.620> it's

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
one's even going to really notice it's

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.729 
one's even going to really notice it's
not<00:04:00.579> that<00:04:00.639> easy<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.329> notice<00:04:01.510> it's<00:04:01.840> not<00:04:01.959> it

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
not that easy to notice it's not it

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.819 
not that easy to notice it's not it
looks<00:04:02.950> fairly<00:04:03.400> normal<00:04:04.359> you<00:04:05.200> could<00:04:05.350> say<00:04:05.590> and

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
looks fairly normal you could say and

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.670 
looks fairly normal you could say and
that's<00:04:06.400> why<00:04:06.579> I<00:04:06.609> chose<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.359> do<00:04:07.510> it<00:04:07.540> this<00:04:07.870> way<00:04:08.139> you

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
that's why I chose to do it this way you

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.620 
that's why I chose to do it this way you
can<00:04:08.859> do<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:09.100> lot<00:04:09.400> more<00:04:09.459> underground<00:04:09.940> stuff<00:04:10.450> but

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
can do a lot more underground stuff but

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.120 
can do a lot more underground stuff but
it's<00:04:10.750> kind<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:10.959> hard<00:04:11.139> to<00:04:11.170> hide<00:04:11.350> this<00:04:11.560> out<00:04:11.799> here

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
it's kind of hard to hide this out here

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.400 
it's kind of hard to hide this out here
so<00:04:12.850> that's<00:04:13.359> like<00:04:13.569> the<00:04:13.690> biggest<00:04:13.810> problem<00:04:14.109> I've

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
so that's like the biggest problem I've

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.129 
so that's like the biggest problem I've
only<00:04:14.680> had<00:04:14.980> with<00:04:15.250> this<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.940> this<00:04:16.660> is<00:04:16.840> like<00:04:16.989> one

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
only had with this and this is like one

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.870 
only had with this and this is like one
of<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.289> solutions<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.859> came<00:04:18.039> up<00:04:18.190> with<00:04:18.220> I'll

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
of the solutions I came up with I'll

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.860 
of the solutions I came up with I'll
show<00:04:19.090> you<00:04:19.150> guys<00:04:19.269> a<00:04:19.329> few<00:04:19.570> different<00:04:19.660> things

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
show you guys a few different things

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.080 
show you guys a few different things
I've<00:04:20.200> done<00:04:20.229> with<00:04:20.889> this<00:04:21.070> design<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.820> can<00:04:21.970> do<00:04:22.060> a

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
I've done with this design you can do a

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.279 
I've done with this design you can do a
few<00:04:22.330> different<00:04:22.419> things<00:04:22.599> it<00:04:22.840> doesn't<00:04:23.020> just

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
few different things it doesn't just

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.230 
few different things it doesn't just
have<00:04:23.409> to<00:04:23.440> be<00:04:23.590> a<00:04:23.710> boring<00:04:24.070> wall<00:04:24.520> like<00:04:25.120> I'm

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
have to be a boring wall like I'm

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.140 
have to be a boring wall like I'm
showing<00:04:25.599> here

on<00:04:58.940> this<00:04:59.330> structure<00:04:59.750> now<00:05:00.289> I've<00:05:00.410> actually

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
on this structure now I've actually

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.129 
on this structure now I've actually
experimented<00:05:01.250> with<00:05:01.910> this<00:05:02.180> method<00:05:02.449> and<00:05:02.840> I've

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
experimented with this method and I've

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.540 
experimented with this method and I've
came<00:05:03.320> up<00:05:03.440> with<00:05:03.560> all<00:05:03.710> these<00:05:03.830> structures<00:05:04.310> in<00:05:04.490> the

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
came up with all these structures in the

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.840 
came up with all these structures in the
past<00:05:04.789> hour<00:05:05.060> or<00:05:05.330> two<00:05:05.479> and<00:05:06.130> here's<00:05:07.130> one<00:05:07.430> and<00:05:07.669> it's

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
past hour or two and here's one and it's

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.250 
past hour or two and here's one and it's
kind<00:05:08.030> of<00:05:08.060> like<00:05:08.180> an<00:05:08.330> upstairs<00:05:08.600> deal<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:09.020> still

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
kind of like an upstairs deal it still

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.230 
kind of like an upstairs deal it still
works<00:05:09.470> obviously<00:05:10.010> it's<00:05:10.520> kind<00:05:10.789> of<00:05:10.820> a<00:05:10.940> different

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
works obviously it's kind of a different

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.200 
works obviously it's kind of a different
deal<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:11.840> can<00:05:11.990> do<00:05:12.470> this<00:05:12.680> kind<00:05:12.949> of<00:05:13.010> design<00:05:13.210> it's

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
deal you can do this kind of design it's

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.090 
deal you can do this kind of design it's
a<00:05:14.360> little<00:05:14.570> bit<00:05:14.690> more<00:05:14.840> width<00:05:15.139> but<00:05:15.650> not<00:05:15.889> as<00:05:16.010> much

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
a little bit more width but not as much

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.029 
a little bit more width but not as much
linked<00:05:16.580> and<00:05:17.380> yeah<00:05:18.380> I<00:05:18.590> mean<00:05:18.800> there's<00:05:18.979> just

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
linked and yeah I mean there's just

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:20.469 
linked and yeah I mean there's just
different<00:05:19.280> structure<00:05:19.760> changes<00:05:20.180> here<00:05:20.389> and

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
different structure changes here and

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.320 
different structure changes here and
they<00:05:21.080> all<00:05:21.199> work<00:05:21.380> great<00:05:21.620> but<00:05:21.979> I<00:05:22.400> think<00:05:22.970> this<00:05:23.120> one

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.020 
they all work great but I think this one
looks<00:05:23.660> pretty<00:05:23.810> simple<00:05:24.349> looks<00:05:24.680> nice<00:05:25.130> neat<00:05:25.729> and

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030
