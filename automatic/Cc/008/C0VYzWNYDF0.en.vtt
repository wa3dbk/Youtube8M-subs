the<00:04:01.269> fight<00:04:01.509> is<00:04:01.750> over<00:04:01.989> on<00:04:02.349> the<00:04:03.129> beta<00:04:03.340> when<00:04:03.790> we

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
the fight is over on the beta when we

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.059 
the fight is over on the beta when we
killed<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.449> first<00:04:04.719> mode<00:04:04.989> of<00:04:05.169> Texas<00:04:05.620> all<00:04:05.799> the

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
killed the first mode of Texas all the

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.949 
killed the first mode of Texas all the
other<00:04:06.250> ones<00:04:06.519> despawn<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.449> the<00:04:07.540> fight<00:04:07.719> was

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
other ones despawn and the fight was

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.559 
other ones despawn and the fight was
over<00:04:07.989> but<00:04:08.530> this<00:04:08.709> is<00:04:08.859> probably<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:09.280> bug<00:04:09.579> like<00:04:10.419> the

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
over but this is probably a bug like the

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.479 
over but this is probably a bug like the
shards<00:04:10.810> of<00:04:10.900> Texas<00:04:11.289> the<00:04:11.590> modes<00:04:11.799> also<00:04:12.039> cast

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
shards of Texas the modes also cast

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.580 
shards of Texas the modes also cast
crystalline<00:04:13.090> barrage<00:04:13.389> fracture<00:04:14.169> and<00:04:14.319> earth

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
and pillar that's everything there is

about<00:04:16.359> this<00:04:16.780> fight<00:04:17.159> positioning<00:04:18.159> will

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
about this fight positioning will

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.009 
about this fight positioning will
probably<00:04:18.729> be<00:04:18.940> one<00:04:19.090> of<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.329> most<00:04:19.509> important

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
probably be one of the most important

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.290 
probably be one of the most important

out of space and you will also have

out of space and you will also have
problems<00:04:35.780> healing<00:04:36.170> players<00:04:36.440> as<00:04:36.740> you<00:04:37.190> can<00:04:37.340> tell
