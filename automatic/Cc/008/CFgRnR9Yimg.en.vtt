00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:13.840
 Well It was unexpected to say I touch giant robot Date at that timing 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:16.360
 I was thinking of making it by myself someday, but there is an opportunity to get in touch with the things so far 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.900
 I 'm really happy that I got it now 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.900
 Hmmm 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:31.820
 And the software itself called Bushido according to it and put the shape of one of the information of the robot 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:36.390
 Simulator that moves in real time along with the robot that draw the maximum force 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:40.090
 Funnel to match it if you do not move at will'll also fixes those of simulator 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:45.770
 Anymore a grant such Toko When the multitude is not accumulated in other words once failed 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:49.100
 There is no problem and I always move while answering, but I do that way 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:54.320
 Everyone said that there was no simulator that was suitable for 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.949
 The work from the place to develop a simulator point of Bushido-only it's too late nano 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.949
 Started 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.830
 After all coolness 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.000
 It c 3 where the robot joints move but glitter is published husband a place to move if there aviation 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.860
 Where it's shining 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.720
 I also think that the robot is deformed and the charcoal is also very cool 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:24.140
 A lot of places wow robot that has been combined in one Atsudo say Toka is an artificial intelligence 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:28.680
 To say joints and selfishness fall in one of the cases, such as having the highest rank among the artifacts 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:33.350
 Tteyuu has become close to the results to human beings by a combination of parts 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.350
 I think it is full of wonder or romance 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:42.730
 Such as the one important is that kind of robot is not enter into the living space 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.770
 I want to create that society 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:52.180
 Have a variety of people make technology that no one can break through 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:56.920
 In a robot that Well put out a lot of company Hey Te 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.500
 For example, software that I have cooperated with is used to create a situation. 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.720
 When you want to use a robot 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:07.370
 Oh yes I have used Bushido so I can use that robot 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.820
 It will be understood if you can use the robot in the same manner as driving by renting a car like this 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.150
 Easy 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.689
 Isn't it possible to say that robots are pervading life 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.200
 Small robots, for example, the windows contained in the personal computer of a large robot 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.920
 like 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.220
 It seems that you can move easily when you enter Bushido 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.420
 And really be nice if the state 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.420
 I'm planning a little
