food<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.280> bread<00:00:41.940> bread<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.629> important<00:00:43.050> for

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
food is bread bread is important for

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.069 
food is bread bread is important for
three<00:00:43.500> important<00:00:44.370> reasons<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.360> first<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
three important reasons the first is the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.049 
three important reasons the first is the
pesticide<00:00:46.649> residues<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.730> wonder<00:00:47.940> why

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
pesticide residues and you wonder why

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.190 
pesticide residues and you wonder why
there<00:00:48.210> would<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.510> many<00:00:48.629> pesticide

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
there would be so many pesticide

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.229 
there would be so many pesticide
residues<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.800> bread<00:00:50.100> here's<00:00:50.520> why<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
residues in bread here's why the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.510 
residues in bread here's why the
pesticides<00:00:51.750> are<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:52.110> only<00:00:52.410> sprayed<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
pesticides are not only sprayed on the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.490 
pesticides are not only sprayed on the
wheat<00:00:53.699> when<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.030> growing<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:54.989> also

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
wheat when it's growing but it's also

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.590 
wheat when it's growing but it's also
sprayed<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.430> grain<00:00:56.670> after<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.480> been

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
sprayed on the grain after it's been

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.330 
sprayed on the grain after it's been
harvested<00:00:57.710> while<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.829> sitting<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.190> in

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
harvested while it's sitting on in

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.340 
harvested while it's sitting on in
storage<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.910> waiting<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.359> be<00:01:00.390> milled<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
storage and waiting to be milled that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.900 
storage and waiting to be milled that
means<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.739> all<00:01:01.920> those<00:01:02.129> pesticides<00:01:02.760> are

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
means that all those pesticides are

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.030 
means that all those pesticides are
still<00:01:03.210> sticking<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.960> wheat<00:01:04.320> when<00:01:04.890> it's

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
still sticking to that wheat when it's

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.100 
still sticking to that wheat when it's
turned<00:01:05.339> into<00:01:05.640> flour<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.330> baked<00:01:06.600> into<00:01:06.840> your

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
turned into flour and baked into your

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.200 
turned into flour and baked into your
bread<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:08.070> second<00:01:08.369> important<00:01:08.729> reason<00:01:08.760> is

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
bread the second important reason is

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.330 
bread the second important reason is
because<00:01:09.689> conventional<00:01:10.049> breads<00:01:10.619> often

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
because conventional breads often

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.130 
because conventional breads often
contain<00:01:11.700> filler<00:01:11.970> ingredients<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.689> sugars

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
contain filler ingredients like sugars

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.750 
contain filler ingredients like sugars
and<00:01:13.350> high<00:01:13.500> fructose<00:01:13.740> corn<00:01:13.920> syrup<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
and high fructose corn syrup and the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.730 
and high fructose corn syrup and the
third<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.509> final<00:01:15.780> reason<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.650> an

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
third and final reason and this is an

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.870 
third and final reason and this is an
important<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.280> also<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.640> very

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
important one and also a very
