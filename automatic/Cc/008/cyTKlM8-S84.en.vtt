00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.450
 I spent the whole day together, you saw a bit of the history of the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.569
 this company the history of the olive tree 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:18.180
 and you have seen the first signs of the process that then came to the oil 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.019
 that is the collection 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.910
 Meanwhile, this is where the olives come again 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.009
 egg defoliator party the city 2 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.230
 after which heaven is called spietramento because there may be 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:29.970
 also 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.690
 who had picked up some stones from the residual earth that ended soon on 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.559
 live and then the washing in running water after which l - once the 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.260
 driving license is not so called breaker to you I now start the real one 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.050
 milling 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.160
 that is, the olives come 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.980
 not synthetically ground 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.620
 after which they pass into the mounds 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.630
 where they will remain for about two hours to amalgamate 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.940
 at this point the olive paste appeared in the decanter 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.840
 the decanter function is to separate the water from the oil and from the 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.640
 room 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.330
 important to say that all these workings of a veneration 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.570
 temperatures below 27 degrees 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.990
 and this is the classic cold working by increasing the temperature yes 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.680
 will get + oil 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.020
 but of poor quality 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.570
 further the oil thus obtained in the water thus obtained must pass 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.510
 in centrifuges, that is, they are further separators 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.740
 s ... briefly the water that is emulsifying together 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.260
 oil with the oil that is in emossione together with the water 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.620
 glory at this point I have finished the process and then it comes out and ends up in the 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.490
 stainless steel containers and it is important to emphasize that 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.800
 all the processing 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.940
 takes place in the stainless steel which is systematically cleaned this for 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.930
 follow dixie disciplinary of the production of the extra virgin and if to the 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.210
 European product standards 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.860
 wine and food 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.510
 after storage we have bottling this is the product 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.430
 finished 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.760
 in my hatred the sileno caves 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.329
 because it is so called because 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.500
 showers the tradition and culture of this land of this 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.870
 company I had of us was a satyr who was worshiped in these parts together 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.290
 to the myth of atina that he gave it that according to mythology men gave the olive tree 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.730
 the typical characteristics of this oil are the typical characteristics 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.430
 d1 to geese can be obtained on this earth if you follow are 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.940
 certain procedures that are those of the specification is an oil 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.379
 with very low acidity level 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.409
 for this it was all his flavors and all his smells and all his 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:45.849
 scents
