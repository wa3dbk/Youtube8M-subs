this<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.000> sim<00:01:36.450> guru<00:01:36.780> granth<00:01:37.079> was<00:01:37.320> quick<00:01:37.560> to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
this but sim guru granth was quick to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.859 
this but sim guru granth was quick to
confirm<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.400> possible<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.450> make<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
confirm that it is possible to make the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.240 
confirm that it is possible to make the
neighborhood's<00:01:40.290> bigger<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> future

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
neighborhood's bigger in the future

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.039 
neighborhood's bigger in the future
stating<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.820> possible<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.240> add<00:01:42.360> more<00:01:42.720> lots

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
stating it's possible to add more lots

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.710 
stating it's possible to add more lots
and<00:01:43.259> larger<00:01:43.710> areas<00:01:44.340> but<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.240> will<00:01:45.450> still<00:01:45.600> have

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
and larger areas but you will still have

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.719 
and larger areas but you will still have
to<00:01:45.930> load<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.320> go<00:01:46.350> from<00:01:46.619> one<00:01:46.860> lot<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.340> another

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
to load to go from one lot to another

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.190 
to load to go from one lot to another
this<00:01:48.030> being<00:01:48.240> because<00:01:48.479> loading<00:01:48.810> screens<00:01:49.079> are

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
this being because loading screens are

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.050 
this being because loading screens are
built<00:01:49.380> right<00:01:49.590> into<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.009> system<00:01:50.369> architecture

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
built right into the system architecture

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.420 
built right into the system architecture
of<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.360> game<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.899> think<00:01:52.170> less<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.439> sims<00:01:52.799> 3<00:01:53.159> and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
of the game so think less of sims 3 and

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.760 
of the game so think less of sims 3 and
more<00:01:53.700> sims<00:01:54.060> 2<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.930> front<00:01:55.170> by<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.500> least

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
more sims 2 in this front by the least

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.170 
more sims 2 in this front by the least
it's<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.979> good<00:01:56.130> sign<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> future<00:01:56.880> it

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
it's a good sign that in the future it

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.160 
it's a good sign that in the future it
may<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.360> possible<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:57.899> larger

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
may be possible to have larger

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.139 
may be possible to have larger
neighborhoods<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.399> unfortunately<00:02:00.030> you'll

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
neighborhoods just unfortunately you'll

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.609 
neighborhoods just unfortunately you'll
still<00:02:00.329> have<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.479> load<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:00.990> from<00:02:01.140> one<00:02:01.170> lot

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
still have to load to get from one lot

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.260 
still have to load to get from one lot
to<00:02:01.890> another<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.000> current

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
to another that's one of the current

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.420 
to another that's one of the current
rights<00:02:03.450> i<00:02:03.630> have<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.020> sims<00:02:04.350> 4<00:02:04.439> but<00:02:05.130> maybe

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
rights i have with the sims 4 but maybe

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.609 
rights i have with the sims 4 but maybe
in<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.759> future<00:02:05.909> like<00:02:06.210> with<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> sims<00:02:06.719> 5<00:02:07.110> that

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
in the future like with the sims 5 that

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.290 
in the future like with the sims 5 that
will<00:02:07.829> be<00:02:07.950> adjusted<00:02:08.550> but<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.910> course<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.119> don't

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
will be adjusted but of course you don't

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.910 
will be adjusted but of course you don't
want<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.569> start<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.080> sims<00:02:10.319> 5<00:02:10.619> news

different notes I'm loving the brand new
interactions<00:03:00.660> with<00:03:00.810> animations<00:03:01.380> inside<00:03:01.950> of

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
interactions with animations inside of

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.380 
interactions with animations inside of
the<00:03:02.220> game<00:03:02.490> there's<00:03:02.940> tons<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.270> different

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
the game there's tons of different

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.180 
the game there's tons of different
aspects<00:03:04.020> of<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.380> it's<00:03:04.440> really<00:03:04.800> fun<00:03:05.160> to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
aspects of it and it's really fun to

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.310 
aspects of it and it's really fun to
actually<00:03:05.430> play<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.450> actually<00:03:06.630> feel<00:03:06.930> like<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.170> get

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
actually play I actually feel like I get

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.380 
actually play I actually feel like I get
sucked<00:03:07.680> into<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.220> game<00:03:08.370> for<00:03:08.550> hours<00:03:09.120> on<00:03:09.150> end

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
sucked into the game for hours on end

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.780 
sucked into the game for hours on end
but<00:03:10.260> one<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.740> big<00:03:10.830> things<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.100> I<00:03:11.190> do<00:03:11.280> miss

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
but one of the big things that I do miss

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.970 
but one of the big things that I do miss
from<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.210> sims<00:03:12.420> 3<00:03:12.750> happens<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.470> be<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.680> open

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
from the sims 3 happens to be the open

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.040 
from the sims 3 happens to be the open
world<00:03:14.280> when<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.820> sims<00:03:15.090> 3<00:03:15.330> first<00:03:15.570> launched<00:03:15.810> and

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
world when the sims 3 first launched and

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.620 
world when the sims 3 first launched and
they<00:03:16.140> teased<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.770> open-world<00:03:17.310> concept<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.180> was

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
they teased the open-world concept I was

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.960 
they teased the open-world concept I was
in<00:03:18.870> love<00:03:19.290> I'm<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.680> hater<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.130> loading<00:03:20.520> screens<00:03:20.820> I

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
in love I'm a hater of loading screens I

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.760 
in love I'm a hater of loading screens I
hate<00:03:21.270> loading<00:03:21.480> screens<00:03:21.930> there<00:03:22.200> are<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.530> worst

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
hate loading screens there are the worst

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.320 
hate loading screens there are the worst
thing<00:03:23.070> ever<00:03:23.340> so<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:23.970> fact<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.180> they

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
thing ever so the fact that they

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.510 
thing ever so the fact that they
reappeared<00:03:24.810> inside<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.410> sims<00:03:25.590> 4<00:03:25.710> kind<00:03:26.430> of

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
reappeared inside of the sims 4 kind of

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.070 
reappeared inside of the sims 4 kind of
feels<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.970> me<00:03:27.000> like<00:03:27.120> we've<00:03:27.450> taken<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.870> step

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
feels to me like we've taken a step

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.930 
feels to me like we've taken a step
backwards<00:03:28.530> instead<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:29.520> being<00:03:29.550> this<00:03:29.790> in

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
backwards instead of it being this in

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.820 
backwards instead of it being this in
three<00:03:30.270> we<00:03:30.480> progressed<00:03:30.900> forward<00:03:31.200> we've<00:03:31.620> kind

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
three we progressed forward we've kind

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.860 
three we progressed forward we've kind
of<00:03:31.890> moved<00:03:32.040> our<00:03:32.220> way<00:03:32.310> back<00:03:32.520> to<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.730> sims<00:03:33.060> 2<00:03:33.480> now

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
of moved our way back to the sims 2 now

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.060 
of moved our way back to the sims 2 now
of<00:03:33.990> course<00:03:34.020> people<00:03:34.320> are<00:03:34.440> gonna<00:03:34.530> argue<00:03:34.770> that

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
of course people are gonna argue that

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.680 
of course people are gonna argue that
the<00:03:35.160> loading<00:03:35.430> screens<00:03:35.700> are<00:03:35.820> really<00:03:36.030> fast<00:03:36.390> and

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
the loading screens are really fast and

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.120 
the loading screens are really fast and
they're<00:03:36.870> really<00:03:36.990> efficient<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.740> they<00:03:37.890> like

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
they're really efficient and they like

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.890 
they're really efficient and they like
don't<00:03:38.370> really<00:03:38.610> bother<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.210> much<00:03:39.480> but

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
don't really bother you that much but

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.090 
don't really bother you that much but
let's<00:03:40.050> not<00:03:40.110> forget<00:03:40.290> this<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.800> base<00:03:41.070> game

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
let's not forget this is the base game

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.800 
let's not forget this is the base game
of<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:41.730> game<00:03:41.880> when<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:42.450> start<00:03:42.660> adding

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
of the game when you start adding

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.150 
of the game when you start adding
different<00:03:43.050> expansion<00:03:43.620> packs<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:44.010> stuff

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
different expansion packs and stuff

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.320 
different expansion packs and stuff
packs<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.520> all<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.670> other<00:03:44.850> stuff<00:03:44.910> into<00:03:45.270> the

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
packs and all the other stuff into the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.600 
packs and all the other stuff into the
game<00:03:45.510> it's<00:03:45.780> gonna<00:03:46.110> become<00:03:46.500> slower<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.370> if<00:03:47.520> you

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
game it's gonna become slower so if you

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.370 
game it's gonna become slower so if you
do<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.910> five-second<00:03:48.630> loading<00:03:48.870> screen<00:03:49.140> could

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
do that five-second loading screen could

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.920 
do that five-second loading screen could
become<00:03:49.800> up<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.130> like<00:03:50.340> 10<00:03:50.370> seconds<00:03:51.150> maybe<00:03:51.390> 20

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
become up to like 10 seconds maybe 20

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.140 
become up to like 10 seconds maybe 20
seconds<00:03:52.560> holy<00:03:52.890> what<00:03:53.370> if<00:03:53.460> it<00:03:53.550> becomes<00:03:53.760> half<00:03:54.030> a

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
seconds holy what if it becomes half a

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.300 
seconds holy what if it becomes half a
minute<00:03:54.360> that<00:03:54.720> would<00:03:55.140> suck<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.830> so<00:03:56.040> that's<00:03:56.190> the

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
minute that would suck and so that's the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.740 
minute that would suck and so that's the
reason<00:03:56.340> why<00:03:56.580> I'm<00:03:56.730> not<00:03:56.880> really<00:03:57.090> big<00:03:57.330> fan<00:03:57.510> of<00:03:57.540> the

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
reason why I'm not really big fan of the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.360 
reason why I'm not really big fan of the
loading<00:03:58.080> screens<00:03:58.380> reappearing<00:03:59.010> along<00:03:59.250> with

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
loading screens reappearing along with

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.860 
loading screens reappearing along with
that<00:03:59.430> as<00:03:59.610> they<00:03:59.730> builder<00:04:00.120> myself<00:04:00.480> I'm<00:04:00.630> free<00:04:00.810> the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
that as they builder myself I'm free the

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.720 
that as they builder myself I'm free the
fan<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.380> bill<00:04:01.620> vote<00:04:01.860> inside<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.460> the<00:04:02.520> sims

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
fan of the bill vote inside of the sims

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.430 
fan of the bill vote inside of the sims
3<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.240> that<00:04:03.420> being<00:04:03.600> of<00:04:03.720> course<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.050> base<00:04:04.410> game

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
3 and that being of course the base game

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.800 
3 and that being of course the base game
of<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.100> sims<00:04:05.310> 3<00:04:05.550> now<00:04:05.790> with<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.030> sims<00:04:06.240> 4<00:04:06.330> I<00:04:06.510> feel

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
of the sims 3 now with the sims 4 I feel

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.880 
of the sims 3 now with the sims 4 I feel
like<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:07.020> lot<00:04:07.110> of<00:04:07.170> different<00:04:07.500> features<00:04:07.770> I've

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
like a lot of different features I've

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.220 
like a lot of different features I've
kind<00:04:08.100> of<00:04:08.130> been<00:04:08.220> grazed<00:04:08.670> over<00:04:09.030> one<00:04:09.780> big<00:04:10.020> feature

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
kind of been grazed over one big feature

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.510 
kind of been grazed over one big feature
of<00:04:10.410> course<00:04:10.620> being<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.920> fact<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.280> the

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
of course being the fact that the

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.490 
of course being the fact that the
swimming<00:04:11.940> pools<00:04:12.150> don't<00:04:12.810> really<00:04:13.050> exist<00:04:13.170> in<00:04:13.410> the

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
swimming pools don't really exist in the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.620 
swimming pools don't really exist in the
game<00:04:13.680> this<00:04:13.920> is<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.160> very<00:04:14.310> first<00:04:14.430> Sims<00:04:15.150> game<00:04:15.360> in

game this is the very first Sims game in

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.960 
game this is the very first Sims game in
which<00:04:16.020> swimming<00:04:16.440> pools<00:04:16.680> don't<00:04:17.130> exist<00:04:17.520> in<00:04:17.730> the
