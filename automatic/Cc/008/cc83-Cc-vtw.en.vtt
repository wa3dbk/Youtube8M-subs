of uncompressed video and if we look at
the<00:00:37.410> back<00:00:37.620> here<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:38.360> got<00:00:39.360> several<00:00:39.899> inputs<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
the back here I got several inputs and

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.299 
the back here I got several inputs and
outputs<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.520> do<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.879> our<00:00:42.090> HDMI<00:00:42.750> IN<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.469> record

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
outputs we do have our HDMI IN to record

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.750 
outputs we do have our HDMI IN to record
off<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.840> an<00:00:45.930> HDMI<00:00:46.289> out<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:47.070> serves

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
off and we have an HDMI out it serves

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.760 
off and we have an HDMI out it serves
two<00:00:48.059> purposes<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.840> once<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.559> loop

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
two purposes for once it's a loop

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.910 
two purposes for once it's a loop
through<00:00:50.160> when<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.850> record<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:51.989> see<00:00:52.530> your

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
through when you record you can see your

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.729 
through when you record you can see your
input<00:00:53.280> signal<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> output<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.530> can

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
input signal on the output but it can

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.770 
input signal on the output but it can
also<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:56.160> used<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.489> playback<00:00:57.090> something<00:00:57.660> off

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
also be used to playback something off

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.860 
also be used to playback something off
this<00:00:57.930> recorder<00:00:58.469> then<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.820> SDI<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
this recorder then we have the SDI and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.729 
this recorder then we have the SDI and
SDI<00:01:01.620> out<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.000> really<00:01:03.329> nice<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:04.500> use

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
SDI out and this is really nice to use

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.880 
SDI out and this is really nice to use
for<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.489> STI<00:01:05.939> testing<00:01:06.570> that's<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.590> I've<00:01:07.740> been

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
for of STI testing that's what I've been

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.940 
for of STI testing that's what I've been
using<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.400> for<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.700> last<00:01:08.850> few<00:01:09.119> days<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.659> just

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
using it for the last few days I just

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.170 
using it for the last few days I just
pulled<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.040> clip<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.060> test<00:01:12.330> clip<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.900> my

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
pulled a clip a test clip on my

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.420 
pulled a clip a test clip on my
solid-state<00:01:15.180> drive<00:01:15.479> here<00:01:16.130> plugged<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
solid-state drive here plugged it in the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.060 
solid-state drive here plugged it in the
box<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.299> used<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.170> generate<00:01:19.590> an<00:01:19.740> SDI

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
box and used it to generate an SDI

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.609 
box and used it to generate an SDI
stream<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.820> me<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.750> I'm<00:01:22.049> using<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.439> as<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
stream for me so I'm using it as a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.640 
stream for me so I'm using it as a
pattern<00:01:22.920> generator<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> same<00:01:24.180> time<00:01:24.650> but

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
pattern generator at the same time but

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.109 
pattern generator at the same time but
that's<00:01:25.860> not<00:01:26.070> what<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.400> made<00:01:26.580> for

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
that's not what it's made for

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.280 
that's not what it's made for
so<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.479> thing<00:01:27.659> does<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.049> power

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
so this thing does have a power

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.440 
so this thing does have a power
connector<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.310> battery-powered<00:01:29.880> as

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
connector but it is battery-powered as

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.190 
connector but it is battery-powered as
you<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.960> see<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.409> working<00:01:31.619> right<00:01:32.009> now<00:01:32.159> and

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
you can see it's working right now and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.440 
you can see it's working right now and
one<00:01:34.200> design<00:01:34.560> complaint<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.240> see

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
one design complaint that you can see

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.359 
one design complaint that you can see
right<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:36.780> directly<00:01:37.439> from<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.829> start<00:01:38.130> is

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
right here directly from the start is

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.899 
right here directly from the start is
okay<00:01:39.240> how<00:01:39.420> many<00:01:39.590> LEDs<00:01:40.590> are<00:01:40.890> lighting<00:01:41.490> up<00:01:41.610> right

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
okay how many LEDs are lighting up right

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.940 
okay how many LEDs are lighting up right
now<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.540> camera<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.350> looks<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.740> whole<00:01:43.920> lot

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
now on camera this looks a whole lot

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.969 
now on camera this looks a whole lot
better<00:01:44.280> than<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.640> dozen<00:01:44.880> reality<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:46.380> there's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
better than a dozen reality but there's

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.130 
better than a dozen reality but there's
apparently<00:01:47.280> no<00:01:47.549> optical<00:01:48.119> shielding<00:01:48.630> between

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
apparently no optical shielding between

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.690 
apparently no optical shielding between
the<00:01:49.409> LEDs<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:51.030> fourth<00:01:51.390> led<00:01:52.250> into<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the LEDs so this fourth led into the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.469 
the LEDs so this fourth led into the
human<00:01:53.909> eye<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:55.020> could<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.619> could<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.130> off

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
human eye it could be on could be off

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.870 
human eye it could be on could be off
there's<00:01:57.479> no<00:01:57.750> no<00:01:58.140> telling<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.130> third<00:01:59.369> LED

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
there's no no telling and the third LED

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.910 
there's no no telling and the third LED
is<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.780> or<00:02:00.960> off<00:02:01.140> I'm<00:02:01.469> not<00:02:01.500> sure

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
is that one on or off I'm not sure

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.980 
is that one on or off I'm not sure
actually<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.820> think<00:02:03.090> there's<00:02:03.240> only<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.570> first

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
actually I think there's only the first

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.459 
actually I think there's only the first
two<00:02:04.259> are<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.880> last<00:02:06.030> two<00:02:06.360> are<00:02:06.390> off<00:02:06.689> so

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
two are on and the last two are off so

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.400 
two are on and the last two are off so
that's<00:02:07.649> definitely<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.340> design<00:02:08.759> flaw<00:02:09.410> then

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
that's definitely a design flaw then

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.190 
that's definitely a design flaw then
next<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.280> an<00:02:11.400> activity<00:02:11.670> LED<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.840> lights

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
next we have an activity LED that lights

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.180 
next we have an activity LED that lights
up<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.800> reach

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
up a reach

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.210 
up a reach
the<00:02:15.190> device<00:02:15.520> accesses<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.240> solid-state<00:02:16.840> drive

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
the device accesses to solid-state drive

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.300 
the device accesses to solid-state drive
next<00:02:18.220> is<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.580> video<00:02:18.990> LED<00:02:19.990> if<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.740> connect<00:02:21.100> a

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
next is a video LED if you connect a

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.330 
next is a video LED if you connect a
valid<00:02:22.060> video<00:02:22.360> source<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.440> I'm<00:02:24.070> trying

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
valid video source to it and I'm trying

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.090 
valid video source to it and I'm trying
to<00:02:24.370> find<00:02:24.610> one<00:02:24.880> here<00:02:25.120> then<00:02:25.600> let's<00:02:26.380> plug<00:02:27.010> one<00:02:27.190> in

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
to find one here then let's plug one in

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.550 
to find one here then let's plug one in
then<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.670> moment<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.090> gets<00:02:31.270> some<00:02:31.660> valid<00:02:32.230> video

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
then the moment it gets some valid video

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.420 
then the moment it gets some valid video
there<00:02:32.950> we<00:02:33.070> go

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
there we go

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.500 
there we go
it'll<00:02:33.730> light<00:02:33.910> up<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.590> that's<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:36.360> next<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.480> a

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
it'll light up and that's that next is a

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.949 
it'll light up and that's that next is a
power<00:02:37.780> button<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.580> Display<00:02:39.580> button<00:02:39.610> then<00:02:40.600> a

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
power button a Display button then a

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.260 
power button a Display button then a
forward<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.070> backwards<00:02:42.700> button<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.240> course

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
forward and backwards button of course

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.320 
forward and backwards button of course
we<00:02:44.170> got<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.590> stop<00:02:45.070> button<00:02:45.459> play<00:02:45.760> button<00:02:46.150> and

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
we got the stop button play button and

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.380 
we got the stop button play button and
record<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.709> recording<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:48.430> very<00:02:48.640> easy<00:02:48.880> as<00:02:49.209> long

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
record so recording is very easy as long

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.240 
record so recording is very easy as long
as<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.630> have<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.810> video<00:02:50.140> signal<00:02:50.470> connected<00:02:51.100> to

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
as you have a video signal connected to

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.490 
as you have a video signal connected to
the<00:02:51.340> device<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.780> got<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.930> solid<00:02:53.290> state

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
the device and you got a solid state

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.860 
the device and you got a solid state
drive<00:02:53.530> inserted<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:55.239> hit<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.480> record<00:02:55.600> button

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
drive inserted you hit the record button

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.470 
drive inserted you hit the record button
and<00:02:56.320> it<00:02:56.890> starts<00:02:57.070> recording<00:02:57.280> it's<00:02:58.150> as<00:02:58.300> simple

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
and it starts recording it's as simple

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.350 
and it starts recording it's as simple
as<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.830> stop<00:02:59.830> the<00:02:59.980> recording<00:03:00.459> we<00:03:01.060> had<00:03:01.239> this

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
as that stop the recording we had this

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.990 
as that stop the recording we had this
button<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.500> playback<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:03.340> previously

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
button and to playback I previously

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.479 
button and to playback I previously
recorded<00:03:04.300> clip<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:05.470> hit<00:03:05.650> play<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:06.280> then<00:03:06.459> you

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
recorded clip you hit play and then you

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.130 
recorded clip you hit play and then you
can<00:03:06.760> scroll<00:03:07.030> through<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.450> videos<00:03:07.780> with<00:03:08.020> the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
can scroll through the videos with the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.470 
can scroll through the videos with the
forward<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.560> backward<00:03:08.800> buttons<00:03:09.340> very<00:03:10.150> easy

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
forward and backward buttons very easy

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.930 
forward and backward buttons very easy
you<00:03:10.959> see<00:03:11.140> yeah<00:03:11.320> that<00:03:12.040> was<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.190> very<00:03:12.280> short<00:03:12.700> clip

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
you see yeah that was a very short clip

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.550 
you see yeah that was a very short clip
that<00:03:13.209> was<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.450> clip<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.840> just<00:03:14.110> recorded

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
that was the clip that I just recorded

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.300 
that was the clip that I just recorded
to<00:03:14.650> show<00:03:14.860> you<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:16.050> that's<00:03:17.050> that<00:03:17.410> I'm<00:03:17.980> not<00:03:18.160> sure

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
to show you and that's that I'm not sure

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.140 
to show you and that's that I'm not sure
if<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.459> can<00:03:18.580> hear<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:18.940> in<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.120> background

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
if you can hear that in the background

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.030 
if you can hear that in the background
but<00:03:19.720> we<00:03:19.810> just<00:03:19.959> have<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.200> nice<00:03:20.380> thunderstorm

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
but we just have a nice thunderstorm

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.920 
but we just have a nice thunderstorm
pulling<00:03:21.430> up<00:03:21.580> here<00:03:21.870> but<00:03:22.870> anyway<00:03:23.290> as<00:03:23.590> far<00:03:23.860> as

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
pulling up here but anyway as far as

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.860 
pulling up here but anyway as far as
those<00:03:26.070> hard<00:03:27.070> drives<00:03:27.400> are<00:03:27.640> concerned<00:03:28.120> you're

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
those hard drives are concerned you're

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.479 
those hard drives are concerned you're
supposed<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.290> use<00:03:29.500> on<00:03:29.680> solid-state<00:03:30.190> drive

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
supposed to use on solid-state drive

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.330 
supposed to use on solid-state drive
I've<00:03:31.000> actually<00:03:31.570> tried<00:03:32.290> this<00:03:32.680> with<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:32.980> couple

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
I've actually tried this with a couple

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.960 
I've actually tried this with a couple
of<00:03:34.110> normal<00:03:35.110> hard<00:03:35.320> drives<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:36.010> I'm<00:03:36.519> surprised

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
of normal hard drives and I'm surprised

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.390 
of normal hard drives and I'm surprised
it<00:03:37.209> actually<00:03:37.570> worked<00:03:37.810> now<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.590> format<00:03:39.220> that<00:03:39.370> I

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
it actually worked now the format that I

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.009 
it actually worked now the format that I
was<00:03:39.640> using<00:03:39.910> for<00:03:40.090> that<00:03:40.390> test<00:03:40.720> was<00:03:41.910> DNxHD<00:03:42.910> so<00:03:43.810> I'm

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
was using for that test was DNxHD so I'm

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.050 
was using for that test was DNxHD so I'm
pretty<00:03:44.200> sure<00:03:44.530> for<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:44.980> intense<00:03:45.370> write<00:03:45.670> speeds

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
pretty sure for the intense write speeds

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.930 
pretty sure for the intense write speeds
used<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:47.140> write<00:03:47.380> uncompressed<00:03:48.220> video<00:03:48.430> on<00:03:48.790> it

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
used to write uncompressed video on it

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.780 
used to write uncompressed video on it
it<00:03:49.060> wouldn't<00:03:49.299> work<00:03:49.480> this<00:03:50.320> box<00:03:50.620> can<00:03:50.980> record<00:03:51.430> in

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
it wouldn't work this box can record in

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.970 
it wouldn't work this box can record in
uncompressed<00:03:53.040> 10-bit<00:03:54.040> color<00:03:54.250> space<00:03:54.959> video

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
uncompressed 10-bit color space video

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.370 
uncompressed 10-bit color space video
it's<00:03:56.980> very<00:03:57.100> important<00:03:57.850> most<00:03:58.299> oh<00:03:58.600> we<00:03:59.140> want<00:03:59.320> to

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
it's very important most oh we want to

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.320 
it's very important most oh we want to
say<00:03:59.500> most<00:03:59.709> but<00:03:59.950> many<00:03:59.980> recorders<00:04:00.610> only<00:04:00.970> record

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
say most but many recorders only record

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.060 
say most but many recorders only record
8<00:04:01.540> bits<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:02.170> there's<00:04:02.350> a<00:04:02.440> big<00:04:02.799> difference

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
8 bits and there's a big difference

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.720 
8 bits and there's a big difference
between<00:04:03.459> 8-bit<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.120> 10-bit<00:04:04.480> video<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:06.430> does

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
between 8-bit and 10-bit video it does

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.750 
between 8-bit and 10-bit video it does
record<00:04:07.470> ProRes<00:04:08.470> for<00:04:08.799> 2<00:04:08.980> -<00:04:09.190> it's<00:04:09.430> an<00:04:09.580> apple

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
record ProRes for 2 - it's an apple

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.819 
record ProRes for 2 - it's an apple
format<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.630> it<00:04:11.470> does<00:04:11.680> record<00:04:12.120> DNxHD<00:04:13.829> some

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
format and it does record DNxHD some

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.370 
format and it does record DNxHD some
people<00:04:15.130> prefer<00:04:15.510> DNxHD<00:04:16.510> other<00:04:16.810> people<00:04:17.200> prefer

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
people prefer DNxHD other people prefer

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.219 
people prefer DNxHD other people prefer
Apple<00:04:17.919> ProRes<00:04:18.160> so<00:04:19.120> many<00:04:19.359> people<00:04:19.690> have<00:04:19.810> argued

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
Apple ProRes so many people have argued

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.270 
Apple ProRes so many people have argued
about<00:04:20.380> that<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:21.040> use<00:04:21.760> DNxHD<00:04:22.720> and<00:04:23.050> I'm<00:04:24.039> going<00:04:24.250> to

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
about that I use DNxHD and I'm going to

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.610 
about that I use DNxHD and I'm going to
stick<00:04:24.550> with<00:04:24.729> that<00:04:24.880> so<00:04:25.320> you<00:04:26.320> might<00:04:26.500> do

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
stick with that so you might do

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.890 
stick with that so you might do
something<00:04:26.890> different<00:04:27.370> with<00:04:27.460> it

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
something different with it

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.589 
something different with it
okay<00:04:28.900> one<00:04:29.110> thing<00:04:29.139> I'm<00:04:29.409> gonna<00:04:29.530> do<00:04:29.830> like<00:04:30.069> I<00:04:30.099> said

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
okay one thing I'm gonna do like I said

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.950 
okay one thing I'm gonna do like I said
hd-sdi<00:04:32.009> isn't<00:04:33.009> SDI<00:04:33.819> in<00:04:34.120> general<00:04:34.569> it's<00:04:34.780> not

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
hd-sdi isn't SDI in general it's not

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.820 
hd-sdi isn't SDI in general it's not
necessarily<00:04:35.710> something<00:04:36.009> that<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:38.169> amateur

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
necessarily something that the amateur

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.659 
necessarily something that the amateur
film<00:04:39.189> or<00:04:39.430> amateur<00:04:39.969> video<00:04:40.360> maker<00:04:40.629> comes<00:04:41.020> along

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
film or amateur video maker comes along

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.140 
film or amateur video maker comes along
so<00:04:42.669> I<00:04:42.699> thought<00:04:43.180> why<00:04:44.110> not<00:04:44.139> show<00:04:44.939> what<00:04:45.939> it<00:04:46.120> looks

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
so I thought why not show what it looks

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.369 
so I thought why not show what it looks
like<00:04:46.689> on<00:04:47.469> the<00:04:47.860> oscilloscope<00:04:48.219> here<00:04:49.379> camera

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:50.379 
like on the oscilloscope here camera

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.700 
like on the oscilloscope here camera
went<00:04:50.620> a<00:04:50.710> little<00:04:50.830> bit<00:04:51.099> down<00:04:51.310> there<00:04:52.560> just<00:04:53.560> the

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
went a little bit down there just the

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.439 
went a little bit down there just the
tech<00:04:54.270> 4104<00:04:55.270> b6<00:04:55.840> obviously<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:57.300> what<00:04:58.300> we're

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
tech 4104 b6 obviously and what we're

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.149 
tech 4104 b6 obviously and what we're
showing<00:04:58.599> here<00:04:58.960> is<00:04:59.050> an<00:04:59.169> eye<00:04:59.349> diagram<00:04:59.860> of<00:05:00.009> the

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 
showing here is an eye diagram of the

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:03.659 
showing here is an eye diagram of the
output<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:01.379> it's<00:05:02.379> really<00:05:02.620> just<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:03.039> serial

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
output and it's really just a serial

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.089 
output and it's really just a serial
stream<00:05:04.000> if<00:05:04.150> we<00:05:04.270> sing<00:05:04.479> I'll<00:05:04.569> capture<00:05:04.810> that<00:05:05.229> you

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
stream if we sing I'll capture that you

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.159 
stream if we sing I'll capture that you
can<00:05:06.279> see<00:05:06.520> the<00:05:06.699> individual<00:05:07.300> bits<00:05:07.599> coming<00:05:07.930> out

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
can see the individual bits coming out

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.679 
can see the individual bits coming out
and<00:05:08.409> jumping<00:05:08.740> around<00:05:09.330> hd-sdi

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:10.689 
and jumping around hd-sdi

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:14.339 
and jumping around hd-sdi
has<00:05:11.289> a<00:05:11.319> bitrate<00:05:11.949> around<00:05:12.430> 1.5<00:05:13.389> gigabits<00:05:14.169> per

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
has a bitrate around 1.5 gigabits per

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.249 
has a bitrate around 1.5 gigabits per
second<00:05:14.949> there<00:05:15.789> are<00:05:15.819> many<00:05:16.449> many<00:05:16.840> many<00:05:17.080> other

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
second there are many many many other

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:20.119 
second there are many many many other
different<00:05:18.039> link<00:05:18.340> rates<00:05:18.639> there's<00:05:19.000> a<00:05:19.120> 3G<00:05:19.719> SDI

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:20.129 
different link rates there's a 3G SDI

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.480 
different link rates there's a 3G SDI
there's<00:05:21.129> dual<00:05:21.789> link<00:05:22.360> SDI<00:05:22.839> which<00:05:23.589> simply

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
there's dual link SDI which simply

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.909 
there's dual link SDI which simply
combines<00:05:24.909> two<00:05:25.210> of<00:05:25.389> these<00:05:25.539> HD<00:05:25.930> SDI<00:05:26.439> streams

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
combines two of these HD SDI streams

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.369 
combines two of these HD SDI streams
together<00:05:27.159> and<00:05:28.029> there's<00:05:28.839> various<00:05:29.229> other

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:29.379 
together and there's various other

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:33.559 
together and there's various other
formats<00:05:29.979> for<00:05:30.249> a<00:05:30.939> standard<00:05:31.719> or<00:05:32.229> lower

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:33.569 
formats for a standard or lower

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.510 
formats for a standard or lower
definitions<00:05:34.569> so<00:05:35.439> if<00:05:35.770> you've<00:05:35.949> never<00:05:36.129> played

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
definitions so if you've never played

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.519 
definitions so if you've never played
with<00:05:36.729> this<00:05:36.969> this<00:05:37.659> should<00:05:37.810> be<00:05:37.870> interesting<00:05:38.500> to

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
with this this should be interesting to

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.589 
with this this should be interesting to
see<00:05:38.830> and<00:05:39.339> you're<00:05:39.639> gonna<00:05:39.789> see<00:05:40.089> many<00:05:40.300> more

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
see and you're gonna see many more

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:42.719 
see and you're gonna see many more
videos<00:05:40.810> on<00:05:41.289> the<00:05:41.409> block<00:05:41.650> about<00:05:41.889> HD<00:05:42.250> SDI<00:05:42.610> and

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
videos on the block about HD SDI and

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.519 
videos on the block about HD SDI and
then<00:05:43.240> professional<00:05:43.870> digital<00:05:44.020> video

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:44.529 
then professional digital video

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.439 
then professional digital video
standards<00:05:45.069> and<00:05:45.339> this<00:05:45.550> is<00:05:45.699> really<00:05:45.969> why<00:05:46.089> I<00:05:46.120> toss

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
standards and this is really why I toss

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.860 
standards and this is really why I toss
this<00:05:46.689> in<00:05:46.870> also<00:05:48.120> for<00:05:49.120> wants<00:05:49.389> to<00:05:49.539> show<00:05:49.689> the

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
this in also for wants to show the

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.230 
this in also for wants to show the
Blackmagic<00:05:50.439> Design<00:05:50.469> recorder<00:05:51.370> and<00:05:51.639> the<00:05:52.120> other

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
Blackmagic Design recorder and the other

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.969 
Blackmagic Design recorder and the other
side<00:05:52.569> of<00:05:52.689> it<00:05:52.810> is<00:05:52.930> we<00:05:53.169> are<00:05:53.199> gonna<00:05:53.439> dive<00:05:53.770> a<00:05:53.800> little

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
side of it is we are gonna dive a little

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.279 
side of it is we are gonna dive a little
bit<00:05:54.129> into<00:05:54.300> professional<00:05:55.300> video<00:05:55.599> applications

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
bit into professional video applications

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.459 
bit into professional video applications
and<00:05:56.759> look<00:05:57.759> at<00:05:57.879> things<00:05:58.029> like<00:05:58.149> HD<00:05:58.419> SDI<00:05:58.930> and<00:05:59.020> other

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
and look at things like HD SDI and other

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:02.129 
and look at things like HD SDI and other
transmission<00:06:00.310> formats<00:06:00.909> okay<00:06:01.569> this<00:06:01.750> was<00:06:01.899> just

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
transmission formats okay this was just

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:03.719 
transmission formats okay this was just
supposed<00:06:02.349> to<00:06:02.500> be<00:06:02.649> a<00:06:02.680> little<00:06:02.919> not<00:06:03.399> even<00:06:03.430> a

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
supposed to be a little not even a

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.260 
supposed to be a little not even a
review<00:06:04.149> but<00:06:04.360> many<00:06:04.719> overview<00:06:05.550> of<00:06:06.550> what<00:06:07.240> I

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
review but many overview of what I

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.679 
review but many overview of what I
bought<00:06:07.569> here<00:06:07.960> and<00:06:08.939> if<00:06:09.939> you<00:06:10.089> have<00:06:10.270> one<00:06:10.509> like

this please share your experience with

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.659 
this please share your experience with
me<00:06:12.909> I'd<00:06:13.089> be<00:06:13.270> very<00:06:13.419> much<00:06:13.719> interested<00:06:13.930> in<00:06:14.439> it<00:06:14.669> one

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 
me I'd be very much interested in it one

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:17.189 
me I'd be very much interested in it one
thing<00:06:15.849> I<00:06:15.969> haven't<00:06:16.180> discovered<00:06:16.599> yet<00:06:16.750> is<00:06:17.050> the

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
thing I haven't discovered yet is the

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:19.889 
thing I haven't discovered yet is the
battery<00:06:17.620> life<00:06:17.860> I<00:06:18.430> don't<00:06:19.149> think<00:06:19.479> it's<00:06:19.599> gonna<00:06:19.689> be

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:19.899 
battery life I don't think it's gonna be

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:21.389 
battery life I don't think it's gonna be
very<00:06:20.110> much<00:06:20.349> as<00:06:20.560> you<00:06:20.649> can<00:06:20.830> see<00:06:21.009> just<00:06:21.219> in<00:06:21.370> the

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:21.399 
very much as you can see just in the

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:23.550 
very much as you can see just in the
time<00:06:21.610> we've<00:06:21.759> been<00:06:21.939> talking<00:06:22.389> it<00:06:22.870> lost<00:06:23.199> another

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
time we've been talking it lost another

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.709 
time we've been talking it lost another
LED<00:06:24.520> here<00:06:24.879> and<00:06:25.830> again<00:06:26.830> how<00:06:27.729> many<00:06:27.939> are<00:06:28.149> on<00:06:28.180> how

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
LED here and again how many are on how

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:30.389 
LED here and again how many are on how
many<00:06:28.779> are<00:06:29.110> off<00:06:29.289> it<00:06:29.710> looks<00:06:29.979> like<00:06:30.039> just<00:06:30.279> the

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:30.399 
many are off it looks like just the

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:32.249 
many are off it looks like just the
first<00:06:30.639> LED<00:06:31.120> is<00:06:31.270> on<00:06:31.479> that<00:06:31.719> the<00:06:31.870> rest<00:06:32.080> is<00:06:32.199> just

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:32.259 
first LED is on that the rest is just

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:34.980 
first LED is on that the rest is just
lighting<00:06:32.830> up<00:06:32.949> because<00:06:33.430> of<00:06:33.550> lack<00:06:33.729> of<00:06:33.990> isolation

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
lighting up because of lack of isolation

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.259 
lighting up because of lack of isolation
there<00:06:35.199> another<00:06:35.979> thing<00:06:36.250> that<00:06:36.370> I'm<00:06:36.490> missing<00:06:36.909> is

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:37.269 
there another thing that I'm missing is

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:38.999 
there another thing that I'm missing is
I<00:06:37.599> would<00:06:37.959> love<00:06:38.169> to<00:06:38.379> see<00:06:38.529> some<00:06:38.769> sort<00:06:38.889> of

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:39.009 
I would love to see some sort of

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:39.810 
I would love to see some sort of
indication

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
indication

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.420 
indication
and<00:06:39.910> how<00:06:40.690> full<00:06:41.110> or<00:06:41.410> empty<00:06:41.440> my<00:06:41.920> solid-state

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
and how full or empty my solid-state

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.430 
and how full or empty my solid-state
drive<00:06:42.700> is<00:06:42.970> there's<00:06:43.600> absolutely<00:06:44.140> no

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
drive is there's absolutely no

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.040 
drive is there's absolutely no
indication<00:06:44.650> of<00:06:45.250> that<00:06:45.550> and<00:06:45.820> it<00:06:46.600> would<00:06:46.750> be<00:06:46.870> nice

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
indication of that and it would be nice

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.700 
indication of that and it would be nice
if<00:06:47.260> like<00:06:47.440> this<00:06:47.770> last<00:06:48.300> LED<00:06:49.300> block<00:06:49.540> here<00:06:49.990> could

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
if like this last LED block here could

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.550 
if like this last LED block here could
be<00:06:50.890> used<00:06:51.160> if<00:06:51.430> you<00:06:51.520> could<00:06:51.700> switch<00:06:52.000> it<00:06:52.030> between

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
be used if you could switch it between

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.840 
be used if you could switch it between
showing<00:06:53.560> me<00:06:53.680> the<00:06:53.860> battery<00:06:54.160> status<00:06:54.460> and

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
showing me the battery status and

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.130 
showing me the battery status and
showing<00:06:55.120> me<00:06:55.210> the<00:06:55.270> solid<00:06:55.660> state

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.140 
showing me the solid state

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.020 
showing me the solid state
a<00:06:56.170> status<00:06:56.980> this<00:06:57.160> would<00:06:57.370> be<00:06:57.490> really<00:06:57.760> awesome

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.030 
a status this would be really awesome

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.120 
a status this would be really awesome
else<00:06:58.810> you<00:06:58.990> just<00:06:59.080> left<00:06:59.410> in<00:06:59.560> the<00:06:59.650> dark<00:06:59.890> of<00:07:00.070> course

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.130 
else you just left in the dark of course

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.830 
else you just left in the dark of course
you<00:07:00.370> can<00:07:00.520> do<00:07:00.640> the<00:07:00.790> math<00:07:01.000> if<00:07:01.210> you<00:07:01.330> know<00:07:01.480> your<00:07:01.660> bid

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 
you can do the math if you know your bid

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.130 
you can do the math if you know your bid
rate<00:07:02.050> but<00:07:02.860> it's<00:07:03.850> not<00:07:04.090> constant<00:07:04.540> bit<00:07:04.690> rate<00:07:04.720> I

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.140 
rate but it's not constant bit rate I

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.390 
rate but it's not constant bit rate I
mean<00:07:05.260> your<00:07:05.440> uncompressed<00:07:05.710> is<00:07:06.070> going<00:07:06.220> to<00:07:06.310> be

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 
mean your uncompressed is going to be

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.830 
mean your uncompressed is going to be
very<00:07:06.610> clear<00:07:06.910> but<00:07:07.120> the<00:07:07.210> compress<00:07:07.630> this

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 
very clear but the compress this

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.600 
very clear but the compress this
variable<00:07:08.380> bit<00:07:08.560> rate<00:07:08.590> so<00:07:09.370> you're<00:07:09.460> going<00:07:09.580> to

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610 
variable bit rate so you're going to

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.370 
variable bit rate so you're going to
have<00:07:09.760> to<00:07:09.880> assume<00:07:10.150> worst<00:07:10.450> case<00:07:10.750> and<00:07:11.140> then<00:07:11.230> do

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380 
have to assume worst case and then do

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.860 
have to assume worst case and then do
the<00:07:11.530> math<00:07:11.740> and<00:07:12.070> swap<00:07:12.400> the<00:07:12.550> SSD<00:07:13.060> out<00:07:13.240> after<00:07:13.630> that

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
the math and swap the SSD out after that

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.040 
the math and swap the SSD out after that
or<00:07:14.530> just<00:07:14.830> buy<00:07:15.010> a<00:07:15.040> humungous<00:07:15.610> SSD<00:07:16.180> whatever<00:07:16.870> you

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050 
or just buy a humungous SSD whatever you

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.230 
or just buy a humungous SSD whatever you
want<00:07:17.290> okay<00:07:18.160> anyway<00:07:18.520> that's<00:07:18.760> enough<00:07:19.060> of<00:07:19.180> that

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.240 
want okay anyway that's enough of that

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.360 
want okay anyway that's enough of that
so<00:07:19.840> I<00:07:19.870> hope<00:07:20.350> you<00:07:20.500> liked<00:07:20.710> it<00:07:20.860> and<00:07:20.980> I'll<00:07:21.100> see<00:07:21.280> you

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.370 
so I hope you liked it and I'll see you

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:29.399 
so I hope you liked it and I'll see you
next<00:07:21.430> time

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:29.409
