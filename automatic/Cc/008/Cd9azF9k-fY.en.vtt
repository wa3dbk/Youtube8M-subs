00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
take notice of the intro in my videos

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.380 
take notice of the intro in my videos
you'll<00:00:32.309> notice<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:33.000> background<00:00:33.329> image

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
you'll notice that the background image

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.959 
you'll notice that the background image
isn't<00:00:33.630> static<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.890> actually<00:00:35.010> moves<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.610> bit<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
isn't static it actually moves a bit and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.430 
isn't static it actually moves a bit and
we<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.420> by<00:00:36.630> using<00:00:36.840> Ken<00:00:37.350> Burns<00:00:39.379> what<00:00:40.379> you

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
we do that by using Ken Burns what you

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.250 
we do that by using Ken Burns what you
want<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.680> do<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.920> adjust<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:42.660> starting

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
want to do is adjust it so the starting

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.830 
want to do is adjust it so the starting
crop<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.340> quite<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> bit<00:00:45.149> smaller<00:00:45.300> than<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.690> end

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
crop is quite a bit smaller than the end

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.880 
crop is quite a bit smaller than the end
one<00:00:46.050> or<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.710> other<00:00:46.739> way

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
one or you can do it the other way

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.190 
one or you can do it the other way
around<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.700> big<00:00:47.910> go<00:00:48.300> into<00:00:48.510> small<00:00:48.750> or

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
around can have it big go into small or

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.500 
around can have it big go into small or
you<00:00:49.530> can<00:00:49.680> do<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.950> small<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.850> big<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.120> up<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.390> you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
you can do it small to big is up to you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.930 
you can do it small to big is up to you
so<00:00:52.050> that's<00:00:52.890> pretty<00:00:53.190> big<00:00:53.309> change<00:00:53.579> there<00:00:53.789> we've

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
so that's pretty big change there we've

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.920 
so that's pretty big change there we've
got<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.149> quite<00:00:54.300> we've<00:00:54.539> got<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.719> whole<00:00:54.750> image

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
got it quite we've got the whole image

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.869 
got it quite we've got the whole image
here<00:00:55.289> when<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.680> starts<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
here when it starts and it's going to

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.779 
here when it starts and it's going to
slowly<00:00:57.300> crop<00:00:57.600> itself<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.890> by<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> end<00:00:59.670> of

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
slowly crop itself to that by the end of

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.220 
slowly crop itself to that by the end of
the<00:00:59.910> clip<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.390> i<00:01:00.420> believe<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.719> four<00:01:00.870> seconds

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the clip and i believe it's four seconds

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.709 
the clip and i believe it's four seconds
long<00:01:01.410> by<00:01:01.559> default<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.000> hit<00:01:03.149> done<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.359> see

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
long by default so it's hit done and see

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.039 
long by default so it's hit done and see
what<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.989> looks<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:05.630> yep<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:06.840> looking

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
what that looks like yep it's looking

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.320 
what that looks like yep it's looking
pretty<00:01:07.260> good<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.650> zoom<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.610> crop<00:01:08.640> in

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
pretty good as you zoom in and crop in

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.270 
pretty good as you zoom in and crop in
the<00:01:09.450> image<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.350> gives<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> illusion<00:01:10.650> over

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the image and it gives the illusion over

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.679 
the image and it gives the illusion over
sort<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.610> moving<00:01:11.939> background<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.540> like

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
sort of moving background if you like

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.020 
sort of moving background if you like
okay<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.619> now<00:01:14.100> we've<00:01:14.220> got<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> background<00:01:14.610> saw<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
okay so now we've got a background saw a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.620 
okay so now we've got a background saw a
tight<00:01:15.240> let's<00:01:15.990> get<00:01:16.259> some<00:01:16.439> signed<00:01:17.360> I've<00:01:18.360> already

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to do what you've tracked it in it will

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.260 
to do what you've tracked it in it will
clip<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.619> length<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.280> your<00:01:38.340> background

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
clip it to the length of your background

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.450

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
automatically but what I like to do is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.100 
automatically but what I like to do is
just<00:01:41.880> make<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> sign<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.390> fade<00:01:42.570> out<00:01:42.750> towards

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
just make the sign to fade out towards

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.440 
just make the sign to fade out towards
the<00:01:43.259> end<00:01:43.430> so<00:01:44.430> we're<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.729> go<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:45.180> clip

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the end so we're going to go to clip

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.830 
the end so we're going to go to clip
