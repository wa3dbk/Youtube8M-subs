where we were absolutely buried I think

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.860 
where we were absolutely buried I think
these<00:03:43.069> guys<00:03:43.280> all<00:03:43.549> talk<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.329> each<00:03:44.359> other<00:03:44.629> and

day<00:03:46.700> it<00:03:47.510> sure<00:03:47.720> seems<00:03:48.019> that<00:03:48.109> way<00:03:48.230> sometimes<00:03:48.349> but

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
day it sure seems that way sometimes but

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.869 
day it sure seems that way sometimes but
because<00:03:50.989> of<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.290> gravel<00:03:51.799> export<00:03:52.370> being<00:03:52.639> a

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
because of the gravel export being a

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.640 
because of the gravel export being a
little<00:03:53.150> down<00:03:53.450> this<00:03:53.689> year<00:03:54.049> and<00:03:54.319> i'm<00:03:54.409> sure

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
little down this year and i'm sure

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.689 
little down this year and i'm sure
that's<00:03:54.859> based<00:03:55.160> on<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.720> economic<00:03:56.720> situation

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
that's based on the economic situation

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:02.890 
that's based on the economic situation
and<00:03:59.799> not<00:04:00.799> a<00:04:00.859> lot<00:04:01.310> of<00:04:01.340> research<00:04:02.180> going<00:04:02.209> on<00:04:02.720> up

that<00:05:04.970> traffic<00:05:05.180> because<00:05:06.080> we<00:05:06.710> are<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:08.120> major

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
that traffic because we are the major

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.130 
that traffic because we are the major

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
port the closest major port to that area

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.870 
port the closest major port to that area
and<00:05:13.450> these<00:05:14.450> guys<00:05:14.710> have<00:05:15.710> to<00:05:15.860> come<00:05:15.890> by<00:05:16.220> it's<00:05:16.580> they

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
and these guys have to come by it's they

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.780 
and these guys have to come by it's they
can<00:05:17.030> either<00:05:17.270> come<00:05:17.570> here<00:05:17.600> or<00:05:17.930> then<00:05:18.260> go<00:05:18.410> to<00:05:18.470> Dutch

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790

for their services I believe we can

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:33.390 
for their services I believe we can
count<00:05:25.310> on<00:05:25.640> an<00:05:26.090> increased<00:05:26.780> volume<00:05:27.320> of<00:05:27.500> traffic

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.270 

that<00:05:34.400> means<00:05:34.670> we<00:05:34.970> have<00:05:35.210> to<00:05:35.420> get<00:05:35.950> we<00:05:36.950> have<00:05:37.130> to

that means we have to get we have to
