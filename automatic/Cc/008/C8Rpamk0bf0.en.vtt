mentality you have every practice I mean

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.140 
mentality you have every practice I mean
we're<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:22.950> gonna<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.369> mean<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.580> feel<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:23.909> we're

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
we're not gonna I mean I feel like we're

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.460 
we're not gonna I mean I feel like we're
the<00:01:24.180> best<00:01:24.390> secondary<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.290> go

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the best secondary but we have to go

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.530 
the best secondary but we have to go
about<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.280> mean<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.090> up<00:01:27.210> here<00:01:27.270> yeah

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
about it and I mean have it up here yeah

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.850 
about it and I mean have it up here yeah
it's<00:01:27.840> got<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> be<00:01:28.140> physically<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.740> mentally

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
it's got to be physically and mentally

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.640 
it's got to be physically and mentally
so<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.369> mean<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:30.240> think<00:01:30.420> we'd<00:01:30.930> abyss<00:01:31.170> secondary

fundamentally what have you been able to
take<00:03:53.680> away<00:03:53.949> from<00:03:54.370> getting<00:03:54.969> a<00:03:55.090> spring<00:03:55.419> in

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
take away from getting a spring in

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:56.999 
take away from getting a spring in
versus<00:03:55.989> you<00:03:56.139> know<00:03:56.199> coming<00:03:56.469> in<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:56.919> just

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:57.009 
versus you know coming in and just

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:59.249 
versus you know coming in and just
trying<00:03:57.219> to<00:03:57.340> learn<00:03:57.519> a<00:03:57.849> playbook<00:03:58.269> well<00:03:58.989> I<00:03:59.019> mean

00:03:59.249 --> 00:03:59.259 
trying to learn a playbook well I mean

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.080 
trying to learn a playbook well I mean
it's<00:03:59.439> more<00:03:59.650> just<00:03:59.680> learning<00:04:00.280> actually<00:04:00.519> I<00:04:00.790> mean

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
it's more just learning actually I mean

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.909 
it's more just learning actually I mean
when<00:04:01.989> I<00:04:02.049> first<00:04:02.290> came<00:04:02.500> out<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.829> do<00:04:02.889> anything

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
when I first came out and do anything

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.039 
when I first came out and do anything
now<00:04:03.430> I<00:04:03.459> just<00:04:03.759> get<00:04:03.939> to<00:04:04.030> learn<00:04:04.209> better<00:04:04.509> everybody

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
now I just get to learn better everybody

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.449 
now I just get to learn better everybody
taking<00:04:05.290> it<00:04:05.379> slow<00:04:05.560> when<00:04:05.709> I<00:04:05.769> came<00:04:05.829> in<00:04:06.219> it<00:04:06.430> was

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
taking it slow when I came in it was

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.129 
taking it slow when I came in it was
more<00:04:06.729> fast-paced<00:04:07.209> because<00:04:07.629> the<00:04:07.780> seasons

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
more fast-paced because the seasons

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.779 
more fast-paced because the seasons
about<00:04:08.199> to<00:04:08.319> come<00:04:08.530> so<00:04:08.919> now<00:04:09.069> it's<00:04:09.280> more<00:04:09.489> slowly

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:09.789 
about to come so now it's more slowly

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.240 
about to come so now it's more slowly
going<00:04:10.329> on<00:04:10.539> key<00:04:10.930> for<00:04:11.139> keys<00:04:11.349> going<00:04:12.099> through

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
going on key for keys going through

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.740 
going on key for keys going through
every<00:04:12.430> little<00:04:12.639> thing<00:04:12.789> and<00:04:13.269> you<00:04:13.419> didn't<00:04:13.599> really
