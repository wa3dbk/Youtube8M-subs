00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.570 

the<00:02:42.049> crowds<00:02:42.349> get<00:02:42.620> bigger<00:02:42.860> since<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
the crowds get bigger since the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.009 
the crowds get bigger since the
eighteenth<00:02:43.909> Street<00:02:44.090> show<00:02:44.209> started<00:02:44.629> it's<00:02:44.780> just

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
eighteenth Street show started it's just

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.680 
eighteenth Street show started it's just
been<00:02:45.560> more<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.190> more<00:02:46.370> tact<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:47.269> that's<00:02:47.540> always

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
been more and more tact so that's always

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.180 
been more and more tact so that's always
a<00:02:47.810> good<00:02:48.019> sign<00:02:48.080> I<00:02:48.590> think<00:02:48.739> it's<00:02:48.860> kind<00:02:48.980> of<00:02:49.069> an

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
a good sign I think it's kind of an

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.190 
a good sign I think it's kind of an
indicator<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.299> amount<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.599> support<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:51.019> we

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
indicator the amount of support that we

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.600 
indicator the amount of support that we
have<00:02:51.440> from<00:02:51.769> our<00:02:51.980> neighborhood<00:02:52.159> is<00:02:52.580> pretty

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
have from our neighborhood is pretty

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.850 
have from our neighborhood is pretty
phenomenal<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:55.599> think<00:02:56.599> now<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:57.049> lot<00:02:57.319> more<00:02:57.500> people

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860
