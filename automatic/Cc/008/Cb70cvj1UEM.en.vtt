the weight shifting back and forth it
weighs<00:03:40.120> more<00:03:40.360> than<00:03:40.420> 4,000<00:03:41.350> pounds<00:03:41.740> which<00:03:41.860> is

weighs more than 4,000 pounds which is

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.920 
weighs more than 4,000 pounds which is
not<00:03:42.790> exactly<00:03:43.300> ideal<00:03:43.770> but<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:46.090> car<00:03:46.300> handles<00:03:46.750> it

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
even though it doesn't weigh quite a bit

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.880 
even though it doesn't weigh quite a bit
this<00:03:52.360> isn't<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.840> smoothest<00:03:53.080> wrapt<00:03:53.620> in<00:03:53.770> the

not<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.600> mention<00:04:10.750> it<00:04:10.990> sounds<00:04:11.380> awesome

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840

not to mention it sounds awesome
mr.<00:04:13.800> slash<00:04:14.040> corner<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:16.680> then<00:04:16.829> bang<00:04:17.100> back<00:04:17.430> onto

mr. slash corner and then bang back onto
the<00:04:17.850> shuttle<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:19.139> can<00:04:19.290> really<00:04:19.500> open<00:04:19.950> it

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
the shuttle and you can really open it

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.350 

so<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.919> challenge<00:04:33.250> is<00:04:33.310> good<00:04:33.520> on<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:33.819> track<00:04:34.060> we

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
so the challenge is good on the track we

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.089 
so the challenge is good on the track we
know<00:04:34.479> that<00:04:34.750> but<00:04:35.319> let's<00:04:35.500> face<00:04:35.650> it<00:04:35.710> you're

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
know that but let's face it you're

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.890 
know that but let's face it you're
probably<00:04:36.280> not<00:04:36.580> going<00:04:36.729> to<00:04:36.789> be<00:04:36.879> lucky<00:04:37.270> enough<00:04:37.300> to

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
probably not going to be lucky enough to

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.020 
probably not going to be lucky enough to
drive<00:04:38.199> it<00:04:38.379> all<00:04:38.500> day<00:04:38.680> long<00:04:38.919> on<00:04:39.129> a<00:04:39.159> track<00:04:39.520> you're

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
drive it all day long on a track you're

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.330 
drive it all day long on a track you're
gonna<00:04:40.120> have<00:04:40.270> to<00:04:40.330> drive<00:04:40.539> it<00:04:40.690> to<00:04:40.810> work<00:04:40.840> in<00:04:41.379> that

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
gonna have to drive it to work in that

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.249 
gonna have to drive it to work in that
capacity<00:04:43.060> is<00:04:43.180> still<00:04:43.419> really<00:04:43.780> good

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
capacity is still really good

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.990 
capacity is still really good
the<00:04:44.440> suspension<00:04:45.039> engineers<00:04:45.490> did<00:04:45.729> a<00:04:45.819> really

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
the suspension engineers did a really

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.330 
the suspension engineers did a really
good<00:04:46.240> job<00:04:46.479> balancing<00:04:46.810> this<00:04:47.409> car<00:04:47.680> so<00:04:48.159> it's

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
good job balancing this car so it's

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.950 
good job balancing this car so it's
still<00:04:48.520> fun<00:04:48.759> on<00:04:48.909> the<00:04:49.030> track<00:04:49.270> but<00:04:49.720> it's<00:04:49.840> not

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
still fun on the track but it's not

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.149 
still fun on the track but it's not

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
interior styling on the Challenger isn't

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.219 
interior styling on the Challenger isn't
nearly<00:04:57.009> as<00:04:57.159> dramatic<00:04:57.400> as<00:04:57.909> the<00:04:58.060> exterior<00:04:58.569> it's

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
nearly as dramatic as the exterior it's

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.100 
nearly as dramatic as the exterior it's
a<00:04:59.319> lot<00:04:59.530> more<00:04:59.740> conservative<00:05:00.599> however<00:05:01.599> the<00:05:01.960> good

and<00:05:08.710> all<00:05:08.949> the<00:05:09.039> controls<00:05:09.430> are<00:05:09.610> really<00:05:09.759> well

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
and all the controls are really well

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.570 
and all the controls are really well
placed<00:05:10.270> so<00:05:11.169> it's<00:05:11.349> not<00:05:11.470> real<00:05:11.650> exciting<00:05:12.220> inside

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
placed so it's not real exciting inside

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.730 
placed so it's not real exciting inside
but<00:05:13.090> it's<00:05:13.240> functional<00:05:13.840> and<00:05:13.960> it's<00:05:14.229> clean<00:05:14.500> and

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
but it's functional and it's clean and

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:26.029 
but it's functional and it's clean and
it<00:05:15.130> works

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.939 

so<00:05:26.580> what's<00:05:26.729> the<00:05:26.849> verdict<00:05:27.240> well<00:05:28.229> on<00:05:28.409> the<00:05:28.740> road

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
so what's the verdict well on the road

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.619 
so what's the verdict well on the road
or<00:05:29.189> on<00:05:29.249> the<00:05:29.550> track<00:05:29.729> the<00:05:30.150> Challenger<00:05:30.509> is<00:05:30.569> a

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:30.629 
or on the track the Challenger is a

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:31.850 
or on the track the Challenger is a
tough<00:05:30.900> act<00:05:31.139> to<00:05:31.199> follow

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
tough act to follow

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.339 
tough act to follow
now<00:05:32.490> it's<00:05:32.669> probably<00:05:33.270> not<00:05:33.569> going<00:05:33.809> to<00:05:33.930> sell<00:05:34.139> as

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
now it's probably not going to sell as

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:35.329 
now it's probably not going to sell as
well<00:05:34.559> as<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:34.860> Mustang

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:35.339 
well as the Mustang

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:37.129 
well as the Mustang
and<00:05:35.819> it's<00:05:36.180> probably<00:05:36.419> not<00:05:36.659> going<00:05:36.809> to<00:05:36.869> get<00:05:36.990> the

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
and it's probably not going to get the

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.079 
and it's probably not going to get the
kind<00:05:37.259> of<00:05:37.379> attention<00:05:37.649> that<00:05:38.069> the<00:05:38.430> Camaro<00:05:38.849> will

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:39.089 
kind of attention that the Camaro will

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.869 
kind of attention that the Camaro will
when<00:05:39.300> it<00:05:39.419> debuts<00:05:39.779> next<00:05:40.169> year<00:05:40.409> but<00:05:41.249> between<00:05:41.580> the
