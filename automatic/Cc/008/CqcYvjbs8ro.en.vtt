00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
was that we tend to think that this is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.819 
was that we tend to think that this is
the<00:01:22.700> destination<00:01:23.450> when<00:01:23.990> really<00:01:24.229> this<00:01:24.649> is<00:01:24.799> just

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
the destination when really this is just

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.149 
the destination when really this is just
the<00:01:25.130> journey
