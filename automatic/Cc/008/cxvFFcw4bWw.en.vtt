00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.599
 yes it will be fun working at the 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.190
 Traffic police so nice that there is one of those 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.400
 road users are then live 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.989
 want to enjoy yes and with that 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.340
 we don't just mean that 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:18.740
 look back when you are on your bike 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.880
 beyond our camera crew comes no 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.880
 by that we mean something else 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.920
 the car that drives by 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:34.429
 and then stop briefly and again later 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.659
 comes back and drives by again and again 

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:37.940
 coming back 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:40.579
 well that car so we had that day 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.499
 seen a few times and we started 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.350
 the suspicion that the 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:47.239
 driver was following us 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.760
 first you watch our camera car and 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.139
 there you have it again 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.639
 that can't be a coincidence than look 

00:00:54.139 --> 00:01:00.069
 what happens when we turn to 

00:00:55.639 --> 00:01:00.069
 turn right and then immediately turn 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.159
 dangerous 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.900
 as well at least the car hits 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.430
 behind us also look but look there 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.640
 he goes 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.100
 but will also turn it just like with it 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.570
 that is yes we stand on zopa crea that 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.380
 cantillon saw came to pass yes 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.660
 but also with the first there is a it 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.120
 stopped preparing aygo from that chicken 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.270
 I was that car behind us and yes now 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.530
 step that astra that isn't going there now 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.820
 also the reverse I have the idea that 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.360
 those behind our labor all the time as 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.360

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.740

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.290
