what<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.799> think<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:08.160> black<00:02:08.729> ops<00:02:08.910> 2<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:09.300> should

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
what I think in black ops 2 they should

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.530 
what I think in black ops 2 they should
have<00:02:09.660> ghost<00:02:09.959> they<00:02:10.259> definitely<00:02:10.530> should<00:02:10.739> have

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
have ghost they definitely should have

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.880 
have ghost they definitely should have
but<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.810> don't<00:02:13.200> think<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:14.790> ghosts<00:02:15.470> should<00:02:16.470> do

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
but I don't think that ghosts should do

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.350 
but I don't think that ghosts should do
all<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:17.250> stuff<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.579> it<00:02:17.849> does<00:02:18.030> because

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
all this stuff that it does because

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.929 
all this stuff that it does because
we've<00:02:18.540> seen<00:02:18.840> in<00:02:19.170> all<00:02:20.129> not<00:02:20.340> agree<00:02:20.549> with<00:02:20.579> you<00:02:20.790> in

previous games before mw2 mw2 is kind of

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.550 
previous games before mw2 mw2 is kind of
balance<00:02:51.389> because<00:02:51.659> stopping<00:02:51.900> power<00:02:52.200> was<00:02:52.409> in

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
there but before that camouflage and UAV

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.819 
there but before that camouflage and UAV
jammer<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.569> believe<00:02:57.930> where<00:02:58.170> they<00:02:58.319> call<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.620> duty

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
jammer I believe where they call of duty

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.979 
jammer I believe where they call of duty
4<00:02:58.859> and<00:02:59.280> or<00:02:59.700> it<00:03:00.120> was<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.359> call<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.659> duty<00:03:00.870> world

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
4 and or it was the call of duty world

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.809 
4 and or it was the call of duty world
at<00:03:01.139> war<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.500> they<00:03:01.590> call<00:03:01.799> of<00:03:01.920> duty<00:03:02.189> for<00:03:02.489> perks

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
at war and they call of duty for perks

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.349 
at war and they call of duty for perks
respectively<00:03:03.359> um<00:03:04.459> those<00:03:05.459> all<00:03:05.819> they<00:03:06.120> did<00:03:06.329> was

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
respectively um those all they did was

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.509 
respectively um those all they did was
protect<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:07.139> from<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.379> UAV<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.280> think

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
protect you from the UAV and I think

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.610 
protect you from the UAV and I think
that<00:03:08.639> Ghost<00:03:08.849> needs<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.239> go<00:03:09.450> back<00:03:09.689> to<00:03:10.260> being<00:03:10.500> the

powerful enough in itself but in these
past<00:03:35.819> few<00:03:36.060> games<00:03:36.239> what<00:03:36.540> they<00:03:36.659> have<00:03:36.840> done<00:03:36.870> is

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
useless in my opinion and I don't even

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.070 
useless in my opinion and I don't even
know<00:05:13.139> why<00:05:13.430> they<00:05:14.430> keep<00:05:14.820> them<00:05:15.090> just<00:05:15.930> because

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
know why they keep them just because

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.290 
know why they keep them just because
like<00:05:16.530> think<00:05:16.830> about<00:05:16.889> it<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.370> call<00:05:17.430> it<00:05:17.729> 84<00:05:18.180> if

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
like think about it and call it 84 if

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.700 
like think about it and call it 84 if

you've got a helicopter you were

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.800 
you've got a helicopter you were
guaranteed<00:05:20.220> a<00:05:20.370> few<00:05:20.580> kills<00:05:20.850> here<00:05:21.389> and<00:05:21.570> there

guaranteed a few kills here and there

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.780 
guaranteed a few kills here and there
and<00:05:22.050> people<00:05:22.740> if<00:05:23.070> they<00:05:23.190> wanted<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:23.460> shoot<00:05:23.610> down

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
and people if they wanted to shoot down

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.070 
and people if they wanted to shoot down

their<00:05:25.350> guns<00:05:25.590> or<00:05:25.860> they<00:05:26.430> had<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.729> take<00:05:26.910> that<00:05:27.300> long

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889

their guns or they had to take that long
RPG<00:05:28.889> and<00:05:29.130> shoot<00:05:29.550> it<00:05:29.610> up<00:05:29.729> and<00:05:29.910> hope<00:05:30.060> that<00:05:30.090> it

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
RPG and shoot it up and hope that it

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.870 
RPG and shoot it up and hope that it
didn't<00:05:30.780> go<00:05:31.200> way<00:05:31.440> off<00:05:31.470> into<00:05:32.010> China<00:05:32.310> and<00:05:32.610> it

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
didn't go way off into China and it

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.159 
didn't go way off into China and it
actually<00:05:33.030> hit<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:33.479> helicopter<00:05:33.630> you<00:05:34.050> know<00:05:34.140> I

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
actually hit the helicopter you know I

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.440 
actually hit the helicopter you know I
mean<00:05:34.440> so<00:05:35.070> I<00:05:35.340> think<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:35.880> they<00:05:36.030> should<00:05:36.060> go<00:05:36.330> back

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
mean so I think that they should go back

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.060 
mean so I think that they should go back
to<00:05:36.600> that<00:05:36.750> because<00:05:36.960> it<00:05:37.260> is<00:05:37.470> so<00:05:37.740> frustrating

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
to that because it is so frustrating

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.159 
to that because it is so frustrating
when<00:05:38.550> i<00:05:38.610> get<00:05:38.820> an<00:05:38.910> osprey<00:05:39.450> gunner<00:05:39.660> then<00:05:40.140> I

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
when i get an osprey gunner then I

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.779 
when i get an osprey gunner then I
worked<00:05:40.530> hard<00:05:40.800> for<00:05:41.070> and<00:05:41.280> it<00:05:41.370> gets<00:05:41.490> shot<00:05:41.760> down

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
worked hard for and it gets shot down

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.909 
worked hard for and it gets shot down
within<00:05:42.720> three<00:05:43.080> seconds<00:05:43.380> of<00:05:43.500> being<00:05:43.590> up<00:05:43.770> and<00:05:43.890> I

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
within three seconds of being up and I

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.440 
within three seconds of being up and I
don't<00:05:43.979> even<00:05:44.190> get<00:05:44.370> to<00:05:44.430> kill<00:05:44.669> with<00:05:44.850> it<00:05:44.970> maybe<00:05:45.150> one

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
don't even get to kill with it maybe one

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.909 
don't even get to kill with it maybe one
kill<00:05:45.690> possibly<00:05:46.169> I<00:05:46.200> don't<00:05:46.260> even<00:05:46.470> get<00:05:46.620> to<00:05:46.680> drop

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
kill possibly I don't even get to drop

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.890 
kill possibly I don't even get to drop
my<00:05:47.039> packages<00:05:47.580> I<00:05:47.789> think<00:05:48.510> that<00:05:48.720> is<00:05:48.870> a

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
my packages I think that is a

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.230 
my packages I think that is a
frustrating<00:05:49.140> thing<00:05:49.580> and<00:05:50.580> I<00:05:50.700> think<00:05:51.090> that

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
frustrating thing and I think that

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.060 
frustrating thing and I think that
rocket<00:05:51.900> launchers<00:05:52.200> have<00:05:52.350> really<00:05:52.680> rendered

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
rocket launchers have really rendered

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.640 
rocket launchers have really rendered
things<00:05:53.340> useless<00:05:54.120> in<00:05:54.270> my<00:05:54.389> opinion<00:05:54.690> so<00:05:54.960> I<00:05:55.169> think

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
things useless in my opinion so I think

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.200 
things useless in my opinion so I think
that<00:05:56.100> they<00:05:56.430> should<00:05:56.460> go<00:05:56.700> back<00:05:56.820> to<00:05:56.880> the<00:05:57.090> way

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
that they should go back to the way

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.110 
that they should go back to the way
wasn't<00:05:57.510> cod4<00:05:58.169> end<00:05:58.530> world<00:05:59.400> war<00:05:59.550> because<00:06:00.030> you

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
wasn't cod4 end world war because you

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.150 
wasn't cod4 end world war because you
couldn't<00:06:00.330> shoot<00:06:00.539> down<00:06:00.690> the<00:06:00.840> dogs<00:06:01.020> either<00:06:01.260> um

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
couldn't shoot down the dogs either um

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.710 
couldn't shoot down the dogs either um
but<00:06:02.580> they<00:06:02.729> shouldn't<00:06:02.970> have<00:06:03.240> locking<00:06:03.510> them

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
but they shouldn't have locking them

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.029 
but they shouldn't have locking them
launchers<00:06:04.080> like<00:06:04.229> that<00:06:04.410> and<00:06:04.530> if<00:06:04.650> they<00:06:04.770> do<00:06:04.830> they

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
launchers like that and if they do they

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:06.920 
launchers like that and if they do they
need<00:06:05.160> to<00:06:05.220> make<00:06:05.370> them<00:06:05.520> weaker<00:06:05.850> because<00:06:06.240> when

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
need to make them weaker because when

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.150 
need to make them weaker because when
somebody<00:06:07.200> earns<00:06:07.410> a<00:06:07.470> kill<00:06:07.650> streak<00:06:07.740> I<00:06:07.979> think

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
somebody earns a kill streak I think

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.890 
somebody earns a kill streak I think
that<00:06:08.280> it<00:06:08.400> deserves<00:06:08.940> to<00:06:09.060> stay<00:06:09.180> up<00:06:09.450> for<00:06:09.660> at<00:06:09.750> least

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
that it deserves to stay up for at least

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.050 
that it deserves to stay up for at least
a<00:06:10.139> little<00:06:10.320> while<00:06:10.440> and<00:06:10.950> should<00:06:11.520> not<00:06:11.610> be<00:06:11.669> able<00:06:11.880> to

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
a little while and should not be able to

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.420 
a little while and should not be able to
be<00:06:12.180> shot<00:06:12.419> down<00:06:12.600> right<00:06:12.840> away<00:06:12.960> I<00:06:13.320> don't<00:06:13.830> know<00:06:13.919> but

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
be shot down right away I don't know but

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.500 
be shot down right away I don't know but
definitely<00:06:14.850> tell<00:06:15.030> me<00:06:15.090> what<00:06:15.240> you<00:06:15.330> guys<00:06:15.450> think

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
that last thing I wanted to touch on was

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.670 
that last thing I wanted to touch on was
weaponry<00:06:17.789> skins<00:06:18.360> everybody<00:06:19.229> always<00:06:19.410> talks

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
weaponry skins everybody always talks

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.469 
weaponry skins everybody always talks
about<00:06:19.860> downloadable<00:06:20.639> weapon<00:06:20.940> content<00:06:21.360> and

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
about downloadable weapon content and

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:22.580 
about downloadable weapon content and

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
then you hear the people talking about

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.350 
then you hear the people talking about
well<00:06:23.070> it<00:06:23.160> will<00:06:23.220> be<00:06:23.340> overpowered<00:06:23.940> the<00:06:24.090> people

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
well it will be overpowered the people

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.730 
well it will be overpowered the people
who<00:06:24.450> have<00:06:24.660> it<00:06:24.840> would<00:06:24.960> have<00:06:25.110> better<00:06:25.320> go<00:06:25.530> to<00:06:25.590> the

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
who have it would have better go to the

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.110 
who have it would have better go to the
people<00:06:26.010> who<00:06:26.100> didn't<00:06:26.400> have<00:06:26.550> it<00:06:26.729> stuff<00:06:26.970> like

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
people who didn't have it stuff like

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.690 
people who didn't have it stuff like
that<00:06:27.150> well<00:06:27.780> my<00:06:27.960> idea<00:06:28.110> is<00:06:28.320> man<00:06:29.190> I<00:06:29.220> always<00:06:29.460> bring

that well my idea is man I always bring
this<00:06:29.820> up<00:06:30.000> and<00:06:30.120> there's<00:06:30.270> never<00:06:30.450> enough<00:06:30.840> time<00:06:30.900> to
