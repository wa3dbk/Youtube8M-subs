end of the game you're risking going out
by<00:01:42.659> taking<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.170> bag<00:01:43.439> never<00:01:44.340> never<00:01:44.700> never<00:01:44.850> push

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420

the<00:01:45.630> bid<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.990> 13<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.619> fourth<00:01:46.829> seat<00:01:47.070> unless<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
the bid to 13 and fourth seat unless the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.030 
the bid to 13 and fourth seat unless the
score<00:01:47.880> clearly<00:01:48.450> dictates<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
score clearly dictates that and the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.160 
score clearly dictates that and the
reason<00:01:50.340> for<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.820> your<00:01:51.509> partner<00:01:51.899> has<00:01:52.020> put

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
reason for that is your partner has put

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.499 
reason for that is your partner has put
up<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.380> big<00:01:52.560> old<00:01:52.770> 5<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.939> had<00:01:54.180> all<00:01:54.329> those

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
up a big old 5 if you had all those

up a big old 5 if you had all those

by<00:01:58.259> some<00:01:58.320> chance<00:01:58.590> somebody<00:01:59.130> comes<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.670> and

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
by some chance somebody comes in and

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.060 
by some chance somebody comes in and
trumps<00:02:00.090> one<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.390> his<00:02:00.540> 5<00:02:00.780> tricks<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.890> only

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
trumps one of his 5 tricks and you only

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.859 
trumps one of his 5 tricks and you only
have<00:02:02.340> four<00:02:02.670> you're<00:02:03.240> not<00:02:03.390> gonna<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.659> able<00:02:03.750> to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
have four you're not gonna be able to

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.270 
have four you're not gonna be able to
pick<00:02:04.049> him<00:02:04.259> up<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.860> already<00:02:05.009> been

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
pick him up because you already been

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.280 
pick him up because you already been
before<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.880> expected<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.479> take<00:02:06.689> so

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
before that you expected to take so

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.460 
before that you expected to take so
again<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.869> game<00:02:10.080> really<00:02:10.619> clearly<00:02:11.150> focuses<00:02:12.150> on

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
again the game really clearly focuses on

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.150 
again the game really clearly focuses on
avoiding<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
avoiding the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.790 
avoiding the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
sets in the impact of being set so

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.820 
sets in the impact of being set so
safety<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.820> contracts<00:02:18.390> safety<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.440> bidding

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
safety and contracts safety and bidding

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.590 
safety and contracts safety and bidding
and<00:02:20.040> particularly<00:02:21.000> when<00:02:21.270> you're<00:02:21.390> bidding

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
and particularly when you're bidding

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.550 
and particularly when you're bidding
numerical<00:02:22.290> bids<00:02:23.750> remember<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.840> average<00:02:25.020> bit

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
numerical bids remember the average bit

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.580 
numerical bids remember the average bit
of<00:02:25.710> a<00:02:25.800> hand<00:02:26.070> is<00:02:26.190> 11<00:02:26.700> tricks<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:28.320> when<00:02:28.470> you

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
of a hand is 11 tricks and so when you

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.350 
of a hand is 11 tricks and so when you
start<00:02:28.650> pushing<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.490> 12<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.120> start

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
start pushing it to 12 and you start

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.780 
start pushing it to 12 and you start
pushing<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.930> 13<00:02:31.410> then<00:02:31.950> you're<00:02:32.160> taking<00:02:32.340> full

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
pushing it to 13 then you're taking full

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.190 
pushing it to 13 then you're taking full
responsibility<00:02:32.840> you're<00:02:33.840> telling<00:02:34.110> your

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
responsibility you're telling your

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.800 
responsibility you're telling your
partner<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.830> probably<00:02:35.430> have<00:02:35.700> two<00:02:35.910> extra<00:02:36.210> tricks

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
partner I probably have two extra tricks

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.870 
partner I probably have two extra tricks
so<00:02:37.200> again<00:02:37.800> bid<00:02:38.460> slightly<00:02:39.180> conservatively
