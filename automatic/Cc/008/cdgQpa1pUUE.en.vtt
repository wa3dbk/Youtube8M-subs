[wind chimes clinking]

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
[mellow music]

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:16.208
Nathaniel: Good morning, Steve

00:00:16.208 --> 00:00:17.708
Steve: Hey, Nathaniel. How are you?

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.458
[electronic beeping]

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:24.666
[electronic voice] Auto driving.

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.208
Nathaniel: Here we go.
Steve: Away we go.

00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:29.083
[chuckles]

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:35.083
Steve: Look, Ma, no hands.

00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:36.708
Nathaniel: [laughs] No hands anywhere.

00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:38.083
Steve: No hands, no feet.

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:40.583
Nathaniel: No hands, no feet, no nothing.

00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:42.125
Steve: I love it.

00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:45.625
So we're here at the stop sign.

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:46.750
Nathaniel: Yep.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.333
Car's using the radars and laser to check and make sure

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.250
there's nothing coming either way.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.250
Steve: I find myself looking.[laughs]

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.666
Nathaniel: Old habits die hard, man.

00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.375
Steve: Hey, they don't die.

00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:58.875
Hey, anybody up for a taco?

00:00:58.875 --> 00:00:59.916
Nathaniel: Yeah, yeah.

00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:01.416
What do you want to do today, Steve?

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:03.291
Steve: I'm all for Taco Bell, myself.

00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:05.625
Nathaniel: All right, well, let's go get a taco at the drive-thru.

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:11.625
Steve: And we're turning into the parking lot.

00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:12.916
Nathaniel: Yeah.

00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:13.833
Steve: How neat.

00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:17.000
Nathaniel: There we go. Now we kind of creep along here.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.541
Nathaniel: Does anybody have any money? 
Steve: I've got money.

00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:20.583
Nathaniel: No, I've got my wallet right here.

00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:22.541
If you roll down your window and order a burrito.

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:24.000
Yeah, push that.
How are you doing today?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.166
Steve: I'm doing very well. How are you today?

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.375
Good. Thank you.

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.916
Steve: This is some of the best driving I've ever done.

00:01:33.916 --> 00:01:36.750
[laughs]

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.750
[mellow music]

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:54.792
95% of my vision is gone.

00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:58.166
I'm well past legally blind.

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:02.708
You lose your timing in life.

00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:04.916
Everything takes you much longer.

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:07.333
There are some places that you cannot go.

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.958
There are some things that you really cannot do.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.875
Where this would change my life

00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:20.666
is to give me the independence and the flexibility

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:25.875
to go the placesI both want to go and need to go

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:29.458
when I need to do those things.

00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:45.416
You guys get out.

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:46.750
I've got places I have to go.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.125
[laughs] Bye, now.

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:50.250
Hey, it's been nice, you know.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.541
It's been nice.
