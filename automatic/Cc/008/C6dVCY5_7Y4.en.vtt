00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.679 
know obviously it's an antec skeleton
case<00:01:31.700> what<00:01:32.700> really<00:01:32.939> attracted<00:01:33.240> me<00:01:33.299> about<00:01:33.540> this

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
case what really attracted me about this

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.569 
case what really attracted me about this
case<00:01:33.930> was<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.590> different<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.280> mean

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
case was that it's different I mean

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.240 
case was that it's different I mean
obviously<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.150> tell<00:01:36.299> there's<00:01:36.570> no<00:01:36.689> walls

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
obviously you can tell there's no walls

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
obviously you can tell there's no walls
there's<00:01:38.250> nothing<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.790> see<00:01:38.909> everything

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
there's nothing you can see everything

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.510 
there's nothing you can see everything
in<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:40.350> big<00:01:40.500> thing<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.710> I'm<00:01:41.070> huge<00:01:41.340> on

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
in it the big thing is I'm huge on

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.510 
in it the big thing is I'm huge on
overclocking<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:44.009> keeps<00:01:44.250> everything

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
overclocking so this keeps everything

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.450 
overclocking so this keeps everything
cooler<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.509> we'll<00:01:45.990> start<00:01:46.200> from<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> top<00:01:46.590> huge

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
cooler but we'll start from the top huge

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.700 
cooler but we'll start from the top huge
fan<00:01:47.759> if<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.390> could<00:01:48.540> see<00:01:48.720> here<00:01:48.990> I'll<00:01:49.380> put<00:01:49.560> my

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
fan if you could see here I'll put my

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.990 
fan if you could see here I'll put my
hand<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.250> guys<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.579> kind<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.820> see

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
hand on it so you guys can kind of see

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.240 
hand on it so you guys can kind of see
just<00:01:51.210> exactly<00:01:51.299> how<00:01:51.689> big<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.320> believe

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
just exactly how big it is I believe

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.530 
just exactly how big it is I believe
it's<00:01:53.460> either<00:01:53.549> 8<00:01:53.820> inches<00:01:54.090> or<00:01:54.240> eight<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.479> half

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
it's either 8 inches or eight and a half

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.440 
it's either 8 inches or eight and a half
inches<00:01:54.840> across<00:01:55.700> that<00:01:56.700> those<00:01:57.030> lights<00:01:57.270> will

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
inches across that those lights will

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.609 
inches across that those lights will
change<00:01:57.689> colors<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.200> see<00:01:58.350> it's<00:01:58.439> kind<00:01:58.590> of

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
change colors you can see it's kind of

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.230 
change colors you can see it's kind of
changing<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.950> green<00:01:59.250> goes<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.729> read<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.119> all

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
changing the green goes to read and all

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.499 
changing the green goes to read and all
that<00:02:00.390> good<00:02:00.509> stuff<00:02:01.579> there<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.670> go<00:02:02.790> there's<00:02:03.210> red

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
that good stuff there you go there's red

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.560 
that good stuff there you go there's red
and<00:02:03.890> will<00:02:04.890> kind<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.159> work<00:02:05.520> our<00:02:05.700> way<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.479> a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
and will kind of work our way in it's a

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.880 
and will kind of work our way in it's a
silver<00:02:06.899> color<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.200> know<00:02:07.350> it's<00:02:07.500> not<00:02:07.649> actually

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
silver color I know it's not actually

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.040 
silver color I know it's not actually
got<00:02:08.069> really<00:02:08.250> see<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:08.879> it's<00:02:09.450> easier<00:02:09.780> for<00:02:09.810> me<00:02:10.020> to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
got really see but it's easier for me to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.900 
got really see but it's easier for me to
show<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.319> everything<00:02:10.590> those<00:02:11.520> right<00:02:11.849> there

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
show you everything those right there

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.520 
show you everything those right there
are<00:02:12.390> two<00:02:12.720> video<00:02:12.989> cards

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
are two video cards

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.120 
are two video cards
those<00:02:13.650> are<00:02:13.920> radiant<00:02:14.400> radeon<00:02:15.240> are<00:02:15.709> 48<00:02:16.709> 30s

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
those are radiant radeon are 48 30s

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.280 
those are radiant radeon are 48 30s
they're<00:02:17.790> running<00:02:18.090> on<00:02:18.180> crossfire<00:02:18.750> what<00:02:19.170> that

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
they're running on crossfire what that

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.660 
they're running on crossfire what that
basically<00:02:19.319> means<00:02:19.740> is<00:02:20.069> that<00:02:20.130> they're<00:02:20.400> working

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
basically means is that they're working

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.000 
basically means is that they're working
together<00:02:20.790> as<00:02:21.209> one<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.770> makes<00:02:22.890> a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
together as one so that it makes a

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.830 
together as one so that it makes a
really<00:02:23.040> really<00:02:23.490> nice<00:02:23.730> video<00:02:24.420> card<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:24.810> that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
really really nice video card so that

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.320 
really really nice video card so that
way<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.110> could<00:02:25.260> play<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:26.490> modern<00:02:26.790> warfare<00:02:26.940> 2

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
way I could play like modern warfare 2

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.050 
way I could play like modern warfare 2
cranked<00:02:27.959> up<00:02:28.050> all<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.380> way<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.760> not<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:29.910> any

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
lag at all but those are the video cards

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.360 
lag at all but those are the video cards
and<00:02:32.760> if<00:02:33.660> we<00:02:33.750> kind<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:33.959> go<00:02:34.050> on<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.319> side<00:02:34.590> that

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
and if we kind of go on this side that

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
fan that you see right there is the cpu

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.240 
fan that you see right there is the cpu
its<00:02:38.910> quad<00:02:39.420> core<00:02:39.690> pentium<00:02:39.959> i<00:02:40.319> believe<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.160> or

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
really good deal on this pin em so I

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.970 
really good deal on this pin em so I
want<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.930> head<00:02:46.050> with<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.530> been<00:02:46.800> pretty

right there my ram I have 12 gigs of RAM
right<00:02:52.560> now<00:02:52.680> that's<00:02:53.340> constantly<00:02:53.970> changing

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
right now that's constantly changing

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.810

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
back and forth but I need a lot of RAM

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.479 
back and forth but I need a lot of RAM
basically<00:02:57.660> for<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.500> know<00:02:58.590> video<00:02:58.739> editing<00:02:59.250> and

basically for you know video editing and
of<00:02:59.610> course<00:02:59.819> video<00:03:00.750> games<00:03:01.190> nothing<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.280> on<00:03:02.400> that

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
of course video games nothing I on that

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.559 
of course video games nothing I on that
then<00:03:04.620> let's<00:03:05.459> kind<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.730> take<00:03:06.269> a<00:03:06.300> look<00:03:06.450> around

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
then let's kind of take a look around

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.900 
then let's kind of take a look around
here<00:03:06.870> my<00:03:07.080> motherboard<00:03:07.650> has<00:03:07.680> all<00:03:07.950> these<00:03:08.100> cool

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
here my motherboard has all these cool

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.640 
here my motherboard has all these cool
lights<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.480> all<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.690> good<00:03:09.780> stuff<00:03:09.840> as<00:03:10.230> well<00:03:10.410> I

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
lights and all that good stuff as well I
