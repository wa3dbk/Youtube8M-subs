really<00:00:21.480> nice<00:00:22.310> if<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.460> was<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.699> get<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:23.880> Escape<00:00:24.150> is

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
really nice if I was to get in Escape is

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.359 
really nice if I was to get in Escape is
the<00:00:24.510> exact<00:00:24.990> way<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.260> would<00:00:25.470> get<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.189> same

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
the exact way I would get it the same

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.679 
the exact way I would get it the same
color<00:00:26.519> combinations<00:00:27.150> everything<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.599> really

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
color combinations everything I really

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.150 
color combinations everything I really
like<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.080> Chrome<00:00:28.380> right<00:00:28.410> there<00:00:28.769> -<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.010> looks

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
like that Chrome right there - it looks

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.980 
like that Chrome right there - it looks
pretty<00:00:29.310> good<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.750> just<00:00:30.779> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
pretty good but on this is just a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.049 
pretty good but on this is just a
front-wheel<00:00:31.320> drive<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.859> think<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:32.940> the

underfloor storage I was kind of an
afterthought<00:04:06.090> but<00:04:06.389> I<00:04:06.629> think<00:04:06.900> that's<00:04:07.019> only

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
afterthought but I think that's only

2013<00:04:07.709> only<00:04:08.359> so<00:04:09.359> back<00:04:09.629> here<00:04:09.659> your<00:04:10.530> materials<00:04:10.889> do

2013 only so back here your materials do

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.499 
2013 only so back here your materials do

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:12.509 
not follow through except this little

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:15.020 
not follow through except this little
portion<00:04:12.959> right<00:04:13.139> here<00:04:13.439> is<00:04:13.620> like<00:04:14.220> leather

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
portion right here is like leather

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.240 
portion right here is like leather
stitched<00:04:15.419> then<00:04:16.109> right<00:04:16.229> here<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.530> gap<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.949> not

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
stitched then right here the gap is not

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.599 
stitched then right here the gap is not
the<00:04:17.400> best<00:04:17.639> as<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.909> can<00:04:18.030> see<00:04:18.739> yeah<00:04:19.739> this<00:04:20.430> feels

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
the best as you can see yeah this feels

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.769 
the best as you can see yeah this feels
a<00:04:20.700> little<00:04:20.760> cheap<00:04:21.000> this<00:04:21.180> handle<00:04:21.450> I<00:04:21.539> always

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:21.779 
a little cheap this handle I always

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.450 
a little cheap this handle I always
thought<00:04:22.560> that<00:04:22.590> is<00:04:22.950> because<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.250> can<00:04:23.370> just

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
thought that is because you can just

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.460 
thought that is because you can just
kind<00:04:23.789> of<00:04:23.849> move<00:04:24.029> it<00:04:24.120> but<00:04:24.779> um

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
kind of move it but um

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.110 
kind of move it but um
