a<00:00:16.410> lot<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.619> threats<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.779> say<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.619> LMGs

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
a lot of threats that say that the LMGs

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.330 
a lot of threats that say that the LMGs
are<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.490> fact<00:00:20.730> broken<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.650> noticed<00:00:23.220> one

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
are in fact broken and I noticed one

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.570 
are in fact broken and I noticed one
thing<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.789> seems<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.359> be<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.660> very<00:00:25.580> consistent

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
thing that seems to be a very consistent

theme<00:00:27.029> with<00:00:27.359> these<00:00:27.539> LMG<00:00:27.930> users<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.529> is

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
theme with these LMG users and that is

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.009 
theme with these LMG users and that is
that<00:00:29.189> they're<00:00:29.369> talking<00:00:30.300> about<00:00:30.420> using<00:00:30.960> it

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
that they're talking about using it

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.830 
that they're talking about using it
while<00:00:31.560> prone<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.279> with<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> bipod<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.600> today

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
while prone and with a bipod so today

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.229 
while prone and with a bipod so today
we're<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> use<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.440> L<00:00:34.559> set<00:00:34.950> which<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.910> my

is<00:00:47.280> not<00:00:47.460> my<00:00:48.180> normal<00:00:48.239> setup<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.410> LMGs<00:00:50.039> usually

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
is not my normal setup for LMGs usually

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.160 
is not my normal setup for LMGs usually
I<00:00:50.460> use<00:00:51.739> usually<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.920> use<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.399> potato<00:00:54.090> or<00:00:54.570> stubby

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
I use usually I use a potato or stubby

we'll<00:00:59.789> take<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.030> look<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.329> bipod<00:01:00.600> problem

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
we'll take a look at the bipod problem

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.599 
we'll take a look at the bipod problem
here<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.770> I'm<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.039> deploy<00:01:02.280> into<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
here so I'm going to deploy into the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.149 
here so I'm going to deploy into the
test<00:01:02.789> range<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.270> I'm<00:01:04.110> gonna<00:01:04.290> run<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
test range and I'm gonna run up to

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.620 
test range and I'm gonna run up to
a<00:01:06.249> wall<00:01:06.909> so<00:01:07.119> that<00:01:07.149> we<00:01:07.299> have<00:01:07.450> some<00:01:07.600> consistency

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
a wall so that we have some consistency

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.169 
a wall so that we have some consistency
the<00:01:10.630> pack<00:01:10.960> here<00:01:11.289> said<00:01:11.560> reload<00:01:11.950> so<00:01:12.729> here's<00:01:13.060> the

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:13.179 
the pack here said reload so here's the

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:16.200 
the pack here said reload so here's the
problem<00:01:13.390> so<00:01:13.929> this<00:01:14.049> is<00:01:14.200> me<00:01:14.380> standing<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:15.210> I'm

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
problem so this is me standing and I'm

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.419 
problem so this is me standing and I'm
going<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.630> single<00:01:17.049> this<00:01:17.229> shot<00:01:17.560> then<00:01:17.799> burst<00:01:18.130> and

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
going to single this shot then burst and

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.099 
going to single this shot then burst and
then<00:01:18.520> full<00:01:18.909> auto<00:01:19.179> you<00:01:19.420> will<00:01:19.539> actually<00:01:19.659> see<00:01:19.929> the

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.109 
then full auto you will actually see the

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.800 
then full auto you will actually see the
this<00:01:20.380> is<00:01:20.560> without<00:01:20.850> cooldown<00:01:21.850> compensation<00:01:22.630> so

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
this is without cooldown compensation so

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.840 
this is without cooldown compensation so
you'll<00:01:22.959> see<00:01:23.079> what<00:01:23.200> happens<00:01:23.640> single<00:01:24.640> shot<00:01:24.819> you

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
you'll see what happens single shot you

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.599 
you'll see what happens single shot you
can<00:01:25.030> see<00:01:25.119> that<00:01:25.679> it<00:01:26.679> stays<00:01:27.009> right<00:01:27.280> on<00:01:27.429> target

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:27.609 
can see that it stays right on target

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.219 
can see that it stays right on target
with<00:01:27.849> the<00:01:27.939> green<00:01:28.149> laser<00:01:28.479> sight<00:01:28.810> right<00:01:29.020> in<00:01:29.140> the

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
with the green laser sight right in the

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.349 
with the green laser sight right in the
dead<00:01:29.469> center<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:30.069> copra<00:01:30.369> sight<00:01:30.549> you<00:01:31.119> can<00:01:31.179> see

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
dead center the copra sight you can see

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:32.940 
dead center the copra sight you can see
everything<00:01:31.659> is<00:01:31.719> right<00:01:31.929> in<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.079> middle<00:01:32.259> lined

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
everything is right in the middle lined

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.520 
everything is right in the middle lined
up<00:01:33.159> just<00:01:33.399> perfectly<00:01:33.759> this<00:01:34.060> is<00:01:34.240> birthday<00:01:37.530> you

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
up just perfectly this is birthday you

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.619 
up just perfectly this is birthday you
can<00:01:38.619> see<00:01:38.770> it<00:01:38.860> creates<00:01:39.189> kind<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:39.459> this<00:01:39.670> pattern

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:40.629 
can see it creates kind of this pattern

00:01:40.629 --> 00:01:41.969 
can see it creates kind of this pattern
that<00:01:40.750> looks<00:01:41.079> kind<00:01:41.379> of<00:01:41.409> like<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.679> state<00:01:41.890> of

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
that looks kind of like the state of

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.969 
that looks kind of like the state of
Texas<00:01:42.369> or<00:01:42.610> Ohio<00:01:43.229> maybe<00:01:44.229> a<00:01:44.319> little<00:01:44.530> bit<00:01:44.619> of<00:01:44.709> a<00:01:44.799> V

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
Texas or Ohio maybe a little bit of a V

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.469 
Texas or Ohio maybe a little bit of a V
just<00:01:45.369> because<00:01:45.549> of<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:45.729> horizontal<00:01:46.329> recoil

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
just because of that horizontal recoil

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.069 
just because of that horizontal recoil
this<00:01:47.259> is<00:01:47.439> it<00:01:47.560> full<00:01:47.770> auto<00:01:48.509> pay<00:01:49.509> attention<00:01:49.869> to

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
this is it full auto pay attention to

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.660 
this is it full auto pay attention to
where<00:01:50.319> the<00:01:50.349> tracers<00:01:50.920> are<00:01:51.069> going<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.520> can

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
where the tracers are going you can

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.209 
where the tracers are going you can
actually<00:01:51.759> see<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.149> tracers<00:01:52.539> in<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:52.750> air

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
actually see the tracers in the air

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.380 
actually see the tracers in the air
perfectly<00:01:54.219> there<00:01:54.399> you<00:01:54.610> can<00:01:54.759> see<00:01:54.969> that<00:01:55.000> it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
perfectly there you can see that it

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.490 
perfectly there you can see that it
follows<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.860> site<00:01:57.129> and<00:01:57.929> how<00:01:58.929> the<00:01:58.989> site<00:01:59.289> moves

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
follows the site and how the site moves

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.719 
follows the site and how the site moves
you<00:01:59.709> can<00:01:59.829> see<00:01:59.979> that<00:02:00.129> the<00:02:00.250> copper<00:02:00.459> site<00:02:00.609> is

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
you can see that the copper site is

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.809 
you can see that the copper site is
swaying<00:02:01.030> back<00:02:01.179> and<00:02:01.239> forth<00:02:01.450> left<00:02:02.379> and<00:02:02.560> right<00:02:02.819> in

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
swaying back and forth left and right in

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.529 
swaying back and forth left and right in
this<00:02:04.030> zigzag<00:02:04.899> pattern<00:02:05.500> which<00:02:05.769> is<00:02:06.539> basically

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
this zigzag pattern which is basically

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:08.759 
this zigzag pattern which is basically
how<00:02:07.689> it's<00:02:07.840> supposed<00:02:08.109> to<00:02:08.200> do<00:02:08.289> it's<00:02:08.410> nice<00:02:08.560> and

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
how it's supposed to do it's nice and

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.460 
how it's supposed to do it's nice and
even<00:02:09.299> this<00:02:10.299> is<00:02:10.539> follow<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.899> patient<00:02:11.079> you<00:02:11.319> can

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
even this is follow the patient you can

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.720 
even this is follow the patient you can
see<00:02:11.560> that<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.829> boys<00:02:12.040> are<00:02:12.280> going<00:02:12.430> exactly

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
see that the boys are going exactly

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.690 
see that the boys are going exactly
where<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.480> paper<00:02:13.720> site

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.760 

so<00:02:18.700> that's<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.150> standing<00:02:20.400> no<00:02:21.400> compensation

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
so that's it standing no compensation

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.920 
so that's it standing no compensation
move<00:02:23.770> over<00:02:23.860> slightly<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.550> left<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.600> then

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
move over slightly to the left and then

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.330 
move over slightly to the left and then
I'm<00:02:26.050> going<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.320> do<00:02:26.380> some<00:02:26.530> compensation<00:02:26.830> here

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
I'm going to do some compensation here

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.240 
I'm going to do some compensation here
now<00:02:27.490> so<00:02:28.000> this<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.210> with<00:02:28.420> some<00:02:28.600> pulldown<00:02:29.250> single

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
now so this is with some pulldown single

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.229 
now so this is with some pulldown single
shot<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.430> course<00:02:30.700> don't<00:02:30.880> need<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.090> pull<00:02:31.240> down

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.789 

see<00:02:37.239> boards<00:02:37.540> hitting<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.959> same<00:02:38.290> place<00:02:38.530> same

significant<00:02:46.269> amount<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.689> horizontal<00:02:46.900> recoil

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
significant amount of horizontal recoil

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.319 
significant amount of horizontal recoil
there<00:02:47.799> with<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.219> full<00:02:48.459> auto<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:48.790> see<00:02:49.209> the

there with the full auto I see the

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.089 
there with the full auto I see the
spread<00:02:49.569> increases<00:02:50.049> but<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.769> thing<00:02:51.069> that

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
spread increases but the thing that

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.170 
spread increases but the thing that

and<00:04:16.590> all<00:04:16.680> up<00:04:16.950> you<00:04:17.280> can<00:04:17.400> see<00:04:17.549> there<00:04:17.729> they'll<00:04:17.940> be

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
and all up you can see there they'll be

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.599 
and all up you can see there they'll be
follow<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.959> tracers<00:04:19.320> like<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:19.560> said<00:04:19.769> earlier

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
follow the tracers like I said earlier

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.099 
follow the tracers like I said earlier
in<00:04:20.789> the<00:04:20.910> example<00:04:21.479> here<00:04:21.600> on<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.780> far<00:04:21.930> right

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
in the example here on the far right

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.779 
in the example here on the far right
follow<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.500> tracers<00:04:22.860> you'll<00:04:23.340> see<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:23.669> the

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
follow the tracers you'll see that the

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.000 
follow the tracers you'll see that the
bullets<00:04:24.120> themselves<00:04:24.710> travel<00:04:25.710> right<00:04:25.979> through

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
bullets themselves travel right through

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.529 
bullets themselves travel right through
this<00:04:26.310> hole<00:04:26.490> that's<00:04:26.700> been<00:04:26.850> made<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.270> they

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
this hole that's been made and they

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.650 
this hole that's been made and they
don't<00:04:27.720> actually<00:04:27.870> follow<00:04:28.350> where<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:30.360> Cobra

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
don't actually follow where the Cobra

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.409 
don't actually follow where the Cobra
site<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:30.990> is<00:04:31.440> swaying<00:04:31.830> left<00:04:32.010> or<00:04:32.190> right<00:04:32.419> here's

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
site is is swaying left or right here's

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.290 
site is is swaying left or right here's
a<00:04:33.479> full<00:04:33.660> mag<00:04:33.810> dump

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.750 

for<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:37.930> problem<00:04:38.380> with<00:04:38.470> this<00:04:38.740> is<00:04:39.490> that<00:04:39.550> if

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
for the problem with this is that if

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.030 
for the problem with this is that if
your<00:04:39.940> normal<00:04:40.300> player<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:41.290> we're<00:04:41.590> tracking<00:04:41.800> a

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
your normal player and we're tracking a

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.790 
your normal player and we're tracking a
target<00:04:42.490> when<00:04:43.240> you<00:04:43.390> are<00:04:43.600> thrown<00:04:44.230> and<00:04:44.560> with<00:04:44.710> the

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
target when you are thrown and with the

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.400 
target when you are thrown and with the
bipod<00:04:45.190> down<00:04:45.490> your<00:04:46.240> sights<00:04:46.570> not<00:04:46.900> actually

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
bipod down your sights not actually

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.020 
bipod down your sights not actually
telling<00:04:47.680> me<00:04:47.770> where<00:04:48.430> your<00:04:48.670> gun<00:04:48.850> is<00:04:49.000> shooting

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
telling me where your gun is shooting

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.110 
telling me where your gun is shooting
and<00:04:49.630> that's<00:04:50.080> a<00:04:50.200> big<00:04:50.620> big<00:04:50.980> problem<00:04:51.120> that's

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
and that's a big big problem that's

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.400 
and that's a big big problem that's
something<00:04:52.420> I<00:04:52.480> didn't<00:04:52.690> notice<00:04:52.930> because<00:04:53.050> like<00:04:53.320> I

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
something I didn't notice because like I

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.690 
something I didn't notice because like I
said<00:04:53.590> before<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:54.100> beginning<00:04:54.220> I'm<00:04:54.520> not

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
said before the beginning I'm not

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.120 
said before the beginning I'm not
normally<00:04:55.090> a<00:04:55.120> bipod<00:04:55.930> user<00:04:56.140> I<00:04:56.470> usually<00:04:56.980> use<00:04:57.100> a

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
normally a bipod user I usually use a

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.800 
normally a bipod user I usually use a
stubby<00:04:57.670> grip<00:04:57.760> or<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.990> potato<00:04:59.290> pivot<00:04:59.710> and<00:05:00.010> so

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
stubby grip or the potato pivot and so

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.900 
stubby grip or the potato pivot and so
there<00:05:01.810> is<00:05:01.930> indeed<00:05:02.140> an<00:05:03.010> issue<00:05:03.250> with<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.670> LMGs

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
there is indeed an issue with the LMGs

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.890 
there is indeed an issue with the LMGs
with<00:05:06.910> a<00:05:07.180> lot<00:05:07.360> of<00:05:07.570> my<00:05:07.810> fellow<00:05:08.170> for<00:05:08.590> mobility

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.670 

the<00:05:11.710> hypotenuse<00:05:12.580> effects<00:05:13.140> because<00:05:14.140> it's<00:05:14.440> not

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
the hypotenuse effects because it's not

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.430 
the hypotenuse effects because it's not
accurate<00:05:14.950> it's<00:05:15.340> not<00:05:15.610> doing<00:05:16.030> it<00:05:16.210> it's<00:05:17.200> not

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
accurate it's not doing it it's not

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.020 
accurate it's not doing it it's not
showing<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:18.130> you<00:05:18.220> what<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.460> game<00:05:18.610> is<00:05:18.790> actually

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
showing to you what the game is actually

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.150 
showing to you what the game is actually
doing<00:05:19.540> so<00:05:19.750> it's<00:05:19.900> not<00:05:20.020> translating<00:05:20.620> correctly

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
doing so it's not translating correctly

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.750 
doing so it's not translating correctly
into<00:05:21.790> what<00:05:22.000> should<00:05:22.300> be<00:05:22.450> getting
