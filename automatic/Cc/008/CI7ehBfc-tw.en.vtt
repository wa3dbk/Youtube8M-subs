00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.069
 or the people of youtube here is how they 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.100
 I say what is the little market 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.849
 healthy and novice 1 2 3 and we're in 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.120
 the new project of looking for an old cpu 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.990
 to do the installation of linux well 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.170
 that we go here put put to look for 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.900
 ssp lost since those are the famous ones 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.390
 little markets that are here in Monterrey and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.440
 Well you do not know it, you already are 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.390
 watching now 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.020
 just as I say, you have to be 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.020
 searching 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.690
 I will also be doing some 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.580
 short to be able this so that it does not 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.360
 make the video very long and thus be able to 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:50.750
 do the compilation of this one to see 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:55.040
 if we can find the cpu to do the 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.980
 basic installation of good linux 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.170
 let us begin 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.700
 you see here there are certain teaspoons 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.700
 shoes clothing 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.830
 We are also looking for what is 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:16.740
 so I'll cut back and now 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:20.670
 with 23 good looking that we have 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.640
 mother card cards 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.030
 in this case if they are a driver they are a 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.030
 little bit 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.740
 many are 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.080
 where they are all unarmed but I do not know 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.720
 Yes, it is very new, what we are 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.430
 looking is an old game but let's go 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.830
 to ask the price as you want 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.830
 this is the good card but 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.060
 it's always the lid 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.800
 I did not want there are other cards but 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.070
 I also do not know 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.060
 having good function and the card is 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.060
 is in 4 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.520
 it would be good to use what is the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.520
 yoyo that the cabinet but to form we are 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.180
 looking for a full old cpu so 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.180
 I'm going to cut 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.400
 we are not knowing each other rather I want 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.930
 a store that wants me to resign 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.640
 sorry 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.640
 Be careful, have the laptop with me 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:51.830
 and 2 727 thousand eight 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.830
 in 1700 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.890
 will stand the windows 8 is or not 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:08.800
 but he does not have the disc I know I do not know 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.800
 the desert is maintained 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.799
 if not 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.800
 you know thank you 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.350
 and here we are still not found 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.350
 our old cpu that we are looking for 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.040
 equally we all lack a good stretch 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.970
 to go but also we have not 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.870
 found nothing as we want we are 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.870
 with everything 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:46.370
 we continue as soon as they have them when 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:49.250
 they have the first 1800 the first 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.000
 and there is the one lying down 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.890
 thousand pesos on the monitor 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.890
 so the pure cpu you do not sell it 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.210
 they would not know the requirements that the 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.030
 net 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.390
 if this would not be an old cpu like 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.390
 who says 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:16.430
 exists I do not think I'll hold a windows 8 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:19.359
 if he left 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.359
 d 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.830
 windows 7 you are 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:36.060
 if we're looking for an old man you see 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:39.889
 like a little more better a little bit 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.889
 more medium a recent bar 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:47.880
 I do not know if we can check back we're going to 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.880
 check the two 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:05:00.110
 I do not think this would occur as a 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:05.800
 21-4 and we adjust one more old man to 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.800
 our our linux project 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.169
 I believe that 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.500
 let's fail in this first chapter 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:18.470
 of the project reads us looking for a pc 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.310
 old and since it is so if it would be one more 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.610
 recent 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.610
 but also 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.110
 we are looking for but I think it 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.110
 we finally see 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.050
 the other gesture would be the least 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.020
 Where is 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.780
 ah 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.750
 how much you have to use windows 8 and 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:54.640
 all this I do not know if the endurance or the 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.640
 supports if you hold it 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:04.040
 is defining 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:08.230
 but this month and I guarantee that if 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.230
 I would hold this system on windows 8 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.640
 since they are also taking out the version 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.870
 of windows 9 and I do not know if it could 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:25.530
 support the new windows 9 no 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.530
 no windows 9 would not occupy one more compu 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:33.680
 others and they would hold windows 9 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.390
 let's check how they want and more 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.870
 old lady does not come out more like that of the 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.870
 white 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:52.970
 and those that I was commissioned by an old 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.180
 done we are not looking for one because 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:58.940
 we have a project for the most 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.660
 white hairs the old ladies because I already know 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.460
 him another operating system that is linux 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.290
 that is not windows and is to hold 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.170
 any almost any computer 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:11.140
 old woman, if it comes out for the other 

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:16.070
 week will be placed the order of lost 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:19.030
 an old lady that have good 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.030
 on my part 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:23.340
 why 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:27.230
 for good 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:29.840
 that would be fine but we would do one more 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:34.249
 more old for the project that we are 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:37.390
 doing on linux and what 

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:39.970
 this is being like a Pentium 4 

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:44.800
 do not believe in 29 is in there and it's 

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:47.940
 pure chat we do here and we're 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:52.320
 here in the new one is already ending 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:56.970
 what I tell him about 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:59.310
 the project looking for a new system 

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.560
 good more again cpu but not what 

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:03.390
 we found I think it will be the next video 

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.170
 I hope you liked the elai 

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:10.080
 share this video because we are here 

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:12.590
 looking and we do not have and we see the 

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.590
 next
