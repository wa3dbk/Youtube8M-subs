00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
a bit of a pattern there actually there

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.589 
a bit of a pattern there actually there
is<00:02:40.319> patterns<00:02:40.739> there<00:02:40.950> all<00:02:41.400> right<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:41.579> uh<00:02:42.060> what

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
is patterns there all right so uh what

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.119 
is patterns there all right so uh what
we're<00:02:42.720> gonna<00:02:42.840> do<00:02:43.049> is<00:02:43.200> just<00:02:43.230> just<00:02:43.680> do<00:02:43.860> some
