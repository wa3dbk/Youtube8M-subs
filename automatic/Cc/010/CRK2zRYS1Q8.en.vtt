00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.650

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.450
 we put on the dragon body and 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.850
 We will continue to customize our 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.480

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.310

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.110

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.160

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.080

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.080

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.370

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.970

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.970
 so we select 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.750
 the right letters 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.510

 there is a dragon 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.100
 and then we're going to need this character 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.090
 that's why I'm creating it that way with the 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.459
 aspect of a dragon for boys 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:35.280
