evolution<00:04:16.510> looked<00:04:16.750> insanely<00:04:17.440> strong<00:04:17.919> the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
evolution looked insanely strong the

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.150 
evolution looked insanely strong the
whole<00:04:18.370> entire<00:04:18.760> match<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.709> thought<00:04:20.709> they<00:04:20.950> were

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
whole entire match I thought they were

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.670 
whole entire match I thought they were
gonna<00:04:21.700> win<00:04:22.020> because<00:04:23.020> they<00:04:23.380> were<00:04:23.440> just

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
gonna win because they were just

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.200 
gonna win because they were just
annihilate<00:04:23.950> in<00:04:24.310> shield

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
annihilate in shield

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.890 
annihilate in shield
but<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:26.650> shield<00:04:26.919> ends<00:04:27.220> up<00:04:27.310> getting<00:04:27.900> evolution

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
but the shield ends up getting evolution

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.689 
but the shield ends up getting evolution
in<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.110> ring<00:04:29.289> towards<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.680> end<00:04:29.800> just<00:04:30.100> as<00:04:30.430> I

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
in the ring towards the end just as I

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.240 
in the ring towards the end just as I
turned<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.150> camera<00:04:31.240> rollin<00:04:31.600> and<00:04:32.100> first<00:04:33.100> they

turned the camera rollin and first they

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.010 
turned the camera rollin and first they
took<00:04:33.430> out<00:04:33.639> blue<00:04:33.970> teesta<00:04:34.419> then<00:04:34.660> they<00:04:34.750> took<00:04:34.870> out

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
took out blue teesta then they took out

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.020

Warren and then triple H with the

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.120 
Warren and then triple H with the
sledgehammer<00:04:37.270> couldn't<00:04:38.050> take<00:04:38.620> out<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.949> rest

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
sledgehammer couldn't take out the rest

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.790

shield not one of them were eliminated

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.600 
shield not one of them were eliminated
but<00:04:44.080> all<00:04:44.259> of<00:04:44.410> evolution<00:04:44.919> was<00:04:45.069> eliminated<00:04:45.550> I

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
but all of evolution was eliminated I
