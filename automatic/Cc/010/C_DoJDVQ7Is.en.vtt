then visuals wise under the bumper
category<00:00:57.149> we'll<00:00:57.329> go<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> custom<00:00:58.140> front

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
category we'll go with a custom front

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.470 
category we'll go with a custom front
splitter<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.920> tidy<00:00:59.280> up<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.520> front<00:00:59.699> end<00:00:59.879> and
