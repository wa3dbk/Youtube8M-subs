depend<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.430> which<00:01:38.520> way<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.850> want<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.150> run<00:01:39.299> which

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
depend on which way we want to run which

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.030 
depend on which way we want to run which
is<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.140> be<00:01:40.200> predicated<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.830> how<00:01:40.979> the

is going to be predicated on how the
defensive<00:01:41.580> lines<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.330> we'll<00:01:42.479> run<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> three<00:01:43.380> by

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
defensive lines so we'll run a three by

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.250 
defensive lines so we'll run a three by
one<00:01:43.979> formation<00:01:44.340> then<00:01:44.610> we'll<00:01:44.729> also<00:01:45.020> have<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
one formation then we'll also have the

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.160 
one formation then we'll also have the
ability<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.650> get<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> three<00:01:48.990> by<00:01:49.110> two

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and run quarterback zone plays we also

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.820 
and run quarterback zone plays we also
have<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.780> ability<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.409> get<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.740> these

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
have the ability to get in these

is<00:02:02.780> aligned<00:02:03.780> over<00:02:04.229> here<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.860> have<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> ability

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
is aligned over here we have the ability

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.460 
is aligned over here we have the ability
to<00:02:05.430> motion<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> three<00:02:06.750> by<00:02:06.900> one<00:02:07.080> formation

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
to motion to a three by one formation

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.870 
to motion to a three by one formation
and<00:02:07.710> we<00:02:07.770> could<00:02:07.920> also<00:02:08.040> motion<00:02:08.549> them<00:02:08.700> all<00:02:08.790> the

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
and we could also motion them all the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.940 
and we could also motion them all the
way<00:02:08.940> across<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.570> get<00:02:09.720> him<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:10.049> either<00:02:10.410> side<00:02:10.920> of

way across to get him on either side of
the<00:02:11.670> ball<00:02:11.880> so<00:02:12.420> we<00:02:12.570> utilize<00:02:13.019> the<00:02:13.230> two-by-two

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the ball so we utilize the two-by-two

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.310 
the ball so we utilize the two-by-two
formation<00:02:13.739> will<00:02:14.640> utilize<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.299> three<00:02:15.840> by<00:02:15.989> two

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
formation will utilize a three by two

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.380 
formation will utilize a three by two
formation<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.430> three<00:02:17.640> by<00:02:17.670> one<00:02:18.000> formation

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
formation and a three by one formation

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.660 
formation and a three by one formation
to<00:02:18.840> run<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.170> zone<00:02:19.350> place<00:02:19.680> there'll<00:02:20.370> be<00:02:20.400> some

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
to run the zone place there'll be some

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.729 
to run the zone place there'll be some
other<00:02:20.760> varieties<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.450> we'll<00:02:21.780> use<00:02:22.230> at<00:02:22.470> times

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
other varieties that we'll use at times

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.830 
other varieties that we'll use at times
for<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.610> most<00:02:23.820> part<00:02:24.030> we'll<00:02:24.269> use<00:02:24.420> those<00:02:24.630> three

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
for the most part we'll use those three

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.390 
for the most part we'll use those three
formations<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:25.560> could<00:02:25.709> also<00:02:25.829> get<00:02:26.100> into<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
formations we could also get into a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.060 
formations we could also get into a
bunch<00:02:26.730> set<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:30.230> just<00:02:31.230> bunch<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.620> receivers

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
bunch set and just bunch the receivers

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.520 
bunch set and just bunch the receivers
to<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.310> one<00:02:32.489> side<00:02:32.760> we<00:02:33.450> could<00:02:33.600> line<00:02:33.810> up<00:02:33.840> and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
to the one side we could line up and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.610 
to the one side we could line up and
shift<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:36.060> one<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.810> formations<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
shift to one of the formations and the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.069 
shift to one of the formations and the
motion<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.220> get<00:02:38.970> into<00:02:39.120> different<00:02:39.540> sets<00:02:39.870> but

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
motion and get into different sets but

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.840 
motion and get into different sets but
again<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.440> important<00:02:40.859> thing<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.820> the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
again the important thing is the the

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.410 
again the important thing is the the
formation<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:42.959> not<00:02:43.139> going<00:02:43.260> to

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
formation is not going to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.110 
formation is not going to
really<00:02:43.990> be<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.319> important<00:02:44.890> other<00:02:45.490> than<00:02:45.819> in

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
really be that important other than in

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.760 
really be that important other than in
certain<00:02:46.720> formations<00:02:47.260> you're<00:02:47.410> able<00:02:47.650> to

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
certain formations you're able to

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.130 
certain formations you're able to
dictate<00:02:47.950> how<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.340> defensive<00:02:48.970> lines<00:02:49.180> possibly

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
dictate how the defensive lines possibly

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.300 
dictate how the defensive lines possibly
to<00:02:50.260> get<00:02:50.380> an<00:02:50.440> extra<00:02:50.620> man<00:02:50.860> at<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.040> point<00:02:51.250> of

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
to get an extra man at the point of

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.680 
to get an extra man at the point of
attack<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.640> those<00:02:51.880> type<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.090> things<00:02:52.239> but<00:02:52.569> our

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
attack and those type of things but our

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.000 
attack and those type of things but our
blocking<00:02:52.959> scheme<00:02:53.380> up<00:02:53.530> front<00:02:53.770> which<00:02:53.890> we're

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
blocking scheme up front which we're

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.930 
blocking scheme up front which we're
going<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.190> spend<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.370> majority<00:02:54.489> of<00:02:54.819> our<00:02:54.880> time

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
going to spend the majority of our time

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.760 
going to spend the majority of our time
talking<00:02:55.270> about<00:02:55.450> today<00:02:55.750> isn't<00:02:56.410> going<00:02:56.680> to

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
talking about today isn't going to

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.500 
talking about today isn't going to
change<00:02:56.800> depending<00:02:57.580> on<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.880> formation<00:02:58.390> it's

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
change depending on the formation it's

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.760 
change depending on the formation it's
always<00:02:58.750> going<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.959> be<00:02:58.989> consistent<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.739> that's

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
always going to be consistent and that's

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.720 
always going to be consistent and that's
what<00:03:00.280> we<00:03:00.370> like<00:03:00.550> so<00:03:00.730> much<00:03:00.850> about<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.360> scheme
