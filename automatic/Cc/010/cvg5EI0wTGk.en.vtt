 hi everyone how are you today in this 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.730
 video I'm going to show you how to do this 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.680
 hairstyle let's start let's do 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.320
 two stripes here on the side and we're going to 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.510
 make a pigtail 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.320
 now here we are going to grab hair from 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.320
 side of the forehead 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.360
 I'm going to divide it into three mentions 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.950
 and I'm going to start knitting what 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.570
 now here I'm going to grab a lock of the 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.570
 pigtail 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.019
 again I grab another lock 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.180
 I'm going to grab another strand of the pigtail 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.620
 now from the left side behind 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.620
 the ear I'm going to grab a lock 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.060
 and from the ponytail I'm going to grab another lock 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.080
 again from the left side 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.410
 now I grab another strand of the queue 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.000
 I'm going to grab another lock from the side of the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.000
 left 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.490
 I'm going to grab another strand of the pigtail 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.580
 and another lock on the left side 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.790
 here I'm going to knit a little 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.770
 here we are going to grab the locks of the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.700
 side of the left and we're going to pull them 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.700
 a little 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.190
 how can you see like this 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.600
 Now here I am going to tie a sandpaper 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.829
 now on this side we are going to do 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.310
 exactly the same as we did the 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.310
 other side 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.879
 now that we are going to join the two braids 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.650
 I'm going to remove the link that I had put in 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.239
 the braid on the left side and 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.599
 now I'm going to place it in both 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.599
 braids 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.300
 in that way so now here we accommodate 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:10.070
 the strands so that they are pretty 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.070
 I'm going to do the same thing on this side 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.230
 this is how we have stayed 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.090
 and good now here to cover a little 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.330
 I'm going to put a brooch with a 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.330
 flower 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.720
