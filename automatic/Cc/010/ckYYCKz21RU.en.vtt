what would the enemy champion do what

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.149 
what would the enemy champion do what
would<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:18.960> would<00:01:19.020> my<00:01:19.229> leaner<00:01:19.470> do<00:01:19.710> how

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
would I do what would my leaner do how

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.920

could<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.460> kill<00:01:20.610> them<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.000> when<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:21.900> of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
could we kill them and when I think of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.020 
could we kill them and when I think of
ganking<00:01:22.290> top<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.890> think<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.159> kind<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.729> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
ganking top I just think it's kind of a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.030 
ganking top I just think it's kind of a
waste<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.630> time<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.409> had<00:01:25.530> red<00:01:25.740> buff<00:01:25.920> I

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
waste of time and if I had red buff I

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.190 
waste of time and if I had red buff I
might<00:01:26.310> consider<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.880> now<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.479> might<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.900> able<00:01:28.020> to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
might consider it now I might be able to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.310 
might consider it now I might be able to
gank<00:01:28.409> TF<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:30.090> don't<00:01:30.420> think<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.990> this

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
gank TF but I don't think so in this

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.440 
gank TF but I don't think so in this
situation<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.890> some<00:01:32.070> reason<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.759> I'd<00:01:33.210> rather

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
situation for some reason so I'd rather

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.240 
situation for some reason so I'd rather
just<00:01:33.600> find<00:01:33.900> my<00:01:33.990> campus<00:01:34.350> yeah<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.829> don't<00:01:34.979> want<00:01:35.159> to

be wasting my time and not getting
anything<00:01:36.930> done<00:01:37.079> when<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.439> get<00:01:37.650> going<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.790> for

anything done when I get going so for

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.399 
anything done when I get going so for
our<00:01:39.030> fourth<00:01:39.329> tip<00:01:39.509> what<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.810> want<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.200> is

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
our fourth tip what you want to do is

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.380 
our fourth tip what you want to do is
when<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> buff<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.159> about<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.549> spawn<00:01:41.759> pick<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.299> up

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
when a buff is about to spawn pick it up

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.990 
when a buff is about to spawn pick it up
right<00:01:42.689> away<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.740> time<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.070> usually<00:01:44.250> about<00:01:44.520> 7

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
right away the time is usually about 7

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.880 
right away the time is usually about 7
15<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.540> your<00:01:45.630> first<00:01:45.840> buff<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.470> killed

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
15 for your first buff that you killed

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.580 
15 for your first buff that you killed
and<00:01:47.220> then<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.479> then<00:01:48.869> right<00:01:49.079> after<00:01:49.229> you're

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and then and then right after you're

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.319 
and then and then right after you're
going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.860> want<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.220> go<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.700> your<00:01:50.909> other<00:01:51.030> buff

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
going to want to go to your other buff

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.760 
going to want to go to your other buff
which<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.689> about<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> spawn<00:01:52.200> since<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.590> went

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
which is about the spawn since you went

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.710 
which is about the spawn since you went
that<00:01:52.979> route<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:54.090> reason<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.420> do<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.570> is

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
that route the reason I do this is

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.850 
that route the reason I do this is
because<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.079> don't<00:01:55.259> want<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.439> other<00:01:55.590> jungler

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
because I don't want the other jungler

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.789 
because I don't want the other jungler
taking<00:01:56.219> my<00:01:56.310> buff<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:57.600> say<00:01:57.869> my<00:01:58.409> red<00:01:58.619> buff

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
respond and I was at top and an enemy

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.289 
respond and I was at top and an enemy
jungler<00:02:01.409> saw<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.920> was<00:02:02.130> top<00:02:02.369> potentially<00:02:03.270> I

jungler saw that I was top potentially I

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.120 
jungler saw that I was top potentially I
left<00:02:03.570> up<00:02:03.719> an<00:02:03.840> opportunity<00:02:04.110> for<00:02:04.469> him<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.829> take

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
left up an opportunity for him to take

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.429 
left up an opportunity for him to take

me
in<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.869> second<00:02:11.440> round<00:02:11.950> when<00:02:12.250> all<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.580> bus

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
spawn for our fifth tip when the jungler

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.160 
spawn for our fifth tip when the jungler
is<00:02:15.519> top<00:02:15.819> at<00:02:16.060> pressuring<00:02:16.390> your<00:02:16.540> tower<00:02:16.780> you

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
is top at pressuring your tower you

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.170 
is top at pressuring your tower you
should<00:02:17.379> be<00:02:17.560> pressuring<00:02:18.099> something<00:02:18.459> else<00:02:18.640> that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
should be pressuring something else that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.059 
should be pressuring something else that
might<00:02:19.330> be<00:02:19.599> saying<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.470> should<00:02:20.680> go<00:02:20.769> talk<00:02:21.010> with

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
might be saying you should go talk with

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.280 
might be saying you should go talk with
your<00:02:21.340> jungle<00:02:21.670> or<00:02:21.849> we<00:02:22.420> can<00:02:22.569> pressure<00:02:22.750> another

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
your jungle or we can pressure another

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.800 
your jungle or we can pressure another
lane<00:02:23.560> or<00:02:23.769> you<00:02:24.700> can<00:02:24.819> get<00:02:24.970> dragon<00:02:25.300> for<00:02:25.480> free<00:02:25.660> as

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
lane or you can get dragon for free as

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.380 
lane or you can get dragon for free as
it<00:02:25.989> would<00:02:26.110> be<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> for<00:02:26.530> v3<00:02:26.819> this<00:02:27.819> is<00:02:27.970> I<00:02:28.090> think<00:02:28.120> a

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
it would be a for v3 this is I think a

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.750 
it would be a for v3 this is I think a
better<00:02:28.569> trade<00:02:28.959> for<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.349> as<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:30.459> can<00:02:30.610> get

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
better trade for you as you can get

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.759 
better trade for you as you can get
their<00:02:31.000> tower<00:02:31.239> later<00:02:31.630> but<00:02:32.319> they<00:02:32.410> can't<00:02:32.620> get

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
their tower later but they can't get

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.680 
their tower later but they can't get
your<00:02:32.950> tower<00:02:33.160> since<00:02:33.430> its<00:02:33.550> Rick<00:02:33.700> dead<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.180> you

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
your tower since its Rick dead and you

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.699 
your tower since its Rick dead and you
were<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.870> get<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:35.019> dragon<00:02:35.440> which<00:02:35.560> is

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
were to get a dragon which is

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.589 
were to get a dragon which is
responsible<00:02:36.010> resource<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:36.910> yeah<00:02:37.239> I<00:02:37.480> think

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
responsible resource so yeah I think

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.509 
responsible resource so yeah I think
it's<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.959> better<00:02:38.049> trade<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.590> also<00:02:39.250> if<00:02:39.400> they

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
it's a better trade and also if they

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.759 
it's a better trade and also if they
really<00:02:39.730> do<00:02:40.000> want<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.299> contest<00:02:40.660> then<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.650> can

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
really do want to contest then you can

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.800 
really do want to contest then you can
just<00:02:41.920> turn<00:02:42.099> on<00:02:42.160> them<00:02:42.430> since<00:02:42.610> it's<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.880> 43<00:02:43.599> and

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
just turn on them since it's a 43 and

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.229 
just turn on them since it's a 43 and
they're<00:02:44.200> at<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.319> disadvantage<00:02:44.880> put<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:45.910> sixth

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
they're at a disadvantage put a sixth

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.930 
they're at a disadvantage put a sixth
tip<00:02:46.450> when<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:46.810> pick<00:02:46.930> up<00:02:47.049> a<00:02:47.140> few<00:02:47.319> kills<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:48.790> can

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
tip when you pick up a few kills you can

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.550 
tip when you pick up a few kills you can
use<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.209> deaths<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.660> Vantage<00:02:50.019> by<00:02:50.170> taking

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
use the deaths of the Vantage by taking

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.979 
use the deaths of the Vantage by taking
objectives<00:02:51.250> around<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.790> map<00:02:51.940> preferably<00:02:52.750> the

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
objectives around the map preferably the

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.930 
objectives around the map preferably the
most<00:02:53.170> nearby<00:02:53.530> objectives<00:02:54.130> are<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.579> ones<00:02:54.730> your

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
most nearby objectives are the ones your

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.550 
most nearby objectives are the ones your
prior<00:02:55.209> type<00:02:55.569> and<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.079> reason<00:02:56.349> you<00:02:56.440> can

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
prior type and the reason you can

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.050 
prior type and the reason you can
actually<00:02:56.709> pressure<00:02:57.069> these<00:02:57.310> objectives<00:02:57.880> is

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
actually pressure these objectives is

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.330 
actually pressure these objectives is
because<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.720> know<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.530> disadvantage<00:03:00.250> of

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
because you know the disadvantage of

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.759 
because you know the disadvantage of
enemy<00:03:00.640> team<00:03:00.849> has<00:03:01.000> in<00:03:01.209> numbers<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.750> also<00:03:02.530> think

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
enemy team has in numbers I also think

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.259 
enemy team has in numbers I also think

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
that if you're low you should still

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.850 
that if you're low you should still
still<00:03:04.480> with<00:03:04.599> your<00:03:04.720> team<00:03:04.959> as<00:03:05.200> for<00:03:05.470> like<00:03:05.590> moral

support and the numbers advantage and

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.509 
support and the numbers advantage and
you<00:03:07.720> could<00:03:07.870> actually<00:03:07.900> use<00:03:08.440> your<00:03:08.980> skills<00:03:09.220> still

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519
