00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.020
 they are mad david of the rules firm 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.090
 srl of the presence of novara ci 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.430
 we take care of third parties especially 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.080
 on biomass we want from wood chips 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.100
 we have a chipper we do 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.989
 we have two excavators 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.940
 let's transport those two 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.210
 we have a trench there is a yarn of 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.980
 corn and to complete we are a company 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.220
 new because it is only three and a half years old 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.900
 to complete the construction this year 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.650
 missing a seeder along with 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.760
 known company that had taken the contract with 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.409
 decal we decided to follow this 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.870
 let's say this novelty of the binate file 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.580
 throwing ourselves on a eight drill 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.920
 file of the mater mag 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.630
 because we have the possibility of yes a 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.080
 disseminate with the single row either 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.030
 disseminate with the combined row there 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.740
 I want to clarify that it is the mater company 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.020
 but that the de calvi have followed us 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.880
 we hear each other a lot and there is one 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.350
 strong collaboration and we are very 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.850
 pleased with this we work in 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.909
 practically all areas of Italy 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.470
 we go from Tuscany we arrived in 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.210
 umbria we arrived in the brands 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.000
 because we take care of the plantation 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.409
 also of biomass and subsequently 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.700
 we do cultural interventions and 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.299
 finally we do the cutting and chipping 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.369
 of precisely the woody biomass 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.840
 we started now at the beginning of 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.780
 maize corn from the first harvest 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.280
 so let's talk about a month and a half 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.899
 ago and we immediately believed why 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.289
 we trust in the cup company that we are 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.909
 appliance pushed on this and how there 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.190
 they believe we believe it too 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.600
 and I repeat that if we miss one 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.519
 with this we have the seeder 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.800
 possibility of sowing both in a row 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.989
 single and simply matched 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.519
 moving the file marks and having the 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.130
 folding frame in this way e 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.799
 standing in the three meters wide 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.690
 we manage to space a lot we sow to the 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.330
 morning in Novara, afternoon in Turin 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.100
 being a young man I believe it 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.440
 much in precision farming 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.269
 because I trust it is the future and so it is 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.920
 true that we have two machines with the 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:41.440
 automatic satellite guide that only 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.410
 passing them apex for example recovering 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.000
 the 5 centimeters in every pass I am 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.859
 convinced that it almost pays for itself 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.109
 as a varied change and then anyway 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.650
 in sowing as we see that 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.390
 we have the agency's guide 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.870
 now I think it's almost essential 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.670
 going on large expanses having clients 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.150
 more and more demanding so you can 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.010
 please thanks to the guide 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.660
 satellite 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.790
 we can know where the 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.890
 machine how many hours it is working which 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.359
 diesel consumption we can 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.430
 monitor the machine much better 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.920
 surely he is also the person who is there 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.210
 above we have created a niche of 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.490
 customers who trust us a lot and 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.190
 so with them we try to propose 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.010
 this twin sowing was to increase the 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.640
 production and productivity of maize in 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.640
 this case
