00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.520 
find a blue sparklekid bottoms playing
on<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.649> looks<00:02:10.800> like<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> 20<00:02:11.400> maybe<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.300> 20<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.750> 13<00:02:13.230> 6

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
on it looks like a 20 maybe a 20 to 13 6

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:25.370 
on it looks like a 20 maybe a 20 to 13 6
18:16<00:02:17.420> or<00:02:18.420> max<00:02:19.350> come<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:22.010> mer<00:02:23.990> which<00:02:24.990> is<00:02:25.170> I'll

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
18:16 or max come on mer which is I'll

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.780 
18:16 or max come on mer which is I'll
put<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.620> link<00:02:25.800> on<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.130> too<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.610> think

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
put a link on that too and I think

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.980 
put a link on that too and I think
that's<00:02:26.910> Kansas<00:02:27.330> City<00:02:27.510> because<00:02:27.690> apparently

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
that's Kansas City because apparently

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.690 
that's Kansas City because apparently
what<00:02:28.140> had<00:02:28.290> happened<00:02:28.650> was<00:02:28.740> I<00:02:28.890> think<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.580> they

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
what had happened was I think that they

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.520 
what had happened was I think that they
had<00:02:29.819> sent<00:02:30.060> their<00:02:30.239> gear<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.690> California<00:02:31.290> for<00:02:31.440> a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
had sent their gear to California for a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.880 
had sent their gear to California for a
show<00:02:31.770> but<00:02:32.459> then<00:02:32.610> they<00:02:32.760> needed<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.180> rent<00:02:33.420> gear

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
show but then they needed to rent gear

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.710 
show but then they needed to rent gear
gotcha<00:02:34.890> right<00:02:35.130> gear<00:02:35.940> for<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.420> particular

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
gotcha right gear for this particular

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.559 
gotcha right gear for this particular
show<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:40.550> so<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.700> it's<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.910> no<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.330> don't<00:02:42.480> know

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
show so so that it's a no I don't know

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.820 
show so so that it's a no I don't know
if<00:02:42.690> it's<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.840> lovely<00:02:43.050> kid<00:02:43.290> or<00:02:43.380> what<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.680> it

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
if it's a lovely kid or what it is it

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.440 
if it's a lovely kid or what it is it
looks<00:02:43.980> kind<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.250> like<00:02:44.310> Rogers<00:02:44.910> kit<00:02:45.090> maybe<00:02:45.270> I'm

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
looks kind of like Rogers kit maybe I'm

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.000 
looks kind of like Rogers kit maybe I'm
not<00:02:45.600> sure<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:45.870> it's<00:02:46.019> kind<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.260> cool<00:02:46.470> he's<00:02:46.830> up

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
sparkle kit it looks like it is two

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.390 
sparkle kit it looks like it is two
floor<00:02:51.870> toms<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.709> I'll<00:02:52.800> put<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.040> picture<00:02:53.250> up

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
floor toms so I'll put that picture up

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.290 
floor toms so I'll put that picture up

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
from Ludwig and he had a bunch of I

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.320 
from Ludwig and he had a bunch of I
think<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:06.480> Vista<00:03:07.260> like<00:03:07.410> black<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.010> white<00:03:08.330> swirl

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
think a Vista like black and white swirl

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.570 
think a Vista like black and white swirl
I<00:03:09.690> get<00:03:10.200> but<00:03:10.350> I<00:03:10.380> forget<00:03:10.769> what<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.040> spiral

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
I get but I forget what the spiral

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.970 
I get but I forget what the spiral
pattern<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.540> know<00:03:12.630> blood<00:03:13.440> we<00:03:13.560> get<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.709> bunch<00:03:13.920> of

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
pattern you know blood we get a bunch of

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.140 
pattern you know blood we get a bunch of
different<00:03:14.250> patterns<00:03:14.430> for<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.910> Vista

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
different patterns for the Vista

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.660 
different patterns for the Vista
language<00:03:15.390> was<00:03:15.540> cool<00:03:15.750> anyway<00:03:16.620> but<00:03:16.860> he<00:03:16.950> had<00:03:17.190> a

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
language was cool anyway but he had a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.470 
language was cool anyway but he had a
kid<00:03:18.570> or<00:03:18.690> two<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:18.900> think<00:03:19.019> in<00:03:19.320> his<00:03:19.500> sizes<00:03:19.920> 26<00:03:20.459> 14<00:03:21.120> 16

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
kid or two I think in his sizes 26 14 16

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.410 
kid or two I think in his sizes 26 14 16
18<00:03:21.570> but<00:03:22.410> then<00:03:22.500> he<00:03:22.590> also<00:03:22.739> had<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.100> like<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> like<00:03:24.390> a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
18 but then he also had I like a like a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.630 
18 but then he also had I like a like a
Quadra<00:03:24.989> plus<00:03:25.200> kind<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.620> thing<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:26.010> think<00:03:26.549> which

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
Quadra plus kind of thing I think which

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.979 
Quadra plus kind of thing I think which
had<00:03:26.820> four<00:03:27.030> times<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.510> front<00:03:27.720> they<00:03:27.840> were<00:03:27.900> at

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
had four times the front they were at

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.330 
had four times the front they were at
concert<00:03:28.410> time<00:03:28.760> Tom<00:03:30.380> and<00:03:31.380> then<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.680> think<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:32.010> 20

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
concert time Tom and then I think of 20

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.890 
concert time Tom and then I think of 20
maybe<00:03:32.549> a<00:03:32.670> 24<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.269> don't<00:03:33.540> know<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.660> don't<00:03:33.780> know

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
maybe a 24 I don't know I don't know

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.270 
maybe a 24 I don't know I don't know
what<00:03:34.019> size<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.260> base<00:03:34.410> room<00:03:34.590> on<00:03:34.680> but<00:03:35.070> you<00:03:35.160> can

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
what size the base room on but you can

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.590 
what size the base room on but you can
see<00:03:35.370> pictures<00:03:35.549> of<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:36.030> think<00:03:36.239> it<00:03:36.329> said<00:03:36.480> his

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
see pictures of it I think it said his

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.380 
see pictures of it I think it said his
old<00:03:36.870> hide<00:03:37.230> farm<00:03:37.700> house<00:03:38.700> but<00:03:38.940> I'll<00:03:39.030> put<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.209> link

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
old hide farm house but I'll put a link
