developer<00:06:13.120> and<00:06:13.330> the<00:06:14.110> the<00:06:14.530> wave<00:06:14.770> pattern<00:06:15.340> can

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
developer and the the wave pattern can

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.270 
developer and the the wave pattern can
you<00:06:16.510> know<00:06:16.600> we<00:06:16.750> came<00:06:16.930> back<00:06:17.200> so<00:06:17.650> I<00:06:17.740> was<00:06:17.770> like<00:06:18.070> oh

more just so the orange can be more

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.340 
more just so the orange can be more
vibrant<00:06:24.310> it<00:06:25.270> could<00:06:25.390> be<00:06:25.510> more<00:06:25.660> oranges<00:06:26.110> study

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
vibrant it could be more oranges study

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.010 
vibrant it could be more oranges study
no<00:06:26.590> more<00:06:26.770> brown<00:06:27.070> so<00:06:27.640> I<00:06:28.120> light<00:06:28.600> in<00:06:28.720> the<00:06:28.810> end

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
noticed that my ends I mean it's still

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.640 
noticed that my ends I mean it's still
awake<00:06:33.880> panel<00:06:34.300> but<00:06:34.419> it's<00:06:34.540> not<00:06:34.690> as<00:06:34.930> you<00:06:35.200> know<00:06:35.350> of

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
awake panel but it's not as you know of

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.020 
awake panel but it's not as you know of
it<00:06:36.220> s<00:06:36.400> is<00:06:36.669> kind<00:06:36.910> of<00:06:37.000> like<00:06:38.760> but<00:06:39.760> the<00:06:39.880> wave

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
it s is kind of like but the wave

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.480 
it s is kind of like but the wave
pattern<00:06:40.419> is<00:06:40.780> still<00:06:41.350> there<00:06:41.650> it's<00:06:42.340> still

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
pattern is still there it's still

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.700 
pattern is still there it's still
noticeable<00:06:43.120> um<00:06:44.970> so<00:06:45.970> I<00:06:46.000> mean<00:06:46.300> overall<00:06:46.570> i'm<00:06:47.470> not

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
noticeable um so I mean overall i'm not

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.570 
noticeable um so I mean overall i'm not
sure<00:06:47.950> it<00:06:48.100> was<00:06:48.280> just<00:06:48.580> because<00:06:48.760> you<00:06:49.210> know<00:06:49.360> of<00:06:49.630> the

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580
