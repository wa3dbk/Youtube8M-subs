assembly<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:08.979> let's<00:02:09.310> take<00:02:09.460> a<00:02:09.490> few<00:02:09.700> minutes<00:02:10.030> and

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
assembly so let's take a few minutes and

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.640 
assembly so let's take a few minutes and
get<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.360> system<00:02:10.540> dialed<00:02:10.990> in<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.350> then<00:02:11.530> we'll

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
get the system dialed in and then we'll

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.180 
get the system dialed in and then we'll
make<00:02:11.740> a<00:02:11.800> face<00:02:12.040> frame<00:02:13.770> begin<00:02:14.770> by<00:02:14.980> installing

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
make a face frame begin by installing

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.980 
make a face frame begin by installing
