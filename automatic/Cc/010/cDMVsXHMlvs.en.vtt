00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.400 
only drawback is the black one chip
really<00:02:26.000> easily<00:02:26.360> like<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.810> sides<00:02:27.079> with

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
really easily like the sides with

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.449 
really easily like the sides with
returning<00:02:27.980> white<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.670> edges<00:02:29.380> so<00:02:30.380> that's<00:02:30.980> we

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
returning white the edges so that's we

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.890 
returning white the edges so that's we
won't<00:02:31.640> have<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:31.940> problem<00:02:32.150> with<00:02:32.510> this<00:02:32.630> deck

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
won't have this problem with this deck

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.349 
won't have this problem with this deck
and<00:02:33.170> also<00:02:34.130> if<00:02:34.280> we<00:02:34.310> go<00:02:34.549> through<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.060> look<00:02:35.150> at

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
and also if we go through and look at

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.440 
and also if we go through and look at
the<00:02:35.450> Royal<00:02:35.690> cards<00:02:36.200> they<00:02:36.769> have<00:02:36.980> an<00:02:37.160> aqua<00:02:37.790> color

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
the Royal cards they have an aqua color

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.039 
the Royal cards they have an aqua color
to<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.170> hair<00:02:40.100> and<00:02:40.609> the<00:02:40.970> little<00:02:41.420> staffs

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
they're holding and inside and then I

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.770 
they're holding and inside and then I
have<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.150> deeper<00:02:44.600> blue<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.049> dark<00:02:45.470> red<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.850> this

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780
