00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
bigger one when it comes in sizes

bigger one when it comes in sizes
the<00:01:56.290> gameplay<00:01:56.590> is<00:01:56.770> too<00:01:56.950> decent<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.430> Sony<00:01:57.640> Game

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
the gameplay is too decent to Sony Game

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
game for some reason I just enjoyed this

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.789 
game for some reason I just enjoyed this
more<00:02:06.820> even<00:02:07.330> though<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:08.080> PlayStation<00:02:08.560> 1

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
more even though the PlayStation 1

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.309 
more even though the PlayStation 1
titles<00:02:09.189> are<00:02:09.340> technically<00:02:10.090> better<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.750> mean

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
titles are technically better I mean

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.949 
titles are technically better I mean
perhaps<00:02:11.920> it's<00:02:12.370> just<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.879> nostalgia<00:02:13.390> I'm<00:02:13.569> just

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
perhaps it's just a nostalgia I'm just

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.780 
perhaps it's just a nostalgia I'm just
not<00:02:14.110> too<00:02:14.230> sure<00:02:14.260> about<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.340> levels<00:02:15.670> the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
not too sure about it the levels the

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.339 
not too sure about it the levels the
enemies<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.299> bosses<00:02:16.480> hands<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.140> staying

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
enemies and the bosses hands and staying

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.349 
enemies and the bosses hands and staying
with<00:02:17.560> though<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.920> just<00:02:18.159> can't<00:02:18.790> feel<00:02:18.999> the<00:02:19.150> same

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
with though I just can't feel the same

don't<00:02:38.579> know<00:02:38.730> how<00:02:38.909> but<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.239> remember<00:02:39.629> that<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.780> lot

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
don't know how but I remember that a lot

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.599 
don't know how but I remember that a lot
and<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.230> still<00:02:40.290> do<00:02:40.709> everything<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.159> think<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.459> in

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
and I still do everything I think of in

and I still do everything I think of in
tranced<00:02:42.030> my<00:02:42.390> cousin<00:02:42.750> had<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.019> game<00:02:43.230> along

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
tranced my cousin had this game along

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.170 
tranced my cousin had this game along
with<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.769> huge<00:02:43.980> adventure<00:02:44.459> he<00:02:44.879> might<00:02:45.060> have

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
with the huge adventure he might have

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.819 
with the huge adventure he might have
had<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.569> Game<00:02:45.810> Boy<00:02:45.959> advances<00:02:46.349> for<00:02:46.470> him<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.739> his

had to Game Boy advances for him and his
big<00:02:47.010> sister<00:02:47.189> so<00:02:47.609> that<00:02:47.640> probably<00:02:48.180> explains<00:02:48.689> how

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
big sister so that probably explains how

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
- is my favorite when it comes to the

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.650 
- is my favorite when it comes to the
PlayStation<00:04:35.740> one<00:04:35.890> platform<00:04:36.190> trilogy<00:04:36.970> I<00:04:37.180> just

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
PlayStation one platform trilogy I just

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.240 
PlayStation one platform trilogy I just
think<00:04:37.870> that<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.170> GBI<00:04:38.470> titles<00:04:38.920> hold<00:04:39.100> more

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
think that the GBI titles hold more

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.800 
think that the GBI titles hold more
memories<00:04:39.700> with<00:04:39.880> me<00:04:40.060> you<00:04:40.420> could<00:04:40.570> say<00:04:40.690> it's

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
nostalgia I just call it something that

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.810
