00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Russian scientists have achieved a 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.660
 important progress in technologies 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.120
 of information in laboratories of the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.889
 ancient university of ancient moscow 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.410
 Higher Institute of Steel and 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.360
 alloys was subjected to tests and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.520
 measured the superconducting quantum bit 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.650
 also known among specialists 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.600
 as qubits basic unit of 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.910
 quantum information storage 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.920
 the experts estimate that from here on 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.019
 few years russia will be able to manufacture 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.939
 quantum computers 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.890
 we know that the quantum bit or q bit is 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.079
 the minimum storage unit of 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.090
 data in a quantum computer but 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.640
 they also say that it is the heart of 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.250
 machines of the future in various countries 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.559
 scientists expected the appearance 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.350
 of a quantum computer like a whole 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.360
 miracle will be hundreds and even thousands of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.149
 times faster than their analogs 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.670
 classics with that they open magnificent 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.160
 perspectives in various areas by 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.800
 example the weather forecasts for a 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.440
 period of up to one hundred years will be 100% 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.840
 true but these are things of the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.000
 future 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.580
 the group of Russian researchers 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.860
 led by álex they tino member of the 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.600
 scientific council of the center of quanta 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.850
 Russian and director of the laboratory of 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.280
 superconductivity of the university mix 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.680
 is has made important progress in the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.030
 development of the computer of the future to 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.850
 test the cubit 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.430
 superconductor doctor ustínova clara 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.470
 The cubit is a tiny metal loop 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.290
 which at low temperature becomes 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.380
 a superconductor its size is 10 to 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.229
 20 microns has two small breaks 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.300
 it is necessary to quantify the cubit for 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.210
 turn him into a true genius of 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.160
 mathematics to the effect cool them up 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.320
 a temperature close to absolute zero 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.660
 equivalent to two hundred and thirty and 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.210
 seven degrees centigrade negative and what 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.220
 place in a weak magnetic field in 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.009
 that quantum state the cubit endures 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.780
 just one millionth of a second but 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.149
 reaches to run hundreds of 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.520
 computation operations the project 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.680
 supervised by alexey ustínov was won 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.869
 a grant of five billion 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.819
 dollars in a contest announced by the 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.020
 Ministry of Education and Science of 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.180
 Russia 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.250
 laboratory created as part of this 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.380
 project in the technological university 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.660
 national missis is provided with the most 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.730
 innovative equipment and instruments for 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.250
 really unique experiments in your 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.500
 gender the same scientist talks to 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.020
 modesty of their work we have checked 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.060
 that we are capable of performing that type 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.000
 of measurements and doing experiments with 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.980
 qubits in russia is only the first step 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.140
 but it 's very important because it shows 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.080
 that we have tools to study 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.120
 that part of physics that advance situates 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.760
 Russia among world leaders 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.110
 development of quantum computers the 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.240
 director of the laboratory 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.430
 superconductivity in the institute of 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.610
 solid state physics of the academy 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.470
 of sciences of Russia valeri razzano says 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.260
 that there are few countries that can be 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.910
 allow that kind of studies our 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.070
 colleagues in many parts of the world 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.070
 try to advance in the development of 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.200
 quantum computers may have us 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.150
 envy because it takes many 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.270
 input components for this 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.280
 work at this point the physicists 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.770
 Russians prepare a series of experiments 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.160
 to try to manipulate the state 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.650
 first of one and then of several qubits 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.820
 will be another step towards the creation of 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.820
 computer of the future
