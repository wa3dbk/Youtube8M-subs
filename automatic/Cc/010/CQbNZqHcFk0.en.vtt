being very useful but I had my reason

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.690 
being very useful but I had my reason
for<00:02:22.110> getting<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.530> wanted<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.860> split<00:02:23.100> push<00:02:23.370> as

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
safely as possible blink is not that

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.440 
safely as possible blink is not that
useful<00:02:25.890> because<00:02:26.280> they<00:02:26.580> have<00:02:26.700> two<00:02:26.910> blinks<00:02:27.210> they

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
useful because they have two blinks they

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.660 
useful because they have two blinks they

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
split pushing is not as effective as

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.330 
split pushing is not as effective as
normal<00:02:36.960> so<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.260> had<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.470> get<00:02:37.620> items<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.040> try<00:02:38.220> and

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
normal so I had to get items to try and

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.710 
normal so I had to get items to try and
compensate<00:02:38.640> for<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.060> because<00:02:39.330> we<00:02:39.480> can't

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
compensate for that because we can't

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.090 
compensate for that because we can't
take<00:02:39.810> them<00:02:39.960> a<00:02:40.020> head<00:02:40.140> on<00:02:40.170> up<00:02:40.410> ahead<00:02:40.590> on<00:02:40.710> fight

and<00:03:14.480> dissect<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.600> argument<00:03:16.080> logically<00:03:16.590> so

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
and dissect the argument logically so

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.380 
and dissect the argument logically so
you<00:03:17.010> can<00:03:17.190> improve<00:03:17.490> and<00:03:17.730> be<00:03:17.850> like<00:03:17.940> okay<00:03:18.180> well

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
you can improve and be like okay well

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.970 
you can improve and be like okay well
maybe<00:03:18.540> shadow<00:03:18.870> play<00:03:19.020> was<00:03:19.170> bad<00:03:19.350> maybe<00:03:19.590> if<00:03:19.860> you

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
maybe shadow play was bad maybe if you

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.290 
maybe shadow play was bad maybe if you
were<00:03:20.070> put<00:03:20.250> in<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.460> exact<00:03:20.760> same<00:03:21.030> scenario

my performance I still have to

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
time you also have to critically think

time you also have to critically think
about<00:05:02.990> advice<00:05:03.440> that<00:05:03.680> better<00:05:03.920> people<00:05:04.160> give<00:05:04.430> you

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
about advice that better people give you

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.330 
about advice that better people give you
and<00:05:04.820> for<00:05:05.360> example<00:05:05.450> if<00:05:05.870> I<00:05:05.990> tell<00:05:06.230> you<00:05:06.340> radiance

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
and for example if I tell you radiance

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.400 
and for example if I tell you radiance
is<00:05:07.430> terrible<00:05:07.850> or<00:05:07.910> necrolyte<00:05:08.270> you<00:05:09.140> should

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
is terrible or necrolyte you should

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.870 
is terrible or necrolyte you should
think<00:05:09.560> about<00:05:09.740> it<00:05:09.950> yourself<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.460> like<00:05:10.550> why<00:05:10.820> is

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
think about it yourself and like why is

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.420 
think about it yourself and like why is
reading<00:05:11.630> us<00:05:11.720> on<00:05:11.930> Necker<00:05:12.290> like<00:05:12.560> terrible<00:05:13.040> is<00:05:13.160> it

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
reading us on Necker like terrible is it

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.880 
reading us on Necker like terrible is it
useful<00:05:13.640> on<00:05:14.030> him<00:05:14.270> sometimes<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.170> why<00:05:15.440> or<00:05:15.680> why

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
useful on him sometimes and why or why

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.590 
useful on him sometimes and why or why
not<00:05:15.919> and<00:05:16.550> I<00:05:16.580> encourage<00:05:16.970> you<00:05:17.030> to<00:05:17.120> critically

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
not and I encourage you to critically

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.409 
not and I encourage you to critically
think<00:05:17.630> and<00:05:17.900> that's<00:05:18.050> why<00:05:18.260> I<00:05:18.320> almost<00:05:18.800> always<00:05:18.980> say

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
think and that's why I almost always say

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.630 
think and that's why I almost always say
almost<00:05:20.419> always<00:05:21.230> like<00:05:21.800> radiance<00:05:22.250> is<00:05:22.340> almost

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
almost always like radiance is almost

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.159 
almost always like radiance is almost
always<00:05:22.910> a<00:05:23.030> bad<00:05:23.240> choice<00:05:23.450> on<00:05:23.690> Necker<00:05:23.870> light

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
always a bad choice on Necker light

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.870 
always a bad choice on Necker light
because<00:05:24.710> there<00:05:24.860> is<00:05:25.040> always<00:05:25.400> going<00:05:25.490> to<00:05:25.580> be<00:05:25.640> that

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
because there is always going to be that

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.610 
because there is always going to be that
you<00:05:26.270> know<00:05:26.300> one<00:05:26.600> or<00:05:26.720> two<00:05:26.840> percent<00:05:27.169> chance<00:05:27.320> where

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
you know one or two percent chance where

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.850 
you know one or two percent chance where
and<00:05:28.060> this<00:05:29.060> specific<00:05:29.540> situation<00:05:29.570> that<00:05:30.230> was<00:05:30.410> the

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
and this specific situation that was the

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.860 
and this specific situation that was the
best<00:05:31.130> item<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.640> get<00:05:31.850> and<00:05:32.030> you<00:05:32.120> can<00:05:32.270> justify<00:05:32.810> it

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
best item to get and you can justify it

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.670 
best item to get and you can justify it
so<00:05:33.640> again<00:05:34.640> think<00:05:35.150> about<00:05:35.390> the<00:05:36.050> criticism<00:05:36.650> that

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
so again think about the criticism that

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.830 
so again think about the criticism that
you<00:05:36.830> receive<00:05:37.220> in<00:05:37.400> a<00:05:37.520> logical<00:05:37.760> manner<00:05:38.060> don't

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
you receive in a logical manner don't

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.750 
you receive in a logical manner don't
discount<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:39.410> argument<00:05:39.860> don't<00:05:40.010> let<00:05:40.250> motions

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
discount the argument don't let motions

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.790 
discount the argument don't let motions
get<00:05:40.970> in<00:05:41.060> the<00:05:41.120> way<00:05:41.270> try<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:41.930> be<00:05:42.080> as<00:05:42.200> logical<00:05:42.770> as

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
get in the way try and be as logical as

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.400 
get in the way try and be as logical as
possible<00:05:43.430> and<00:05:43.690> you'll<00:05:44.690> have<00:05:44.840> a<00:05:44.900> lot<00:05:45.080> more<00:05:45.140> fun

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
possible and you'll have a lot more fun

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.440 
possible and you'll have a lot more fun
and<00:05:45.680> you'll<00:05:45.800> get<00:05:45.950> a<00:05:46.010> lot<00:05:46.250> better<00:05:46.460> in<00:05:46.760> this<00:05:47.210> way

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
and you'll get a lot better in this way

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.270 
and you'll get a lot better in this way
