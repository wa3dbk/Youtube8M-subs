00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.729
 that one the whole youtube band is your 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.010
 dance costumes are a small video that the 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:10.740
 I really hope it helps a little 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.419
 they had or if they have this doubt as 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.230
 you already know after the departure 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:19.590
 from air 7.0 onwards to all the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.270
 ios concept was redesigned some 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.550
 of the new features is that 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.280
 now it brings us some small effects for 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.120
 example this effect when unlocking the 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:33.960
 device brings us that effect or towards 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:38.060
 move the device that apparently 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.400
 move on the wallpaper or icons 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.310
 I think there are about three tweets in 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.130
 Syria on this about this kind of 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.440
 effect but some of the disadvantages 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.970
 is that now if we want and we're going to 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.970
 photos if we go 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.760
 to any photograph and we want it 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.270
 put as a wallpaper let's say this 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.810
 I want to photograph it in depth 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.030
 screen 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.280
 for example if I want to fix it I do not 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.950
 let's fix it and it's because of that same effect 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.320
 that you are in this that you have your 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.800
 device what they have to do to 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.200
 let them modify the photograph that 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.360
 to the size that you like and this 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.020
 works on any photo what 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.509
 have to do is go to settings 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.020
 general 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:32.000
 accessibility and where it says reduce 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.710
 movement do not have to activate I do not 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.799
 I have disabled at the time of 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.439
 activating it will no longer bring that effect and 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.630
 itself will also help them this 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.130
 battery performance 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.130
 and now if I can go to photos 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.670
 you can select the wallpaper 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:56.409
 and as you see now if you can already I can 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.109
 put the picture as I like there 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:03.310
 it is even fixed automatically 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:06.959
 set on screen home screen 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.959
 blocked is me 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.460
 that's how I'm left if he deactivated it 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.600
 As you can see, it distorts me and does not put it on 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.700
 the wallpaper a wallpaper or background 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.700
 screen like me how I wanted 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.490
 there is 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.200
 and now yes it puts me and good in itself 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.510
 that was all about this video I hope that 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.050
 they liked it, I hope this helps 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.220
 wallpaper is a creation of the zr1 sr 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.720
 in the description of the video I can 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.340
 leave your twitter account the account 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.080

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.340
 they want to follow me and well there we 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.760
 we see in the following video
