00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
to make right now but the thing with

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.900 
to make right now but the thing with
these<00:00:33.510> yeah<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.980> if<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.460> look<00:00:35.640> at<00:00:35.760> them

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
these yeah is that if you look at them

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.180 
these yeah is that if you look at them
from<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.210> side<00:00:36.480> they<00:00:36.750> don't<00:00:36.930> look<00:00:37.260> great<00:00:37.800> but

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
from the side they don't look great but

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.220 
from the side they don't look great but
like<00:00:38.520> when<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.090> put<00:00:39.390> them<00:00:39.860> in<00:00:40.860> here

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
like when you put them in here

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.729 
like when you put them in here
they<00:00:43.230> look<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.910> epic<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.350> tell<00:00:46.559> you

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
they look like epic so just to tell you

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.850 
they look like epic so just to tell you
that<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.870> but<00:00:48.870> here's<00:00:49.140> how<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.379> make<00:00:49.530> it

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
that for this but here's how to make it

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.760 
that for this but here's how to make it
so<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.789> basically<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.570> keep<00:00:52.969> flipping<00:00:54.770> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
so you basically just keep flipping the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.869 
so you basically just keep flipping the
blocks<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:58.850> these<00:00:59.930> what<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.260> block<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
blocks on these what this block and

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.680 
blocks on these what this block and
it'll<00:01:02.879> come<00:01:03.059> out<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.300> that

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it'll come out like that

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.640 
it'll come out like that
so<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.140> stack<00:01:04.530> up<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.010> flats<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:06.570> 1x2<00:01:07.049> flats

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
so you stack up the flats the 1x2 flats

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.289 
so you stack up the flats the 1x2 flats
then<00:01:08.640> you'll<00:01:08.880> get<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.090> butter<00:01:09.540> or<00:01:10.760> or<00:01:11.760> gold

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
then you'll get a butter or or gold

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.380 
then you'll get a butter or or gold
however<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.260> say<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.210> here<00:01:15.210> is

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
however you like to say that and here is

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.570 
however you like to say that and here is
a<00:01:15.750> gold<00:01:16.590> slash<00:01:17.340> butter<00:01:17.850> block<00:01:18.409> you<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.740> pop

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
a gold slash butter block you just pop

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.179 
a gold slash butter block you just pop
that<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:21.619> here<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.850> slab<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:25.920> just

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that on here is a slab you just

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.179 
that on here is a slab you just
basically<00:01:26.369> pop<00:01:27.090> two<00:01:27.540> things<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.680> there<00:01:28.950> you

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
basically pop two things on there you

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.090 
basically pop two things on there you
can<00:01:29.340> make<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.670> smooth<00:01:30.060> or<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:31.380> could<00:01:31.619> make<00:01:31.829> it

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
can make it smooth or you could make it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.480 
can make it smooth or you could make it
with<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.930> studs<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.320> top<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.130> that's<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
with the studs on the top so that's a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.480 
with the studs on the top so that's a
slab<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:37.140> finally<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.640> stairs

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
slab and then finally we have the stairs

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.280 
slab and then finally we have the stairs
so<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.770> three<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:44.100> these<00:01:44.909> or<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:46.079> can

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
so you get three of these or you can

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:55.600 
so you get three of these or you can
make<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.950> 2<00:01:47.340> by<00:01:47.520> 2<00:01:47.549> flat<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:51.409> do<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:54.079> and

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
make it a 2 by 2 flat so you do this and

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.010 
make it a 2 by 2 flat so you do this and
then<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.909> put<00:01:57.270> 8<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:58.110> 1<00:01:58.649> by<00:01:58.829> 2<00:01:59.090> on<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.750> top

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
then you put 8 to 1 by 2 on the top

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.700 
then you put 8 to 1 by 2 on the top
there<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:03.000> get<00:02:03.180> stairs<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.590> think

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
there and you get stairs so I think

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.399 
there and you get stairs so I think
that's<00:02:05.070> pretty<00:02:05.549> cool

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
that's pretty cool

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.940 
that's pretty cool
and<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:08.220> was<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.640> thanks<00:02:09.629> for<00:02:09.690> watching<00:02:09.959> and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
and that was it thanks for watching and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.790 
and that was it thanks for watching and
I'll<00:02:11.220> see<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.550> guys<00:02:11.760> later
