00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.640 
want a nice even feed coming into the
plant<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:34.220> we<00:02:34.340> can<00:02:34.520> process<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:35.290> in<00:02:36.290> a<00:02:36.440> real

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
plant so we can process it in a real

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.570 
plant so we can process it in a real
controlled<00:02:37.130> manner<00:02:38.050> so<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.260> glass<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:39.860> the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
controlled manner so the glass that the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.309 
controlled manner so the glass that the
hopper<00:02:41.090> is<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.239> big<00:02:41.420> funnel<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:41.959> it's<00:02:42.110> feeding

hopper is a big funnel and it's feeding
down<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:42.830> low<00:02:43.130> point<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.850> we<00:02:43.970> have<00:02:44.090> a

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
down to a low point and we have a

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.150 
down to a low point and we have a

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.050 
rate going into the plant we set it up
right<00:02:48.319> now<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.560> be<00:02:48.739> about<00:02:48.920> six<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.550> seven<00:02:49.580> tons

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
right now to be about six to seven tons

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.729 
right now to be about six to seven tons
per<00:02:50.300> hour<00:02:50.420> going<00:02:50.810> in<00:02:50.930> okay<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.410> that's<00:02:51.560> what

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
per hour going in okay and that's what

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.350

that vibration you hear there that's a

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.810 
that vibration you hear there that's a
vibrating<00:02:53.810> feeder<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.340> can<00:02:55.459> hear<00:02:55.670> the

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
vibrating feeder so you can hear the

over again back into another glass

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:18.820 
over again back into another glass
container<00:03:13.269> we<00:03:14.269> have<00:03:14.769> mostly<00:03:15.769> glass<00:03:16.159> and<00:03:16.519> some

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.870 

that's<00:03:19.100> what<00:03:19.310> you're<00:03:19.490> seeing<00:03:19.700> here

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.060 

like<00:03:25.450> this<00:03:25.630> ring<00:03:25.960> you<00:03:26.140> know<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:26.440> is<00:03:26.470> my<00:03:26.740> class

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
like this ring you know this is my class

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.520 
like this ring you know this is my class
so<00:03:27.340> this<00:03:27.520> has<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.760> come<00:03:27.880> out<00:03:28.170> it's<00:03:29.170> going<00:03:29.440> to

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
so this has to come out it's going to

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.980 
so this has to come out it's going to
get<00:03:29.620> sucked<00:03:29.920> up<00:03:30.160> by<00:03:30.400> this<00:03:30.640> vacuum<00:03:30.940> system

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
get sucked up by this vacuum system

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.200 
get sucked up by this vacuum system
and<00:03:32.350> if<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.590> doesn't<00:03:32.650> if<00:03:33.400> for<00:03:33.580> some<00:03:33.610> reason<00:03:33.820> it

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
and if it doesn't if for some reason it

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.940 
and if it doesn't if for some reason it
doesn't<00:03:34.450> it<00:03:35.080> goes<00:03:35.290> down<00:03:35.560> through<00:03:35.830> the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
doesn't it goes down through the

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.860 
doesn't it goes down through the
obstacle<00:03:36.400> throater<00:03:36.700> here

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.150 

ripple<00:03:42.870> glass<00:03:43.020> gets<00:03:43.260> its<00:03:43.500> name<00:03:43.620> partially

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
ripple glass gets its name partially

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.280 
ripple glass gets its name partially
from<00:03:44.490> like<00:03:45.210> when<00:03:45.360> you<00:03:45.420> throw<00:03:45.600> a<00:03:45.630> pebble<00:03:45.960> into<00:03:46.260> a

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
from like when you throw a pebble into a

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.290 
from like when you throw a pebble into a
pond<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.740> has<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.010> ripple<00:03:47.250> effect<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:48.150> our

the Missouri and Kansas side and

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.870 
the Missouri and Kansas side and
Boulevard<00:03:52.890> looked<00:03:53.130> at<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> fact<00:03:53.550> that<00:03:53.670> it's

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
year in a metropolitan area we're trying

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.520 
year in a metropolitan area we're trying
to<00:04:05.910> make<00:04:06.000> this<00:04:06.060> really<00:04:06.420> tiny<00:04:06.810> glass<00:04:07.230> powder

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
to make this really tiny glass powder

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.100 
to make this really tiny glass powder
here<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.310> glass<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:09.390> know<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.630> doesn't<00:04:09.810> break

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
here and glass you know it doesn't break

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.140 
here and glass you know it doesn't break
so<00:04:10.440> consistently<00:04:11.130> some<00:04:11.430> pieces<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.850> thicker

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
so consistently some pieces a thicker

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.540 
so consistently some pieces a thicker
and<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:12.600> takes<00:04:12.810> more<00:04:13.050> energy<00:04:13.200> so<00:04:14.190> we<00:04:14.310> send

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
and it takes more energy so we send

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.760 
and it takes more energy so we send
those<00:04:14.700> back<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.270> breaker<00:04:15.450> again<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.260> then

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
those back to the breaker again and then

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.979 
those back to the breaker again and then
the<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.070> small<00:04:17.940> pieces<00:04:18.239> come<00:04:18.600> on<00:04:18.720> through

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
the the small pieces come on through

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.340 
the the small pieces come on through
here<00:04:19.130> glass<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.670> product<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.390> is<00:04:21.540> does<00:04:22.320> not

thing about ripple glass is the local

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.570 
thing about ripple glass is the local
nature<00:04:55.320> of<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:55.650> that<00:04:56.130> we're<00:04:56.370> keeping

everything local and we're

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.070 
everything local and we're
remanufacturing<00:04:58.830> it<00:04:59.010> locally<00:04:59.520> and<00:05:00.050> into<00:05:01.050> a

remanufacturing it locally and into a
product<00:05:01.620> that<00:05:01.650> ultimately<00:05:02.100> it<00:05:02.610> makes<00:05:02.790> homes

more<00:05:03.180> energy<00:05:03.480> efficient<00:05:03.870> we<00:05:04.710> hope<00:05:04.860> one<00:05:05.040> day

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
more energy efficient we hope one day

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.220 
more energy efficient we hope one day
that<00:05:05.370> we<00:05:05.490> can<00:05:05.760> make<00:05:06.210> bottles<00:05:06.810> out<00:05:06.990> of<00:05:07.140> our

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
that we can make bottles out of our

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.470 
that we can make bottles out of our
cholet<00:05:07.530> but<00:05:08.130> that's<00:05:08.460> a<00:05:08.730> step<00:05:09.060> down<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.330> road

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
cholet but that's a step down the road

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.140 
cholet but that's a step down the road
right<00:05:09.720> now<00:05:09.900> we're<00:05:10.080> as<00:05:10.200> trying<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:10.970> get<00:05:11.970> glass

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
right now we're as trying to get glass

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.510 
right now we're as trying to get glass
