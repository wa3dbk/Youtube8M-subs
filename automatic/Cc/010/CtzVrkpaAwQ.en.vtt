00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:10.180
 hello friends how are you today we are going to 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.670
 make broken dough that will serve us 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.370
 of base to make some delicious 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.289
 I tell you the ingredients 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:22.230
 let's use 200 grams of flour 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.530
 100 grams of medium butter 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.430
 small teaspoon of salt 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.880
 and half a glass of water 150 milliliters this 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.280
 will depend on the absorption of the area 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.309
 and if we are going to make a base for a 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.649
 sweet cake we will put a spoonful of 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.860
 sugar in the event that we're going to do 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:47.760
 a tart a chevy type of vegetables or 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.010
 whatever it is we will not state 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.130
 and with these ingredients simply with 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.500
 these ingredients we are going to make 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.370
 the broken dough that you have given me so much 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.370
 asked for that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.310
 to start the elaboration simply 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.790
 we add 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.340
 to the flour the salt 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.659
 the sugar I already say is a cake 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.909
 sweet we put it if it's a cake 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.649
 of vegetables or whatever we do not put it 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.640
 in this case like I'm going to make a sweet 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.980
 and I put it on 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.990
 and now we add the butter 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.990
 broken into pieces 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.040
 It is convenient that it is at room temperature 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.320
 now we're going to mix it up 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.650
 put your hand we will start to squeeze 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.040
 until we have a kind of 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.040
 crumbs 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.790
 here 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.790
 ah 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.850
 we already have everything well mixed as you see 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.439
 is left with a kind of crumbs has been 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.280
 dissolved the butter in all the 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.530
 flour with sugar and salt to it 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.540
 we have now we are going to add water 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:13.060
 but let's add little 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:15.819
 we have a time and we go and mixing 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.440
 because according to believes flours admit more 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.440
 water or less 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.840
 mixing 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.790
 to make a ball 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.150
 we already have the tail formed you have to have 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.569
 note that this mass is not like the 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.099
 bread dough this is not to knead 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.099
 let's give the second green 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.140
 we leave as I say a little ball 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.350
 and we have it ready when we do not know 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.200
 paste is the texture that does not stick to 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.440
 finger leaves mark this is what we are 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.440
 searching 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.990
 we add a little 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.010
 we resort with a little film paper 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.750
 and we're going to let them rest an average 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.750
 hour 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.050
 After half an hour of rest we are going 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.680
 to put some flour on the table 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.310
 let's flour the roll and 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:31.340
 let's start to spread the dough up 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.340
 the width of the mold that we are going to use 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.930
 now we have extended the let's 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.260
 roll up when the roller we have 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.980
 assured we are going to use this mold 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.049
 it is removable we have made sure that 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.230
 It's a little bigger than the mold 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:00.470
 because we have to count on what is 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.439
 the base plus the walls and with this already what 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.170
 we have solved now we are going to 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.620
 roll on the same roller to 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.620
 help us 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.520
 we already have perfectly reported all 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:44.240
 the dough in the mold and now here we have 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:47.180
 two options if we want to bake it like that 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.280
 we will put baking paper in the base 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.130
 we will add some weight like 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.590
 chickpeas a few beans and we will 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.410
 oven that in the event that it's a 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.419
 cold cake that the filling let's say base 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.360
 it is cold a cream cheese the garment of 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.490
 lemon or so if you're going to make a cake 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.699
 hot baked with the filling to the 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.150
 simply add the filling and 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.740
 put everything together heat you see super 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.110
 easy to make 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.780
 It was not complicated as you have seen and 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.750
 you have read two options even you are worth 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.080
 to make a vegetable pie for 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.939
 example 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.419
 or it serves to make any cake 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:29.340
 any fruit cake of the first 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:32.629
 I hope you liked it and I hope you 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.629
 here in the next nation
