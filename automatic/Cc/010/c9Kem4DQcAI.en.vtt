been<00:03:23.620> on<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.799> little<00:03:24.040> losing<00:03:24.579> streak<00:03:25.169> so<00:03:26.169> what<00:03:26.349> I

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
been on a little losing streak so what I

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.509 
been on a little losing streak so what I
think<00:03:26.829> is<00:03:27.069> that<00:03:27.519> there's<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.329> match<00:03:29.099> between<00:03:30.099> me

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
think is that there's a match between me

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.379 
think is that there's a match between me
and<00:03:30.849> Hernandez<00:03:31.739> against<00:03:32.739> storm<00:03:33.459> and<00:03:33.760> gunner

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
and Hernandez against storm and gunner

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.050 
and Hernandez against storm and gunner
and<00:03:34.750> those<00:03:35.680> tag<00:03:35.950> team<00:03:36.130> titles<00:03:36.459> on<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.579> line

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
and those tag team titles on the line

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.979 
and those tag team titles on the line
I<00:03:37.919> think<00:03:38.919> your<00:03:40.019> losing<00:03:41.019> streak<00:03:41.220> will<00:03:42.220> continue

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
I think your losing streak will continue

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:54.050 
I think your losing streak will continue
because<00:03:43.989> we're<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:45.069> better<00:03:45.310> tag<00:03:46.000> team<00:03:46.359> period
