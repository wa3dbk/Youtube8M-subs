minor pentatonic or you can call it C
major<00:00:52.550> pentatonic<00:00:53.079> it's<00:00:54.079> more<00:00:54.260> appropriate

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
major pentatonic it's more appropriate

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.229 
major pentatonic it's more appropriate

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
to call it C major pentatonic in this

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.689 
to call it C major pentatonic in this
case<00:00:56.510> because<00:00:57.079> it's<00:00:57.559> this<00:00:57.769> note<00:00:58.069> C<00:00:58.460> that's

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
case because it's this note C that's

functioning<00:00:59.239> is<00:00:59.329> in<00:00:59.479> root<00:00:59.659> not<00:00:59.899> a<00:01:00.109> in<00:01:00.440> fact<00:01:01.399> you

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:01.549 
functioning is in root not a in fact you

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:03.399 
functioning is in root not a in fact you
could<00:01:01.819> play<00:01:01.999> this<00:01:02.210> riff<00:01:02.539> right<00:01:03.049> here<00:01:03.289> in

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
could play this riff right here in

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.980 
could play this riff right here in
pattern<00:01:03.739> one<00:01:03.979> just<00:01:04.640> start<00:01:04.879> on<00:01:05.030> C<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:05.630> climb<00:01:05.840> up

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
pattern one just start on C and climb up

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:14.920 
pattern one just start on C and climb up
the<00:01:06.110> scale<00:01:12.490> or<00:01:13.490> if<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.360> don't<00:01:14.540> like<00:01:14.690> reaching

the scale or if you don't like reaching
over<00:01:15.320> here<00:01:15.860> with<00:01:16.040> your<00:01:16.130> pinkie<00:01:16.580> you<00:01:17.030> can<00:01:17.180> play

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
over here with your pinkie you can play

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.650 
over here with your pinkie you can play
the<00:01:17.510> same<00:01:17.540> exact<00:01:18.110> C<00:01:18.410> back<00:01:19.130> here<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:20.480> be<00:01:20.630> a

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
the same exact C back here so be a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:29.470 
the same exact C back here so be a
little<00:01:20.870> bit<00:01:20.990> of<00:01:21.080> mater<00:01:21.260> 5<00:01:22.750> 5<00:01:27.970> which<00:01:28.970> is<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.360> way

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
little bit of mater 5 5 which is the way

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.920 
little bit of mater 5 5 which is the way
most<00:01:29.510> guitar<00:01:30.050> players<00:01:30.320> would<00:01:30.590> do<00:01:30.740> it

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
most guitar players would do it

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.500 
most guitar players would do it
once<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.050> vocals<00:01:33.410> come<00:01:33.590> in<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:35.150> pentatonic

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
once the vocals come in the pentatonic

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.540 
once the vocals come in the pentatonic
scale<00:01:35.900> actually<00:01:36.320> switches<00:01:36.800> keys<00:01:37.070> over<00:01:37.430> the

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
scale actually switches keys over the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.910 
scale actually switches keys over the
chords<00:01:38.120> the<00:01:38.270> chords<00:01:38.570> are<00:01:38.660> C<00:01:38.900> and<00:01:39.020> F<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:39.830> it

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
chords the chords are C and F so it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.340 
chords the chords are C and F so it
plays<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.130> riff<00:01:40.430> once<00:01:40.700> on<00:01:40.940> C<00:01:41.300> then<00:01:42.230> it

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
plays the riff once on C then it

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.600 
plays the riff once on C then it
switches<00:01:42.680> keys<00:01:43.160> to<00:01:43.520> F<00:01:43.960> major<00:01:44.960> pentatonic

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
switches keys to F major pentatonic

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.780 
switches keys to F major pentatonic
here's<00:01:46.610> an<00:01:46.790> F<00:01:47.030> 1st<00:01:47.870> fret<00:01:48.080> of<00:01:48.140> string<00:01:48.320> 6<00:01:48.860> I'm

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
here's an F 1st fret of string 6 I'm

here's an F 1st fret of string 6 I'm
using<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.120> little<00:01:50.300> bit<00:01:50.420> of<00:01:50.600> pattern<00:01:50.780> 3<00:01:52.630> excuse

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630
