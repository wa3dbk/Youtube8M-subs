00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 how are you put with the imagination in 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.700
 cooking zero ideas for dinner 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.799
 don't worry guys i'll take care of it 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.360
 I come to your rescue 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.429
 a few nights ago I didn't know that 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.200
 but what cooked the first one since 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.560
 I had courgettes and that's how I got myself 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.150
 invented savory pancakes 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.380
 amazing cooked in the oven the beauty is that 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.699
 they managed to get the vegetables to eat 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.320
 also for children 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.560
 so I can't wait to offer them to you 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.269
 we see the ingredients around 450 grams 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.540
 of zucchini two eggs 30 g of salt 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.700
 pepper 20 grams of breadcrumbs 2 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.920
 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.410
 let's start with the preparation then I have 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.360
 prepared an electric grater e 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.730
 now I'm going to reduce them to julienne 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.800
 zucchini after having properly washed them 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:55.460
 obviously the end was not removed 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.460
 At this point we add salt 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.629
 we mix well after that 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.570
 we will let it rest for about 15-20 minutes 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.369
 to make to drain or better to remove 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.740
 as much as possible the water of 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.720
 vegetation from zucchini to facilitate 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.640
 the operation we can also put 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.270
 all the julienne vegetables inside 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.280
 of a colander 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.369
 so let's wait twenty minutes then 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.400
 we see the final result after twenty 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.380
 minutes this is the result you see the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.479
 julienne has taken on a consistency 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.970
 rather dry and below we find 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.979
 instead the vegetation water therefore 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.400
 we transfer the julienne inside 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:40.470
 another bowl in this case to this 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.610
 point we just have to unite the others 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.590
 ingredients 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.840
 if you are wondering what I'm here to 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.570
 a wrist pain simply then 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.200
 I put on a special plaster 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.880
 now we put the grana cheese 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:04.800
 pepper no longer salt this time 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:04.800
 because we put the two eggs first 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.280
 and mix as you can hear the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.600
 oven has reached the right temperature 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.600
 180 degrees 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.140
 we got this consistency 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.480
 we must make the mixture a little more 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.780
 thick so we add so much bread 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.190
 grated enough so I have you 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.410
 given the indicative doses why 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.730
 it also depends on the amount of water 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.590
 in other words from humidity present 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.850
 inside the zucchini you will put a 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.850
 another bit 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.180
 so now 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.730
 we expect a spoonful of the mixture 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.560
 see the consistency as it should be and 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.120
 we arrange it inside a 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.450
 coppapasta because we want to do things 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.390
 well on top of a sheet of paper 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.100
 oven 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.989
 let's see then we give the form the shape 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:02.200
 of a medallion practically not here 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:07.480
 here we continue in this way until 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.040
 to exhaust the batter he got 5 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.110
 pancakes because I've done it enough 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.150
 however, he clearly proposed if you do them anymore 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.640
 thin you can get one and more 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.060
 we put a trickle of oil about a 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.140
 spoon and a half or two for all 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.420
 pancakes 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.160
 and then a little bit of breadcrumbs 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.110
 what we have advanced that there 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.709
 will serve to form in the crust 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.560
 golden very inviting and now there is in 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.840
 oven at 180 degrees which already hot for 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.840
 about 15 20 minutes or until golden brown 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.650
 here they are then baked pancakes already 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.600
 ready that being cooked and right at the 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.400
 oven I would call more ovens than 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.590
 pancakes however I recommend you 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.380
 serve them immediately hot so steaming hot 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:59.000
 they will remain soft and soft we look 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.340
 a little the consistency inside I do 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.580
 see wonderful aids 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.580
 enjoy your meal
