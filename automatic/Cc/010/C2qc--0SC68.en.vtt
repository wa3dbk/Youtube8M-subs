while<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.420> was<00:00:20.570> in<00:00:20.720> walk<00:00:21.500> on<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:21.740> trench

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.430 

if<00:00:42.820> you've<00:00:43.030> been<00:00:43.180> you<00:00:43.719> been<00:00:43.870> following<00:00:44.050> our

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
if you've been you been following our

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.189 
if you've been you been following our
build<00:00:44.710> on<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.070> chassis<00:00:45.280> you'll<00:00:45.670> notice<00:00:46.000> that

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
build on the chassis you'll notice that

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.660 
build on the chassis you'll notice that
pretty<00:00:47.199> much<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.559> entire<00:00:47.769> chassis<00:00:48.219> is<00:00:48.340> MIG

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
pretty much the entire chassis is MIG

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.819 
pretty much the entire chassis is MIG
welded<00:00:49.059> together<00:00:49.149> however<00:00:50.019> when<00:00:50.350> it<00:00:50.440> comes<00:00:50.649> to

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
welded together however when it comes to

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.220 
welded together however when it comes to
the<00:00:50.949> critical<00:00:51.160> suspension<00:00:52.000> components<00:00:52.629> where

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
the critical suspension components where

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.680 
the critical suspension components where
precision<00:00:53.980> is<00:00:54.160> key<00:00:54.399> we're<00:00:55.030> going<00:00:55.180> to<00:00:55.239> TIG<00:00:55.420> weld

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
precision is key we're going to TIG weld

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.430 
precision is key we're going to TIG weld
those<00:00:55.839> items<00:00:56.289> together<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:57.640> also<00:00:58.239> maintains<00:00:59.019> a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
those items together it also maintains a

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.740 
those items together it also maintains a
higher<00:00:59.649> strength<00:01:00.070> for<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.879> bead<00:01:01.149> size<00:01:01.449> as

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
higher strength for the bead size as

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.619 
higher strength for the bead size as
well<00:01:01.930> so<00:01:02.620> even<00:01:03.489> though<00:01:03.579> our<00:01:03.610> roll<00:01:03.940> cage<00:01:04.210> is<00:01:04.420> MIG

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
well so even though our roll cage is MIG

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.710 
well so even though our roll cage is MIG
welded<00:01:05.080> and<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:06.040> strength<00:01:06.430> is<00:01:06.670> is<00:01:07.000> perfectly

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
welded and the strength is is perfectly

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.389 
welded and the strength is is perfectly
adequate<00:01:08.200> for<00:01:08.229> that<00:01:08.409> area

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
adequate for that area

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.450 
adequate for that area
the<00:01:10.060> precision<00:01:10.479> items<00:01:10.990> in<00:01:11.409> this<00:01:11.770> case<00:01:12.009> this<00:01:12.280> is

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
the precision items in this case this is

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.370 
the precision items in this case this is
the<00:01:12.670> upper<00:01:13.240> control<00:01:13.600> or<00:01:13.840> upper<00:01:14.110> shock<00:01:14.350> mount

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
the upper control or upper shock mount

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.760 
the upper control or upper shock mount
where<00:01:15.369> the<00:01:15.899> coilover<00:01:16.899> shocks<00:01:16.929> em<00:01:17.590> blaze

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
where the coilover shocks em blaze

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.219 
where the coilover shocks em blaze
mounted<00:01:18.310> so<00:01:18.490> this<00:01:19.179> takes<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.600> lot<00:01:19.750> of<00:01:19.810> stress

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
mounted so this takes a lot of stress

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.279 
mounted so this takes a lot of stress
from<00:01:20.590> absorbing<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:22.360> stress<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:23.050> cars

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
from absorbing the stress of the cars

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.680 
from absorbing the stress of the cars
it's<00:01:23.679> racing<00:01:24.130> so<00:01:24.520> we're<00:01:24.880> gonna<00:01:24.970> take<00:01:25.240> weld<00:01:25.479> all

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
it's racing so we're gonna take weld all

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.669 
it's racing so we're gonna take weld all
of<00:01:25.840> our<00:01:25.960> critical<00:01:26.350> components<00:01:26.920> on<00:01:27.009> this<00:01:27.159> car

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
of our critical components on this car

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.020

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
the same we the reason we use these

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.139 
the same we the reason we use these
types<00:01:47.740> of<00:01:47.860> fixtures<00:01:48.310> is<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.640> keep<00:01:48.820> the

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
types of fixtures is to keep the

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.969 
types of fixtures is to keep the
