 and hello everyone pulls flush and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.840
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.900
 again you in this author to contain 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.310
 two parts the heaviest first 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.140
 have explained how renowned a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.070
 storage device ie 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.050
 a usb stick hard drive memory card and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.460
 at second part a little longer is going 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.250
 explain how to create a new 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.500
 disk because for example you come 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.280
 to install a new hard drive gold 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.770
 your computer 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.149
 and to be able to use it store 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.910
 above data you need 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.340
 to buy records on so that's it 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.289
 we have 38 passed the first part 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:57.120
 to rename storage devices 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.460
 haider start computer so there by 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.420
 example the day but my usb key click 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.080
 right on it renamed and you put the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:12.960
 name you want here it works 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.439
 also for discs to fame and 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.439
 i see m 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:27.500
 that's where there is a little bit so that's it 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.189
 this is the first part now for 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.319
 the second part 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.299
 if you want to create a disc you 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:36.069
 give you just start and then 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.060
 after to search you type management 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.240
 you click on management of 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.240
 computer 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.259
 so there you go in storage 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.530
 disk management you expect that its 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.530
 charge 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.200
 that's where we can see their 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.429
 ca the record one month is the record 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.369
 was basic on my pc 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.319
 it contains say it's the 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.409
 record of two other two countries 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.000
 parties that's actually it's what allows 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.849
 is between windows that's what 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.060
 allows the PC to start the disco is 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.650
 the hard drive that I added myself 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:17.599
 then you see that I have already done 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.769
 blues a and there remains an empty space if 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.750
 you have not yet scream say that 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.880
 everything will be black and soft to empty 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.910
 so after to create a new one of 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.180
 all done right click new volumes 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.370
 following simple then you choose 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.560
 the ability you want but too many 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.480
 if you have not made a record yet 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.040
 are hard drive and he has a great 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.560
 ability he will find you bag to do 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.639
 several discs like that it will allow 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.420
 two aisles that's when you have to 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.880
 do a systematic search 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.889
 the antivirus or any other analysis that 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.269
 will go faster so at least if I 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.690
 have already done a pure second will him 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:58.160
 to say to take all the remaining space 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:02.180
 that's it for the letter gmb that you 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:12.139
 do not touch then following the name ben 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:14.359
 we will put ten more than 1la 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.230
 next so here you have a small 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:22.310
 summary you click on finish 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:25.519
 there you wait a little bit and that's it 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.120
 your new disc is scratched then you 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.599
 can the renamed also 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.319
 and you know how to change his ability in 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.730
 title on reducing the volume 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.170
 Here you go do not leave in your writings 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.430
 a new design next to that one there 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.040
 you have to reduce the volume of 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.080
 this one to be able to do it again 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.459
 and there you can see delete enough 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.000
 easy you make more rights over 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.260
 deleted if you delete say that 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.170
 all the data on it 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.840
 will be erased so here it is well
