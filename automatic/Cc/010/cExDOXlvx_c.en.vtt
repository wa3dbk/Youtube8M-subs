and design don't all play together the

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.520 
and design don't all play together the
anchor<00:00:53.390> might<00:00:53.600> work<00:00:53.780> good<00:00:53.989> in<00:00:54.019> one<00:00:54.260> situation

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
anchor might work good in one situation

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.200 
anchor might work good in one situation
but<00:00:55.100> not<00:00:55.250> in<00:00:55.370> others<00:00:55.519> that's<00:00:55.850> why<00:00:56.000> we've

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
but not in others that's why we've

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.270 
but not in others that's why we've
actually<00:00:56.449> we've<00:00:57.289> actually<00:00:57.440> perfected<00:00:57.920> that

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
actually we've actually perfected that

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.669 
actually we've actually perfected that
we've<00:00:58.820> put<00:00:59.000> a<00:00:59.030> patent<00:00:59.480> on<00:00:59.570> it<00:00:59.629> and<00:00:59.989> that's<00:01:00.500> why

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
we've put a patent on it and that's why

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.319 
we've put a patent on it and that's why
our<00:01:00.710> anchor<00:01:01.070> works<00:01:01.280> also<00:01:01.850> what's<00:01:02.089> unique

weight in the nose is our anchor is the

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.810 
weight in the nose is our anchor is the
only<00:01:30.409> anchor<00:01:30.680> without<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.189> row<00:01:31.340> bar<00:01:31.579> that

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
only anchor without the row bar that

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.469 
only anchor without the row bar that
will<00:01:31.909> land<00:01:32.119> up<00:01:32.299> right<00:01:32.540> regardless<00:01:34.299> of<00:01:35.299> how

will land up right regardless of how

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.520 
will land up right regardless of how
it's<00:01:35.689> fun<00:01:35.950> Wow<00:01:36.950> cool<00:01:37.930> also<00:01:38.930> what<00:01:39.079> our<00:01:39.200> anchor

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
it's fun Wow cool also what our anchor

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.319 
it's fun Wow cool also what our anchor
does<00:01:39.710> is<00:01:40.009> because<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.759> patents

you<00:01:44.540> look<00:01:44.689> right<00:01:44.869> now<00:01:44.930> in<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.290> seabed<00:01:45.740> when

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
you look right now in the seabed when

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.550 
you look right now in the seabed when
that<00:01:46.340> anchor<00:01:46.610> is<00:01:46.670> laying<00:01:46.880> on<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.119> seabed<00:01:47.560> this

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
that anchor is laying on the seabed this

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.289 
that anchor is laying on the seabed this
body<00:01:48.829> of<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.070> anchor<00:01:49.310> has<00:01:49.490> nowhere<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:49.939> go<00:01:49.969> but

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
body of the anchor has nowhere to go but

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.630 
body of the anchor has nowhere to go but
down<00:01:50.329> okay<00:01:51.049> now<00:01:51.320> once<00:01:51.649> it's<00:01:51.860> down<00:01:52.100> it's<00:01:52.430> also

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
down okay now once it's down it's also

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.910 
down okay now once it's down it's also
important<00:01:53.299> that<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:54.020> have<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.200> concave<00:01:54.500> design

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
important that you have a concave design

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.160 
important that you have a concave design
that<00:01:55.280> works<00:01:55.490> as<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:56.240> look<00:01:56.600> when<00:01:56.750> our<00:01:56.869> anchor

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
that works as you look when our anchor

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.529 
that works as you look when our anchor
is<00:01:57.289> down<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:58.399> concave<00:01:58.880> design<00:01:59.090> actually

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
is down the concave design actually

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.480 
is down the concave design actually
instead<00:01:59.990> of<00:02:00.079> using<00:02:00.259> this<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:00.740> bottom<00:02:01.340> of<00:02:01.430> the

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
instead of using this the bottom of the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.700 
instead of using this the bottom of the
ocean<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:01.909> seabed<00:02:02.359> going<00:02:02.930> over<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.259> back<00:02:03.469> of

ocean the seabed going over the back of
the<00:02:03.799> anchor<00:02:04.130> we're<00:02:04.609> diverting<00:02:04.909> that<00:02:05.149> way<00:02:05.270> back

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
the anchor we're diverting that way back

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:06.999 
the anchor we're diverting that way back
toward<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.930> front<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.350> anchor<00:02:06.649> applying

toward the front of the anchor applying

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.889 
toward the front of the anchor applying
more<00:02:07.250> pressure<00:02:07.310> here<00:02:07.850> that's<00:02:08.270> why<00:02:08.479> our<00:02:08.509> anchor

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
more pressure here that's why our anchor

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.200 
more pressure here that's why our anchor
is<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.110> only<00:02:09.259> anchor<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.950> all<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.670> tests
