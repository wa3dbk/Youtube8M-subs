00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.349 
I don't know why I picked this shelf
glass<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:32.049> do<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.909> actually<00:02:33.909> I<00:02:33.969> grabbed<00:02:34.209> it

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
glass to do this actually I grabbed it

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.640 
glass to do this actually I grabbed it
by<00:02:34.450> mistake<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.930> photos<00:02:35.139> grabbing<00:02:35.560> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
by mistake of photos grabbing the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.849 
by mistake of photos grabbing the
tasting<00:02:36.010> glass<00:02:36.219> but<00:02:36.519> this<00:02:36.879> is<00:02:37.030> fine<00:02:37.530> if<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.709> had

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
tasting glass but this is fine if I had

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.199 
tasting glass but this is fine if I had
it<00:02:38.950> in<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.040> tasting<00:02:39.400> glass<00:02:39.639> I<00:02:39.819> think<00:02:39.999> it<00:02:40.120> would

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
it in the tasting glass I think it would
