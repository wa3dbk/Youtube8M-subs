00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.650 

but<00:01:31.410> halfway<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:33.800> so<00:01:34.800> on<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:35.190> other<00:01:35.340> side<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
but halfway on so on the other side it

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.170 
but halfway on so on the other side it
pulls<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.140> perfectly<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.030> if<00:01:39.030> you

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
pulls and perfectly like that if you

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.430 
pulls and perfectly like that if you
have<00:01:39.270> any<00:01:40.340> on<00:01:41.340> take<00:01:42.030> part<00:01:42.330> it's<00:01:42.810> leftover<00:01:43.350> you

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
have any on take part it's leftover you

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.100 
have any on take part it's leftover you
just<00:01:43.740> wipe<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.070> off<00:01:44.450> now<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.900> like

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
just wipe that off now you have like

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.170 
just wipe that off now you have like
this<00:01:46.670> like<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.910> and<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:49.040> you<00:01:50.040> fold<00:01:50.400> it<00:01:50.580> like

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
this like that and so you fold it like

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.980 
this like that and so you fold it like
about<00:01:51.720> half<00:01:52.200> way<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.010> maybe<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.990> then

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
about half way so maybe like that then

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.630 
about half way so maybe like that then
you<00:01:55.020> take<00:01:55.440> it<00:01:55.650> and<00:01:55.830> fold<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:57.030> like<00:01:57.860> that<00:01:58.860> so

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
you take it and fold it up like that so

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.090 
you take it and fold it up like that so
it<00:01:59.729> looks<00:01:59.759> like<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.470> do<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.800> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it looks like that and you do that the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.300 
it looks like that and you do that the
same<00:02:02.369> with<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.700> other<00:02:02.729> side<00:02:03.290> like<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
same with the other side like that and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.520 
same with the other side like that and
then<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.450> do<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.900> different<00:02:07.200> way<00:02:07.410> like<00:02:08.340> this

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
then you do it a different way like this

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.740 
then you do it a different way like this
then<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.619> for<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.950> backwards<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:12.510> fold

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
then you for it backwards and you fold

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.380 
then you for it backwards and you fold
this<00:02:12.959> one<00:02:13.170> backwards<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:15.000> it'll<00:02:15.180> be<00:02:15.270> exactly

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
this one backwards so it'll be exactly

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.750 
this one backwards so it'll be exactly
the<00:02:15.870> same<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:16.170> same<00:02:16.380> time<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.400> have<00:02:17.550> this

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
the same on same time so you have this

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:29.630 
the same on same time so you have this
now<00:02:18.270> let's<00:02:18.390> go<00:02:18.510> test<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.840> out<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:29.190> have<00:02:29.370> this

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
now let's go test it out you have this

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.960 
now let's go test it out you have this
and<00:02:30.000> put<00:02:30.900> on<00:02:31.019> your<00:02:31.050> finger<00:02:31.440> like<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:32.370> you
