about the classes of roses that do
better<00:02:43.370> in<00:02:43.550> lower<00:02:43.730> light<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.300> hybrid<00:02:44.660> Musk's

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
better in lower light the hybrid Musk's

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.840 
better in lower light the hybrid Musk's
and<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.140> poly<00:02:45.350> Anthes<00:02:45.740> for<00:02:45.920> example<00:02:46.370> here's

petals on a rose flower the better that

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.010 
petals on a rose flower the better that
Rose<00:02:51.830> has<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.520> making<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.180> in<00:02:53.300> lower<00:02:53.750> light

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
Rose has of making it in lower light

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.570 
Rose has of making it in lower light
conditions<00:02:54.050> let<00:02:54.920> me<00:02:54.980> just<00:02:55.130> say<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:55.340> again

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
conditions let me just say that again

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.820 
conditions let me just say that again
less<00:02:55.940> petals<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.780> better<00:02:57.020> chance<00:02:57.320> it<00:02:57.470> has<00:02:57.650> of

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
less petals the better chance it has of

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.220 
less petals the better chance it has of
making<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.280> lower<00:02:58.520> light<00:02:58.820> conditions

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
making it lower light conditions

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.930 
making it lower light conditions
obviously<00:03:00.230> also<00:03:00.620> pick<00:03:00.860> a<00:03:00.890> disease<00:03:01.340> resistant

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
obviously also pick a disease resistant

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.160 
obviously also pick a disease resistant
Rose<00:03:02.120> because<00:03:02.360> you've<00:03:02.540> got<00:03:02.720> some<00:03:02.900> stress<00:03:03.140> from

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
disease in lower light conditions you

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.640 
disease in lower light conditions you
don't<00:03:04.970> have<00:03:05.060> that<00:03:05.180> full<00:03:05.420> sunlight<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:06.380> dry<00:03:06.410> the

these<00:03:19.700> hardwood<00:03:20.120> trees<00:03:20.390> here<00:03:20.630> where<00:03:21.050> some

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
these hardwood trees here where some

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.900 
these hardwood trees here where some
sunlight<00:03:21.620> will<00:03:21.800> hit<00:03:21.950> this<00:03:22.100> spot<00:03:22.340> occasionally

but maybe not all the time so remember
that<00:03:24.980> it's<00:03:25.250> dappled<00:03:25.790> light<00:03:25.850> it's<00:03:26.270> not
