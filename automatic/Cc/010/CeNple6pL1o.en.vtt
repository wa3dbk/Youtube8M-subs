00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
crochet braids video you would notice

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.330 
crochet braids video you would notice
that<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.909> had<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.510> lot<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.840> new<00:01:10.409> growth<00:01:10.590> so

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that I had like a lot of new growth so

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.490 
that I had like a lot of new growth so
when<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.000> was<00:01:12.180> flat<00:01:12.420> ironing<00:01:12.720> my<00:01:12.780> hair<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.140> could

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
when I was flat ironing my hair I could

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.550 
when I was flat ironing my hair I could
definitely<00:01:13.890> tell<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.790> my<00:01:15.360> hair<00:01:15.570> has<00:01:15.840> grown<00:01:16.080> I

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
definitely tell that my hair has grown I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.039 
definitely tell that my hair has grown I
think<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.520> length<00:01:18.060> check<00:01:18.330> though<00:01:18.600> would<00:01:18.900> be

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
think this length check though would be

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.469 
think this length check though would be
a<00:01:19.080> little<00:01:19.439> bit<00:01:19.710> more<00:01:20.040> accurate<00:01:21.000> because<00:01:21.180> my

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
a little bit more accurate because my

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.080 
a little bit more accurate because my
hair<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.720> straightened<00:01:22.320> versus<00:01:23.100> curling<00:01:23.670> but

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
hair is straightened versus curling but

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.850 
hair is straightened versus curling but
my<00:01:24.210> hair<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:24.450> pretty<00:01:24.960> much<00:01:25.200> stretched<00:01:25.619> out

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
my hair was pretty much stretched out

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.580 
my hair was pretty much stretched out
when<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.130> did<00:01:26.250> my<00:01:26.400> first<00:01:26.790> Lynn<00:01:27.570> check<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.290> I

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
when I did my first Lynn check so I

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.590 
when I did my first Lynn check so I
don't<00:01:28.979> think<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.280> really<00:01:29.310> matters<00:01:29.579> but<00:01:30.450> what

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
don't think it really matters but what

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.510 
don't think it really matters but what
I'm<00:01:30.689> gonna<00:01:30.810> do<00:01:31.079> I'm<00:01:31.229> going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.530> monitor<00:01:32.340> my

last<00:02:12.400> flower<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.030> think<00:02:13.270> i<00:02:13.420> flat<00:02:13.750> ironed<00:02:14.110> at

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350

last flower and I think i flat ironed at
the<00:02:14.650> lowest<00:02:15.040> which<00:02:15.220> was<00:02:15.400> 300<00:02:16.120> degrees<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.620> i

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
the lowest which was 300 degrees so i
