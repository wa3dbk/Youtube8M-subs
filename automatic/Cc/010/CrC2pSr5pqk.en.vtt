color was very very very prone to being

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.060 
color was very very very prone to being
able<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.629> take<00:00:57.899> knocks<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.559> dings<00:00:58.770> and

able to take knocks and dings and
scratch<00:00:59.670> very<00:01:00.300> very<00:01:00.629> easily

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
scratch very very easily

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.740 
scratch very very easily
making<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> device<00:01:02.370> look<00:01:02.760> kind<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.180> tacky<00:01:03.449> in

making the device look kind of tacky in

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.649 
making the device look kind of tacky in
a<00:01:04.229> short<00:01:04.739> period<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.220> time<00:01:05.280> now<00:01:06.090> my<00:01:06.390> belief

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
a short period of time now my belief

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.810 
a short period of time now my belief
that<00:01:06.689> Apple<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.170> changed<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.100> black<00:01:08.549> color

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
that Apple have changed the black color

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.420 
that Apple have changed the black color
to<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.270> new<00:01:09.570> space<00:01:09.869> cray<00:01:10.229> color<00:01:10.530> because<00:01:11.189> of

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
to this new space cray color because of

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640 
to this new space cray color because of
this<00:01:11.670> exact<00:01:12.330> issue<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.320> think<00:01:13.439> it's

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
this exact issue so I think it's

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.899 
this exact issue so I think it's
important<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.159> all<00:01:14.250> those<00:01:14.460> people<00:01:14.790> that

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
important for all those people that

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.210 
important for all those people that
wanted<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.390> stay<00:01:15.780> away<00:01:16.200> from<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.860> darker

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
wanted to stay away from the darker

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.760 
wanted to stay away from the darker
colors<00:01:17.610> because<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:19.110> inevitable

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
colors because of that inevitable

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.609 
colors because of that inevitable
scratching<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.390> cover<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:22.170> actually<00:01:22.470> take

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
scratching of the cover to actually take

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.530 
scratching of the cover to actually take
a<00:01:22.650> look<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.580> able<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.299> is

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
a look at this and be able to see is

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.740 
a look at this and be able to see is
this<00:01:25.020> any<00:01:25.380> more<00:01:25.560> scratch<00:01:26.250> resistant<00:01:26.939> than<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
this any more scratch resistant than the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.920 
this any more scratch resistant than the
previous<00:01:28.350> black<00:01:28.799> color<00:01:29.189> now<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.030> actual

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
previous black color now the actual

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.260 
previous black color now the actual
device<00:01:31.439> itself<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:32.310> terms<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> iPad<00:01:33.060> 5

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
device itself in terms of the iPad 5

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.260 
device itself in terms of the iPad 5
casing<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.049> now<00:01:34.590> very<00:01:35.070> very<00:01:35.189> similar<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.060> that

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
casing is now very very similar to that

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.080 
casing is now very very similar to that
of<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.990> iPad<00:01:37.650> Mini<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.579> say<00:01:38.759> we've

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
of the iPad Mini but like I say we've

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.730 
of the iPad Mini but like I say we've
just<00:01:39.119> got<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.479> new<00:01:39.750> color<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.470> when<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
just got this new color and when you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.530 
just got this new color and when you
compare<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.880> black<00:01:42.090> color<00:01:42.329> there

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
compare it to the black color there

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.539 
compare it to the black color there
really<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.259> very<00:01:43.770> very<00:01:43.890> distinct

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
really is a very very distinct

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.219 
really is a very very distinct
difference<00:01:44.909> between<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.570> two<00:01:45.810> it's

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
difference between the two it's

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.160 
difference between the two it's
definitely<00:01:46.619> not<00:01:46.829> as<00:01:47.040> dark<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.060> also<00:01:48.299> has<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
definitely not as dark and it also has a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.980 
definitely not as dark and it also has a
much<00:01:49.680> shinier<00:01:50.369> bezel<00:01:50.909> shaping<00:01:51.479> around<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
much shinier bezel shaping around the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.109

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
outside of the device which is going to

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.380 
outside of the device which is going to
be<00:01:54.240> much<00:01:54.509> much<00:01:54.810> harder<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.710> scratch<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
be much much harder to scratch but the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.170 
be much much harder to scratch but the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
majority of items is obviously the very

majority of items is obviously the very
very<00:02:02.579> back<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> casing<00:02:04.170> itself<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:05.040> what

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
very back of the casing itself and what

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.010 
very back of the casing itself and what
I<00:02:05.369> do<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:06.030> actually<00:02:06.149> put<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.570> through<00:02:06.780> some

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
I do is actually put it through some

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.249 
I do is actually put it through some
very<00:02:07.170> very<00:02:07.680> rigorous<00:02:08.539> scratching<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.720> just

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
very very rigorous scratching and just

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.830 
very very rigorous scratching and just
see<00:02:10.470> how<00:02:10.679> difficult<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.550> actually

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
see how difficult it is to actually

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.300 
see how difficult it is to actually
scratch

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
scratch

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.020

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
now the iPad for the previous generation

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.210 
now the iPad for the previous generation
only<00:02:17.659> came<00:02:17.930> in<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.379> silverback<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.159> it

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
only came in that silverback so it

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.789 
only came in that silverback so it
wasn't<00:02:19.640> really<00:02:19.909> too<00:02:20.090> much<00:02:20.330> of<00:02:20.540> an<00:02:20.959> issue<00:02:21.110> but

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
wasn't really too much of an issue but

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.100 
wasn't really too much of an issue but
let's<00:02:22.220> get<00:02:22.400> into<00:02:22.549> this<00:02:22.819> and<00:02:23.090> see<00:02:23.510> just<00:02:23.930> how

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
let's get into this and see just how

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.550 
let's get into this and see just how
easy<00:02:24.379> or<00:02:24.769> difficult<00:02:24.799> it<00:02:25.459> is<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:26.090> scratch<00:02:27.080> this

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
easy or difficult it is to scratch this

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.539 
easy or difficult it is to scratch this

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
new iPad 5 casing in Space Gray so first

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.280 
new iPad 5 casing in Space Gray so first
of<00:02:31.700> all<00:02:31.819> I<00:02:31.849> actually<00:02:31.940> just<00:02:32.269> got<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.450> normal<00:02:32.810> key

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
of all I actually just got a normal key

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.009 
of all I actually just got a normal key
and<00:02:33.560> just<00:02:33.980> applied<00:02:34.459> it<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.209> if<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.840> was

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
and just applied it to it and if I was

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.539 
and just applied it to it and if I was
doing<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.349> on<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.620> black<00:02:36.830> version<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.459> can

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
doing this on the black version I can

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.850 
doing this on the black version I can
definitely<00:02:38.090> tell<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.230> paint<00:02:39.650> would

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
definitely tell you that the paint would

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.100 
definitely tell you that the paint would
have<00:02:40.010> come<00:02:40.190> off<00:02:40.340> pretty<00:02:40.640> much<00:02:40.910> instantly<00:02:41.660> or

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
have come off pretty much instantly or

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.600 
have come off pretty much instantly or
the<00:02:42.290> amortization<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.340> would<00:02:43.489> have

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
the amortization and it would have

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.210 
the amortization and it would have
looked<00:02:43.790> absolutely<00:02:44.170> horrific<00:02:45.170> with<00:02:45.709> just<00:02:46.040> a

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
looked absolutely horrific with just a

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.030 
looked absolutely horrific with just a
simple<00:02:46.700> scratch<00:02:47.000> from<00:02:47.780> something<00:02:48.319> like<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.680> key

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
simple scratch from something like a key

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.400 
simple scratch from something like a key
we<00:02:49.489> can<00:02:49.640> see<00:02:49.879> here<00:02:50.120> they<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.629> actual<00:02:50.930> space

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
we can see here they the actual space

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.339 
we can see here they the actual space
gray<00:02:51.709> color<00:02:51.980> is<00:02:52.190> very<00:02:52.879> very<00:02:53.120> much<00:02:53.299> so<00:02:53.599> more

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
gray color is very very much so more

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.250 
gray color is very very much so more
Hardy<00:02:55.160> than<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:56.000> black<00:02:56.450> color<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:57.019> went

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
Hardy than that black color that went

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.069 
Hardy than that black color that went
before<00:02:57.879> so<00:02:58.879> now<00:02:59.180> I<00:02:59.209> stepped<00:02:59.720> it<00:02:59.840> up<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.989> little

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
before so now I stepped it up a little

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.750 
before so now I stepped it up a little
bit<00:03:00.319> and<00:03:00.470> actually<00:03:00.560> use<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.220> sim<00:03:01.489> tray

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
bit and actually use the sim tray

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.780 
bit and actually use the sim tray
remover<00:03:02.299> from<00:03:02.900> an<00:03:03.170> iPhone<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.129> started<00:03:04.670> to

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
remover from an iPhone and started to

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.490 
remover from an iPhone and started to
scratch<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.269> as<00:03:05.359> well<00:03:05.629> and<00:03:05.840> although<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.410> has

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
scratch that as well and although it has

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.280 
scratch that as well and although it has
actually<00:03:06.890> made<00:03:07.099> a<00:03:07.400> distinct<00:03:07.940> mark<00:03:08.299> on<00:03:08.629> the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
actually made a distinct mark on the

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.500 
actually made a distinct mark on the
back<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.739> casing<00:03:10.160> itself<00:03:10.420> personally<00:03:11.420> I

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
back of the casing itself personally I

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.479 
back of the casing itself personally I
still<00:03:11.750> believe<00:03:12.049> that<00:03:12.079> it<00:03:12.410> looks<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:12.920> lot<00:03:13.160> better

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
still believe that it looks a lot better

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.660 
still believe that it looks a lot better
than<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.420> equivalent<00:03:14.989> black<00:03:15.590> one<00:03:15.859> would<00:03:16.400> look

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
than the equivalent black one would look

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.490 
than the equivalent black one would look
if<00:03:16.879> we<00:03:17.000> were<00:03:17.120> doing<00:03:17.329> this<00:03:17.419> on<00:03:17.480> an<00:03:17.690> iPad<00:03:17.840> Mini<00:03:18.290> or

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
if we were doing this on an iPad Mini or

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.449 
if we were doing this on an iPad Mini or
indeed<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.549> iPhone<00:03:20.269> 5<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.319> last<00:03:21.950> test

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
indeed the iPhone 5 and the last test

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.309 
indeed the iPhone 5 and the last test
just<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:23.000> really<00:03:23.419> kind<00:03:23.630> of<00:03:23.690> push<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.019> up<00:03:24.139> a<00:03:24.260> step

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
just to really kind of push it up a step

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.039 
just to really kind of push it up a step
was<00:03:24.919> to<00:03:25.099> get<00:03:25.250> out<00:03:25.400> a<00:03:25.430> chisel<00:03:26.120> and<00:03:26.359> really<00:03:26.870> give

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
was to get out a chisel and really give

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.620 
was to get out a chisel and really give
this<00:03:27.200> a<00:03:27.380> good<00:03:27.829> going-over<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.639> indeed<00:03:29.419> you

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
this a good going-over and indeed you

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.780 
this a good going-over and indeed you
can<00:03:29.660> obviously<00:03:30.169> see<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.470> scratches<00:03:31.340> that

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
can obviously see the scratches that

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.809 
can obviously see the scratches that
have<00:03:32.269> come<00:03:32.540> out<00:03:32.660> but<00:03:33.169> again<00:03:33.440> it<00:03:34.069> hasn't<00:03:34.489> kind

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
have come out but again it hasn't kind

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.690 
have come out but again it hasn't kind
of<00:03:34.910> flaked<00:03:35.269> off<00:03:35.540> in<00:03:36.139> the<00:03:36.319> way<00:03:36.530> that<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.190> black

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
of flaked off in the way that the black

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.970 
of flaked off in the way that the black
one<00:03:37.940> has<00:03:38.180> done<00:03:38.450> before<00:03:38.510> so<00:03:39.169> I<00:03:39.380> think<00:03:39.739> this<00:03:39.829> is<00:03:39.950> a

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
one has done before so I think this is a

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.580 
one has done before so I think this is a
definite<00:03:40.609> improvement<00:03:41.269> by<00:03:41.660> Apple<00:03:42.049> I<00:03:42.169> believe

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
definite improvement by Apple I believe

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.559 
definite improvement by Apple I believe
this<00:03:42.769> really<00:03:43.099> was<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.730> only<00:03:43.760> reason<00:03:44.480> they

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
this really was the only reason they

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.539 
this really was the only reason they
changed<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.049> black<00:03:45.349> from<00:03:45.620> -<00:03:45.859> the<00:03:45.980> Space<00:03:46.280> Gray

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
changed the black from - the Space Gray

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:47.920 
changed the black from - the Space Gray
and<00:03:46.579> in<00:03:47.000> fact<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:47.269> actually<00:03:47.359> preferred<00:03:47.900> the

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
and in fact I actually preferred the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.680 
and in fact I actually preferred the
black<00:03:48.410> color<00:03:48.859> but<00:03:49.430> like<00:03:49.730> I<00:03:49.760> say<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.180> really<00:03:50.480> did

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
black color but like I say it really did

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.080 
black color but like I say it really did
have<00:03:50.959> that<00:03:51.530> situation<00:03:51.829> where<00:03:52.370> you<00:03:52.489> just<00:03:52.790> knew

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
have that situation where you just knew

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.629 
have that situation where you just knew
that<00:03:53.359> very<00:03:53.750> very<00:03:54.049> slight<00:03:54.319> touch<00:03:54.680> or<00:03:54.950> knock<00:03:55.430> was

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
that very very slight touch or knock was

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.220 
that very very slight touch or knock was
going<00:03:55.819> to<00:03:55.879> damage<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.329> I<00:03:56.450> think<00:03:56.810> you<00:03:56.900> can<00:03:57.019> see

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
going to damage it I think you can see

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.900 
going to damage it I think you can see
from<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.500> test<00:03:57.739> here<00:03:57.950> today<00:03:58.250> that<00:03:58.639> that<00:03:58.669> is

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
from the test here today that that is

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.909 
from the test here today that that is
definitely<00:03:59.450> not<00:03:59.750> going<00:04:00.169> to<00:04:00.230> be<00:04:00.319> the<00:04:00.440> case<00:04:00.650> with

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
definitely not going to be the case with

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.289 
definitely not going to be the case with
the<00:04:01.040> Space<00:04:01.280> Gray<00:04:01.579> and<00:04:01.819> it's<00:04:02.030> going<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.209> be<00:04:02.269> a

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
the Space Gray and it's going to be a

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.199 
the Space Gray and it's going to be a
lot<00:04:02.660> harder<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.349> make<00:04:04.010> your<00:04:04.250> device<00:04:04.430> look
