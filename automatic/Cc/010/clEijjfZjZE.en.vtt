in<00:04:22.490> fact<00:04:22.940> I<00:04:23.030> can<00:04:23.180> think<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.360> a<00:04:23.449> couple<00:04:23.599> cars

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
in fact I can think of a couple cars

in fact I can think of a couple cars
that<00:04:24.199> cost<00:04:24.349> more<00:04:24.620> than<00:04:24.680> twice<00:04:24.979> this<00:04:25.190> much<00:04:25.460> that

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
that cost more than twice this much that

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.700 
that cost more than twice this much that
were<00:04:25.789> much<00:04:26.090> harsher<00:04:26.419> to<00:04:26.780> ride<00:04:26.990> in<00:04:27.229> which

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
brings us to the power a short subject

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.650 
brings us to the power a short subject
there's<00:04:31.250> not<00:04:31.430> much<00:04:31.639> there<00:04:31.880> as<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.240> can<00:04:32.419> tell

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
there's not much there as you can tell

there's not much there as you can tell
from<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.990> numbers<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:33.650> you<00:04:33.949> always<00:04:34.220> feel

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
from the numbers and you always feel

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.700 
from the numbers and you always feel
like<00:04:34.610> you're<00:04:34.820> about<00:04:35.150> 20<00:04:35.690> percent<00:04:36.169> shy<00:04:36.410> of<00:04:36.590> the
