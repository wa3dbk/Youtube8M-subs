00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
this month excellent and so what this is

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.480 
this month excellent and so what this is
its<00:01:27.869> uses<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.229> new<00:01:28.350> technology<00:01:28.950> which<00:01:29.100> snaps

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
its uses a new technology which snaps

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.539 
its uses a new technology which snaps
into<00:01:29.729> place<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.780> rather<00:01:31.020> than<00:01:31.350> rather<00:01:32.220> than

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
into place so rather than rather than

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.609 
into place so rather than rather than
the<00:01:32.939> previous<00:01:33.360> cases<00:01:33.570> which<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> black

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the previous cases which with the black

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.219 
the previous cases which with the black
glass<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.640> backing<00:01:36.090> yeah<00:01:36.420> will<00:01:36.720> crack<00:01:36.960> over

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
glass of backing yeah will crack over

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.050 
glass of backing yeah will crack over
time<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.920> snaps<00:01:38.220> into<00:01:38.400> place<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
time this snaps into place and the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.880 
time this snaps into place and the
connector<00:01:39.479> actually<00:01:39.840> snaps<00:01:40.110> into<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.560> unit

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
connector actually snaps into the unit

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.190 
connector actually snaps into the unit
thereby<00:01:41.340> providing<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.180> charge<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.810> those<00:01:42.990> who

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
