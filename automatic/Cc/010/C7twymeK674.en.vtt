00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.610
 how to plant a vine in order to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:10.410
 to make a trellis and to realize 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.679
 a trellis you need of course 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.900
 a pergola to a wall or why not 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.609
 sheet piling it can be also a sort in 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.050
 wood so that this vine can 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.449
 climb quite easily 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.779
 other interest and especially if you live 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.740
 in a cold region you have to expose 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.570
 your life in the sun to plant 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.149
 a vine you must already make a good hole 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.890
 you have to work well when 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.770
 you work your soil especially if 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.450
 you have moist, clay soil 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.610
 do not hesitate to put at the bottom of the hole 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.410
 rubble from the bricks of the gravel 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.590
 way to hang out well you have to know 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.809
 the thumb avim practically everywhere she 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.550
 is content with little but if during 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.530
 winter its roots are in the humidity 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.920
 it may go downhill 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.840
 push 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.570
 do not hesitate to enrich your land 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.280
 bring compost and compost the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.530
 worth at least a third on your 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.480
 existing earth a land that you 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.090
 go mix you can go even 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.700
 bring an organic fertilizer over 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.920
 so also to enrich and especially 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.409
 feed the roots from the start of the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.240
 planting at specialists of the 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.570
 garden you have several choices 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.119
 divine vines when grafting even two 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.439
 years here it is a two year old vine 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.479
 she is already well developed she is going 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.049
 can quickly start giving some 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.360
 clusters 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.409
 but like all plantations 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.930
 when it comes to a plant in 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.759
 container must already be soaked in 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.909
 water for a few minutes before the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.909
 planting 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.930
 now here is our life 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.700
 of plants and so we see young people 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.450
 white rootlets and sign that the vine 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.100
 is in good health 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.200
 and then we also see some small 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.640
 balls inside the room this are 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.470
 delay fertilizers and do not be 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.520
 worried they are not de2 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.170
 spider as we often hear 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.430
 it is a judgment that is there precisely for 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.200
 feed our border 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.090
 we will now go to the plantation 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.729
 and now we will position our 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.689
 vines in our hole then as 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.920
 each tree that is grafted it does not take 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.119
 never bury the graft 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.879
 so the transplant that is always 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.069
 often positioned at 10 or even 20 cm 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.420
 copyright now we will fill the 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.890
 earth always around with our land 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.860
 which is enriched with potting soil and 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.500
 compost and one cup 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.500
 slightly along the clod so 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.120
 there is no air hole 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.250
 after planting arrange for 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.960
 that it makes a bowl and we will him 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.890
 bring 10 liters of water to the plantation 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.960
 now our life is planted there on 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.610
 leave her like that we might have 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.140
 a few clusters this year but that's 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.490
 not the goal of the game since in fact it 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.530
 this is a betrayal he steals to do 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.910
 climb and to make it climb he goes 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.950
 have to cut it severely 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.840
 then we will remove the tutor who exists 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.970
 in all the links and we will make a 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.640
 preparation size two formations 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.200
 to recover minimum 2 carpenter 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.660
 now that our life is there 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.590
 planted we will observe the graft on 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.140
 sees that it's a transplant that's already 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.120
 well developed with beautiful little 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.459
 carpenters who start to push 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.200
 along but if we leave it that way we 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.060
 may have some clusters this 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.680
 year but it's a bit ridiculous since 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.420
 we want to make it climb so what is 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.340
 important and but that's the size is 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.690
 severely the first year out of two 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.760
 buds so that they 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.860
 can remake beautiful 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.959
 carpenters here is a little trick 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.970
 for the first year and even for 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.070
 years that will follow for your trait 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.780
 always prepared a small box 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.600
 to wick the bear to few links you 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.700
 put on the planted side then 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.350
 attention that do not take root and 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.970
 when you have the oaths start over again 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.650
 to develop but you will just need to 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.489
 ligation and / or progressively so 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.489
 what she is a beautiful form
