dresser should look like what we have a
problem<00:00:11.300> the<00:00:12.300> holes<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.559> drawer<00:00:14.400> slide

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
problem the holes in the drawer slide

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.500 
problem the holes in the drawer slide
don't<00:00:16.170> line<00:00:16.379> up<00:00:16.410> with<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.010> pre-drilled<00:00:17.510> holes

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
don't line up with the pre-drilled holes

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.609 
don't line up with the pre-drilled holes
in<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.439> furniture<00:00:20.990> there's<00:00:21.990> no<00:00:22.109> way<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.350> put

in the furniture there's no way to put

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.000 
in the furniture there's no way to put
this<00:00:22.740> together<00:00:23.810> because<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:25.439> piece<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.830> wood

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
this together because this piece of wood

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.400 
this together because this piece of wood
is<00:00:26.720> too<00:00:27.720> wide<00:00:28.910> since<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.240> don't<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.630> metal

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
is too wide since I don't have a metal

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.889 
is too wide since I don't have a metal
stretcher<00:00:31.859> here<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.309> make<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> drawers<00:00:33.660> all

rise any longer I'm gonna have to drill
another<00:00:38.550> hole<00:00:39.239> there<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.500> put<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> screw<00:00:41.640> in

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
another hole there and put a screw in

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.790 
another hole there and put a screw in
there<00:00:42.059> into<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> little<00:00:43.020> piece<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.200> wood<00:00:43.440> that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
there into the little piece of wood that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.979 
there into the little piece of wood that
I<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.629> same<00:00:45.629> situation<00:00:46.289> there<00:00:47.690> same<00:00:48.690> there

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
I have same situation there same there

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.910 
I have same situation there same there
this<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.920> how<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.789> looks<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:53.000> when<00:00:54.000> it's

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
this is how it looks like when it's

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.310 
this is how it looks like when it's
kinda<00:00:55.920> fixed<00:00:56.309> or<00:00:56.460> made<00:00:56.699> work<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
kinda fixed or made work and the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.450 
kinda fixed or made work and the
critical<00:00:58.829> part<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.609> to<00:01:00.180> seat<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:02.010> flat

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
critical part in it is to seat this flat

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.899 
critical part in it is to seat this flat
head<00:01:02.730> screw<00:01:03.619> deep<00:01:04.619> enough<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.460> doesn't<00:01:05.790> hit

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
head screw deep enough so it doesn't hit

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.370 
head screw deep enough so it doesn't hit
the<00:01:06.060> glider<00:01:06.360> glider<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.860> little<00:01:08.220> wheel

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
the glider glider that little wheel

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.420 
the glider glider that little wheel
should<00:01:10.380> glide<00:01:10.799> by<00:01:12.710> because<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.950> flat<00:01:14.189> head

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
should glide by because this flat head

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.550 
should glide by because this flat head
is<00:01:14.610> flat<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> surface<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.350> it's

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
is flat on the surface but it's

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.270 
is flat on the surface but it's
triangular<00:01:17.509> underneath<00:01:18.530> or<00:01:19.530> there<00:01:19.890> should<00:01:20.130> be

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
triangular underneath or there should be

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.990 
triangular underneath or there should be
a<00:01:20.310> big<00:01:20.520> enough<00:01:20.759> hole<00:01:21.259> for<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> head<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.670> sink

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
a big enough hole for the head to sink

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.359 
a big enough hole for the head to sink
in<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.409> not<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.770> way<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:28.369> roller

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
in so it's not in the way of the roller

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.630 
in so it's not in the way of the roller
there<00:01:29.869> on<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:30.960> one<00:01:31.020> here<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:32.040> hitting<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.549> a

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
there on this one here it's hitting it a

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:41.300 
there on this one here it's hitting it a
little<00:01:32.850> bit<00:01:35.869> again<00:01:37.850> it's<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.259> little<00:01:40.259> bit<00:01:40.590> so

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
little bit again it's a little bit so

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.999 
little bit again it's a little bit so
I'm<00:01:42.030> gonna<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.570> redo<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.530> one<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
I'm gonna have to redo this one and

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.300 
I'm gonna have to redo this one and
count<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.850> with<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> bigger<00:01:46.049> hole<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> head

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
count and with a bigger hole so the head

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.749 
count and with a bigger hole so the head
sinks<00:01:48.020> further<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> metal<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
sinks further in to the metal and the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.260 
sinks further in to the metal and the
wood<00:01:51.829> another<00:01:52.829> thing<00:01:53.100> that's<00:01:53.460> important<00:01:54.090> why

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
wood another thing that's important why

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.600 
wood another thing that's important why
they<00:01:54.450> do<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:57.090> these<00:01:58.219> drawer<00:01:59.219> slides

have to be at the same height okay I

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
have to be at the same height okay I
have<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.320> do<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.649> you're<00:02:05.340> gonna<00:02:05.460> need<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.700> use

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
have to do that you're gonna need to use

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.270 
have to do that you're gonna need to use
the<00:02:06.750> drawer<00:02:07.020> itself

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
the drawer itself

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:25.210 
the drawer itself
just<00:02:08.729> put<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:21.170> there<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:24.000> way<00:02:24.240> they

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
just put it in there so this way they

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.100 
just put it in there so this way they
drawer<00:02:26.220> itself<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:29.180> dictating<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.600> height<00:02:30.810> of

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
drawer itself is dictating the height of

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.890 
drawer itself is dictating the height of
both<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.680> these<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.730> once<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.600> have<00:02:33.780> the

both of these so once you have the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.610 
both of these so once you have the
height<00:02:34.080> for<00:02:34.410> one<00:02:34.830> side<00:02:36.290> once<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.380> have<00:02:37.500> the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
perfectly level I tilted this one a

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.910 
perfectly level I tilted this one a
little<00:03:33.030> bit<00:03:33.180> down<00:03:33.420> because<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:34.380> had<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.739> bite

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
little bit down because I had to bite

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.190 
little bit down because I had to bite
into<00:03:35.130> some<00:03:35.400> wood<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:36.540> means<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:36.989> the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
into some wood so that means that the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.140 
into some wood so that means that the
bottom<00:03:37.590> corner<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.160> gonna<00:03:38.400> kick<00:03:38.640> out<00:03:38.820> a<00:03:38.850> little

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
bottom corner is gonna kick out a little

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.199 
bottom corner is gonna kick out a little
bit<00:03:39.359> just<00:03:39.750> like<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.230> minimally<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:42.000> top

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
bit just like so minimally and the top

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.110 
bit just like so minimally and the top
is<00:03:42.359> gonna<00:03:42.540> sink<00:03:43.350> in<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.620> little<00:03:43.650> bit<00:03:44.120> because

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
is gonna sink in a little bit because

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.750 
is gonna sink in a little bit because
it's<00:03:45.769> because<00:03:46.769> I<00:03:46.890> have<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.220> tear<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.549> drawer

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760
