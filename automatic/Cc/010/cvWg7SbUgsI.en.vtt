about widgets is that widgets are
constantly<00:02:35.890> using<00:02:36.250> your<00:02:36.370> battery<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:37.209> more

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
constantly using your battery the more

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.030 
constantly using your battery the more
widgets<00:02:37.599> you<00:02:37.870> have<00:02:38.079> the<00:02:38.379> more<00:02:38.500> battery<00:02:38.890> that's

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
widgets you have the more battery that's

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.179 
widgets you have the more battery that's
going<00:02:39.219> to<00:02:39.280> be<00:02:39.430> used<00:02:39.760> by<00:02:40.180> those<00:02:40.390> widgets<00:02:40.599> and

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
going to be used by those widgets and

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.309 
going to be used by those widgets and
the<00:02:42.189> more<00:02:42.489> that<00:02:42.670> they<00:02:42.819> use<00:02:43.030> data<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.780> what

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
the more that they use data is what

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.069 
the more that they use data is what
really<00:02:44.700> triggers<00:02:45.700> how<00:02:45.879> much<00:02:46.060> battery<00:02:46.750> they're

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
really triggers how much battery they're

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.839 
really triggers how much battery they're
going<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.290> take<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:47.709> for<00:02:47.890> example<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.549> Google

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
going to take so for example the Google

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.369 
going to take so for example the Google
search<00:02:49.030> bar<00:02:49.269> doesn't<00:02:49.510> use<00:02:49.780> any<00:02:49.930> data<00:02:50.200> by

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
search bar doesn't use any data by

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.649 
search bar doesn't use any data by
itself<00:02:50.709> unless<00:02:50.889> you<00:02:51.400> trigger<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.760> search<00:02:52.090> so

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
itself unless you trigger a search so

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.149 
itself unless you trigger a search so
it's<00:02:52.840> okay<00:02:53.139> to<00:02:53.200> sit<00:02:53.530> there<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:53.889> it's<00:02:54.010> not

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
it's okay to sit there and it's not

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.770 
it's okay to sit there and it's not
going<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.370> use<00:02:54.489> that<00:02:54.670> much<00:02:54.849> battery<00:02:55.239> the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
going to use that much battery the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.020 
going to use that much battery the
calendar<00:02:56.139> also<00:02:56.409> is<00:02:56.859> just<00:02:56.920> showing<00:02:57.459> you<00:02:57.639> dates

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
calendar also is just showing you dates

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.589 
calendar also is just showing you dates
and<00:02:58.359> you<00:02:59.260> know<00:02:59.680> events<00:03:00.189> but<00:03:00.730> it's<00:03:00.879> not<00:03:01.000> taking

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
and you know events but it's not taking

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.270 
and you know events but it's not taking
any<00:03:01.750> data<00:03:02.049> usage<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:02.709> it's<00:03:02.829> not<00:03:02.950> using<00:03:03.250> that

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
any data usage so it's not using that

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.240 
any data usage so it's not using that
much<00:03:03.519> battery<00:03:03.939> the<00:03:04.810> weather<00:03:05.019> widget<00:03:05.470> is<00:03:05.620> using

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
much battery the weather widget is using

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.740 
much battery the weather widget is using
data<00:03:06.430> because<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:06.819> has<00:03:06.939> to<00:03:07.060> call<00:03:07.299> out<00:03:07.510> and

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
data because it has to call out and

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.289 
data because it has to call out and
trigger<00:03:08.439> refresh<00:03:09.310> on<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.909> different

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
trigger refresh on the different

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.449 
trigger refresh on the different
forecasts<00:03:10.959> so<00:03:11.409> it's<00:03:11.560> using<00:03:11.680> data<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.310> it's

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
forecasts so it's using data so it's

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.770 
forecasts so it's using data so it's
going<00:03:12.609> to<00:03:12.669> be<00:03:12.730> killing<00:03:13.060> my<00:03:13.150> battery<00:03:13.329> just<00:03:13.510> a

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
going to be killing my battery just a

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.809 
going to be killing my battery just a
little<00:03:13.989> bit<00:03:14.139> not<00:03:14.769> that<00:03:14.919> much<00:03:15.159> because<00:03:15.400> i<00:03:15.579> have

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
little bit not that much because i have

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.479 
little bit not that much because i have
it<00:03:15.970> on<00:03:16.060> i<00:03:16.120> think<00:03:16.329> an<00:03:16.510> hourly<00:03:16.900> sync<00:03:17.169> schedule<00:03:17.620> my

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
it on i think an hourly sync schedule my

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.069 
it on i think an hourly sync schedule my
data<00:03:18.700> usage<00:03:18.819> is<00:03:19.299> probably<00:03:19.540> using<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.840> little

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
data usage is probably using a little

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.140 
data usage is probably using a little
bit<00:03:20.169> of<00:03:20.340> battery<00:03:21.340> simply<00:03:21.579> because<00:03:21.879> it<00:03:22.000> needs

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
bit of battery simply because it needs

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.780 
bit of battery simply because it needs
to<00:03:22.389> refresh<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:23.069> indicator<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.280> tell<00:03:24.489> me<00:03:24.639> how

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
to refresh the indicator to tell me how

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.580

up here they've got all sorts of widgets
that<00:03:43.720> are<00:03:43.840> just<00:03:44.049> running<00:03:44.379> simply<00:03:45.340> because

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
that are just running simply because

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.520 
that are just running simply because
simply<00:03:46.209> because<00:03:46.419> it's<00:03:46.599> cool<00:03:46.840> so<00:03:47.109> because<00:03:47.290> it

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
simply because it's cool so because it

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.250 
simply because it's cool so because it
looks<00:03:47.739> cool<00:03:47.979> the<00:03:48.879> and<00:03:49.329> there's<00:03:49.959> nothing<00:03:50.079> wrong

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
looks cool the and there's nothing wrong

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.629 
looks cool the and there's nothing wrong
with<00:03:50.530> doing<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:50.919> but<00:03:51.099> you<00:03:51.220> need<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.430> realize

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
with doing that but you need to realize

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.640 
with doing that but you need to realize
that<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.209> more<00:03:52.389> widgets<00:03:52.569> you<00:03:52.810> have<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.440> more

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
that the more widgets you have the more

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.080 
that the more widgets you have the more
your<00:03:53.859> battery<00:03:54.159> is<00:03:54.190> going<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.430> be<00:03:54.549> depleted

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
your battery is going to be depleted

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.930 
your battery is going to be depleted
because<00:03:55.239> those<00:03:55.659> widgets<00:03:55.870> are<00:03:56.650> if<00:03:57.310> they're

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
because those widgets are if they're

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.339 
because those widgets are if they're
accessing<00:03:58.239> data<00:03:58.569> they're<00:03:58.780> using<00:03:59.079> battery

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
accessing data they're using battery

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.229 
accessing data they're using battery
faster<00:03:59.739> but<00:03:59.919> also<00:04:00.069> the<00:04:00.370> quantity<00:04:00.849> the<00:04:01.030> more

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
you add the more data is going to be

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.890 
you add the more data is going to be
used<00:04:02.919> by<00:04:03.159> the<00:04:03.819> phone<00:04:04.120> or<00:04:04.329> excuse<00:04:04.569> me<00:04:04.599> the<00:04:04.690> more

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
good battery life but the first step is

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.090 
good battery life but the first step is
your<00:04:54.000> widget<00:04:54.330> usage<00:04:54.720> what<00:04:55.470> would<00:04:55.620> you<00:04:55.920> have

your widget usage what would you have
how<00:04:56.640> many<00:04:56.700> you<00:04:57.000> have<00:04:57.210> and<00:04:57.540> learning<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:58.200> simply
