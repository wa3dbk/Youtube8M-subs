00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
like if when she flips back over she

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.089 
like if when she flips back over she
almost<00:01:24.020> looks<00:01:24.259> like<00:01:24.320> she<00:01:24.500> has<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.619> little<00:01:24.860> lion

mane<00:01:25.459> she's<00:01:25.789> all<00:01:25.940> fuzzy<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.050> this<00:01:27.170> is<00:01:27.289> a<00:01:27.319> brand

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
mane she's all fuzzy so this is a brand

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.620 
mane she's all fuzzy so this is a brand
new<00:01:28.039> young<00:01:28.340> mated<00:01:28.700> Queen<00:01:28.940> and<00:01:29.179> we<00:01:29.270> know<00:01:29.390> she's

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
new young mated Queen and we know she's

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.880 
new young mated Queen and we know she's
made<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:29.959> because<00:01:30.170> we've<00:01:30.319> been<00:01:30.349> looking<00:01:30.590> at

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
made it because we've been looking at

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.730 
made it because we've been looking at
the<00:01:31.160> eggs<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.819> larvae<00:01:32.319> we<00:01:33.319> don't<00:01:33.500> know<00:01:33.619> really

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
the eggs and larvae we don't know really

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.499 
the eggs and larvae we don't know really
the<00:01:33.950> quality<00:01:34.160> because<00:01:34.729> that<00:01:34.910> could<00:01:35.060> be<00:01:35.240> drone

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
the quality because that could be drone

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.449 
the quality because that could be drone
but<00:01:35.989> I<00:01:36.200> doubt<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:37.149> um<00:01:38.149> and<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.220> here<00:01:40.220> she<00:01:40.429> is

00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:40.459 
but I doubt it um and so here she is

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:43.150 
but I doubt it um and so here she is
maybe<00:01:40.970> she'll<00:01:41.239> flip<00:01:41.420> over<00:01:41.780> again<00:01:42.080> for<00:01:42.440> us<00:01:42.530> but

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
maybe she'll flip over again for us but

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.889 
maybe she'll flip over again for us but
that's<00:01:43.280> marking<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:43.789> Queen<00:01:43.940> so<00:01:44.450> then<00:01:44.599> you<00:01:44.750> can

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
that's marking and Queen so then you can

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.290 
that's marking and Queen so then you can
set<00:01:45.140> her<00:01:45.289> aside<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:46.039> put<00:01:46.789> everything<00:01:47.000> back

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
set her aside and put everything back

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.999 
set her aside and put everything back
together<00:01:47.539> and<00:01:47.810> then<00:01:48.200> let<00:01:48.349> her<00:01:48.470> back<00:01:48.619> into<00:01:48.890> the

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
together and then let her back into the

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.999 
together and then let her back into the
hive<00:01:49.690> that<00:01:50.690> gives<00:01:51.050> a<00:01:51.170> few<00:01:51.349> minutes<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.739> let<00:01:51.890> the

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
hive that gives a few minutes to let the
