the ones curving down and the ones
curving<00:03:31.040> upwards<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:36.430> make<00:03:37.430> sure<00:03:37.760> you<00:03:38.090> don't

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
curving upwards and make sure you don't

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.449 
curving upwards and make sure you don't
do<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:38.959> on<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.260> outside<00:03:39.770> of<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:40.040> blue<00:03:40.190> make

do it on the outside of the blue make

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.670 
do it on the outside of the blue make

00:03:42.680 --> 00:04:05.250 
sure it stays within the blue border
line

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.140 

and<00:04:06.260> then<00:04:06.380> you're<00:04:06.530> going<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:06.740> start<00:04:07.160> by<00:04:07.700> during

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
and then you're going to start by during

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.010 
and then you're going to start by during
curves<00:04:08.900> that<00:04:09.170> follow<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.920> shape<00:04:10.220> of<00:04:10.580> your

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
curves that follow the shape of your

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.420 
curves that follow the shape of your
face<00:04:12.020> so<00:04:12.620> these<00:04:12.770> ones<00:04:13.040> are<00:04:13.130> going<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.310> be

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
face so these ones are going to be

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.120 
face so these ones are going to be
slanting<00:04:13.880> down<00:04:13.910> on<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.420> bottom<00:04:14.570> and<00:04:15.130> these

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
slanting down on the bottom and these

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.280 
slanting down on the bottom and these
are<00:04:16.310> just<00:04:16.370> going<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:16.850> create<00:04:17.420> the<00:04:17.570> basis<00:04:17.989> to

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
are just going to create the basis to

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.350 
are just going to create the basis to
our<00:04:18.530> web<00:04:18.770> pattern<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.550> then<00:04:20.150> you're<00:04:20.330> just

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
our web pattern and then you're just

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.140 
our web pattern and then you're just
going<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.660> just<00:04:20.900> drew<00:04:21.110> one<00:04:21.590> line<00:04:22.280> on<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:22.970> top

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
going to just drew one line on the top

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.230 
going to just drew one line on the top
segment<00:04:23.500> straight<00:04:24.500> diagonally<00:04:25.100> up<00:04:25.310> and<00:04:25.580> then

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
segment straight diagonally up and then

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.880 
segment straight diagonally up and then
you're<00:04:26.390> going<00:04:26.510> to<00:04:26.600> start<00:04:26.930> by<00:04:27.170> drawing<00:04:27.500> see

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
you're going to start by drawing see

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.700 
you're going to start by drawing see
shapes<00:04:28.220> all<00:04:28.580> throughout<00:04:29.420> those<00:04:29.810> segments<00:04:30.590> and

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
shapes all throughout those segments and

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.400 
shapes all throughout those segments and
lines<00:04:31.150> this<00:04:32.150> is<00:04:32.300> again<00:04:32.600> just<00:04:32.870> to<00:04:32.930> create<00:04:33.200> that

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
lines this is again just to create that

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:49.450 
lines this is again just to create that
web<00:04:34.160> spider-man<00:04:35.090> mask<00:04:35.870> effect<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:48.460> then

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
web spider-man mask effect and then

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.120 
web spider-man mask effect and then
you're<00:04:49.610> going<00:04:49.760> to<00:04:49.850> draw<00:04:50.180> a<00:04:50.390> thick<00:04:51.260> line<00:04:51.710> on

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
you're going to draw a thick line on

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.530 
you're going to draw a thick line on
your<00:04:52.640> top<00:04:53.030> lid<00:04:53.390> and<00:04:55.030> you're<00:04:56.030> going<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.300> bring

it all the way in pasture in a corner
and<00:04:59.630> a<00:04:59.990> little<00:05:00.260> point<00:05:00.530> and<00:05:00.800> then<00:05:01.580> you're<00:05:01.730> just

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
and a little point and then you're just

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.990 
and a little point and then you're just
going<00:05:02.150> to<00:05:02.270> do<00:05:02.540> a<00:05:02.840> medium-sized<00:05:03.830> wing<00:05:04.250> on<00:05:04.490> the
