00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
you saw us we did Venus circuit and next

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.140 
you saw us we did Venus circuit and next
part<00:00:25.019> would<00:00:25.170> be<00:00:25.670> Jupiter<00:00:26.670> we're<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.029> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
part would be Jupiter we're going to the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.060 
part would be Jupiter we're going to the
Jupiter<00:00:27.570> circuit<00:00:28.170> now<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.560> we're<00:00:28.680> gonna<00:00:28.740> do

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
Jupiter circuit now so we're gonna do

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.370 
Jupiter circuit now so we're gonna do
Jupiter<00:00:29.820> circuit<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.630> know<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.869> Jupiter's

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
Jupiter circuit you know the Jupiter's

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.620 
Jupiter circuit you know the Jupiter's
ring<00:00:31.949> where's<00:00:32.219> your<00:00:32.430> water<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.210> carbon

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
ring where's your water and carbon

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.720 
ring where's your water and carbon
potable<00:00:34.290> water<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.739> carbon<00:00:35.130> dioxide
