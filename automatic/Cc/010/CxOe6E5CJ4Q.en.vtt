00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello to all today I you 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.150
 found with a new video and in 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.130
 this one I'll show you how I 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.630
 make my two hairstyles the fastest 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.190
 and the most cute I know for 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.190
 spring let's go 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.250
 so weather sir of the first 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:43.809
 hairstyle it's gone 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.640
 and then you will take all your 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:50.559
 hair and you're going to divide it into 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:53.370
 two good of course I attach my little 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.370
 wick so that it does not fall 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.480
 and we'll do something very, very simple 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.649
 is that you're going to do a double 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.649
 very easy knot to make 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.740
 then once you finish you 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.150
 go take two small locks and 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.070
 with a rubber band you go 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.920
 attached so that the double does not stay in 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.210
 good place if you have rubber bands 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.900
 the same color as your hair is 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.550
 always better 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.600
 I lost them so I took a 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.430
 white elastic to finish there is no left 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.450
 more than to camouflage your elastic and to 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.180
 arrange your new hairstyle and 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.710
 here is the cup is already finished I love this 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.780
 look is very chic in the evening and 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.310
 bohemian in the day I like it too much 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.929
 wolf so it's a hairstyle 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.460
 also found on fashion shows 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.560
 and it's a bit my hairstyle goes 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.280
 everywhere so here is now you know 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.280
 how do i call it 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.470
 then we move to the second hairstyle 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.910
 we for this hairstyle you will have 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.050
 need to take a wick enough 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.860
 thick and you separate them by 3 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.860
 make a nice braid 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.790
 after that you will take a break 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.500
 to hold the mat a few 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.500
 moments and not to let it go 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.710
 then what you will do is 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.140
 that you will divide the rest into two 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.120
 of your hair and the same thing one 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:15.430
 redo a braid by including in the 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.840
 small mat should be done so 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:29.500
 take your time because it's not 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:32.550
 complicated at all we do not forget 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.550
 not the little elastic 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.580
 at 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.490
 and here is the result the feet I hope 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.600
 really that you liked 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.130

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.320

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.550
 I have a little preference for 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.260
 second time that the first 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.970
 still decided to push in

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.620
 really feels like you've been 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.060
 very worked but not at all 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.690
 it's very simple to do is very 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.690
 practice especially 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.870
 I love talking in flight I think 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.610

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.379
