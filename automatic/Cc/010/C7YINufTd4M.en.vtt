00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.590 
tested together and I took the first
bite<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.589> saw<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.769> bit<00:00:56.040> off<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.519> so<00:00:57.299> that

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
bite and I saw a bit off like so that

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.270 
bite and I saw a bit off like so that
much<00:00:57.869> oh<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.790> I'm<00:01:00.030> here<00:01:00.330> and<00:01:00.659> then<00:01:01.140> he<00:01:01.589> he

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
much oh and like I'm here and then he he

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.130 
much oh and like I'm here and then he he
took<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.610> second<00:01:03.030> bite<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.540> she's<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.900> top

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
took the second bite and she's the top

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.780 
took the second bite and she's the top
and<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.500> obviously<00:01:04.619> had<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.309> seeds<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.670> it

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and I obviously had all the seeds in it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.670 
and I obviously had all the seeds in it
so<00:01:05.939> i<00:01:05.970> guess<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.659> quite<00:01:06.810> hot<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.560> s

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
so i guess it's quite hot so I in s

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.499 
so i guess it's quite hot so I in s
pretty<00:01:07.950> average<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.640> he's<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:09.000> done<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
pretty average and he's just done in the

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.919 
pretty average and he's just done in the
corner<00:01:09.929> so<00:01:10.469> um<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.359> figured<00:01:12.359> out<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.630> bit<00:01:12.780> left

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:12.929 
corner so um I figured out a bit left

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:15.590 
corner so um I figured out a bit left
out<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.380> be<00:01:13.500> honest<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.100> thought<00:01:14.490> um<00:01:14.789> you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600
