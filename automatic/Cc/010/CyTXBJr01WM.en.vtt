00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
time really to make sure you're doing it

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.910 
time really to make sure you're doing it
with<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.030> spoon<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.630> not<00:01:37.900> in<00:01:38.050> a<00:01:38.110> bottle<00:01:38.470> because

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
with a spoon and not in a bottle because

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.470 
with a spoon and not in a bottle because
that<00:01:39.160> can<00:01:39.340> increase<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.790> chances<00:01:40.150> of<00:01:40.210> them

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
that can increase the chances of them

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.600 
that can increase the chances of them
choking<00:01:40.900> and<00:01:41.020> also<00:01:41.770> increase<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.370> amount<00:01:42.400> of

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
choking and also increase the amount of

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.130 
choking and also increase the amount of
food<00:01:42.760> that<00:01:42.820> they're<00:01:43.120> consuming<00:01:43.480> and<00:01:43.870> it<00:01:43.990> can

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
food that they're consuming and it can

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.930 
food that they're consuming and it can
lead<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:44.590> them<00:01:44.830> gaining<00:01:45.190> too<00:01:45.370> much<00:01:45.400> weight

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
lead to them gaining too much weight

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.060 
lead to them gaining too much weight
so<00:01:46.300> sometimes<00:01:46.900> pediatricians<00:01:47.590> recommend<00:01:47.650> it

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
so sometimes pediatricians recommend it

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.620 
so sometimes pediatricians recommend it
for<00:01:48.100> reflux<00:01:48.520> but<00:01:48.880> if<00:01:48.940> your<00:01:49.060> doctor<00:01:49.330> hasn't

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
for reflux but if your doctor hasn't

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.210 
for reflux but if your doctor hasn't
said<00:01:49.780> anything<00:01:50.020> about<00:01:50.110> doing<00:01:50.410> it<00:01:50.620> then<00:01:51.100> it

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
said anything about doing it then it

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.040 
said anything about doing it then it
would<00:01:51.280> be<00:01:51.400> best<00:01:51.610> to<00:01:51.760> give<00:01:52.000> it<00:01:52.120> in<00:01:52.270> with<00:01:52.660> a<00:01:52.690> spoon

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
would be best to give it in with a spoon

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.930 
would be best to give it in with a spoon
and<00:01:53.260> not<00:01:53.530> in<00:01:53.650> a<00:01:53.710> bottle<00:01:54.010> once<00:01:54.550> you've<00:01:54.700> gotten
