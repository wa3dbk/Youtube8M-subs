00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.859 
they were popped they'd be popped out
just<00:02:08.820> like<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.970> housebreaker<00:02:09.510> would<00:02:09.750> be

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
just like a housebreaker would be

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.770 
just like a housebreaker would be
alright<00:02:10.800> these<00:02:11.040> ones<00:02:11.280> are<00:02:11.430> good<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.300> if<00:02:12.630> this

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
alright these ones are good so if this

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.320 
alright these ones are good so if this
guy's<00:02:12.990> complaint<00:02:13.560> was<00:02:13.890> hey<00:02:14.460> we<00:02:14.730> still<00:02:15.060> have

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
guy's complaint was hey we still have

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.530 
guy's complaint was hey we still have
bad<00:02:16.250> voltage<00:02:17.250> or<00:02:17.580> low<00:02:17.760> power<00:02:18.000> going<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.420> our

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
bad voltage or low power going to our

from this point this is a positive and
the<00:02:25.320> negative<00:02:26.150> I'd<00:02:27.150> want<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.450> go<00:02:27.540> ahead<00:02:27.600> and

if this breaker is good I should have

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.900 
if this breaker is good I should have
also<00:02:34.410> battery<00:02:35.100> power<00:02:35.250> coming<00:02:35.610> out<00:02:35.700> on<00:02:35.760> this

you<00:02:43.170> know<00:02:43.260> your<00:02:43.380> breakers<00:02:43.680> bad<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.070> just<00:02:44.130> need

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
you know your breakers bad you just need

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.340 
you know your breakers bad you just need
to<00:02:44.430> replace<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:44.850> piece<00:02:45.060> here<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.140> we'll<00:02:46.290> go

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
to replace this piece here so we'll go

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.480 
to replace this piece here so we'll go
ahead<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.530> test<00:02:46.770> this<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.130> will<00:02:47.250> show<00:02:47.400> you

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
ahead and test this this will show you

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.340 
ahead and test this this will show you
what<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.670> looks<00:02:47.850> like<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.840> go<00:02:49.020> from<00:02:49.200> there

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
what it looks like and go from there

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.699 
what it looks like and go from there
okay<00:02:49.530> at<00:02:50.310> this<00:02:50.460> point<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:51.030> got<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.709> multimeter

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
okay at this point I got a multimeter

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.460 
okay at this point I got a multimeter
and<00:02:53.310> I'm<00:02:53.580> on<00:02:53.730> voltage<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.959> I've<00:02:55.290> got<00:02:55.440> a

and I'm on voltage and I've got a

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.320 
and I'm on voltage and I've got a
negative<00:02:55.740> my<00:02:56.220> ground<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:56.700> I'd<00:02:56.790> hooked<00:02:57.000> up<00:02:57.150> here

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
negative my ground so I'd hooked up here

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.150 
negative my ground so I'd hooked up here
and<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:58.500> went<00:02:58.620> ahead<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.770> connected<00:02:59.040> my

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
and I went ahead and connected my

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.440 
and I went ahead and connected my
positive<00:02:59.580> up<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.820> positive<00:02:59.970> side<00:03:00.300> of<00:03:00.330> the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
positive up to the positive side of the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.720 
positive up to the positive side of the
battery<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.100> can<00:03:02.220> see<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.370> have<00:03:02.550> eight

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
battery and you can see I have eight

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.240 
battery and you can see I have eight
point<00:03:03.120> one<00:03:03.240> seven<00:03:03.660> volts<00:03:04.080> this<00:03:04.590> battery<00:03:04.980> is

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
point one seven volts this battery is

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.960 
point one seven volts this battery is
weak<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.980> that's<00:03:07.980> testing<00:03:08.459> basically<00:03:08.640> the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
weak so that's testing basically the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.850 
weak so that's testing basically the
battery<00:03:09.239> side<00:03:09.480> now<00:03:09.840> if<00:03:09.930> we<00:03:10.050> want<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.290> test<00:03:10.470> the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
battery side now if we want to test the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.880 
battery side now if we want to test the

point<00:03:30.660> one<00:03:30.780> seven<00:03:31.200> also<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:32.370> breaker<00:03:32.700> was

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
point one seven also this breaker was

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.360 
point one seven also this breaker was
bad<00:03:33.150> obviously<00:03:33.540> we'd<00:03:33.959> have<00:03:34.200> maybe<00:03:34.739> two<00:03:35.040> volts

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
bad obviously we'd have maybe two volts

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.729 
bad obviously we'd have maybe two volts
there<00:03:35.610> 1<00:03:35.910> volt<00:03:36.150> are<00:03:36.540> nothing<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.290> breaker<00:03:37.530> was

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
there 1 volt are nothing the breaker was

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.920 
there 1 volt are nothing the breaker was
popped<00:03:38.090> we<00:03:39.090> would<00:03:39.209> have<00:03:39.300> no<00:03:39.420> voltage<00:03:39.600> there

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
popped we would have no voltage there

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.710 
popped we would have no voltage there
either<00:03:40.790> same<00:03:41.790> with<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.030> other<00:03:42.180> battery<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.600> is

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
either same with the other battery it is

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.199 
either same with the other battery it is
low<00:03:42.930> but<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.410> breakers<00:03:43.860> are<00:03:44.040> good<00:03:44.250> very

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
low but the breakers are good very

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.330 
low but the breakers are good very
simple<00:03:45.540> tests<00:03:45.900> you<00:03:46.440> can<00:03:46.530> do<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.739> yourself<00:03:48.080> and

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
simple tests you can do it yourself and

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.110 
simple tests you can do it yourself and
basically<00:03:50.340> save<00:03:50.610> your<00:03:50.730> time<00:03:50.850> on<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.090> water

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
basically save your time on the water

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.200 
basically save your time on the water
thank<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.050> much
