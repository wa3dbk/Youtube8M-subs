00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.290
 third class of inverted speech layers and 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.799
 structure of the earth department of 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.799
 natural Sciences 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.820
 basic rooms 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.090
 objective to know the layers and the 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.350
 structure that make up the earth 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.730
 let's know more about the layers and 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.950
 terrestrial structures 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.480
 I invite you to pay attention and then 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.590
 complete in your notebook some 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.800
 questions 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.020
 the atmosphere the atmosphere is the layer of 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.570
 most external earth air is 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.380
 composed mainly of nitrogen 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.660
 oxygen and less amount of other gases 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.500
 there are several layers of the atmosphere the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.250
 troposphere mesosphere stratosphere 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.190
 thermosphere and exosphere 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.500
 the hydrosphere is the set of water in 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.900
 the planet in any of its states 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.570
 most of the liquid water is 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.330
 found in the oceans seas and are 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.479
 salt water fresh water is found 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.210
 in rivers lakes or underground lands the 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.550
 water the water vapor is in the 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.880
 atmosphere and when it condenses it forms the 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.880
 clouds 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.799
 the geosphere the geosphere is the part 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.990
 structural of the land that extends 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.420
 from the surface to the interior 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.630
 of the planet the geosphere has three 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.909
 parts the mantle the core and the cortex 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.880
 terrestrial let's get to know them 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.429
 the earth's crust is the most 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.159
 external is solid and consists of 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:41.439
 rocks this layer is very thin in 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.439
 comparison with the size of the earth 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.710
 the mantle the mantle is the mantle of the 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.050
 land that lies between the crust 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.630
 and the core its temperature is very 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:56.450
 elevated and some of its rocks are 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.450
 molten this is called magma 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.579
 and the nucleus is the innermost part and 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.149
 is formed by iron its temperature 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.789
 is higher than the mantle part 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.610
 external core is in a 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.730
 been liquid as we see it take out the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.730
 image 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.720
 and the internal 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.720
 it is in solid state 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.490
 in synthesis the earth is formed by 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.820
 the hydrosphere and geosphere atmosphere and the 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.160
 biosphere is formed by the cortex the 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.990
 mantle and the core 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.640
 now I invite you to answer the 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.670
 following questions in your notebook 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.310
 natural sciences one of what it is 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.580
 the video two write down the concepts 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.250
 important that you could rescue 3 that 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.800
 all this emerged when watching the video very 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.380
 well now you are ready to follow 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.380
 learning in classes until later
