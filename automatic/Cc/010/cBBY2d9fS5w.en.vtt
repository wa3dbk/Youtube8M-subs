00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:06.190 
okay today I'm going to I was gonna

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.769 
okay today I'm going to I was gonna
pickle<00:00:06.550> some<00:00:06.700> beets<00:00:06.880> but<00:00:07.149> I<00:00:07.180> decided<00:00:07.510> to

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:07.779 
pickle some beets but I decided to

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:09.270 
pickle some beets but I decided to
dehydrate<00:00:08.320> them<00:00:08.410> since<00:00:08.650> I<00:00:08.769> still<00:00:08.950> had<00:00:09.160> some

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:09.280 
dehydrate them since I still had some

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.089 
dehydrate them since I still had some
pickled<00:00:09.610> beets<00:00:09.760> and<00:00:10.330> I<00:00:10.839> know<00:00:11.019> my<00:00:11.500> friend<00:00:11.860> has

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:12.099 
pickled beets and I know my friend has

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.690 
pickled beets and I know my friend has
grown<00:00:12.339> a<00:00:12.549> lot<00:00:13.000> of<00:00:13.330> peace<00:00:13.540> this<00:00:13.809> year<00:00:14.110> so<00:00:15.099> I'm

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
grown a lot of peace this year so I'm

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.100 
grown a lot of peace this year so I'm
expecting

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
expecting

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.010 
expecting
I<00:00:17.370> shouldn't<00:00:18.370> say<00:00:18.490> I'm<00:00:18.580> expecting<00:00:19.150> but<00:00:19.330> every

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
I shouldn't say I'm expecting but every

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.450 
I shouldn't say I'm expecting but every
year<00:00:20.230> she<00:00:20.470> gives<00:00:20.740> me<00:00:20.920> a<00:00:20.950> lot<00:00:21.160> because<00:00:21.280> she

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
year she gives me a lot because she

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.660 
year she gives me a lot because she
grows<00:00:21.730> a<00:00:21.760> lot<00:00:22.060> of<00:00:22.210> them<00:00:22.360> so<00:00:22.630> I<00:00:22.980> will<00:00:23.980> probably

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
grows a lot of them so I will probably

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.430 
grows a lot of them so I will probably
be<00:00:24.820> getting<00:00:25.120> more<00:00:25.330> to<00:00:25.540> tickle<00:00:25.870> later<00:00:26.080> in<00:00:26.320> the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440 
be getting more to tickle later in the

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.080 
be getting more to tickle later in the
year<00:00:26.620> so<00:00:26.680> I<00:00:26.920> decided<00:00:26.980> I'd<00:00:27.430> rather<00:00:27.610> just<00:00:27.910> go

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
year so I decided I'd rather just go

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.930 
year so I decided I'd rather just go
ahead<00:00:28.390> and<00:00:28.720> put<00:00:29.560> this<00:00:29.740> caliber<00:00:30.340> to<00:00:30.400> work<00:00:30.610> since

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 
ahead and put this caliber to work since

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.720 
ahead and put this caliber to work since
I<00:00:31.090> hadn't<00:00:31.450> used<00:00:31.990> it<00:00:32.259> in<00:00:32.529> probably<00:00:33.160> a<00:00:33.370> week<00:00:33.550> or

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
I hadn't used it in probably a week or

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.110 
I hadn't used it in probably a week or
two<00:00:33.910> and<00:00:34.570> keep<00:00:35.560> migrating<00:00:36.100> so<00:00:36.340> duck<00:00:36.550> use<00:00:36.910> them

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
two and keep migrating so duck use them

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.330 
two and keep migrating so duck use them
for<00:00:37.330> later<00:00:37.540> fur<00:00:37.930> like<00:00:38.260> I<00:00:38.410> can<00:00:38.590> rehydrate<00:00:38.860> them

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
for later fur like I can rehydrate them

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.000 
for later fur like I can rehydrate them
and<00:00:39.520> roast<00:00:39.730> them<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.600> use<00:00:41.560> them<00:00:41.740> in<00:00:41.800> other

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
and roast them and use them in other

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.060 
and roast them and use them in other
ways<00:00:42.670> so<00:00:43.450> it'll<00:00:44.170> give<00:00:44.290> me<00:00:44.470> a<00:00:44.500> few<00:00:44.710> more<00:00:44.860> options

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
ways so it'll give me a few more options

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.180 
ways so it'll give me a few more options
than<00:00:45.550> just<00:00:45.579> pickled<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.680> first<00:00:47.860> thing<00:00:48.070> of

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
than just pickled so the first thing of

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.630 
than just pickled so the first thing of
course<00:00:48.460> we<00:00:48.610> want<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:48.850> do<00:00:49.030> is<00:00:49.300> wash<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:51.460> want

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
course we want to do is wash we want

00:00:51.640 --> 00:01:01.430 
course we want to do is wash we want
them<00:00:51.880> relatively<00:00:52.450> clean<00:00:58.320> every<00:00:59.320> one<00:00:59.500> of<00:00:59.530> them

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
them relatively clean every one of them

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.590 
them relatively clean every one of them
okay<00:01:02.440> so<00:01:02.800> I've<00:01:03.610> got<00:01:03.670> them<00:01:03.940> all<00:01:04.059> washed<00:01:04.329> and<00:01:04.540> I

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
okay so I've got them all washed and I

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.599 
okay so I've got them all washed and I
put<00:01:04.780> them<00:01:04.869> in<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:04.989> pot<00:01:05.199> I'm<00:01:05.890> going<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.429> bring

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:06.609 
put them in a pot I'm going to bring

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:08.700 
put them in a pot I'm going to bring
them<00:01:06.759> to<00:01:06.939> a<00:01:06.969> boil<00:01:07.359> and<00:01:07.840> I'm<00:01:08.020> gonna<00:01:08.259> cook<00:01:08.499> them

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
them to a boil and I'm gonna cook them

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.379 
them to a boil and I'm gonna cook them
just<00:01:09.609> until<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:11.439> outsides<00:01:12.009> can<00:01:12.939> be<00:01:13.060> peeled

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:13.389 
just until the outsides can be peeled

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:15.419 
just until the outsides can be peeled
the<00:01:13.780> peeling<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.619> outside<00:01:15.100> will<00:01:15.189> start

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
the peeling the outside will start

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.279 
the peeling the outside will start
coming<00:01:15.579> loose<00:01:15.939> then<00:01:16.600> I'll<00:01:16.719> peel<00:01:16.960> them<00:01:17.139> off<00:01:17.259> and

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
coming loose then I'll peel them off and

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.669 
coming loose then I'll peel them off and
I'll<00:01:17.709> slice<00:01:18.069> them<00:01:18.310> nice<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.549> thin<00:01:18.850> but<00:01:19.810> as<00:01:20.469> you

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
I'll slice them nice and thin but as you

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:22.499 
I'll slice them nice and thin but as you
see<00:01:20.859> another<00:01:21.159> reason<00:01:21.369> why<00:01:21.700> I'm<00:01:21.819> dehydrating

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
see another reason why I'm dehydrating

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.629 
see another reason why I'm dehydrating
instead<00:01:22.840> of<00:01:22.959> pickling<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.560> because<00:01:24.340> there's

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:24.639 
instead of pickling is because there's

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:27.539 
instead of pickling is because there's
not<00:01:25.179> that<00:01:25.240> many<00:01:25.630> of<00:01:25.869> them<00:01:26.020> right<00:01:26.259> now<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:26.859> it's

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
not that many of them right now so it's

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.459 
not that many of them right now so it's
not<00:01:27.579> really<00:01:27.969> worth<00:01:28.119> going<00:01:28.450> through<00:01:28.479> you<00:01:29.350> know

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
not really worth going through you know

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:30.809 
not really worth going through you know
the<00:01:29.649> water<00:01:29.829> bath<00:01:30.039> thing<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.399> all<00:01:30.490> that<00:01:30.670> to

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
the water bath thing and all that to

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.489 
the water bath thing and all that to
pickle<00:01:31.149> them<00:01:31.329> so<00:01:32.459> anyway<00:01:33.719> we'll<00:01:34.719> go<00:01:34.899> ahead<00:01:35.170> and

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 
pickle them so anyway we'll go ahead and

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:37.800 
pickle them so anyway we'll go ahead and
bring<00:01:36.429> them<00:01:36.579> to<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:36.729> boil<00:01:36.999> and<00:01:37.270> when<00:01:37.539> they<00:01:37.659> get

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
bring them to a boil and when they get

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.199 
bring them to a boil and when they get
the<00:01:38.170> beets<00:01:38.319> are<00:01:38.499> boiling

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
the beets are boiling

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:46.529 
the beets are boiling
let<00:01:40.209> me<00:01:40.389> check<00:01:41.380> them<00:01:43.469> see<00:01:45.029> ya<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:46.299> they're

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
let me check them see ya and they're

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.969 
let me check them see ya and they're
still<00:01:47.249> do<00:01:48.249> you<00:01:48.369> sorry<00:01:48.819> about<00:01:49.029> that<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:50.799> can

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
still do you sorry about that you can

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.679 
still do you sorry about that you can
just<00:01:51.159> barely

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.719 

so<00:01:55.689> not<00:01:56.079> quite<00:01:56.469> ready<00:01:56.829> because<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:57.369> want<00:01:57.579> the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
so not quite ready because you want the

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.770 
so not quite ready because you want the
peel<00:01:57.969> so<00:01:58.329> that<00:01:59.579> it<00:02:00.579> is<00:02:00.850> coming<00:02:01.329> loose<00:02:01.689> easily

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
peel so that it is coming loose easily

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.480 
peel so that it is coming loose easily
they<00:02:04.780> won't<00:02:05.020> be<00:02:05.140> real<00:02:05.649> soft<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.310> beats

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
they won't be real soft the beats

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.279 
they won't be real soft the beats
themselves<00:02:07.240> but<00:02:07.450> they'll<00:02:07.659> be<00:02:07.780> sliceable

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
themselves but they'll be sliceable

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.280 
themselves but they'll be sliceable
pretty<00:02:08.709> easy<00:02:11.910> okay<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.239> here's<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.870> test<00:02:14.080> it's

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
pretty easy okay so here's the test it's

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.830 
pretty easy okay so here's the test it's
kind<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.650> fork-tender<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.550> if<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.480> take<00:02:16.810> a

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
kind of fork-tender and if you take a

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.580 
kind of fork-tender and if you take a
knife<00:02:17.200> or<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.680> fork<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.430> scrape<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:20.440> can

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
knife or a fork and scrape it you can

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.710 
knife or a fork and scrape it you can
see<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.130> peel<00:02:21.459> is<00:02:22.000> starting<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.540> come

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720

I<00:02:46.239> can<00:02:46.480> use<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:47.049> dye<00:02:47.200> my<00:02:47.470> yarns<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.250> things

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
I can use to dye my yarns and things

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.880 
I can use to dye my yarns and things
like<00:02:48.579> that<00:02:48.640> with<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.660> don't<00:02:49.870> waste<00:02:50.079> the

like that with so I don't waste the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:58.520 
like that with so I don't waste the
water<00:02:51.640> from<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.060> beads

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.080 

okay<00:02:59.640> and<00:03:00.650> here's<00:03:01.650> how<00:03:02.520> they<00:03:02.670> look<00:03:02.910> like

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
okay and here's how they look like

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.300 
okay and here's how they look like
arranged<00:03:03.780> on<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.020> tray<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.830> want<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.160> get

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
arranged on the tray you want to get

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.570 
arranged on the tray you want to get
them<00:03:05.580> roughly<00:03:06.450> between<00:03:06.930> an<00:03:07.650> eighth<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.460> an

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
them roughly between an eighth of an

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.570 
them roughly between an eighth of an
inch<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.770> 1/4<00:03:10.770> of<00:03:11.190> an<00:03:11.340> inch<00:03:13.220> easier<00:03:14.220> said<00:03:14.460> than

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
inch and 1/4 of an inch easier said than

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.070 
inch and 1/4 of an inch easier said than
done<00:03:14.640> sometimes<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.510> know<00:03:15.630> how<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:15.900> when

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
done sometimes you know how it is when

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.650 
done sometimes you know how it is when
you're<00:03:16.200> slicing<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:17.010> anywhere<00:03:17.970> in<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.300> area

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
you're slicing so anywhere in that area

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
you're slicing so anywhere in that area
is<00:03:18.720> fine

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
is fine

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.990 
is fine
it'll<00:03:19.890> just<00:03:19.920> if<00:03:20.340> they're<00:03:20.550> little<00:03:20.700> thicker

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
it'll just if they're little thicker

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.940 
it'll just if they're little thicker
they<00:03:21.330> take<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.540> little<00:03:21.780> longer<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:22.290> dehydrate

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
they take a little longer to dehydrate

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.850 
they take a little longer to dehydrate
and<00:03:23.190> rehydrate<00:03:23.880> but<00:03:24.600> it's<00:03:24.959> not<00:03:25.350> really<00:03:25.830> that

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
and rehydrate but it's not really that

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.520 
and rehydrate but it's not really that
big<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.459> deal<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:28.940> I'll<00:03:29.940> put<00:03:30.120> them<00:03:30.209> in<00:03:30.530> and

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
big of a deal and I'll put them in and

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.170 
big of a deal and I'll put them in and
luckily<00:03:32.520> my<00:03:33.050> Excalibur<00:03:34.050> here<00:03:34.530> tells<00:03:34.890> me<00:03:35.180> which

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
luckily my Excalibur here tells me which

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.960 
luckily my Excalibur here tells me which
one<00:03:36.450> is<00:03:36.750> for<00:03:37.110> fruits<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.709> vegetables<00:03:38.220> so<00:03:38.610> it's

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
one is for fruits and vegetables so it's

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.600 
one is for fruits and vegetables so it's
real<00:03:39.209> easy<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.780> will<00:03:40.440> put<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:40.860> on<00:03:41.360> 125<00:03:43.610> it'll

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
real easy I will put it on 125 it'll

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.670 
real easy I will put it on 125 it'll
take<00:03:44.820> map<00:03:45.360> I'm<00:03:45.660> gonna<00:03:45.900> guess<00:03:46.110> because<00:03:46.350> some<00:03:46.590> of

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
take map I'm gonna guess because some of

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.130 
take map I'm gonna guess because some of
these<00:03:46.739> are<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:46.980> little<00:03:47.100> thicker<00:03:47.400> 4<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.450> 6<00:03:48.690> hours

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
these are a little thicker 4 to 6 hours

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.620 
these are a little thicker 4 to 6 hours
but<00:03:49.800> I<00:03:50.130> don't<00:03:50.640> know<00:03:50.700> we'll<00:03:51.120> check<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:51.510> I'll

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
but I don't know we'll check and I'll

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:59.840 
but I don't know we'll check and I'll
let<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:51.930> know<00:03:52.050> when<00:03:52.230> we're<00:03:52.410> done

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:12.000 

there<00:04:00.850> it<00:04:01.000> is<00:04:01.800> everything's

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.870 

so<00:04:13.010> my<00:04:13.489> cute<00:04:13.790> back<00:04:14.739> definitely<00:04:15.739> easier<00:04:16.609> to<00:04:16.730> do

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
so my cute back definitely easier to do

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
are already getting to the point

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.800
