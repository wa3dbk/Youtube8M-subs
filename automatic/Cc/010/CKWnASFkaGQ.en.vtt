new suckers

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.100 
new suckers
we<00:02:25.740> have<00:02:25.890> also<00:02:26.070> applied<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:27.030> uuf<00:02:27.480> technology

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
we have also applied the uuf technology

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.949 
we have also applied the uuf technology
to<00:02:28.320> our<00:02:28.530> own<00:02:29.330> circus<00:02:30.330> that's<00:02:30.450> used<00:02:30.720> for<00:02:30.900> the

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
to our own circus that's used for the

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.250 
to our own circus that's used for the
active<00:02:31.290> shielding<00:02:31.740> on<00:02:31.950> our<00:02:32.100> cables

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
active shielding on our cables

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.720 
active shielding on our cables
tremendous<00:02:34.260> improvement<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.459> where<00:02:35.640> does

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
tremendous improvement so where does

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.470 
tremendous improvement so where does
this<00:02:35.880> go

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
this go

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.840 
this go
it<00:02:37.260> goes<00:02:37.440> on<00:02:37.650> if<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.890> look<00:02:38.040> up<00:02:38.190> on<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.459> cables

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
it goes on if you look up on you cables

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.340 
it goes on if you look up on you cables
here<00:02:38.970> I'll<00:02:39.090> show<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.330> here<00:02:41.930> over<00:02:42.930> here<00:02:43.140> we

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
here I'll show you here over here we

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.949 
here I'll show you here over here we
have<00:02:43.560> one<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.400> our<00:02:44.580> cables<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:45.840> an

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
have one of our cables this is an

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.070 
have one of our cables this is an
element<00:02:46.350> copper<00:02:46.770> interconnect<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:47.970> these<00:02:48.840> we

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
element copper interconnect and these we

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.230 
element copper interconnect and these we
apply<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.380> 32<00:02:49.800> volt<00:02:49.950> DC<00:02:50.130> bias<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.850> outside

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
apply a 32 volt DC bias to the outside

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.880 
apply a 32 volt DC bias to the outside
shielded<00:02:51.690> cable<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.140> make<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.380> an<00:02:52.500> active

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
shielded cable to make it an active

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.910 
shielded cable to make it an active
shielded<00:02:53.250> cable<00:02:53.640> if<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:55.200> power<00:02:55.410> supply<00:02:55.590> that

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
shielded cable if the power supply that

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.650 
shielded cable if the power supply that
goes<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.370> here<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.760> damn<00:02:57.030> short<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.570> will

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
goes in here so damn short it will

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.150 
goes in here so damn short it will
obviously<00:02:57.930> burn<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.290> out<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:58.830> you've<00:02:58.950> got<00:02:59.070> to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
obviously burn it out so you've got to

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.310 
obviously burn it out so you've got to
create<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.459> load<00:02:59.760> flag<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.570> that's<00:03:01.080> what<00:03:01.230> these

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
create a load flag and that's what these

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.050 
create a load flag and that's what these
circuits<00:03:01.769> do<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.130> plug<00:03:02.370> them<00:03:02.519> in<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.910> blue

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
circuits do you plug them in the blue

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.240 
circuits do you plug them in the blue
LED<00:03:03.360> light<00:03:03.540> will<00:03:03.930> come<00:03:04.110> on<00:03:04.220> indicating<00:03:05.220> that

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
LED light will come on indicating that

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.600 
LED light will come on indicating that
the<00:03:05.550> active<00:03:06.480> shield<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:06.900> active<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.370> also

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
the active shield is active but it also

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.310 
the active shield is active but it also
created<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.180> load<00:03:09.360> for<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.600> powers<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:09.989> five

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
created a load for the powers of five

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.350 
created a load for the powers of five
now<00:03:10.739> where<00:03:10.890> does<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.040> power<00:03:11.160> supply<00:03:11.580> go<00:03:11.790> it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
now where does the power supply go it

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.180 
now where does the power supply go it
goes<00:03:12.540> into<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:13.019> other<00:03:13.320> picture<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:14.040> other

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
goes into this other picture the other

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.460 
goes into this other picture the other
pigtail<00:03:14.670> yeah<00:03:14.880> mm-hmm

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
pigtail yeah mm-hmm

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.830 
pigtail yeah mm-hmm
so<00:03:16.860> depending<00:03:17.250> on<00:03:17.340> how<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:18.180> circuit<00:03:18.690> is

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
so depending on how the circuit is

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.710 
so depending on how the circuit is
designed<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.709> has<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.340> form<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.300> voicing

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
designed it has a form of voicing

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.720 
designed it has a form of voicing
towards<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.260> gray<00:03:22.530> will<00:03:23.130> be<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> warmer

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
towards the gray will be a warmer

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.560 
towards the gray will be a warmer
