00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.450 
durability in the toe so it's a little
bit<00:02:01.429> of<00:02:01.580> protection<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:02.270> then<00:02:02.979> Greg<00:02:03.979> went<00:02:04.250> and

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
bit of protection and then Greg went and

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.300 
bit of protection and then Greg went and
redesign<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.420> sole<00:02:05.689> so<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:06.649> it's<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:06.979> full

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
redesign the sole so so it's a full

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.859 
redesign the sole so so it's a full
carbon<00:02:07.610> outsole<00:02:08.030> although<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.630> can't<00:02:08.810> see

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
carbon outsole although you can't see

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.140 
carbon outsole although you can't see
all<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.170> carbon<00:02:09.500> it's<00:02:09.649> it's<00:02:10.039> extremely<00:02:10.970> rigid

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
all the carbon it's it's extremely rigid

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.390 
all the carbon it's it's extremely rigid
so<00:02:12.049> it's<00:02:12.230> really<00:02:12.500> just<00:02:12.709> efficient<00:02:13.160> for<00:02:13.310> when

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
so it's really just efficient for when

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.100 
so it's really just efficient for when
you're<00:02:13.519> pedaling<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:14.510> what<00:02:14.690> we<00:02:14.780> did<00:02:14.930> is<00:02:15.080> we

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
you're pedaling and what we did is we

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.080 
you're pedaling and what we did is we
covered<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.739> with<00:02:16.069> this<00:02:16.250> urethane<00:02:16.730> in<00:02:16.940> that

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
covered it with this urethane in that

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.390 
covered it with this urethane in that
kind<00:02:17.299> of<00:02:17.360> petal<00:02:18.200> stomps<00:02:18.590> on<00:02:18.739> so<00:02:19.069> if<00:02:19.250> you're

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
kind of petal stomps on so if you're

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.759 
kind of petal stomps on so if you're
clipping<00:02:20.180> out<00:02:20.299> of<00:02:20.420> your<00:02:20.510> pedals<00:02:20.780> when<00:02:20.989> you<00:02:21.110> try

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
clipping out of your pedals when you try

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.020 
clipping out of your pedals when you try
to<00:02:21.799> step<00:02:22.069> back<00:02:22.160> on<00:02:22.310> your<00:02:22.459> pedal<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:22.850> don't

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
to step back on your pedal and you don't

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.539 
to step back on your pedal and you don't
quite<00:02:23.299> clip<00:02:23.600> in<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:24.530> have<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:24.799> grippy<00:02:25.370> zone

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
quite clip in you have this grippy zone

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.300 
quite clip in you have this grippy zone
which<00:02:25.730> really<00:02:25.970> helps<00:02:26.709> extremely<00:02:27.709> stiff<00:02:27.980> and

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
which really helps extremely stiff and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.400 
which really helps extremely stiff and
durable<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.060> nice<00:02:29.720> thing<00:02:29.750> about<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.290> is

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
durable and the nice thing about it is

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.530 
durable and the nice thing about it is
it's<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.830> race<00:02:31.040> level<00:02:31.370> shoe<00:02:31.580> but<00:02:31.850> it's<00:02:32.390> also

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
it's a race level shoe but it's also

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.250 
it's a race level shoe but it's also
very<00:02:32.750> walkable<00:02:33.049> as<00:02:33.349> well<00:02:33.560> whoa
