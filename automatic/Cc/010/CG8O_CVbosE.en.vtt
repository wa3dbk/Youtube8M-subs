00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.640 
alright guys welcome to your 16th
computer<00:00:02.909> networking<00:00:03.240> tutorial<00:00:03.870> and<00:00:04.049> in<00:00:04.620> this

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
computer networking tutorial and in this

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.380 
computer networking tutorial and in this
video<00:00:05.100> I<00:00:05.370> want<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.819> talk<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.060> you<00:00:06.120> guys<00:00:06.210> about

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
video I want to talk to you guys about

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.459 
video I want to talk to you guys about
the<00:00:06.600> OSI<00:00:07.529> model<00:00:08.429> now<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.179> OSI<00:00:09.900> model<00:00:09.929> is

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
the OSI model now the OSI model is

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.020 
the OSI model now the OSI model is
something<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.099> confuses<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.670> lot<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.940> people

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
something that confuses a lot of people

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.419 
something that confuses a lot of people
but<00:00:12.900> it's<00:00:13.080> actually<00:00:13.469> an<00:00:13.620> incredibly<00:00:14.219> useful

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
but it's actually an incredibly useful

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.060 
but it's actually an incredibly useful
model<00:00:14.969> if<00:00:15.179> taught<00:00:15.570> correctly<00:00:16.109> for<00:00:16.619> not<00:00:16.770> only

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
model if taught correctly for not only

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.040 
model if taught correctly for not only
understanding<00:00:17.699> how<00:00:17.910> computer<00:00:18.390> networks<00:00:18.750> work

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
understanding how computer networks work

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.090 
understanding how computer networks work
but<00:00:19.590> also<00:00:19.800> specifically<00:00:20.699> how<00:00:21.090> two<00:00:21.150> computers

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
but also specifically how two computers

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.620 
but also specifically how two computers
communicate<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:23.250> each<00:00:23.369> other<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:23.880> if<00:00:24.510> you

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
communicate with each other so if you

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.269 
communicate with each other so if you
had<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> hard<00:00:25.109> time<00:00:25.320> understanding<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:26.130> know

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
had a hard time understanding you know

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.700 
had a hard time understanding you know
the<00:00:26.730> big<00:00:27.060> picture<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.900> computer<00:00:28.349> networking

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the big picture of computer networking

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.380 
the big picture of computer networking
and<00:00:29.099> how<00:00:29.220> everything<00:00:29.699> was<00:00:29.789> kind<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.300> know

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
and how everything was kind of you know

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.330 
and how everything was kind of you know
piece<00:00:30.660> together<00:00:30.869> what<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:31.920> model<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.309> going

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
piece together what this model is going

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.610 
piece together what this model is going
to<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.850> not<00:00:33.420> only<00:00:33.450> give<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> really<00:00:34.469> good

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
to do is not only give you a really good

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.889 
to do is not only give you a really good
broad<00:00:35.010> overview<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.329> also<00:00:36.540> going<00:00:36.840> to

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
broad overview but it's also going to

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.500 
broad overview but it's also going to
take<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> individual<00:00:37.739> pieces<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.579> clarify

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
take the individual pieces and clarify

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.220 
take the individual pieces and clarify
how<00:00:39.780> each<00:00:40.050> part<00:00:40.350> works<00:00:40.649> part<00:00:41.489> by<00:00:41.910> part<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:43.050> what

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
how each part works part by part so what

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.229 
how each part works part by part so what
it<00:00:43.320> does<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.770> basically<00:00:43.890> starts<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
it does is it basically starts with the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.869 
it does is it basically starts with the
user<00:00:45.510> experience<00:00:45.629> basically<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.039> looking<00:00:47.789> at

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
user experience basically you looking at

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.330 
user experience basically you looking at
your<00:00:48.000> computer<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:49.260> explains<00:00:49.649> everything

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
your computer and it explains everything

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.400 
your computer and it explains everything
all<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.820> way<00:00:50.940> down<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.570> when<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.840> know<00:00:52.170> those

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
all the way down to when you know those

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.709 
all the way down to when you know those
electric<00:00:53.190> signals<00:00:53.670> are<00:00:53.879> traveling<00:00:54.420> across

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
electric signals are traveling across

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.529 
electric signals are traveling across
copper<00:00:55.379> wire<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.590> another<00:00:56.100> computer<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.360> it

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
copper wire to another computer so it

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.610 
copper wire to another computer so it
does<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.469> form<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.949> layers<00:00:59.730> now<00:01:00.620> this

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
does this in the form of layers now this

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
does this in the form of layers now this
model<00:01:01.890> calls<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.699> know<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.300> different<00:01:03.629> parts

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
model calls you know the different parts

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.960 
model calls you know the different parts
of<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:03.989> layers<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> layers<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.850> this

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
of it layers but the layers in this

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.550 
of it layers but the layers in this
model<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.510> basically<00:01:06.960> just<00:01:07.260> different

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
model are basically just different

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.609 
model are basically just different
pieces<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.520> how<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> computer<00:01:10.049> network<00:01:10.350> works

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
pieces of how a computer network works

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.280 
pieces of how a computer network works
now<00:01:11.400> like<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.700> said<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.090> starts<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:13.170> know

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
now like I said it starts with you know

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710 
now like I said it starts with you know
just<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.830> your<00:01:14.640> user<00:01:14.909> experience<00:01:15.540> you

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
just you your user experience you

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.450 
just you your user experience you
looking<00:01:16.049> at<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> computer<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.220> first

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
looking at the computer and the first

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.670 
looking at the computer and the first
layer<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.880> called<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:21.470> application<00:01:22.470> layer

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
layer is called the application layer

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.039 
layer is called the application layer
now<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.909> basically<00:01:24.330> software

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
now this is basically software

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.140 
now this is basically software
applications<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.250> basically<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.880> user

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
applications it's basically the user

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.179 
applications it's basically the user
looking<00:01:28.020> at<00:01:28.140> whatever<00:01:28.409> program<00:01:28.890> they<00:01:29.070> have

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
looking at whatever program they have

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.460 
looking at whatever program they have
running<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.729> computer<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:31.200> layer

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
running on the computer now this layer

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.230 
running on the computer now this layer
usually<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.460> know<00:01:32.549> involves<00:01:32.970> things<00:01:33.150> like

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
usually you know involves things like

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.270 
usually you know involves things like
Firefox<00:01:34.100> arm<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:36.450> know<00:01:36.570> Google<00:01:37.079> Chrome<00:01:37.470> those

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
Firefox arm you know Google Chrome those

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.830 
Firefox arm you know Google Chrome those
are<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.759> know<00:01:38.790> probably<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.390> two<00:01:39.570> biggest

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
are you know probably the two biggest

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.289 
are you know probably the two biggest
ones<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.439> users<00:01:41.130> use<00:01:41.460> whenever<00:01:42.119> they're

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
ones that users use whenever they're

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.359 
ones that users use whenever they're
networking<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.110> also<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:44.009> whatever

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
networking and also you know whatever

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.940 
networking and also you know whatever
program<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.090> use<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.869> email<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.439> stuff<00:01:46.649> it's

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
program you use for email and stuff it's

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.359 
program you use for email and stuff it's
basically<00:01:47.750> software<00:01:48.750> applications<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:50.310> is

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
basically software applications this is

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.520 
basically software applications this is
the<00:01:50.670> layer<00:01:50.790> again<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.390> said<00:01:51.450> closest<00:01:52.229> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the layer again like I said closest to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.560 
the layer again like I said closest to
the<00:01:52.649> user<00:01:52.950> experience<00:01:53.610> software

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
the user experience software

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.260 
the user experience software
applications<00:01:55.110> or<00:01:55.259> programs<00:01:55.820> now<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> next

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
applications or programs now the next

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.090 
applications or programs now the next
layer<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.630> called<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> presentation

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.780 

the<00:02:02.030> presentation<00:02:03.020> layer<00:02:03.229> now<00:02:04.070> this<00:02:04.400> is<00:02:04.670> the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
the presentation layer now this is the

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.180 
the presentation layer now this is the
layer<00:02:04.970> that<00:02:05.210> your<00:02:05.390> operating<00:02:05.900> system<00:02:06.320> works

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
layer that your operating system works

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.940 
layer that your operating system works
on<00:02:07.810> now<00:02:08.810> what<00:02:09.020> this<00:02:09.170> does<00:02:09.229> is<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.830> basically

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
on now what this does is it basically

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.980 
on now what this does is it basically
converts<00:02:10.820> text<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.420> user<00:02:11.480> can

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
converts text that the user can

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.970 
converts text that the user can
understand<00:02:12.470> like<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.670> know<00:02:13.790> letters<00:02:14.270> in

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
understand like you know letters in

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.140 
understand like you know letters in
numbers<00:02:18.250> because<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.400> course<00:02:19.610> whenever<00:02:19.820> you

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
numbers because of course whenever you

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.330 
numbers because of course whenever you
type<00:02:20.330> something<00:02:20.600> into<00:02:20.990> your<00:02:21.020> email<00:02:21.470> you're

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
type something into your email you're

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.310 
type something into your email you're
typing<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:22.850> know<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.270> basic<00:02:23.630> letters<00:02:23.900> and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
typing you know just basic letters and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.960 
typing you know just basic letters and
numbers<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.890> language<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:25.640> can

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
numbers a language that you can

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.180 
numbers a language that you can
understand<00:02:26.510> but<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.470> isn't<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> language

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
understand but that isn't the language

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.310 
understand but that isn't the language
that<00:02:28.490> your<00:02:28.610> computer<00:02:29.150> can<00:02:29.360> understand<00:02:29.840> your

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
that your computer can understand your

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.040 
that your computer can understand your
computer<00:02:30.920> actually<00:02:31.390> one<00:02:32.390> of<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.600> languages

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
computer actually one of the languages

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.920 
computer actually one of the languages
that<00:02:33.340> understands<00:02:34.340> is<00:02:34.720> something<00:02:35.720> called

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
that understands is something called

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.560 
that understands is something called
ASCII<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:36.760> this<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.090> know<00:02:38.209> we'll<00:02:38.450> talk

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
ASCII and this is you know we'll talk

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.090 
ASCII and this is you know we'll talk
about<00:02:38.720> different<00:02:38.959> you<00:02:39.380> know<00:02:39.500> languages<00:02:39.980> and

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
about different you know languages and

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.040 
about different you know languages and
stuff<00:02:40.250> like<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.580> later<00:02:40.820> on<00:02:40.910> but<00:02:41.600> this<00:02:41.870> is

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
stuff like that later on but this is

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.800 
stuff like that later on but this is
basically<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.770> very<00:02:43.250> simple<00:02:43.520> language<00:02:44.450> that

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
basically a very simple language that

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.720 
basically a very simple language that
you<00:02:44.870> computer<00:02:45.290> can<00:02:45.470> understand<00:02:46.010> because<00:02:46.130> you

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
you computer can understand because you

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.640 
you computer can understand because you
know<00:02:46.820> it<00:02:47.030> can't<00:02:47.239> understand<00:02:47.660> English<00:02:48.320> like

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
know it can't understand English like

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.290 
know it can't understand English like
you<00:02:48.680> can<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.160> needs<00:02:49.310> its<00:02:49.459> own<00:02:49.580> special<00:02:50.120> thing

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
you can it needs its own special thing

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.360 
you can it needs its own special thing
so<00:02:50.930> that's<00:02:51.170> what<00:02:51.350> your<00:02:51.470> operating<00:02:51.980> system

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
so that's what your operating system

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.670 
so that's what your operating system
does<00:02:52.580> in<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:53.000> layer<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.780> converts<00:02:54.230> text<00:02:54.590> that

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
does in this layer it converts text that

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.410 
does in this layer it converts text that
the<00:02:54.830> user<00:02:54.860> can<00:02:55.310> understand<00:02:55.760> like<00:02:55.910> letters<00:02:56.239> and

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
the user can understand like letters and

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.210 
the user can understand like letters and
numbers<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:57.200> basically<00:02:57.560> stuff<00:02:57.920> that<00:02:58.070> the

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
numbers to basically stuff that the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.850 
numbers to basically stuff that the
computer<00:02:58.850> can<00:02:59.060> understand<00:02:59.570> and<00:02:59.840> it<00:03:00.470> just

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
computer can understand and it just

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.920 
computer can understand and it just
makes<00:03:01.070> it<00:03:01.280> more<00:03:01.580> easy<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.209> work<00:03:02.480> with<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.780> data

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
makes it more easy to work with the data

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.440 
makes it more easy to work with the data
when<00:03:03.260> it's<00:03:03.410> in<00:03:03.560> this<00:03:03.950> form<00:03:04.010> right<00:03:04.519> here<00:03:04.550> now

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
when it's in this form right here now

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.759 
when it's in this form right here now
another<00:03:05.690> thing<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.170> presentation

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
another thing that the presentation

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.490 
another thing that the presentation
layer<00:03:06.950> does<00:03:07.220> is<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.850> also<00:03:08.000> encrypts<00:03:08.870> data<00:03:08.930> and

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
layer does is it also encrypts data and

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.130 
layer does is it also encrypts data and
whenever<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.250> say<00:03:10.489> encrypts<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.269> I<00:03:11.299> mean<00:03:11.720> put

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
whenever I say encrypts that I mean put

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.390 
whenever I say encrypts that I mean put
a<00:03:12.170> special<00:03:12.560> code<00:03:12.860> on<00:03:13.040> it

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
a special code on it

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.670 
a special code on it
so<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:13.850> hackers<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.810> know<00:03:14.930> just<00:03:15.230> can't<00:03:15.410> tap

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
so that hackers you know just can't tap

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.650 
so that hackers you know just can't tap
into<00:03:15.920> it<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.160> steal<00:03:16.459> your<00:03:16.640> data<00:03:16.850> look<00:03:17.360> you

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
into it and steal your data look you

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.699 
into it and steal your data look you
know<00:03:17.780> what<00:03:17.959> you're<00:03:18.110> sending<00:03:18.440> it<00:03:18.530> in<00:03:18.620> your

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
know what you're sending it in your

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.410 
know what you're sending it in your
email<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.130> stuff<00:03:19.310> like<00:03:19.459> that<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:20.150> we'll<00:03:20.299> talk

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
email and stuff like that and we'll talk

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.030 
email and stuff like that and we'll talk
more<00:03:20.630> about<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.989> presentation<00:03:21.590> layer<00:03:21.739> later

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
more about the presentation layer later

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.100 
more about the presentation layer later
on<00:03:22.250> but<00:03:22.880> just<00:03:22.940> remember<00:03:23.420> right<00:03:23.600> now<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:23.959> it's

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
on but just remember right now that it's

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.990 
on but just remember right now that it's
the<00:03:24.350> layer<00:03:24.560> that<00:03:24.799> your<00:03:25.010> operating<00:03:25.579> system

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
the layer that your operating system

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.930 
the layer that your operating system
resides<00:03:26.510> on<00:03:26.860> now<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:27.950> next<00:03:28.459> layer<00:03:28.670> is

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
resides on now the next layer is

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.090 
resides on now the next layer is
actually<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:31.420> session<00:03:32.420> layer<00:03:32.630> now<00:03:33.590> if<00:03:33.950> you're

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
actually the session layer now if you're

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.590 
actually the session layer now if you're
familiar<00:03:34.280> with<00:03:34.640> you<00:03:34.970> know<00:03:35.120> like<00:03:35.269> PHP

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
familiar with you know like PHP

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.810 
familiar with you know like PHP
programming<00:03:36.380> or<00:03:36.590> anything<00:03:36.799> like<00:03:37.070> that<00:03:37.130> then

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
programming or anything like that then

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.520 
programming or anything like that then
you<00:03:37.940> already<00:03:38.180> know<00:03:38.480> what<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:38.690> session<00:03:39.140> is<00:03:39.320> a

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
you already know what a session is a

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.890 
you already know what a session is a
session<00:03:40.489> is<00:03:40.670> pretty<00:03:40.940> much<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.150> conversation

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
session is pretty much a conversation

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.069 
session is pretty much a conversation
between<00:03:42.049> two<00:03:42.790> computers<00:03:43.790> so<00:03:44.540> what<00:03:44.660> this<00:03:44.810> layer

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
between two computers so what this layer

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.840 
between two computers so what this layer
does<00:03:45.380> is<00:03:45.650> let<00:03:46.130> me<00:03:46.220> just<00:03:46.340> go<00:03:46.459> ahead<00:03:46.489> and<00:03:46.760> write

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
does is let me just go ahead and write

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:56.050 
does is let me just go ahead and write
conversation<00:03:50.500> between<00:03:51.500> two<00:03:53.049> computers

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.030 

so<00:03:57.060> whenever<00:03:57.750> computers<00:03:58.439> are<00:03:58.620> in<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.830> process

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
so whenever computers are in the process

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.500 
so whenever computers are in the process
of<00:03:59.370> having<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.670> conversation<00:04:00.000> with<00:04:00.360> one

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
of having a conversation with one

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.720 
of having a conversation with one

another we call this conversation a
session<00:04:03.360> now<00:04:04.019> this<00:04:04.260> layer<00:04:04.530> is<00:04:04.709> responsible

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
session now this layer is responsible

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.130 
session now this layer is responsible
for<00:04:05.549> you<00:04:05.670> know<00:04:05.790> starting<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.659> ending

responsible for getting data from a
website<00:04:12.030> so<00:04:12.500> with<00:04:13.500> this<00:04:13.650> say<00:04:14.400> that<00:04:14.579> you<00:04:14.670> wanted

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
website so with this say that you wanted

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.909 
website so with this say that you wanted
to<00:04:15.030> get<00:04:15.150> data<00:04:15.390> from<00:04:15.540> your<00:04:15.720> website<00:04:15.900> this<00:04:16.650> layer

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
to get data from your website this layer

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.770 
to get data from your website this layer
would<00:04:17.160> go<00:04:17.340> ahead<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.760> create<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.030> session<00:04:18.389> or

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
would go ahead and create a session or

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.930 
would go ahead and create a session or
start<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.410> conversation<00:04:19.620> with<00:04:20.280> a<00:04:20.430> web<00:04:20.699> server

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
start a conversation with a web server

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.719 
start a conversation with a web server
and<00:04:21.530> whenever<00:04:22.530> you<00:04:23.130> know<00:04:23.250> during<00:04:23.520> the

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
and whenever you know during the

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.400 
and whenever you know during the
conversation<00:04:24.389> it<00:04:24.570> would<00:04:24.660> help<00:04:24.810> maintain<00:04:25.380> the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
conversation it would help maintain the

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.620 
conversation it would help maintain the
communication<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.490> if<00:04:27.000> something<00:04:27.419> you<00:04:27.449> know

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
communication and if something you know

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.870 
communication and if something you know
disrupted<00:04:28.500> your<00:04:28.620> communication<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.610> would

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
disrupted your communication it would

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.900 
disrupted your communication it would
try<00:04:30.060> to<00:04:30.120> re-establish<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.919> link<00:04:32.220> between<00:04:32.460> it

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
try to re-establish the link between it

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.129 
try to re-establish the link between it
so<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:33.180> know<00:04:33.389> you<00:04:33.419> guys<00:04:33.630> could<00:04:33.870> still

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
so you know you guys could still

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.990 
so you know you guys could still
communicate<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.860> whenever<00:04:35.310> it<00:04:35.580> was<00:04:35.729> done

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
communicate and whenever it was done

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.420 
communicate and whenever it was done
this<00:04:36.600> is<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.870> layer<00:04:37.199> right<00:04:37.500> here<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:38.310> is

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
this is the layer right here that is

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.279 
this is the layer right here that is
responsible<00:04:39.150> for<00:04:39.180> ending<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.990> conversation

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
responsible for ending the conversation

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.590 
responsible for ending the conversation
so<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:41.010> session<00:04:41.610> is<00:04:41.760> basically<00:04:42.240> like<00:04:42.570> a

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
so a session is basically like a

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.870 
so a session is basically like a
conversation<00:04:43.139> or<00:04:43.729> communication<00:04:44.729> between

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
conversation or communication between

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.810 
conversation or communication between
two<00:04:45.240> computers<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:46.020> this<00:04:46.710> right<00:04:47.460> here<00:04:47.760> is

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
two computers and this right here is

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.029 
two computers and this right here is
responsible<00:04:48.630> for<00:04:49.169> pretty<00:04:49.320> much<00:04:49.560> starting

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
responsible for pretty much starting

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.430 
responsible for pretty much starting
ending<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:50.580> maintaining<00:04:51.300> that<00:04:51.750> conversation

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
ending and maintaining that conversation

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.590 
ending and maintaining that conversation
now<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.370> next<00:04:53.760> layer<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:53.970> want<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.330> talk<00:04:54.449> about

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
now the next layer I want to talk about

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.710 
now the next layer I want to talk about
is<00:04:54.840> called<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.110> transport<00:04:58.699> the<00:04:59.720> transport

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
is called the transport the transport

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.129 
is called the transport the transport
layer<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:01.340> this<00:05:02.340> will<00:05:03.060> talk<00:05:03.210> about<00:05:03.389> what

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
layer and this will talk about what

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.439 
layer and this will talk about what
packets<00:05:04.710> are<00:05:04.889> later<00:05:05.190> on<00:05:05.370> but<00:05:05.580> basically<00:05:05.970> let

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
packets are later on but basically let

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.570 
packets are later on but basically let
me<00:05:06.510> give<00:05:06.660> you<00:05:06.780> guys<00:05:06.840> a<00:05:06.960> real<00:05:07.380> you<00:05:07.800> know<00:05:07.919> quick

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
me give you guys a real you know quick

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.490 
me give you guys a real you know quick
overview<00:05:09.060> and<00:05:09.090> this<00:05:09.330> is<00:05:09.510> not<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:10.020> technical

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
overview and this is not the technical

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.409 
overview and this is not the technical
definition<00:05:11.010> so<00:05:11.490> please<00:05:11.760> I<00:05:11.789> don't<00:05:12.030> want<00:05:12.240> to<00:05:12.330> get

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
definition so please I don't want to get

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.570 
definition so please I don't want to get
you<00:05:12.539> know<00:05:12.570> a<00:05:12.690> thousand<00:05:13.110> comments<00:05:13.500> a<00:05:13.620> packet<00:05:14.460> is

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
you know a thousand comments a packet is

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.820 
you know a thousand comments a packet is
pretty<00:05:14.789> much<00:05:14.910> like<00:05:15.090> a<00:05:15.270> chunk<00:05:15.630> of<00:05:15.840> data<00:05:16.050> that

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
pretty much like a chunk of data that

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.700 
pretty much like a chunk of data that
you<00:05:16.949> deliver<00:05:17.280> from<00:05:17.550> one<00:05:17.789> computer<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.270> another

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
you deliver from one computer to another

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.680 
you deliver from one computer to another
whenever<00:05:19.710> you<00:05:20.310> know<00:05:20.430> you<00:05:20.490> have<00:05:20.849> an<00:05:20.970> email<00:05:21.389> and

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
whenever you know you have an email and

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.450 
whenever you know you have an email and
you<00:05:22.110> want<00:05:22.289> to<00:05:22.380> send<00:05:22.590> it<00:05:22.680> to<00:05:22.740> another<00:05:23.070> computer

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
you want to send it to another computer

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.969 
you want to send it to another computer
what<00:05:24.180> your<00:05:24.330> computer<00:05:24.690> does<00:05:24.900> is<00:05:25.110> it<00:05:25.440> breaks<00:05:25.770> it

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
what your computer does is it breaks it

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.279 
what your computer does is it breaks it
up<00:05:26.039> into<00:05:26.190> smaller<00:05:26.820> chunks<00:05:27.150> of<00:05:27.810> data<00:05:27.960> just

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
up into smaller chunks of data just

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.140 
up into smaller chunks of data just
because<00:05:28.620> it's<00:05:28.830> easier<00:05:29.280> for<00:05:29.340> your<00:05:29.699> computer<00:05:30.000> to

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
because it's easier for your computer to

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.600 
because it's easier for your computer to
work<00:05:30.330> with<00:05:30.570> smaller<00:05:31.229> chunks<00:05:31.620> of<00:05:31.740> data<00:05:31.860> rather

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
work with smaller chunks of data rather

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.600 
work with smaller chunks of data rather
than<00:05:32.789> one<00:05:33.240> big<00:05:33.510> one<00:05:33.780> so<00:05:34.500> these<00:05:35.099> chunks<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.520> data

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
than one big one so these chunks of data

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.240 
than one big one so these chunks of data
are<00:05:35.910> actually<00:05:36.060> called<00:05:36.419> packets<00:05:37.199> and<00:05:37.440> I

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
are actually called packets and I

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.370 
are actually called packets and I
sometimes<00:05:38.909> use<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:39.479> word<00:05:39.599> packet<00:05:40.020> and<00:05:40.139> frame

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
sometimes use the word packet and frame

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.629 
sometimes use the word packet and frame
interchangeably<00:05:41.099> but<00:05:41.340> there<00:05:41.490> is<00:05:41.610> a

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
interchangeably but there is a

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.040 
interchangeably but there is a
difference<00:05:42.090> I'll<00:05:42.240> talk<00:05:42.419> about<00:05:42.599> that<00:05:42.750> later<00:05:42.900> on

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
difference I'll talk about that later on

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.740 
difference I'll talk about that later on
so<00:05:43.860> basically<00:05:44.310> what<00:05:44.880> this<00:05:45.060> does<00:05:45.120> is<00:05:45.510> it

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
so basically what this does is it

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.649 
so basically what this does is it
ensures<00:05:45.930> that<00:05:47.000> packets<00:05:48.000> I'll<00:05:48.180> just<00:05:48.479> rewrite

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
ensures that packets I'll just rewrite

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:53.360 
ensures that packets I'll just rewrite
packets<00:05:49.229> are<00:05:50.360> delivered
