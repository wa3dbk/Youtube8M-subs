00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
it just lay over a little bit but we'll

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.369

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
it's picking on just one cylinder I

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:12.759 
it's picking on just one cylinder I
think<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.019> it's<00:04:12.109> making<00:04:12.379> it<00:04:12.439> a<00:04:12.500> little<00:04:12.620> bit

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
think and it's making it a little bit

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.479 
think and it's making it a little bit
lean<00:04:13.009> right<00:04:13.280> there<00:04:13.689> but<00:04:14.889> all<00:04:15.889> things<00:04:16.219> said<00:04:16.430> and

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
lean right there but all things said and

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.949 
lean right there but all things said and
done<00:04:16.579> and<00:04:16.699> then<00:04:17.000> laid<00:04:17.359> over<00:04:17.659> a<00:04:17.690> little<00:04:17.840> bit

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
done and then laid over a little bit

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.300 
done and then laid over a little bit
that's<00:04:18.229> probably<00:04:18.560> a<00:04:18.620> bad<00:04:18.739> number<00:04:18.979> because<00:04:19.219> I

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
that's probably a bad number because I

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.099 
that's probably a bad number because I
pulled<00:04:19.519> back<00:04:19.699> on<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.940> throttle<00:04:20.359> short<00:04:20.599> so<00:04:20.900> I

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
pulled back on the throttle short so I

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.550 
pulled back on the throttle short so I
disregard<00:04:21.889> that<00:04:21.919> last<00:04:22.039> number<00:04:22.430> has<00:04:22.639> nothing

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
disregard that last number has nothing

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.580 
disregard that last number has nothing
but<00:04:24.560> good<00:04:24.620> good<00:04:25.280> 1600<00:04:25.969> horsepower<00:04:26.050> e85<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:28.490> a
