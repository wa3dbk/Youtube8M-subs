00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:13.880
 our blue planet offers a great one 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.530
 variety of impressive landscapes 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.600
 are in remote regions of the earth 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.650
 many of these landscapes are still untouched 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.650
 and originally 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.589
 where man settles and 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.509
 of course it will be there 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:34.510
 grown landscapes thoroughly 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:36.190
 changed there are again the 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.620
 well-known four lighting 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.510
 climate zones cover the earth's surface 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.579
 very rough climatic grid 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:52.120
 we'll skim that over 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:53.589
 you can put on this grid very much 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.220
 much finer dissolve 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.530
 34 in landscape on the basis of the climate 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.030
 Types that the biographers troll and fit 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.189
 in their model have distinguished the 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.990
 Passat winds cause in the tropics 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.810
 more or less strong precipitation 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.530
 in the subtropics against whom she is hot 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.900
 and dry 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.200
 huge tracts of land wither among the 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.200
 passanten 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:28.619
 Here we find the great subtropical 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:30.030
 desert sahara namib and atacama and the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.869
 outbacks in australia 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.090
 It often does not rain like that here for years 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.770
 now everyone is a bit slain by 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.280
 the variety of landscape zones 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.900
 the earth 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.330
 and we have in the last 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.570
 both film only about 20 of the total 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.729
 You can see 34 landscape zones 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.100
 the base of the climate map of troll 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.100
 and Paffen demarcate and name 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.120
 but maybe one or the other 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.490
 yes, become curious and research 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.450
 own fist a little further 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.800
 looking for hidden 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.800
 landscape zones of the earth
