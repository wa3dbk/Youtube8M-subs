00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:11.780
 What's up, kids, what do you want to generate? 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:14.809
 I bring you a trick for gta 5 online 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.670
 in update 1.16 and it's a trick 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.050
 to be able to play in the first person 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.090
 that will serve you very much very much 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.460
 very much to do the sketches 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.740
 montages and many original things that 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.900
 you do for the youtube world then 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.180
 for this trick we're going to need to be 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.980
 alone we need neither help nor anything and 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.570
 we're going to have to come right here to the 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.150
 ferris wheel that is in what is the part 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.520
 left of the map is worth what is 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.329
 is the beach you will see some symbols that 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.079
 they look like rudders, that's the wheel 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.060
 so what we have to do is 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.800
 come right to the Ferris wheel door and 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.420
 we have to give the arrow to the 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.350
 right and quickly leave being 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.450
 expelled 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.970
 then the Ferris wheel is bought and then 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.399
 we will get what is the little screen 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.140
 it's from being expelled we have to come 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.670
 down the whole and committing suicide but everything 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.100
 this is very fast vouchers arrow to the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.559
 right and then be pressed down 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.560
 running and committing suicide will charge us 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.960
 500 dollars for what it is to pay the wheel 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.659
 when asking us we will appear then close 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.070
 of what the fair is and what we have 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.020
 What to do is come running to the 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.909
 mountain of Russian vale no hurry 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.009
 do not look like me when the 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.140
 roller coaster was still turning around 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.330
 well I was wait here now 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.580
 just wait for it to arrive and 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.170
 one time we get there we hit each other 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.000
 stuck together as you are seeing a 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.100
 trolley and we give the arrow to the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.350
 right to also buy what is 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.329
 the mountain of Russian then set yourself as 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.189
 that sits on the sidewalk and at the same time 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.509
 appears a kind of failure like that 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.399
 it's on the wheel, so it's like 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.380
 is in two and two at a time and what 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.149
 then it will happen to us is going to be that 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.189
 let's see what the roller coaster is 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.140
 but from a very distant perspective 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.720
 as you are seeing now that we are in 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.220
 a very very high camera 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.869
 this is all well worth what you have to 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.549
 to do is wait for the mountain to finish 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.619
 Russian and just when I reach the end 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.810
 now you will see it and I have put this to you 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.580
 fast camera but look now just 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.110
 when we reach the end that the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.060
 back we have to give the triangle and 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.770
 to select but without leaving it pressed 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.810
 only give it once it is worth 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.310
 triangle and to select what will happen 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.170
 is going to be going down the mountain 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.370
 Russian as you are watching but let's go 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.110
 in the first person we will be in the 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.870
 gta in the first person something that is 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.720
 unpublished and now, well, nothing will leave you 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.510
 several clips like how he beat punches 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.280
 and so you can see it, throw me into the sea 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.500
 hit me for reasons and such that 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.840
 see what it looks like what it looks like 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.569
 this trick what is first person 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.459
 in gta iv you can also check out 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.470
 weapons is worth to take weapons simply 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.300
 you have to get into a car to give the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.870
 square to change weapon in the 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.030
 car and once done that we will leave the 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.220
 car and we can already have weapons what is 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.040
 walking is worth being in first person 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.410
 and with weapons we can shoot and they go to 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.810
 see what the firing fire is but 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.910
 the weapons are not worth being invisible like that 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.370
 that we can be in the first person 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.440
 but with the invisible weapon so nothing 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.880
 that's all I leave you with several shots and 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.319
 nothing I hope you liked you give life
