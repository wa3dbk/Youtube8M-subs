00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
slope like over here it's not too

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.610 
slope like over here it's not too
straight<00:00:48.030> up<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.480> also<00:00:48.660> not<00:00:48.990> too<00:00:49.260> small

straight up and it's also not too small

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.350 
straight up and it's also not too small
so<00:00:50.010> make<00:00:50.160> sure<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.400> slope<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.790> like<00:00:51.000> 45

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
so make sure the slope is like 45

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.060 
so make sure the slope is like 45
degrees<00:00:51.870> or<00:00:52.050> something<00:00:52.350> like<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:52.650> it's

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
degrees or something like that like it's

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.920 
degrees or something like that like it's
over<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.550> then<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.300> right<00:00:54.450> off<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.720> slope

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
over here then just right off the slope

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.360 
over here then just right off the slope
with<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:55.320> tank<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.710> while<00:00:55.890> your<00:00:56.040> tank<00:00:56.250> is

going up hold your left analog stick all
the<00:00:58.380> way<00:00:58.470> down<00:00:58.680> then<00:00:59.130> your<00:00:59.280> tank<00:00:59.520> will<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.700> like

90 degrees up doing a wheelie then you
guys<00:01:02.310> could<00:01:02.520> use<00:01:02.700> your<00:01:02.850> left<00:01:03.090> analog<00:01:03.480> stick<00:01:03.510> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
guys could use your left analog stick to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.389 
guys could use your left analog stick to
push<00:01:04.049> up<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.500> down<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.890> balance<00:01:05.220> out<00:01:05.369> your

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
push up and down to balance out your

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.370 
push up and down to balance out your
wheelie<00:01:05.880> once<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.540> guys<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.930> glitch<00:01:07.170> for

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
wheelie once you guys do this glitch for

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.630 
wheelie once you guys do this glitch for
yourself<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.829> guys<00:01:07.979> will<00:01:08.189> know<00:01:08.310> what<00:01:08.430> i<00:01:08.490> mean

by<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.909> balancing<00:01:09.420> part<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.750> things<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.200> it's

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
by the balancing part of things and it's

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.440 
by the balancing part of things and it's
really<00:01:10.439> easy<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.829> do<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.729> also<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.150> shout-out

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
really easy to do and also a shout-out

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.270 
really easy to do and also a shout-out
goes<00:01:12.600> out<00:01:12.870> to<00:01:13.050> ghost<00:01:13.260> protocol<00:01:13.800> for<00:01:14.010> hooking

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
goes out to ghost protocol for hooking

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.160 
goes out to ghost protocol for hooking
me<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:14.760> tank<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.690> i<00:01:15.750> basically<00:01:15.900> got

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
me up with the tank so i basically got

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.930 
me up with the tank so i basically got
this<00:01:16.500> glitch<00:01:16.740> down<00:01:16.950> at<00:01:17.130> my<00:01:17.250> first<00:01:17.490> try<00:01:17.760> but

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
this glitch down at my first try but

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.370 
this glitch down at my first try but
right<00:01:18.150> over<00:01:18.180> here<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.750> guys<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.140> see<00:01:19.200> you

right over here as you guys can see you
could<00:01:19.560> pretty<00:01:19.740> much<00:01:19.830> wheelie<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.460> however

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
could pretty much wheelie for however

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.430 
could pretty much wheelie for however
long<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.150> guys<00:01:21.210> would<00:01:21.450> like

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
glove so essentially your helmet is
going<00:01:51.320> to<00:01:51.380> stay<00:01:51.530> in<00:01:51.560> your<00:01:51.680> hand<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.010> guys
