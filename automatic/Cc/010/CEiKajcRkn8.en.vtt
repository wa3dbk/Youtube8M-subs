00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.150
 dimension and is now in our time 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.150
 I presented 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.000
 It should be mentioned that the transition has been 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.060
 a bit difficult for him 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.050
 where the hell I am or if he 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.050
 I can talk now too 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:36.370
 it's dangerous and just all this no thanks 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:40.030

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.739

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.579
 money for the bus and give you a sword 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.579

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.790
 and great 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.660

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:00.250
 what the hell are you using and you look like 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:05.380
 reds ready for him to retract and 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:08.460
 now that less than you would break them 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.460
 two in small pieces 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.479
 and 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.670

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.970

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.350

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.010
 fat colon like you against a sword 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.010
 like mine 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.890
 and never again call me korol which is what 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.330
 which means a chubby that from 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.500
 any way is very bad and 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.500
 politically incorrect 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.220

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.410

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.330

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.020
 oops 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.590
 and finally a vase shop 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.239
 I can go in to break some drawers 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.239
 and that they put some rupees 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.629
 and then man to my horse your mom 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.530
 that way I can always tell me 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.530
 I'm riding your mom 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.930
 I will 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.520
 you can stop doing that you should 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.910
 iron a bomb to it if you really 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:29.360
 you want to teach them a lesson in a 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.360
 pump in the angle 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.160
 in red because that means it's 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.160
 about to explode 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.280
 or 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.180
 there are more important things to do is 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.500
 change so rolling the clouds not with this 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.900
 big 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.910
 despite 16 epic adventures in hair 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.210
 a link only lasted 25 minutes in the 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.210
 land 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.970
 to see it and this 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.520
 hard 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.160
 further down in the description I can 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.720
 upload where I want is a free country 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.790
 on the subscribe button before 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.770
 start flashing red because that 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.750
 it means that it will explode 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.050
 that's weird because he's proposing in 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.050
 Red
