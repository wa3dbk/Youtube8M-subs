 welcome 96 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.580
 hello guys I have already previously 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.100
 placed in mid and here I leave the link 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.020
 so that if you do not know how to place a 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.660
 clip in these dreams is extremely easy 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.730
 you can even make them in sculptural 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.140
 and you can occupy these three colors of 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.330
 active base will already be using that is 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.400
 a rose a purple and a turquoise blue 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.220
 well the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.530
 place my pink color on the part of the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.450
 almond this rose is very saturated by 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.300
 leader so well I do not want it to be 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.390
 very rough you have to know how to handle this 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.830
 kind of very saturated colors so that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.240
 good to our organ look like this 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.460
 very thick 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.960
 if it is not as thin as possible 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.270
 what I'm going to do is just put a 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.820
 little pearl a pearl be it very 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.380
 small or medium and I'm going to start 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:38.229
 sweep the down eye that touches us 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.020
 our cuticle is like a half 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.290
 millimeter of separation between 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.790
 cuticle and our acrylic so you do not 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.620
 you go to fungus and will 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.420
 detach so easy name 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.070
 now with the purple color what I'm going to 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.140
 do is place it by the part of 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.270
 in the middle and I'll start like 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.310
 blur up and down 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.160
 this is so that the colors mix 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.610
 well and do not see a color on one side and 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.670
 on the other but to see everything together and what 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.860
 what am I going to do with the turquoise blue what 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.470
 I will place on the tip and I will see 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.570
 upwards just like nothing else so that 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.000
 mix colors perfectly 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.920
 you may be occupying different 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.870
 colors do not necessarily have to 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.700
 do this you can try this 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.210
 almost put may be occupying a 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.580
 red white pink and good are the colors 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.620
 as more allusive to this season but 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.510
 good and you will depend not only 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.000
 You can use these lines for week in 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.860
 they can be modified as you can 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.470
 Like we arrived from with an idea 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.030
 basic and a very quick idea to make them 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.360
 but hey it could be put 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.300
 a lot more creativity and brawn than 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.370
 they will see that it is extremely easy to do 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.640
 this kind of meals even these 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.550
 dreams can be made with 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.640
 nothing but taking great care of 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.850
 that the good brush that is not very 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.800
 then varnish and then that is 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.530
 all now what we are going to do is 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.650
 encapsulate our nail with acrylic 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.209
 crystal we grab a medium pearl and 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.280
 let's start from the cuticle and 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.980
 we started equal to barrier down what 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.170
 What we want is that our nail does not 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.989
 it's thick because believe me it's 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.670
 Facta did nails hardness well 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.500
 as if they were claws is what I do not 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.970
 I like then we will make it as 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.140
 subtle possible and post 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.540
 you can already see 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.850
 as you are working with 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.330
 with the acrylic encapsulating and all that 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.210
 so that you do not see a bad nail and a 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.550
 unsightly that's the important thing about 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.130
 acrylic nails something that is extremely 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:50.270
 natural and well then let's continue on 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.520
 capturing our pretty like we're going 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.340
 to start number from the part of the 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.710
 cuticle after media and then points 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.710
 so that they are well reinforced ok 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.720
 let's leave aside to dry 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.109
 well and since it came out I know if it's good 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.720
 with an animation feel a file that 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.479
 have the great union very hard I will 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.930
 start polishing the to take away all those 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:27.479
 excesses that I did not like with floppy and 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.330
 all of us and now we are going to try that 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:33.320
 the most polished visit is possible 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.510
 because that also gives him something of 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.410
 aesthetic to our nails that is good 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:43.789
 obviously they are false and what 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.800
 that we will be quite natural 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.889
 after this file what we are going to 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.889
 do 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.740
 polishing them with another one called lima is 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:05:00.140
 pons that is the same for the sides 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.780
 lateral ends and then we leave with 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.640
 entire nail so that there is glitter and 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.700
 screws and ankles and it 's already 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.880
 later we will be able to put 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.380
 our third dimension or the 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.300
 decorated that we want here 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.460
 the 19 in wax paper are about 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.650
 underpants but you the good thing already 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.470
 be direct on the nail and come back not what 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.570
 I can be doing is a small 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.270
 perlita I'm going to flatten it and I'm going to start 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:30.980
 to shape it as it should 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:33.530
 once extremely as a very finite visit 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.120
 and with the tip of my brush what I'm going to 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.550
 do is from the top where 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.010
 it was my go I'm going to push it like 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.410
 inside to make it the little heart and 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.720
 I'm going to start pulling like the ends 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.610
 so that now if all forms of 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.680
 we can do with the 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.660
 colors that you like and already after 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.180
 Well, we can hit them good 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.310
 my case I hit them since I made them in 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.260
 wax but you have to do them 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.730
 in the unit already being fine and already 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.100
 then finally we are going to put it 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.770
 finish that he put it to the lamp 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.110
 and that's how it is beautiful 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.520
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.620
 you have to know you can change the 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.270
 decorations without any problem and then 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.510
 well, we go very fast with the kit 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.510
 day 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.230
 to have model legs 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.080
 this valentine already know that what 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.910
 we need to use that skirts or not 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.620
 it will be something that we need to show 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.620
 our legs and we want them to be done 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.600
 as outlined good is very easy to 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.840
 done this is the trick that many 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.820
 they use and it's just to get a little bit 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.040
 well baby a few drops and 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.810
 we started to massage the legs and so 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.030
 we're going to leave it, we're not going to take it off 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.280
 or with water and none of it any more so 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.860
