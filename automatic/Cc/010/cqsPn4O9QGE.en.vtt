to<00:00:01.979> another<00:00:02.010> unboxing<00:00:02.700> video<00:00:03.210> today<00:00:03.629> I'm

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
to another unboxing video today I'm

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.809 
to another unboxing video today I'm
looking<00:00:04.080> at<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.350> thermaltake<00:00:04.890> element<00:00:05.549> V

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
looking at the thermaltake element V

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.450 
looking at the thermaltake element V
case<00:00:06.150> I<00:00:06.450> receive<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.200> lot<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.740> case<00:00:07.980> products

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
case I receive a lot of case products

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.730 
case I receive a lot of case products
and<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.880> course<00:00:09.179> they<00:00:09.480> come<00:00:09.719> in<00:00:09.870> large<00:00:10.110> boxes

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
and of course they come in large boxes

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.640 
and of course they come in large boxes
so<00:00:11.340> these<00:00:11.700> boxes<00:00:12.240> are<00:00:12.360> more<00:00:12.840> prone<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.259> damage

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
so these boxes are more prone to damage

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.340 
so these boxes are more prone to damage
than<00:00:14.130> smaller<00:00:14.519> boxes<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.269> they<00:00:15.809> do<00:00:15.870> get

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
than smaller boxes and they do get

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.290 
than smaller boxes and they do get
damaged<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.430> can<00:00:17.550> see<00:00:17.789> here<00:00:18.090> there's

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300
