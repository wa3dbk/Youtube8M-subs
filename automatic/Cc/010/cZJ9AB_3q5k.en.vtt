the zip here

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.580 
the zip here
I<00:00:22.770> wouldn't<00:00:23.730> recommend<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.360> very<00:00:24.930> very<00:00:25.259> fine

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
I wouldn't recommend on very very fine

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.710 
I wouldn't recommend on very very fine
fabric<00:00:25.919> because<00:00:26.579> I<00:00:26.759> actually<00:00:27.000> say<00:00:27.360> what<00:00:27.509> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
fabric because I actually say what the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.150 
fabric because I actually say what the
seam<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:27.989> the<00:00:28.230> machine<00:00:28.559> with<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.739> basting

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
seam on the machine with the basting

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.100 
seam on the machine with the basting
stitch<00:00:29.430> and<00:00:29.669> then<00:00:30.059> slip<00:00:30.419> through<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.020> was

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
stitch and then slip through and I was

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.840 
stitch and then slip through and I was
something<00:00:31.380> like<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> satin<00:00:31.980> or<00:00:32.070> silk<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.640> can

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
something like a satin or silk it can

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.910 
something like a satin or silk it can
portly<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.780> fabric<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.290> little<00:00:34.380> bit<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:34.860> you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
portly the fabric a little bit so you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.009 
portly the fabric a little bit so you
need<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.370> at<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.489> stage<00:00:35.670> by<00:00:36.210> hand<00:00:36.510> but

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
need to do at that stage by hand but

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:38.329 
need to do at that stage by hand but
again<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> look<00:00:37.500> at<00:00:37.679> your<00:00:37.769> pattern<00:00:37.920> it's

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
again have a look at your pattern it's

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.279 
again have a look at your pattern it's
really<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:38.730> very<00:00:38.760> difficult<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.719> at<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> end

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
really not very difficult and at the end

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:41.990 
really not very difficult and at the end
of<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.469> day<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.920> any<00:00:41.129> sewing<00:00:41.399> if<00:00:41.699> you<00:00:41.760> get<00:00:41.879> it

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
of the dress where the zip is going to

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.950 
of the dress where the zip is going to
go<00:01:09.490> now<00:01:09.820> if<00:01:09.970> you've<00:01:10.090> got<00:01:10.119> very<00:01:10.390> fine<00:01:10.660> fabric

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
go now if you've got very fine fabric

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.660 
go now if you've got very fine fabric
like<00:01:11.320> a<00:01:11.350> satin<00:01:11.770> or<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:11.950> silk<00:01:12.310> then<00:01:12.490> I<00:01:12.580> would

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
like a satin or a silk then I would

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.969 
like a satin or a silk then I would
suggest<00:01:12.820> that<00:01:13.090> this<00:01:13.420> part<00:01:13.750> you<00:01:14.260> do<00:01:14.440> by<00:01:14.650> hand

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
suggest that this part you do by hand

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.260 
suggest that this part you do by hand
because<00:01:15.400> your<00:01:15.550> stitch<00:01:15.700> is<00:01:15.850> going<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.150> be

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
because your stitch is going to be

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.609 
because your stitch is going to be
longer<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:16.720> you're<00:01:16.840> less<00:01:16.960> likely<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.350> leave

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
longer and you're less likely to leave

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:27.850 
longer and you're less likely to leave
holes<00:01:17.830> when<00:01:18.460> you<00:01:18.580> want<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.759> pick<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.060> thread

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.370 

I'll<00:01:28.850> just<00:01:29.000> let<00:01:29.120> the<00:01:29.180> pins<00:01:29.450> out<00:01:29.630> as<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:29.900> go

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
I'll just let the pins out as I go

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.440 
I'll just let the pins out as I go
keeping<00:01:30.920> my<00:01:31.010> feet<00:01:31.220> nice<00:01:31.370> and<00:01:31.580> straight<00:01:34.450> I'm

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
keeping my feet nice and straight I'm

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.670 
keeping my feet nice and straight I'm
going<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.690> get<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.020> end<00:01:36.140> I'm<00:01:36.290> not<00:01:36.320> going<00:01:36.590> to

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
going to get to the end I'm not going to

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.990 
going to get to the end I'm not going to
worry<00:01:36.800> about<00:01:36.890> back<00:01:37.190> token<00:01:37.610> because<00:01:37.850> these

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
worry about back token because these

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.190 
worry about back token because these
stitches<00:01:38.390> again<00:01:38.510> are<00:01:38.840> going<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.050> come<00:01:39.200> out

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.450 

I'll<00:01:45.200> just<00:01:45.260> move<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.680> Machine<00:01:46.510> away<00:01:47.510> and<00:01:48.460> the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
I'll just move the Machine away and the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.400 
I'll just move the Machine away and the
next<00:01:49.640> stage<00:01:50.000> would<00:01:50.330> be<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.720> take<00:01:50.930> this<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.320> the

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
next stage would be to take this to the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.130 
next stage would be to take this to the
ironing<00:01:51.860> board<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.370> press<00:01:52.570> not<00:01:53.570> as<00:01:53.750> I've<00:01:53.930> got

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
ironing board and press not as I've got

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.540 
ironing board and press not as I've got
cotton<00:01:54.590> I<00:01:54.710> should<00:01:54.920> be<00:01:55.010> able<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:55.220> press<00:01:55.400> this

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
cotton I should be able to press this

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:04.240 
cotton I should be able to press this
open<00:01:55.760> with<00:01:56.060> my<00:01:56.180> fingers<00:02:02.590> make<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:03.770> nice<00:02:04.010> and

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
open with my fingers make that nice and

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.370 
open with my fingers make that nice and
neat<00:02:04.430> take<00:02:04.670> away<00:02:04.850> any<00:02:04.940> loose<00:02:05.120> threads<00:02:08.380> and

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
neat take away any loose threads and

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.410 
neat take away any loose threads and
then<00:02:09.530> it's<00:02:09.679> time<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:09.920> pop<00:02:10.220> on<00:02:10.399> my<00:02:10.429> zip<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.209> I'm

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
then it's time to pop on my zip and I'm

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.810 
then it's time to pop on my zip and I'm
going<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.660> put<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.870> zip<00:02:12.110> on<00:02:12.320> face<00:02:12.950> down<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.550> just

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
going to put a zip on face down and just

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.699 
going to put a zip on face down and just
pin<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.120> in<00:02:14.480> place<00:02:14.510> all<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.260> way<00:02:15.290> around

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
pin that in place all the way around

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.340 
pin that in place all the way around
before<00:02:16.310> then<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:16.850> start<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.360> tack<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.900> by<00:02:18.080> hand

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
before then I start to tack it by hand

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.680 
before then I start to tack it by hand
so<00:02:18.700> all<00:02:19.700> I'm<00:02:19.820> doing<00:02:19.850> with<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.180> pinning<00:02:20.510> is

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
so all I'm doing with the pinning is

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.040 
so all I'm doing with the pinning is
making<00:02:21.230> sure<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.530> my<00:02:22.070> zip<00:02:22.459> teeth<00:02:23.209> are<00:02:23.570> right

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
making sure that my zip teeth are right

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.949 
making sure that my zip teeth are right
over<00:02:24.620> at<00:02:24.740> the<00:02:24.770> center<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.459> my<00:02:25.700> seam<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.450> I'm

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
over at the center of my seam and I'm

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.480 
over at the center of my seam and I'm
going<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.200> pin<00:02:27.410> that<00:02:27.440> all<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.040> way<00:02:28.160> around

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
going to pin that all the way around

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.120 
going to pin that all the way around
before<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.690> then<00:02:29.930> tack<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.350> by<00:02:30.500> hand<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.070> the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
before I then tack it by hand and the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.710 
before I then tack it by hand and the
reason<00:02:31.280> I'm<00:02:31.490> going<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.700> tack<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:32.000> by<00:02:32.150> hand<00:02:32.450> is

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
reason I'm going to tack it by hand is

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.520 
reason I'm going to tack it by hand is
so<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.850> pins<00:02:35.360> don't<00:02:35.600> move<00:02:35.959> when<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.230> then

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
so that the pins don't move when I then

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.470 
so that the pins don't move when I then
go<00:02:36.739> over<00:02:36.890> this<00:02:37.160> again<00:02:37.220> with<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.239> sewing

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
go over this again with the sewing

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.020 
go over this again with the sewing
machine<00:02:38.959> so<00:02:39.200> I'll<00:02:40.130> just<00:02:40.310> finish<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.580> off<00:02:40.850> I'm

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
machine so I'll just finish that off I'm

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.630 
machine so I'll just finish that off I'm
going<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:41.180> pin<00:02:41.390> on<00:02:41.480> both<00:02:41.720> sides<00:02:42.430> just<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.519> keep

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
going to pin on both sides just to keep

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.729 
going to pin on both sides just to keep
that<00:02:43.790> nice<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.300> flattened<00:02:44.660> in<00:02:44.810> place<00:02:45.019> making

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
that nice and flattened in place making

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.210 
that nice and flattened in place making
sure<00:02:45.890> again<00:02:46.190> those<00:02:46.550> teeth<00:02:46.820> facing<00:02:47.360> down<00:02:48.220> I'll

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
sure again those teeth facing down I'll

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.250 
sure again those teeth facing down I'll
right<00:02:49.640> across<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.150> center<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.600> scene<00:02:52.120> and

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
right across the center of the scene and

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.830 
right across the center of the scene and
then<00:02:54.260> I'll<00:02:54.380> tack<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.000> next<00:02:56.030> step<00:02:56.420> is<00:02:56.600> to

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
then I'll tack it so the next step is to

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.900 
then I'll tack it so the next step is to
sew<00:02:57.200> all<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.590> way<00:02:57.860> around<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.459> zipper<00:02:58.670> I'm

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
sew all the way around the zipper I'm

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.370 
sew all the way around the zipper I'm
going<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.180> sew<00:02:59.330> from<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.780> top<00:02:59.989> because<00:03:00.170> this

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
going to sew from the top because this

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.449 
going to sew from the top because this
is<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.590> side<00:03:00.800> where<00:03:00.950> you're<00:03:01.070> going<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.310> see

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
is the side where you're going to see

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.699 
is the side where you're going to see
the<00:03:01.610> stitches<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:03.080> I'm<00:03:03.230> going<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.500> sew<00:03:03.680> down

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
the stitches and I'm going to sew down

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.910 
the stitches and I'm going to sew down
this<00:03:04.310> side<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:05.030> then<00:03:05.300> swap<00:03:05.630> over<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.380> foot<00:03:06.650> to

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
this side and then swap over the foot to

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.860 
this side and then swap over the foot to
my<00:03:07.040> zipper<00:03:07.340> foot<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.209> other<00:03:08.330> side<00:03:08.630> and

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
my zipper foot to the other side and

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.660 
my zipper foot to the other side and
then<00:03:08.989> sew<00:03:09.230> down<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.739> other<00:03:09.769> side<00:03:09.920> like<00:03:10.610> so

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
then sew down the other side like so

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.509 
then sew down the other side like so
rather<00:03:11.330> than<00:03:11.600> go<00:03:11.810> down<00:03:12.380> then<00:03:12.890> across<00:03:13.130> them

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
rather than go down then across them

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.910 
rather than go down then across them
back<00:03:13.700> up<00:03:13.880> again<00:03:14.000> just<00:03:14.750> my<00:03:14.930> way<00:03:15.140> of<00:03:15.170> doing<00:03:15.590> it<00:03:15.739> so

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
back up again just my way of doing it so

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.830 
back up again just my way of doing it so
I'll<00:03:16.700> start<00:03:16.910> with<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.090> needle<00:03:17.480> in<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.810> down

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
I'll start with a needle in the down

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.229 
I'll start with a needle in the down
position<00:03:18.019> I<00:03:18.769> need<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.400> make<00:03:19.610> sure<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:20.060> I'm

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
position I need to make sure that I'm

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.660 
position I need to make sure that I'm
catching<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.720> ribbon<00:03:21.200> or<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.860> tape<00:03:22.100> on<00:03:22.370> the

catching the ribbon or the tape on the
zip<00:03:22.940> but<00:03:23.209> not<00:03:23.390> too<00:03:23.690> close<00:03:24.019> to<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.440> teeth<00:03:24.680> here

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
zip but not too close to the teeth here

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.850 
zip but not too close to the teeth here
but<00:03:26.269> I<00:03:26.330> can<00:03:26.510> feel<00:03:26.720> my<00:03:26.989> way<00:03:27.140> back<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:27.680> can

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
but I can feel my way back and you can

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.789 
but I can feel my way back and you can
feel<00:03:28.220> where<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.549> teeth<00:03:28.760> of<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.060> zipper<00:03:29.799> so

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
feel where the teeth of the zipper so

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.990 
feel where the teeth of the zipper so
let's<00:03:31.220> find<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.269> foot<00:03:32.540> pedal<00:03:32.900> again

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.309 

and<00:03:37.000> where<00:03:37.239> we<00:03:37.329> go<00:03:37.480> just<00:03:37.689> taking<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.079> slowly

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
and where we go just taking it slowly

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.720 
and where we go just taking it slowly
because<00:03:38.739> again<00:03:38.980> you<00:03:39.099> will<00:03:39.250> see<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.549> top

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
because again you will see the top

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.089 
because again you will see the top
stitches<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.480> just<00:03:41.200> going<00:03:41.349> to<00:03:41.470> back<00:03:41.620> attack<00:03:41.920> to

stitches I just going to back attack to

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.660 
stitches I just going to back attack to
hold<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:42.489> in<00:03:42.670> place<00:03:42.819> and<00:03:44.430> obviously<00:03:45.430> use<00:03:45.640> a

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.379 

it's<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:24.009> nearly<00:04:24.250> there<00:04:24.550> just<00:04:24.939> making<00:04:25.120> sure

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
it's that nearly there just making sure

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.999 
it's that nearly there just making sure
that<00:04:25.419> I'm<00:04:25.659> not<00:04:25.810> sewing<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.259> two<00:04:26.439> sides<00:04:26.710> of<00:04:26.919> the

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
that I'm not sewing the two sides of the

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:37.950 
that I'm not sewing the two sides of the
dress<00:04:27.189> together

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.629 

I'm<00:04:38.470> coming<00:04:38.770> up<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:38.949> the<00:04:39.039> bottom<00:04:39.400> of<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.669> zip

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
I'm coming up to the bottom of the zip

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.040 
I'm coming up to the bottom of the zip
so<00:04:42.639> I'm<00:04:42.729> just<00:04:42.880> going<00:04:43.030> to<00:04:43.150> sew<00:04:43.300> across<00:04:43.419> and

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
so I'm just going to sew across and

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.830 
so I'm just going to sew across and
backwards<00:04:44.680> just<00:04:45.009> to<00:04:45.130> secure<00:04:45.460> that<00:04:45.840> straight

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
backwards just to secure that straight

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.510 
backwards just to secure that straight
across<00:04:47.199> the<00:04:47.440> bottom<00:04:47.590> of<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.860> zip<00:04:48.039> now<00:04:48.190> this<00:04:48.370> is

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
across the bottom of the zip now this is

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.210 
across the bottom of the zip now this is
a<00:04:48.550> nylon<00:04:48.819> zip<00:04:49.419> so<00:04:50.050> if<00:04:50.319> I<00:04:50.410> do<00:04:50.470> catch<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:51.039> teeth

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
a nylon zip so if I do catch the teeth

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.070 
a nylon zip so if I do catch the teeth
it's<00:04:51.400> not<00:04:51.550> going<00:04:51.729> to<00:04:51.789> be<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:51.910> problem<00:04:52.120> if<00:04:52.900> you're

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
it's not going to be a problem if you're

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.680 
it's not going to be a problem if you're
using<00:04:53.259> a<00:04:53.470> metal<00:04:53.949> tooth<00:04:54.220> zip<00:04:54.789> then<00:04:55.150> just<00:04:55.449> make

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
using a metal tooth zip then just make

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.290 
using a metal tooth zip then just make
sure<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.949> you<00:04:57.099> don't<00:04:57.280> hit<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:57.970> teeth

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
sure that you don't hit the teeth

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.760 
sure that you don't hit the teeth
through<00:04:58.539> the<00:04:58.660> needle<00:04:59.020> because<00:04:59.080> they'll<00:04:59.349> break

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.999 

okay<00:05:02.770> so<00:05:02.830> that's<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.280> one<00:05:03.460> side<00:05:04.680> snip<00:05:05.680> off<00:05:05.830> my

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
okay so that's the one side snip off my

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:13.620 
okay so that's the one side snip off my
thread<00:05:09.060> light<00:05:10.060> my<00:05:10.210> fabric<00:05:12.330> then<00:05:13.330> I'm<00:05:13.449> going<00:05:13.599> to

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
thread light my fabric then I'm going to

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.230 
thread light my fabric then I'm going to
take<00:05:13.870> my<00:05:14.020> zipper<00:05:14.289> foot<00:05:14.530> off<00:05:14.789> and<00:05:15.789> move<00:05:16.090> it

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
take my zipper foot off and move it

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.749 
take my zipper foot off and move it
across<00:05:16.330> to<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:16.780> other<00:05:16.960> side<00:05:17.320> and<00:05:17.770> sew<00:05:18.490> down

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
across to the other side and sew down

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.550 
across to the other side and sew down
again<00:05:19.180> and<00:05:19.419> the<00:05:19.750> reason<00:05:19.900> I'm<00:05:20.139> doing<00:05:20.259> that<00:05:20.410> is

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
again and the reason I'm doing that is

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.800 
again and the reason I'm doing that is
because<00:05:20.860> sometimes<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.520> fabric<00:05:21.940> can<00:05:22.210> twist<00:05:22.599> a

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
because sometimes the fabric can twist a

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.050 
because sometimes the fabric can twist a
little<00:05:22.840> bit<00:05:23.410> or<00:05:23.620> maybe<00:05:24.190> put<00:05:24.520> a<00:05:24.580> fabric<00:05:25.030> that

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
little bit or maybe put a fabric that

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.879 
little bit or maybe put a fabric that
has<00:05:25.180> a<00:05:25.330> nap<00:05:25.660> on<00:05:25.840> it<00:05:26.020> and<00:05:26.169> you<00:05:26.259> want<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.500> NAP<00:05:26.680> to

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
has a nap on it and you want the NAP to

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.310 
has a nap on it and you want the NAP to
lie<00:05:27.070> in<00:05:27.430> both<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:28.000> same<00:05:28.210> direction<00:05:28.660> so<00:05:29.169> you're

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
lie in both the same direction so you're

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.300 
lie in both the same direction so you're
so<00:05:29.560> down<00:05:29.860> on<00:05:30.220> both<00:05:30.789> sides

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
so down on both sides

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.219 
so down on both sides
lay<00:05:33.310> down<00:05:36.599> flat

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
lay down flat

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.050 
lay down flat
I<00:05:38.259> try<00:05:38.770> and<00:05:38.830> keep<00:05:38.949> that<00:05:39.099> the<00:05:39.220> same<00:05:39.250> distance

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
I try and keep that the same distance

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.820 
I try and keep that the same distance
away<00:05:40.240> from<00:05:40.389> the<00:05:40.750> teeth<00:05:41.020> as<00:05:41.229> I<00:05:41.349> have<00:05:41.530> on<00:05:41.680> the

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
away from the teeth as I have on the

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.620 
away from the teeth as I have on the
other<00:05:41.919> side<00:05:42.250> so<00:05:42.940> it<00:05:43.060> keeps<00:05:43.210> it<00:05:43.419> nice<00:05:43.570> and

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
other side so it keeps it nice and

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:54.659 
other side so it keeps it nice and
straight

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.469 

again<00:05:55.669> just<00:05:55.820> make<00:05:55.940> sure<00:05:55.970> I'm<00:05:56.150> not<00:05:56.240> saying

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
again just make sure I'm not saying

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.140 
again just make sure I'm not saying
through<00:05:56.720> to<00:05:56.960> two<00:05:57.590> pieces<00:05:57.979> of<00:05:58.009> the<00:05:58.340> dress<00:05:58.970> the

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
through to two pieces of the dress the

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.159 
through to two pieces of the dress the
back<00:05:59.300> and<00:05:59.509> front

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
back and front

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:27.120 
back and front
no<00:06:01.040> good<00:06:01.280> look

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.790 

and<00:06:28.130> then<00:06:28.220> that's<00:06:28.430> just<00:06:28.520> bringing<00:06:29.120> me<00:06:29.270> up<00:06:29.300> to

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
and then that's just bringing me up to

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.360 
and then that's just bringing me up to
the<00:06:30.800> base<00:06:31.010> of<00:06:31.040> visit<00:06:31.669> where<00:06:31.970> I<00:06:32.000> finished

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
the base of visit where I finished

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.189 
the base of visit where I finished
previously<00:06:34.370> and<00:06:34.760> I'll<00:06:35.300> back<00:06:35.510> tack<00:06:35.810> just<00:06:36.050> to

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
previously and I'll back tack just to

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:47.520 
previously and I'll back tack just to
secure<00:06:36.590> their<00:06:43.360> take<00:06:44.360> away<00:06:44.630> my<00:06:44.810> throat<00:06:45.080> from

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.550 

the<00:06:48.530> inside<00:06:48.979> to<00:06:49.130> keep<00:06:49.280> that<00:06:49.520> neat<00:06:50.020> and<00:06:51.020> then<00:06:51.289> i

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
the inside to keep that neat and then i

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:57.090 
the inside to keep that neat and then i
wanting<00:06:52.370> to<00:06:52.520> do<00:06:52.669> is<00:06:53.060> to<00:06:53.120> take<00:06:53.600> a<00:06:53.630> quick<00:06:53.990> on<00:06:54.139> pic

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:03.460 

and<00:06:58.600> take<00:06:59.600> away<00:07:01.330> the<00:07:02.330> basting<00:07:02.810> stitches<00:07:03.169> that

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470 
and take away the basting stitches that
