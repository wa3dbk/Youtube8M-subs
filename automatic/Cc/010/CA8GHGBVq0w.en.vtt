seen before and not only virgin hair but

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.360 
seen before and not only virgin hair but
other<00:03:51.019> hair<00:03:51.350> it's<00:03:51.950> what<00:03:52.160> like<00:03:52.370> here

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
other hair it's what like here

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.420 
other hair it's what like here
the<00:03:54.370> next<00:03:54.640> longest<00:03:54.879> one<00:03:55.209> is<00:03:55.390> this<00:03:55.599> one<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:56.430> the

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
the next longest one is this one and the

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.190 
the next longest one is this one and the
longer<00:03:57.760> they<00:03:57.879> get<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.269> less<00:03:58.510> wavy<00:03:58.900> they

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
longer they get the less wavy they

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.110 
longer they get the less wavy they
appear<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.590> be<00:03:59.680> I<00:03:59.769> just<00:03:59.950> I<00:04:00.340> guess<00:04:00.700> because<00:04:01.060> it's

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
appear to be I just I guess because it's

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:11.089 
appear to be I just I guess because it's
heavier<00:04:01.690> but<00:04:03.269> still<00:04:04.269> it's<00:04:04.480> still<00:04:04.599> a<00:04:04.750> nice<00:04:04.959> way

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.130 

that's<00:04:12.099> what<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.340> looks<00:04:12.489> like<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:13.030> then<00:04:13.810> this

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
that's what it looks like and then this

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.180 
that's what it looks like and then this
is<00:04:14.200> what<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:15.010> West<00:04:15.280> looks<00:04:15.580> like<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.979> last

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
is what the West looks like and the last

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.090 
is what the West looks like and the last
one<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.609> longest<00:04:19.060> Fendall<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.959> 26<00:04:20.829> I've
