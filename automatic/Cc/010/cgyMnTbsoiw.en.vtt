00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:15.359
 friends hello today would connect 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.869
 DVR and radar detector of the day 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:20.669
 Century before meromorod factor in general 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.539
 I was pleased if the problem is why 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:25.609
 then the sound is gone 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:30.449
 Well, if they are Bishkek 1 warranty 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:32.099
 replaced on the ship so too often listen 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.839
 the works that you say about the water that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.040
 write a radar detector then it show me 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:40.500
 he is not the most expensive frankly but in 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.539
 Basically, everything catches in the city 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.610
 more than deliver to 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:47.160
 pleased with the known problem with the arrows 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.680
 the arrow he takes after the moment there is already 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.390
 when you were photographed new in 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.340
 principle in the city is actually so 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.910
 too often though we have cameras 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.949
 you break the rules here on the track he 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.719
 I bought my price almost immediately 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.910
 did you take it in bishkek bye ladies 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.890
 I drove in general, then I already 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.560
 bought as there are only 200 kilometers 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.979
 on three posts on one of them clearly 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.220
 saves because it was so interesting 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.470
 The situation and this he very scribbles 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.240
 I think Cho for garbage for some reason there is no 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.970
 there are no worms but nevertheless that is 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.830
 10 can still urban mode here it is 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.630
 Comes column worth childbirth hairstyle 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.849
 whether the radar it is very good if you do not 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.060
 I know that there is no one hundred percent 

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:31.739
 see here the same way here 500 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.929
 I have dollars according to my price 

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:36.780
 with its bid price of about 70 dollars on 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.340
 more about time, too, he was helped not happened 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.590
 as much as I have this course and I 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.940
 breaking how many are not pissed off on the slopes 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.580
 marks 40 and here 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.130
 the screws that stand are delicious not visible so 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.660
 what better way to know the tracks this thing 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.709
 justifies itself as regards 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.140
 DVR 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:57.420
 unconditionally so also often comes in handy 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.000
 I also laid out a video from him on my own 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.750
 channel shoots tom well enough 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.319
 number and night 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.020
 but you know here once you can called 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.239
 save so in general then its price 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.730
 it pays off but generally pleasant 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.890
 controversial situations with the same 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.350
 the police that you have an extra trump card 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.470
 and an extra argument video and 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.000
 registrar regarding connectivity 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.060
 so here we usually look 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.230
 to light it I took it off it shot it for nothing 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.030
 my he eventually did not need the shot but in 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.630
 cigarette lighter and we have minuses thomas 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.970
 This is obtained as a body and plus very 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.290
 everything is just done but unfortunately I will 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.780
 would urgently connect everything without 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.310
 cigarette lighter if not for power supplies 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.010
 what's a dvr what is radar detector 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.780
 does not work 20 volts works from 5 5 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.380
 Volt normally in the car there is nowhere to take 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.630
 so I took my old cigarette lighter 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.890
 repaired it publicly you see it shook up 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.200
 you duct tape just in case that does not 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.810
 where is he in any way whatsoever 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.250
 I lost my time and now I experience his key 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.410
 Generally it is parallel to the staff 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.080
 I leave the cigarette lighter 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.090
 full-time system, plus I'll hide it 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.000
 wires i'm here i have a good one 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.820
 ashtray niche 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.410
 in general, here I can even show it 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.990
 a little seen here is enough space to 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.390
 2 cigarette lighter and for shoes of both blocks 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.630
 power wire further some but 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.370
 somehow beautiful well most likely here 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.930
 here is this little stand on the smoke and here already 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.640
 asking for one wire here already have from 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.460
 Apparently the old radar detector at the same time 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.650
 see if it works with difficulty 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.330
 I found a fuse yesterday by work 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.750
 who answered me for finish 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.620
 to light you and did not work before 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.880
 infection guard according to the law of meanness 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.650
 was the very last 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.630
 and right-hand drive Japanese cars 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.150
 naturally I didn't understand where 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.480
 specifically what is in general then if someone 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.140
 suddenly 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.880
 beaten too by anyone interesting here 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.550
 very poorly visible but on a little bit 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.090
 there are fuses rightmost most 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.580
 top it we have a cigarette lighter 15 amps 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.720
 and so the cigarette lighter fits two wires 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.270
 one of them is double 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.820
 in japanese cars he is always black it 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.720
 don't fall on the ground it's blue here 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:11.300
 but here the blue ones are white in the funds 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.900
 this plus there is still lighting on but us 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.480
 not interesting yet 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.660
 I will take a plus from here when it turns on 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.220
 ignition for your own minus 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.170
 draw from anywhere but I'm just 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.300
 case for parallels here 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.430
 working with auto electrics and need 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.450
 adhere to the principle of seven measure 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.430
 cut once 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.500
 because the cost of error will be very high 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.900
 down to the burned-out car 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.850
 so we are looking for the wires correctly rendered 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.470
 we connect wires through a safety lock 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.750
 the mass of the vast majority 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.120
 modern cars it's just 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.050
 the case so in a bunch case to it and 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.060
 connect 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.130
 I prefer to crash into a full-time 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.760
 wiring or throw the wire to minus 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.740
 battery 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.750
 and we complicated process installation 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.340
 directly on the cigarette lighter 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.930
 a place 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.940
 I could not shoot because there need 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.980
 learn three hands very small probably 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.980
 Japanese do it easier but suddenly 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.260
 nothing seems to be working now 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.940
 now checked and we will be 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.720
 connect directly 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.570
 main devices as you can see 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.590
 both sockets work both regular and 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.690
 additional 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.270
 which means that I did everything right 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.490
 at the time of buying a car full-time 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.800
 the outlet did not work in the office moreover 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.860
 she was charged on load 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.600
 which will be on a regular outlet then she 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.370
 will be relatively small what 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.080
 DVR that rather detector 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.240
 works on just one amp 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.910
 the standard cigarette lighter socket protects 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.890
 h15 amp fuse 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.310
 accordingly all the wires and the very 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.080
 the socket is designed for 15 amps too what 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.110
 I will demand much from her 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.970
 less well and since i don't smoke my 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.070
 I don't use cigarette lighter 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.200
 Staff is very light it il 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.630
 unsuccessfully when switching speed about 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.190
 constant touched the power supply that 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.740
 would have a negative effect on his term 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.050
 The service goal is not to make it difficult for me 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.450
 water the cigarette lighter is to me all 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.920
 the wires here are these of you pirates that is it 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.380
 have a light or I will be hidden in 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.300
 niche for shifting gearbox and 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.210
 accordingly the wires hang out here 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.010
 There is nothing I want to achieve and a 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.710
 while maintaining a regular light or 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.050
 even though I don't smoke, but it's still nice 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.730
 that's why i will do one bite yes 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.490
 let them do extremely as usual 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.870
 because i have a radar detector 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.840
 it is also a cigarette lighter 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.450
 accordingly, I can do enough 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.820
 compactly place the radar detector 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:38.760
 only left to sleep 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.800
 All the wires this video I took almost 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.200
 half a year ago, practice showed that 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.700
 tee is still needed, therefore, more 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.520
 in detail about how I have already connected 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.260
 tee in the next part of this video before 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.200
 those who are interested to see how I am 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:55.200
 threw the wire that time here we have 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.700
 niche wire quietly passes under 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.670
 the radio tape recorder can even be sewn 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:03.270
 pockets then goes for the torpedo you can 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:07.050
 take off behind the glove compartment and leave here here already 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.850
 depending on sutra from car 0 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.280
 by chance every car here here 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.410
 there is a place to hide 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.250
 wire as you see here is one such 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.850
 the wire 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:19.500
 There is news this all will be visible 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.720
 everything will be hidden nowhere beautifully 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.890
 there will be no rotation does not interfere with this all 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.890
 thank you all bye 

00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:55.219
