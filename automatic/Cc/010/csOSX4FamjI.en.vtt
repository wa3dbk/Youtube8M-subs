was impressed
I<00:00:08.570> suppose<00:00:09.570> it's<00:00:09.780> different<00:00:10.050> for<00:00:10.230> me<00:00:10.320> because

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
I suppose it's different for me because

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.620 
I suppose it's different for me because
I<00:00:10.769> play<00:00:11.429> with<00:00:11.639> all<00:00:11.790> these<00:00:11.940> guys<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.240> know<00:00:12.509> I'm

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
I play with all these guys I know I'm

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.390 
I play with all these guys I know I'm
finished<00:00:12.870> no<00:00:13.110> but<00:00:13.259> I'm<00:00:13.349> shattered<00:00:13.559> it's<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.130> was

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
finished no but I'm shattered it's I was

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.039 
finished no but I'm shattered it's I was
a<00:00:14.429> pitch<00:00:14.670> level<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.179> think<00:00:15.240> they<00:00:15.540> won<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.870> body

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
a pitch level I think they won the body

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.650 
a pitch level I think they won the body
language<00:00:16.440> battle<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.490> lot<00:00:18.210> stems<00:00:18.510> from

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
language battle and a lot stems from

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.880 
language battle and a lot stems from
that<00:00:18.900> but<00:00:19.050> it's<00:00:19.170> not<00:00:19.289> all<00:00:19.410> doom<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.800> gloom

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
that but it's not all doom and gloom

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.800 
that but it's not all doom and gloom
that<00:00:20.279> sport<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.000> happens<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.510> know<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.630> mean

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
that sport that happens you know I mean

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.120 
that sport that happens you know I mean
I<00:00:21.840> think<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.199> need<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.439> get<00:00:22.590> behind<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.980> team

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
I think we need to get behind the team

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.640 
I think we need to get behind the team
no<00:00:23.340> one<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:23.869> you<00:00:24.869> know<00:00:24.960> less<00:00:25.199> than<00:00:25.380> an<00:00:25.470> 80

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
no one just you know less than an 80

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.710 
no one just you know less than an 80
minutes<00:00:26.039> ago<00:00:26.279> we<00:00:27.119> were<00:00:27.150> probably<00:00:27.480> gotten<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
minutes ago we were probably gotten the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.970 
minutes ago we were probably gotten the
other<00:00:27.810> way<00:00:28.019> about<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.410> team<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.800> they<00:00:28.890> were

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
other way about the team that they were

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.230 
other way about the team that they were
a<00:00:29.010> little<00:00:29.130> bit<00:00:29.340> better<00:00:29.490> than<00:00:29.609> they<00:00:29.730> wore<00:00:29.910> today

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
a little bit better than they wore today

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.440 
a little bit better than they wore today
we<00:00:30.390> got<00:00:30.740> badly<00:00:31.740> beaten<00:00:32.099> by<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.399> good<00:00:32.640> site<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.180> I

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
we got badly beaten by a good site but I

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.450 
we got badly beaten by a good site but I
think<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.590> turned<00:00:34.829> around<00:00:34.980> when<00:00:35.370> we

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
think it can be turned around when we

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.040 
think it can be turned around when we
attacked<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:35.940> looked<00:00:36.120> deadly<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.660> thought

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
attacked we looked deadly I thought

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.290 
attacked we looked deadly I thought
maybe<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.010> was<00:00:38.190> three<00:00:38.610> or<00:00:38.730> four<00:00:38.760> minutes<00:00:39.210> of

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
maybe that was three or four minutes of

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.549 
maybe that was three or four minutes of
eighty<00:00:39.480> minutes<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.079> didn't<00:00:40.290> look<00:00:40.350> good

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
eighty minutes but we didn't look good

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.700 
eighty minutes but we didn't look good
and<00:00:40.800> there<00:00:41.190> are<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.610> think<00:00:42.540> glimmers<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.500> hope

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
and there are I think glimmers of hope

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.650 
and there are I think glimmers of hope
there<00:00:44.010> we're<00:00:44.309> blotting<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.030> lot<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.300> young

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
there we're blotting a lot of young

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.810 
there we're blotting a lot of young
players<00:00:46.100> some<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.190> these<00:00:47.280> players<00:00:47.579> are

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
players some of these players are

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.040 
players some of these players are
finding<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.239> difficult<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.750> all<00:00:48.899> young

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
finding it difficult like all young

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.690 
finding it difficult like all young
players<00:00:49.379> are<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.890> persevere<00:00:50.370> with

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
players are you have to persevere with

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.729 
players are you have to persevere with
these<00:00:50.820> guys<00:00:51.059> they're<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> best<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:51.989> at

these guys they're the best we have at
club<00:00:53.039> level<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.510> step<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.350> difficult

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
club level so the step up is difficult

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.180

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
I suppose a disappoint I think for me

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.270 
I suppose a disappoint I think for me
the<00:01:24.780> one<00:01:24.930> thing<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.170> inspired<00:01:25.590> me<00:01:25.890> was<00:01:26.100> when

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the one thing that inspired me was when

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.670 
the one thing that inspired me was when
could<00:01:26.549> Rihanna<00:01:26.850> spear<00:01:27.450> tackled<00:01:27.930> or<00:01:28.439> maniy

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
could Rihanna spear tackled or maniy

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.560 
could Rihanna spear tackled or maniy
there<00:01:29.220> was<00:01:29.310> no<00:01:29.430> reaction<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:30.150> our<00:01:30.299> time<00:01:30.540> I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
there was no reaction in our time I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.359 
there was no reaction in our time I
suppose<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.439> not<00:01:31.560> long<00:01:31.799> ago<00:01:31.979> he<00:01:32.189> would<00:01:32.280> have

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
suppose it's not long ago he would have
