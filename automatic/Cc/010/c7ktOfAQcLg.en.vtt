00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.960

 crystal had not broken also what 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.940
 I had 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.940
 this stretched 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.960
 damaged 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.710
 we had to buy this 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.260
 because it was needed, you could not 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.880
 wait more 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.880
 that was too much here has this 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.550
 the controls to see how 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.890
 works 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.150
 Cool 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.479
 has double session in this session 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.830
 section that then the exception of 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.210
 outside also 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.210
 it gets bigger 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.640
 behind 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.080
 from behind 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.080
 a very serious matter 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.490
 hot quickie 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.360
 that would be the matter 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.360
 here 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.100
 look at this 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.880
 all right 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.880
 and without 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.320
 without the broken glass splinter 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.140
 I was going to be super happy 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.190
 super happy of gaira can be 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.720
 imagine 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.720
 and I know that would be the matter 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:44.430
 and then the other goal is here is 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.049
 like to keep things warm 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.900
 it's like to keep things 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.940
 the hot is is here 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.690

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.520
 watson 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.040
 so if you want to keep something 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.500
 hot but not cooking then what 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.410
 is that 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.850
 We will continue reporting while everyone 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.850

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.299
 5 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.750
