00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Good day to you himself 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.569
 boxing and welcome to anime studio 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.030
 apologize for the idea 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.519
 that for a long time there was no lesson yes I am very 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.429
 lazy ass but now let's get down 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.440
 to the very topic of the lesson the topic of the lesson as 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.990
 say it will not be because I collected all 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.910
 small questions and combined them into one 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.080
 big lesson so well let's start 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.890
 from the first question how to make a cartoon 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.429
 hd extension 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.099
 go to the file and project settings but 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.450
 settings in the project settings you have 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.660
 standard worth CTC to g-1 white screen 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.469
 this one is 872 by 486 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.480
 so what to do hd for youtube here 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.390
 e.g. remove youtube hd 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.579
 if you are really very cool there you need 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.010
 do more here there is still 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:59.850
 hd 1080p pretty good too 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.930
 you can for any reason just permission 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.930
 make dimensions 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.510
 You can experiment there in class. 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.610
 but I choose this spray by the way wanted 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.860
 notice when you hit control-r 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.280
 and see the render frame you see very 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.500
 big cat has become and they are all all that 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.470
 it was in the chamber actually fit 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.680
 fit if you pull it like this 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.280
 about the mouse button you can see everything 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.130
 I think you understand 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.090
 the next question is sounds in 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.240
 anime studio pro 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.189
 you recorded downloaded sound and you need 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.070
 move it on the timeline 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.619
 certain specific place but 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.990
 many think this is physically 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.630
 impossible how to move it with him 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.680
 do for this we need to go to 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.930
 second timeline tab and here's our sound 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.040
 move where we need on the timeline 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.470
 he too 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.360
 also moves herself with all 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.939
 actions that you do here 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.340
 displayed and all this can be pushed 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.439
 where do you need more of course 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.930
 I donâ€™t remember to tell exactly I drove her about 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.790
 this or not, but now I'll tell you how 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.009
 remove the character or put something 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.369
 its when it opens and studio 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.430
 click edit preferences 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.150
 Well, in general, at the very bottom 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.209
 here there is a start file according to the standard 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.330
 you stood this one like this one 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.370
 robocop or how else to call it old 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.829
 versions stood seed and annoying 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.620
 alien I decided this is all married 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.500
 put your file here we press other file 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.129
 and then choose your anime studio free 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.650

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.909
 it says there is a respected boxing good 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.099

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.739

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.060

 anime studio pro developers 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.500
 I would like a little bit 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.200
 talk a little bit about hotkeys 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.060
 let's start a little bit a little bit 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.950
 a little bit fat countries a little bit 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.680
 image Well let's start 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.930
 open the image for tracing but 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.970

 hissi anal you need to click this one 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.829
 control + y 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.030
 Here we have a window for 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.510
 image selection 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.699
 that 's what we open the image about and here 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.910
 in general, he is that this image 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:57.260
 hide we will we will need to click 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.019
 control + 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.360
 Here in the initial image disappeared 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:06.000
 click again she appeared 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.040
 this is understandable but in order to be 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.860
 in general, professionals are best 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.750
 use hotkeys when 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.030
 choosing tools that is not so 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.140
 draw draw pressed for all very 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:23.900
 for a long time is better when in this way 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:27.260
 can move through the instruments 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.180
 pretty quick very easy 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:34.620
 here everything is clear when you direct 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:38.220
 gives you that somewhere is you r here 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.250
 you can remember that is the people 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:45.380
 moving. translate points, that is, t 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.680
 I remembered that this one is available as points 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.650
 farther 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.800
 skill points well, then the text does not 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.900
 hot keys and particles no one 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.150
 necessary and the more so it is also not hot 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:02.310
 the keys can be further understood too 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.620
 so here's a lesson and came to an end 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.840
