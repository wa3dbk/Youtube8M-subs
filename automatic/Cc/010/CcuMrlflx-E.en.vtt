00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.049
 Once a cover for the iPad Air 2 I've 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.929
 bought as you see in amazon this Saturday 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.090
 past and Monday today is already at home with 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.670
 the premium for the service 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.460
 Amazon shipments goes very well this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.330
 I bought it as I told you to 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.519
 the pair 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.890
 2 that you can see the unboxing on my channel 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.829
 from youtube that I will leave the link in the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.770
 description of this video well let's 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.379
 see how the case is, I have already opened a 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.810
 little cardboard to see that it was all 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.670
 right and good 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:49.890
 the case is of the brand like this is 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.200
 mark that you have already seen some 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.610
 some more unboxing in my channel 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.490
 youtube that I really like for your 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.550
 quality price this time it is founded as 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.610
 I tell you it 's for the ipad ter 2 as it puts 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.780
 here and it's red both ahead and 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.360
 behind is based 24.99 euros 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.730
 a great price compared to the original 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.070
 apple that is worth about 70 that covers 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.860
 front and back and it's a cover that 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.010
 I like it a lot because of the material that 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.700
 have that it's like gum tp I think it's 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.100
 called a material resistant to 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.080
 blows and marks and that are cleaned 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.090
 very easy with a cloth and a little 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.090
 Twinkle the touch is very soft 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.540
 is here you can see it and well if the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.150
 we open we have inside here this 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.150
 gray area is like velvet that can 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.330
 tend to get dirty more than the material 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.490
 outside but with a small cloth 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.990
 wet it cleans very well because already 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.660
 I could buy it in the case that 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.970
 had on the ipad mini is the same as the 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.910
 same brand and did not have a problem for 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.580
 clean it good this cartoncito or this 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.880
 foam that comes so as not to lose shape 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.270
 of the case we remove it and we will see it 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.550
 a little bit more closely from the inside 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.340
 classic edges hole we have 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.590
 free for the camera for the button 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.860
 lock and ignition 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.650
 here we have 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.950
 the classic hole here are the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.750
 buttons should lower and increase the volume 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.600
 here below for the two speakers and the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.120
 lighting connector and up here a 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.360
 Hole for the minijack connector if 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.600
 we want to connect some headphones if the 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.370
 close then it is on this side 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:46.970
 we have the board to make the book 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.770
 and below, just a cover 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.430
 story now let's put it in the 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.010
 ipad 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.160
 r2 to see how it looks and how it covers 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.980
 both the edges and also the part of 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.550
 above and the bottom part 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:06.140
 here we have the ipad2 and the cover and 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:09.440
 let's proceed to put the ipad 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.780
 in the good case normally, I already tell you 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.930
 that there are usually no problems for 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.840
 fit this type of covers because they are 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.860
 Made of very good quality and adapted 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.390
 very well the ipad is already placed and 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.390
 you can see ahead 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.990
 behind 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.060
 the hole for the camera how to leave that 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.190
 perfect little hole and the camera is left 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.490
 under the cover 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.270
 does not stand out 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:44.500
 like the hole or the hole to light 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.500
 and lock the ipad 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.560
 another gap for the minijack connector 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.680
 that is like that in squares 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.290
 under 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.859
 lighting that is free to charge the 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.720
 ipad the two free speakers here with 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:04.050
 its cleavage 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.000
 and then on this side the button to 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.830
 go down in volume up and this 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.630
 little hole that I really do not know what it is 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.210
 but that they leave it free because it will be that 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.700
 which is a microphone because they leave it free 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.390
 so that it is and can record everything 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:21.060
 perfectly as you see closed is 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:26.040
 very very good 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:28.320
 on this side, above the side 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.560
 where is the board so that it makes the 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.560
 book 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.490
 below and if we open it 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.219
 Well how can you see 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.219
 it goes perfect 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:52.010
 It closes and the 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.630
 ipad of possible scratches both 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:59.660
 back as front with this stage 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.850
 and it does not give any kind of problem now 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:06.440
 I have the brightness to the minimum and you do not see it 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:10.030
 but the device is unlocked and it 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.030
 block with the lid look at it 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.470
 you heard the blocking noise 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.410
 at this moment I unlock it I put the 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:23.000
 footprint of the tÃ¡chira and unblocks I'll 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.000
 raise the brightness so that you see it better 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.900
 the device is locked with the lock 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.750
 cover as if it were the original cover 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.080
 and when I open it, the code asks for the touch 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.080
 Haiti 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:43.290
 You see, I think because of the price 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:45.990
 has this case 24.99 what does what 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.480
 which is to protect does it perfectly is 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.240
 easy to clean one thing that matters to me 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.940
 much and also aesthetically, it is very 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.420
 pretty is a very very bright red so 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.820
 that the space gray so it looks great and 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.980
 this has been all for the unboxing review 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.750
 of this brand's case as in my 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.480
 youtube channel if you have any 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.250
 question or doubt you can do with the 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.970
 contact methods that I leave in the 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:15.620
 description of this video with this me 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.620
 dismissal and a greeting
