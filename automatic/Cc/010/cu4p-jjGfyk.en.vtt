00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:03.950
 and the problem 42 26 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.460
 the figure of iguana axes jae king hitec vs an apex if they ask us to calculate 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.739
 the value of ca 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:14.619
 in short and not as it moves us further 3 beta 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:15.769
 on 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.150
 2 ansa - 3 beta 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.919
 then the figure that 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.419
 we are not here 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.419
 and there are the established data and we are going to place 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.769
 for example aha is that we do not define Munich as 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.239
 but how do we expand what 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.820
 said enclosures in ibiza and he told me kirsch m 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.910
 here it has to be 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.140
 now I am here must be with the sum of one without 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.820
 interiors the outer one kek the sum 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.910
 and tell yourself 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.910
 but like triangle b 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.010
 also and if they are civilians 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.270
 then and here and cinematic this of quito rally and grow 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.310
 with the alpha mute beast for opposites by the prestige 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.140
 we can place here alpha 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.140
 where we established in the triangle that 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.980
 for example if we exclude a good a little dot 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.560
 then mulito description we note that the sum of two lower fertilizers 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.540
 n + alpha is equal to his mother 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.470
 in mimar 2 of eta then establish molina 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.790
 lie equality 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.659
 what n + alfaquíes iguana and mimos 2 detail here 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.440
 we can simplify and mimi 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.390
 we came to the conclusion that there are 50 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.980
 twice from eta 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.740
 so 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.310
 alpha isabelite 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.060
 as 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.310
 two sets to one 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.200
 for example we have in this proportion an equality for example as is 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.530
 defined well 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.869
 alférez equalizing ska 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.489
 indicates estimated in the value of ca 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.559
 we replace it discretion link that we have k 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.139
 It does not matter 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.139
 as many of Caesar sotelo as Alfredo sometimes 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.129
 hinton we replace it more believe that it is intended that balica 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.359
 my dignity is not divided between 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.179
 two digits 10 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.559
 minus three times 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:35.589
 then we will operate 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.589
 and then we stay here 2 times seven times 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:40.779
 on 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:43.009
 two by two 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.629
 4 - grow celiac 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.119
 and it does not turn out 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.989
 simplifying the value of ac 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.609
 the 2007 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.069
 so the answer is
