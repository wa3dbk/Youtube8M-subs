00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
you during the concert I had this

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.970 
you during the concert I had this
feeling<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:49.960> there<00:02:50.230> was<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.350> small<00:02:50.770> Orchestra

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
feeling that there was a small Orchestra

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.860 
feeling that there was a small Orchestra
behind<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.820> did<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.540> ever<00:02:52.660> consider

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
behind you did you ever consider

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.350 
behind you did you ever consider
recording<00:02:53.460> with<00:02:54.460> a<00:02:54.490> lot<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:54.970> Symphony

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
recording with a lot of Symphony

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.330 
recording with a lot of Symphony
Orchestra<00:02:55.780> behind<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.260> maybe<00:02:56.770> perhaps<00:02:57.040> on<00:02:57.310> a

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
Orchestra behind you maybe perhaps on a

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.220 
Orchestra behind you maybe perhaps on a
next<00:02:57.610> record<00:02:57.970> or<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.330> live<00:02:58.630> set<00:02:58.960> with<00:02:59.140> an

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
next record or a live set with an

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.870 
next record or a live set with an
orchestra<00:02:59.500> it's<00:02:59.920> an<00:03:00.010> interesting<00:03:00.220> idea<00:03:00.550> but

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
orchestra it's an interesting idea but

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.420 
orchestra it's an interesting idea but
the<00:03:00.970> band<00:03:01.200> has<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.230> very<00:03:02.560> orchestrated<00:03:02.740> time<00:03:03.280> to

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
the band has a very orchestrated time to

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.210 
the band has a very orchestrated time to
begin<00:03:03.550> with<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.210> might<00:03:04.360> be<00:03:04.420> like<00:03:05.070> just<00:03:06.070> too

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
begin with so it might be like just too

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.070 
begin with so it might be like just too
much<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.640> same<00:03:06.850> thing<00:03:07.120> I<00:03:07.630> don't<00:03:07.900> know<00:03:07.990> if

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
much of the same thing I don't know if

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.510 
much of the same thing I don't know if
it's<00:03:08.560> really<00:03:08.800> necessary<00:03:08.920> for<00:03:09.280> us<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.370> the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
it's really necessary for us to the

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.150 
it's really necessary for us to the
strings<00:03:09.820> are<00:03:10.000> going<00:03:10.030> because<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:11.230> band<00:03:11.440> has<00:03:12.130> a

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
strings are going because the band has a

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.820 
strings are going because the band has a
violinist<00:03:12.700> we<00:03:12.970> have<00:03:13.210> string<00:03:14.200> synthesizers

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
would be a lot of fun to work with an

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.090 
would be a lot of fun to work with an
orchestra<00:03:22.239> like<00:03:22.540> like<00:03:23.080> a<00:03:23.110> deep<00:03:23.440> purple<00:03:23.709> did<00:03:23.980> at

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
one time but they didn't have the same

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.620 
one time but they didn't have the same
instrumentation<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:27.430> we<00:03:27.550> do<00:03:27.850> so<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:28.150> feel
