00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.890 
see every time we get a good player we
will<00:01:19.740> put<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.610> best<00:01:20.939> pools<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.720> day

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
will put it in the best pools of the day

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.660 
will put it in the best pools of the day
obviously<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> best<00:01:22.920> pools<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.400> day<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
obviously the best pools of the day and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.820 
obviously the best pools of the day and
the<00:01:23.759> best<00:01:23.909> pool<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.390> far<00:01:24.720> are<00:01:24.930> exactly<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the best pool so far are exactly the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.950 
the best pool so far are exactly the
same<00:01:25.860> because<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.390> know<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> first

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
same because you know it's the first

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.840 
same because you know it's the first
episode<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> best<00:01:29.009> pool<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.430> far<00:01:29.670> will

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
episode so the best pool so far will

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.969 
episode so the best pool so far will
eventually<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> best<00:01:30.780> pull<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
eventually be the best pull of the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.520 
eventually be the best pull of the
series<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.640> far<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.329> today<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.049> going<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.409> be

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
series so far so today it's going to be

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.469 
series so far so today it's going to be
the<00:01:34.619> same<00:01:34.799> all<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> way<00:01:35.100> through<00:01:35.460> now<00:01:35.909> as<00:01:36.150> you
