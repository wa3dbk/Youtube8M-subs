this<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.570> something<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.929> came<00:00:15.990> up<00:00:16.139> with<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.560> a

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
this is something I came up with it a

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.439 
this is something I came up with it a
little<00:00:16.770> while<00:00:16.980> back<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.609> never<00:00:17.670> really<00:00:18.240> had

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
little while back and I never really had

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.689 
little while back and I never really had
a<00:00:18.480> reason<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.960> use<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.350> but<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.189> think<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:20.609> a

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
a reason to use it but I think it's a

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.429 
a reason to use it but I think it's a
really<00:00:20.939> cool<00:00:21.119> thing<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.390> show<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:22.080> uses

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
really cool thing to show you it uses

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.960 
really cool thing to show you it uses

I<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.520> elevated<00:00:47.969> my<00:00:48.180> turrets<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.230> that

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
I have elevated my turrets so that

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
I have elevated my turrets so that
they're<00:00:49.469> not<00:00:49.620> constantly<00:00:49.860> owned<00:00:50.340> when<00:00:51.270> they

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
they're not constantly owned when they

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.979 
they're not constantly owned when they
lower<00:00:51.690> they<00:00:52.440> can't<00:00:52.710> find<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.670> target<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.840> they

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
lower they can't find a target so they

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.049

place the turret on top of a piston it

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.140 
place the turret on top of a piston it
will<00:01:34.530> sit<00:01:34.770> there<00:01:34.979> whenever<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.820> flip<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.450> lever

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
will sit there whenever I flip the lever

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.700 
will sit there whenever I flip the lever

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the Pistons go up into the air that's

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.160 
the Pistons go up into the air that's
all<00:01:40.950> there<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.670> guys<00:01:41.700> when<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> raise<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
all there is to it guys when I raise the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.350 
all there is to it guys when I raise the
piston<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.950> turret<00:01:44.220> goes<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.579> with<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.970> when<00:01:45.299> I

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
piston the turret goes up with it when I

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.840 
piston the turret goes up with it when I
lower<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:46.259> goes<00:01:46.439> back<00:01:46.710> down<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:47.579> gives

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
lower it it goes back down that gives

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.910 
lower it it goes back down that gives
you<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> really<00:01:48.540> really<00:01:48.899> cool<00:01:49.140> feature<00:01:49.500> guys

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
you a really really cool feature guys

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.289 
you a really really cool feature guys
what<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.369> allows<00:01:50.579> us<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.149> your

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
what that allows us to do is your

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.679 
what that allows us to do is your
turrets<00:01:51.600> cannot<00:01:51.930> be<00:01:52.110> hit<00:01:52.320> by<00:01:52.500> mobs<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:53.700> skeleton

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
turrets cannot be hit by mobs a skeleton

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.120 
turrets cannot be hit by mobs a skeleton
could<00:01:54.869> possibly<00:01:55.320> shoot<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.710> off<00:01:55.829> but

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
could possibly shoot it off but

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.130 
could possibly shoot it off but
generally<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.820> don't<00:01:57.270> think<00:01:57.719> they<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.110> are

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
generally I don't think they really are

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.069 
generally I don't think they really are
that<00:01:58.259> good<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.799> shot<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.340> non<00:02:00.060> players<00:02:00.509> but

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
that good of a shot on non players but

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.840 
that good of a shot on non players but
that's<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.530> my<00:02:01.770> personal<00:02:01.829> opinion<00:02:02.280> so

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that's just my personal opinion so

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.490 
that's just my personal opinion so
that's<00:02:03.540> pretty<00:02:03.689> much<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.020> guys<00:02:04.200> it's

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
that's pretty much it guys it's

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.280 
that's pretty much it guys it's
basically<00:02:04.920> turret<00:02:05.759> defense<00:02:06.119> systems<00:02:06.689> you

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
basically turret defense systems you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.139 
basically turret defense systems you
can't<00:02:07.560> see<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> turrets<00:02:08.340> let's<00:02:08.819> say<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.060> were

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
can't see the turrets let's say you were

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.360 
can't see the turrets let's say you were
walking<00:02:09.509> up<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:10.140> have<00:02:10.349> an<00:02:10.500> intruder<00:02:10.860> all

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
walking up you have an intruder all

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.250 
walking up you have an intruder all
you've<00:02:11.760> got<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.150> do<00:02:12.330> first<00:02:12.690> off<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:13.200> would

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
you've got to do first off I would

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.199 
you've got to do first off I would
recommend<00:02:13.739> flip<00:02:13.980> your<00:02:14.160> gate<00:02:14.340> your<00:02:14.670> gate<00:02:14.910> comes

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
recommend flip your gate your gate comes

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.630 
recommend flip your gate your gate comes
up<00:02:15.450> or<00:02:16.020> Hall<00:02:16.379> are<00:02:16.650> expecting<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.250> gate<00:02:17.430> where

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
up or Hall are expecting the gate where

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.360 
up or Hall are expecting the gate where
you<00:02:17.790> secondly<00:02:18.690> ask<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.170> intruder<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.560> remove
