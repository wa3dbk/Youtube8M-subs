and<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:41.510> it<00:00:42.510> almost<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:43.170> acts<00:00:43.440> as<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> safe

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and get it almost like acts as a safe

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.690 
and get it almost like acts as a safe
sandpaper<00:00:45.350> of<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.980> there's<00:00:47.340> little

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
sandpaper of the and there's little

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.220 
sandpaper of the and there's little
chips<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.239> paint<00:00:48.480> already<00:00:48.660> that's<00:00:49.020> not

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
chips in this paint already that's not

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.000 
chips in this paint already that's not
this<00:00:50.750> baking<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.800> seems

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
this baking so to do that but it seems

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.529 
this baking so to do that but it seems
like<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.430> really<00:00:53.520> works<00:00:53.910> well<00:00:54.180> when<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.390> add

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
like it really works well when you add

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.610 
like it really works well when you add
them<00:00:54.750> for<00:00:55.260> tea<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:59.930> so<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.199> kind<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.500> get

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
them for tea to it so it can kind of get

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.140 
them for tea to it so it can kind of get
in<00:01:01.770> there<00:01:02.090> and<00:01:03.090> get<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> little<00:01:05.150> mechanical

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
in there and get a little mechanical

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.700 
in there and get a little mechanical
action<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.810> speak<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.530> little

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
action so to speak I like a little

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.550 
action so to speak I like a little
sandpaper<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.400> there<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.350> this

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
sandpaper in there to really get this

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:22.260 
sandpaper in there to really get this
any<00:01:10.890> stubborn<00:01:11.400> stains<00:01:11.729> off

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.789 

it<00:01:22.869> really<00:01:23.170> works<00:01:23.409> well<00:01:25.859> and<00:01:26.859> again<00:01:27.280> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
marks and stuff are just dings from the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.580 
marks and stuff are just dings from the
paint<00:02:38.180> not<00:02:38.540> being<00:02:38.780> taken<00:02:38.960> care<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.260> over<00:02:39.410> the
