before we get started since a lot of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.359 
before we get started since a lot of
people<00:01:50.300> ask<00:01:50.540> me<00:01:50.869> my<00:01:51.140> hair<00:01:51.409> in<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:51.800> front<00:01:52.190> is

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
people ask me my hair in the front is

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.940 
people ask me my hair in the front is
about<00:01:52.970> six<00:01:53.360> inches<00:01:53.570> long<00:01:53.840> as<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:54.680> can<00:01:54.800> see

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
about six inches long as you can see

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.609 
about six inches long as you can see
here<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.520> then<00:01:55.700> on<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.149> top<00:01:56.390> it's<00:01:57.020> about<00:01:57.170> five

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
here and then on the top it's about five

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.340 
here and then on the top it's about five
inches<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.000> six<00:01:59.240> blends<00:01:59.630> into<00:02:00.020> five

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
inches so the six blends into five

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.730 
inches so the six blends into five
inches<00:02:00.710> on<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:00.950> top<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.580> then<00:02:02.330> on<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:03.380> back

inches on the top and then on the back

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.770 
inches on the top and then on the back
in<00:02:04.039> sides<00:02:04.369> it's<00:02:04.820> about<00:02:05.000> three<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:05.509> a<00:02:05.630> half

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.810 
in sides it's about three and a half
inches<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:07.160> then<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.479> just<00:02:08.630> have<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:08.810> taper<00:02:09.110> that

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
inches and then I just have a taper that

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.090 
inches and then I just have a taper that
blends<00:02:10.820> into<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.450> length<00:02:12.050> on<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.650> top<00:02:12.830> and

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
blends into the length on the top and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.790

the<00:02:13.220> sides<00:02:13.489> and<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.880> taper<00:02:14.090> is<00:02:14.269> usually

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
the sides and the taper is usually

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.940 
the sides and the taper is usually
created<00:02:15.800> with<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.370> number<00:02:16.910> one<00:02:17.150> guard<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.680> to

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
going to take a little more original and

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.000 
going to take a little more original and

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
palms it's pretty smooth and it equally

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.950 
palms it's pretty smooth and it equally
distributes<00:05:09.669> into<00:05:09.820> my<00:05:09.909> hair<00:05:10.060> easily<00:05:10.539> and<00:05:10.780> then

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
distributes into my hair easily and then

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.649 
distributes into my hair easily and then
I'm<00:05:11.080> just<00:05:11.110> going<00:05:11.440> to<00:05:11.530> reshape<00:05:12.460> my<00:05:12.940> pompadour

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
I'm just going to reshape my pompadour

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:15.089 
I'm just going to reshape my pompadour
there's<00:05:13.870> really<00:05:13.990> no<00:05:14.169> rhyme<00:05:14.470> or<00:05:14.500> reason<00:05:14.680> to

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
there's really no rhyme or reason to

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:16.800 
there's really no rhyme or reason to
this<00:05:15.400> you<00:05:15.669> just<00:05:15.820> want<00:05:15.940> to<00:05:16.150> kind<00:05:16.300> of<00:05:16.419> keep<00:05:16.599> the

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
this you just want to kind of keep the

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.540 
this you just want to kind of keep the
same<00:05:16.840> shape<00:05:17.080> as<00:05:17.500> before<00:05:17.889> but<00:05:18.130> it's<00:05:18.310> a<00:05:18.400> little

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
same shape as before but it's a little

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.589 
same shape as before but it's a little
broken<00:05:19.539> down<00:05:19.690> and<00:05:20.080> doesn't<00:05:21.070> look<00:05:21.400> so<00:05:22.060> put

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
broken down and doesn't look so put

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:24.540 
broken down and doesn't look so put
together<00:05:22.750> here<00:05:23.380> but<00:05:23.949> I<00:05:23.979> think<00:05:24.220> it's<00:05:24.340> a<00:05:24.400> good

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
together here but I think it's a good

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:32.850 
together here but I think it's a good
everyday<00:05:25.000> look

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.110 

and<00:05:33.860> again<00:05:34.070> you<00:05:34.250> can<00:05:34.400> definitely<00:05:34.550> just<00:05:35.060> kind

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
and again you can definitely just kind

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.940 
and again you can definitely just kind
of<00:05:35.270> play<00:05:35.450> around<00:05:35.630> with<00:05:35.780> this<00:05:35.960> and<00:05:36.290> there's<00:05:36.800> no

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
of play around with this and there's no

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.450 
of play around with this and there's no
really<00:05:37.370> right<00:05:37.580> or<00:05:37.700> wrong<00:05:37.760> way<00:05:37.970> to<00:05:38.000> do<00:05:38.240> it<00:05:38.270> and

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
really right or wrong way to do it and

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.970 
really right or wrong way to do it and
using<00:05:40.460> original<00:05:40.880> is<00:05:41.210> great<00:05:42.050> because<00:05:42.350> it<00:05:42.530> has<00:05:42.680> a

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
using original is great because it has a

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.430 
using original is great because it has a
pretty<00:05:43.700> strong<00:05:43.820> hold<00:05:44.510> and<00:05:44.750> again<00:05:45.050> like<00:05:45.260> I<00:05:45.380> said

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
pretty strong hold and again like I said

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.310 
pretty strong hold and again like I said
before<00:05:45.590> if<00:05:46.100> I<00:05:46.280> wanted<00:05:46.610> to<00:05:46.990> reshape<00:05:47.990> my<00:05:48.140> hair

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320

before if I wanted to reshape my hair
into<00:05:48.590> something<00:05:48.860> else<00:05:48.950> I<00:05:49.190> probably<00:05:49.670> could

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
into something else I probably could

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.360 
into something else I probably could
achieve<00:05:50.060> another<00:05:50.450> look<00:05:50.720> easily<00:05:51.380> and<00:05:51.620> still

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
achieve another look easily and still

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.270 
achieve another look easily and still
maintain<00:05:53.360> the<00:05:53.630> hold<00:05:53.900> it<00:05:54.260> keeps<00:05:54.800> my<00:05:54.920> hair<00:05:55.070> very

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
maintain the hold it keeps my hair very

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.090 
maintain the hold it keeps my hair very
pliable<00:05:55.520> and<00:05:56.060> as<00:05:56.480> you<00:05:56.990> saw<00:05:57.170> a<00:05:57.500> second<00:05:57.890> ago<00:05:57.980> I

pliable and as you saw a second ago I

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.860 
pliable and as you saw a second ago I
added<00:05:58.490> a<00:05:58.550> little<00:05:58.670> heat<00:05:59.030> to<00:05:59.240> finish<00:05:59.450> off<00:05:59.720> the

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
added a little heat to finish off the

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.110 
added a little heat to finish off the

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
look to lock it into place and this is

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.690
