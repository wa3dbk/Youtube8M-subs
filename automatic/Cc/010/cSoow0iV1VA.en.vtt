00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 emergency meeting in the capital gathered 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.759
 Representatives of the largest Russian and 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.870
 foreign railway companies 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.030
 in order to discuss 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.250
 the acute problem of breaking the side frames 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.960
 freight car trucks at the meeting 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.450
 held under the auspices of a non-profit 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.550
 partnership about the same you told that 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.550
 only in the last two months happened 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.890
 24 case of a break of a side frame quite often 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.539
 this led to the same train 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.029
 cases recorded for the entire past 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.949
 year meeting participants are sure of the matter 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.800
 poor quality parts cast elements 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.510
 do not maintain even term of operation 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.969
 designated by the manufacturer if 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.820
 talk about breaking the side frames of the carts in 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.950
 depending on where their production 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.239
 overwhelming amount for this period 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.559
 there were 26 elements of 2007 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:53.329
 making 18 percent or 23 of the house 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:57.750
 2010 12 percent 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.270
 2008, nine per cent in 2005 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.410
 something 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:07.130
 in the total mass it is clear that these are details 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:11.660
 which are not actually made 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.670
 longer than 8 years 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.650
 Today, manufacturers do not bear 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.630
 responsibility for breaking a part is 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.580
 simply not prescribed by law on 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.710
 meeting decided the first thing you need 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.080
 develop a regulatory framework to 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.810
 the supplier was responsible for their products all 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.800
 guaranteed lifetime 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:33.350
 chief designer who released 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.780
 fourth frame fourth frame which 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.770
 still intends to release it must 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.830
 subscribe 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.080
 What is the term of service, he guarantees to 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.380
 appearances let him count it full 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.390
 resource and under this thing subscribe to 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.830
 drafting laws will take time but 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.170
 do something with substandard 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.930
 manufacturers need products now 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.560
 find it difficult to decide now I'm 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.580
 I can not say what the procedure is in a circle 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.840
 it will definitely be necessary to perform here 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.270
 fully children you hold 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.429
 defect from copying is the search for hidden 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.560
 flaws and internal cracks hold 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.120
 such a procedure with each car is expensive 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.670
 and long trains before departure 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.740
 checks the inspector but according to 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.110
 rail notice all defects not 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.540
 always possible and use side 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.750
 ram happens almost on your own 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.750
 and risk
