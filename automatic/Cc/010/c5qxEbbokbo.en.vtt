about<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.049> I<00:02:25.650> like<00:02:26.370> on<00:02:26.700> my<00:02:26.999> home<00:02:27.209> lawn<00:02:27.510> to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
about this but I like on my home lawn to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.470 
about this but I like on my home lawn to
water<00:02:28.049> only<00:02:28.920> once<00:02:29.129> a<00:02:29.310> week<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.670> have<00:02:29.849> quite<00:02:30.180> fine

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
water only once a week I have quite fine

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.080 
water only once a week I have quite fine
textured<00:02:30.959> soil<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.469> I<00:02:32.010> water<00:02:32.219> heavy<00:02:32.549> once<00:02:32.909> a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
textured soil and I water heavy once a

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.080 
textured soil and I water heavy once a
week<00:02:33.269> about<00:02:33.719> two<00:02:34.139> inches<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.879> about<00:02:35.879> two

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
week about two inches of about two

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.780 
week about two inches of about two
inches<00:02:36.389> of<00:02:36.450> water<00:02:36.659> per<00:02:36.930> water<00:02:37.310> given<00:02:38.310> but

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
inches of water per water given but

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.909 
inches of water per water given but
whatever<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.389> do<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:39.780> think<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.439> time<00:02:40.739> of

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:40.919 
whatever you do I think this time of

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:43.250 
whatever you do I think this time of
year<00:02:41.129> you<00:02:41.340> need<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.549> put<00:02:41.879> on<00:02:42.060> almost<00:02:42.959> two

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
year you need to put on almost two

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.899 
year you need to put on almost two
inches<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.709> water<00:02:43.739> sometime<00:02:44.459> during<00:02:44.669> the<00:02:44.879> week

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
inches of water sometime during the week

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.670 
inches of water sometime during the week
to<00:02:45.389> keep<00:02:45.569> your<00:02:45.750> meter<00:02:45.900> grass<00:02:46.109> looking<00:02:46.469> good

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
to keep your meter grass looking good

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.220 
to keep your meter grass looking good
okay<00:02:47.280> one<00:02:47.909> nice<00:02:48.150> thing<00:02:48.180> about<00:02:48.450> Bermuda<00:02:48.989> grass

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
okay one nice thing about Bermuda grass

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.939 
okay one nice thing about Bermuda grass
though<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.739> if<00:02:50.549> you<00:02:50.790> are<00:02:51.530> terribly<00:02:52.530> short<00:02:52.799> of

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:52.949 
though is if you are terribly short of

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:56.569 
though is if you are terribly short of
water<00:02:53.129> you<00:02:53.849> can<00:02:53.879> shut<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.019> water<00:02:55.139> off<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:55.799> let

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
water you can shut the water off and let

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.699 
water you can shut the water off and let
it<00:02:56.669> turn<00:02:56.849> brown<00:02:57.090> if<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.569> can<00:02:57.719> stand<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:58.109> and

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
it turn brown if you can stand that and

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.309 
it turn brown if you can stand that and
then<00:02:58.949> it'll<00:02:59.519> recover<00:02:59.909> it'll<00:03:00.540> recover<00:03:00.810> after<00:03:01.290> a

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
then it'll recover it'll recover after a

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.550 
then it'll recover it'll recover after a
month<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.829> severe<00:03:02.459> drought<00:03:02.639> it's<00:03:03.030> very

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
month of severe drought it's very

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.119 
month of severe drought it's very
tolerant<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.859> that<00:03:05.579> sort<00:03:05.849> of<00:03:05.909> thing<00:03:05.969> okay<00:03:07.129> our

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
tolerant to that sort of thing okay our

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.539 
tolerant to that sort of thing okay our
third<00:03:08.159> question<00:03:08.939> is<00:03:09.239> from<00:03:09.719> Rebecca<00:03:10.620> in<00:03:11.069> Hobbs

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
third question is from Rebecca in Hobbs

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.379 
third question is from Rebecca in Hobbs
and<00:03:12.439> she<00:03:13.439> has<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> problem<00:03:14.310> with<00:03:14.489> her<00:03:14.669> Bermuda

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
and she has a problem with her Bermuda

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.780 
and she has a problem with her Bermuda
grass<00:03:15.659> showing<00:03:16.199> a<00:03:16.290> blueish<00:03:16.650> gray<00:03:16.980> cast<00:03:17.340> and

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
grass showing a blueish gray cast and

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.390 
grass showing a blueish gray cast and
the<00:03:18.449> nurseries<00:03:18.870> have<00:03:18.900> told<00:03:19.290> her<00:03:19.409> that's<00:03:20.159> a

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
the nurseries have told her that's a

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.069 
the nurseries have told her that's a
fungus<00:03:20.849> and<00:03:21.000> other<00:03:21.150> people<00:03:21.540> have<00:03:21.689> told<00:03:21.930> her

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
fungus and other people have told her

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.249 
fungus and other people have told her
that's<00:03:22.229> a<00:03:22.470> drought<00:03:22.680> sentiment<00:03:23.340> grass<00:03:24.259> that'd

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:25.259 
that's a drought sentiment grass that'd

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:27.199 
that's a drought sentiment grass that'd
be<00:03:25.439> hard<00:03:25.650> for<00:03:25.889> me<00:03:25.949> to<00:03:26.040> answer<00:03:26.220> without<00:03:26.759> seeing

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
be hard for me to answer without seeing

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.800 
be hard for me to answer without seeing
it<00:03:27.359> but<00:03:28.579> it<00:03:29.579> sounds<00:03:30.060> like<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.389> might<00:03:30.599> be

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
it but it sounds like it might be

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.780 
it but it sounds like it might be
somewhat<00:03:31.290> variety<00:03:31.859> related<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:34.579> it<00:03:35.579> almost

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
somewhat variety related and it almost

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.210 
somewhat variety related and it almost
sounds<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.389> me<00:03:36.509> like<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.989> might<00:03:37.199> be<00:03:37.409> a<00:03:37.439> short<00:03:37.859> of

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
sounds to me like it might be a short of

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.789 
sounds to me like it might be a short of
water<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:39.120> does<00:03:39.329> tend<00:03:39.629> to<00:03:39.720> get<00:03:39.870> blue<00:03:40.169> gray<00:03:40.470> when

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
water it does tend to get blue gray when

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.280 
water it does tend to get blue gray when
it<00:03:40.919> gets<00:03:41.099> short<00:03:41.370> of<00:03:41.459> water<00:03:41.639> okay<00:03:42.239> so<00:03:42.659> good

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
it gets short of water okay so good

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.499 
it gets short of water okay so good
technique<00:03:43.859> for<00:03:44.069> her<00:03:44.220> would<00:03:44.400> be<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.849> actually

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:45.509 
technique for her would be to actually

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.839 
technique for her would be to actually
sample<00:03:46.169> an<00:03:46.259> area<00:03:46.439> and<00:03:46.829> visit<00:03:47.609> our<00:03:47.699> local

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
sample an area and visit our local

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.719 
sample an area and visit our local
county<00:03:48.359> agent<00:03:48.659> right<00:03:49.439> and<00:03:50.040> see<00:03:50.310> whether<00:03:50.549> it

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:50.729 
county agent right and see whether it

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.640 
county agent right and see whether it
truly<00:03:50.939> I<00:03:51.150> just<00:03:51.419> hit<00:03:51.599> some<00:03:51.750> information<00:03:52.560> on

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
truly I just hit some information on

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.569 
truly I just hit some information on
that<00:03:52.680> yeah<00:03:53.189> Arden<00:03:54.120> as<00:03:55.109> far<00:03:55.349> as<00:03:55.579> Bermuda
