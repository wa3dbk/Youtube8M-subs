so<00:00:36.600> let's<00:00:37.600> talk<00:00:37.780> about<00:00:38.100> technology<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:40.120> its

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
so let's talk about technology and its

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.320 
so let's talk about technology and its
potential<00:00:41.379> in<00:00:41.800> education<00:00:42.489> and<00:00:42.760> you<00:00:43.239> were

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
potential in education and you were

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.960 
potential in education and you were
gonna<00:00:43.420> talk<00:00:43.840> about<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.890> modern<00:00:45.280> cellphone

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
gonna talk about the modern cellphone

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.930 
gonna talk about the modern cellphone
all<00:00:46.480> right<00:00:46.949> we<00:00:47.949> need<00:00:48.100> to<00:00:48.220> start<00:00:48.309> thinking<00:00:48.610> as

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
all right we need to start thinking as

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.479 
all right we need to start thinking as
as<00:00:49.510> 2008<00:00:50.260> showing<00:00:50.650> us<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:51.010> economy's<00:00:51.400> really

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
as 2008 showing us the economy's really

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.460 
as 2008 showing us the economy's really
changed<00:00:51.970> and<00:00:52.180> we<00:00:52.479> have<00:00:52.510> this<00:00:52.750> really<00:00:52.870> of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
changed and we have this really of

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.049 
changed and we have this really of
technology<00:00:54.010> but<00:00:54.159> let's<00:00:54.309> just<00:00:54.460> look<00:00:54.760> at<00:00:54.879> how

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
technology but let's just look at how

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.329 
technology but let's just look at how
fast<00:00:55.390> everything<00:00:55.839> is<00:00:56.440> happening<00:00:56.949> to<00:00:57.040> us

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
fast everything is happening to us

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.280 
fast everything is happening to us
here's<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:57.820> modern<00:00:58.120> cell<00:00:58.510> phone<00:00:58.750> I<00:00:58.780> brought<00:00:59.080> in

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
here's a modern cell phone I brought in

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.920 
here's a modern cell phone I brought in
five<00:01:00.280> years<00:01:00.610> ago<00:01:00.850> this<00:01:01.330> is<00:01:01.390> my<00:01:01.659> cell<00:01:01.900> phone

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
five years ago this is my cell phone

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.740 
five years ago this is my cell phone
just<00:01:02.379> one<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.370> these<00:01:03.489> bad<00:01:03.670> boys<00:01:03.699> so<00:01:04.330> how<00:01:04.510> is<00:01:04.570> it

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
just one of these bad boys so how is it

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.480 
just one of these bad boys so how is it
equivalent<00:01:04.960> well<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.680> make<00:01:05.860> this<00:01:06.040> cell<00:01:06.280> phone

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
equivalent well to make this cell phone

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.880 
equivalent well to make this cell phone
equivalent<00:01:07.000> to<00:01:07.120> this<00:01:07.240> cell<00:01:07.479> phone<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:07.990> this

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
equivalent to this cell phone and this

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.830 
equivalent to this cell phone and this
is<00:01:09.070> what<00:01:09.220> everybody's<00:01:09.760> seeing<00:01:10.000> now<00:01:10.150> I<00:01:10.390> would

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
is what everybody's seeing now I would

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.899 
is what everybody's seeing now I would
need<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.049> bring<00:01:11.170> a<00:01:11.260> camera<00:01:11.470> I<00:01:11.830> would<00:01:12.670> need<00:01:12.790> to

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
need to bring a camera I would need to

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.510 
need to bring a camera I would need to
bring<00:01:13.030> a<00:01:13.240> video<00:01:13.600> camera<00:01:13.930> I<00:01:14.320> would<00:01:14.979> need<00:01:15.370> to

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
bring a video camera I would need to

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.580 
bring a video camera I would need to
bring<00:01:15.700> a<00:01:15.760> GPS<00:01:16.210> and<00:01:16.540> more<00:01:16.960> importantly<00:01:17.380> I'd

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
bring a GPS and more importantly I'd

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.469 
bring a GPS and more importantly I'd
have<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:17.979> have<00:01:18.070> a<00:01:18.130> big<00:01:18.520> computer<00:01:18.970> to<00:01:19.210> go<00:01:19.299> with

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
have to have a big computer to go with

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.370 
have to have a big computer to go with
it

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
it

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.020 
it
and<00:01:20.650> in<00:01:20.860> fact<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.280> computer<00:01:21.670> in<00:01:21.790> here<00:01:21.940> is

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
and in fact the computer in here is

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.790 
and in fact the computer in here is
probably<00:01:22.150> more<00:01:22.360> powerful<00:01:22.720> than<00:01:22.780> this<00:01:22.930> but

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
probably more powerful than this but

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.990 
probably more powerful than this but
what<00:01:23.980> that<00:01:24.100> does<00:01:24.280> is<00:01:24.460> provide<00:01:24.730> us<00:01:24.880> an

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
what that does is provide us an

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.370 
what that does is provide us an
opportunity<00:01:25.210> for<00:01:25.720> students<00:01:26.080> because<00:01:26.260> if

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
opportunity for students because if

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.260 
opportunity for students because if
they're<00:01:26.560> carrying<00:01:26.890> this<00:01:27.070> with<00:01:27.310> them<00:01:27.520> they<00:01:28.090> are

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
they're carrying this with them they are

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.870 
they're carrying this with them they are
indeed<00:01:28.540> carrying<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:28.990> camera<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.620> video<00:01:30.160> camera

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
indeed carrying a camera a video camera

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.320 
indeed carrying a camera a video camera
and<00:01:31.090> a<00:01:31.450> computer<00:01:31.570> so<00:01:32.380> let's<00:01:32.590> use<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:32.920> screen

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
and a computer so let's use that screen

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.180 
and a computer so let's use that screen
effectively<00:01:34.330> in<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.480> classroom<00:01:34.510> and<00:01:35.440> yet<00:01:35.680> the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
effectively in the classroom and yet the

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.220 
effectively in the classroom and yet the
policy<00:01:36.640> in<00:01:36.700> so<00:01:36.820> many<00:01:36.910> schools<00:01:37.300> is<00:01:37.600> either<00:01:37.960> not

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
policy in so many schools is either not

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.470 
policy in so many schools is either not
have<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:38.710> or<00:01:39.010> it<00:01:39.520> needs<00:01:39.790> to<00:01:39.880> be<00:01:39.970> turned<00:01:40.240> off

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
have that or it needs to be turned off

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.360 
have that or it needs to be turned off
what<00:01:41.170> are<00:01:41.200> some<00:01:41.380> ideas<00:01:41.440> about<00:01:41.740> what<00:01:42.190> we<00:01:42.220> could

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
what are some ideas about what we could

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.910 
what are some ideas about what we could
be<00:01:42.820> doing<00:01:42.850> with<00:01:43.630> this<00:01:44.080> tool<00:01:44.500> this<00:01:44.770> great

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
be doing with this tool this great

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.200 
be doing with this tool this great
learning<00:01:45.070> tool<00:01:45.250> that<00:01:45.580> a<00:01:45.610> lot<00:01:45.820> of<00:01:45.850> students

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
learning tool that a lot of students

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.420 
learning tool that a lot of students
have<00:01:46.390> well<00:01:46.960> there<00:01:47.410> there's<00:01:47.740> already<00:01:47.890> apps<00:01:48.220> out

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
have well there there's already apps out

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.040 
have well there there's already apps out
there<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.730> things<00:01:48.910> where<00:01:49.090> kids<00:01:49.540> can<00:01:49.750> collect

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
there and things where kids can collect

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.010 
there and things where kids can collect
data<00:01:50.290> but<00:01:50.710> if<00:01:51.430> you<00:01:51.580> think<00:01:51.760> about<00:01:51.910> it<00:01:52.210> too<00:01:52.390> it's

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
data but if you think about it too it's

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.320 
data but if you think about it too it's
got<00:01:53.260> a<00:01:53.290> video<00:01:53.500> recording<00:01:54.100> so<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.400> kids<00:01:55.000> can

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
got a video recording so the kids can

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.100 
got a video recording so the kids can
record<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:56.200> lab<00:01:56.620> procedure<00:01:57.070> for<00:01:57.400> example<00:01:57.880> or

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
record a lab procedure for example or

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.750 
record a lab procedure for example or
they<00:01:59.110> can<00:01:59.290> be<00:01:59.410> tweeting<00:01:59.860> among<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.370> the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
they can be tweeting among the the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.460 
they can be tweeting among the the
different<00:02:01.390> students<00:02:01.750> as<00:02:01.840> they<00:02:01.930> do<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.110> project

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
different students as they do a project

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.560 
different students as they do a project
