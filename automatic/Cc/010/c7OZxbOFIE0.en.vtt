00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
cutting board but that's okay and just

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.640 
cutting board but that's okay and just
like<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:13.510> know<00:02:13.630> cut<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:13.989> up<00:02:14.110> into<00:02:14.319> little

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
like you know cut it up into little

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.740 
like you know cut it up into little
bitty<00:02:14.890> pieces<00:02:14.950> like<00:02:15.670> about<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:16.060> size<00:02:16.330> and

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
bitty pieces like about that size and

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.720 
bitty pieces like about that size and
kinda<00:02:17.110> get<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.380> happen<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:17.980> know<00:02:18.069> just<00:02:18.280> mix<00:02:18.489> it

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
kinda get it happen you know just mix it

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.470 
kinda get it happen you know just mix it
up<00:02:19.319> okay<00:02:20.319> so<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:21.010> decided<00:02:21.580> that<00:02:21.850> we're<00:02:22.390> gonna

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
up okay so I decided that we're gonna

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.170 
up okay so I decided that we're gonna
need<00:02:22.569> another<00:02:23.050> two<00:02:23.500> inches<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:24.459> carrot<00:02:25.000> and

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
need another two inches of carrot and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.680 
need another two inches of carrot and
that<00:02:25.989> would<00:02:26.500> probably<00:02:26.709> equal<00:02:27.340> about<00:02:27.580> two<00:02:28.450> baby

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
that would probably equal about two baby

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.830 
that would probably equal about two baby
carrots<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.709> just<00:02:30.040> put<00:02:30.340> your<00:02:31.000> little<00:02:31.180> pieces
