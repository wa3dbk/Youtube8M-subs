00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.420
 for a good realization of a 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.680
 Turf is important at the moment 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.750
 of sowing 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.420
 but first of all it is important to 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.240
 soil preparation a land like 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.420
 this is not adequate to receive the seed 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.449
 the ground goes first ruthless go 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.930
 once the wood residues have been eliminated it must be eliminated 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.060
 the moss the dead roots and all the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.900
 parts of dead vegetation up to 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.290
 get a land like this 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.149
 soft that it is well leveled and that it is 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.670
 able to collect the seed and of 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.469
 allow adequate germination on 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.989
 sowing time is a very moment 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.420
 important is both the execution 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.760
 of sowing but also fertilization 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.809
 during sowing or better before 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.190
 sowing 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.989
 before sowing is appropriate 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.030
 distribute high-grade fertilizers 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.260
 of phosphorus that can help 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.600
 seedling growth e 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.850
 the radical deepening in the first ones 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.739
 phases soon after germination the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.890
 sowing can be done with technique a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.540
 then hand or machine spreading 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.729
 if the spreading technique is used 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.650
 it is very important and distribution 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.670
 of the seed takes place from the outside towards 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.560
 the interior 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.930
 therefore it is necessary to throw the seed 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.210
 upwind so that the rose of the self 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.299
 it can be opened and distributed 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.460
 uniformly on the ground proceeding in 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.950
 the opposite way the seed will come 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.020
 distributed instead on the ground with arches 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.799
 and the distribution will be much less 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.979
 uniform 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.100
 in this way it will be possible to form gods 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.229
 seed accumulations with problems then 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.680
 funny or yellowing during 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.270
 the growth phase is also important 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.430
 that the quantity of seed is 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.369
 appropriate normally come 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.140
 distributed 35 40 grams of seed per 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.020
 every square meter for what you can 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.240
 understand by sowing in a pan of 30 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.530
 centimeters the optimal density could 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.090
 be this 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.790
 in the tray next to it we have a 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.950
 especially seed excess 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.110
 concentrated in several places 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.060
 these concentrations can give rise to 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.950
 to excessive competition 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.470
 during grass development with lo 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.390
 development of rot yellowing e 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.680
 with partial or complete compromise 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.690
 after sowing is appropriate a 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.209
 cost the seed to the seed for 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.240
 this is performed in a rolling way 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.910
 that the soil in contact with the seed 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.560
 may permit germination at 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.080
 end of rolling starts at 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.180
 irrigate irrigation in the early stages 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.970
 must be very frequent with little 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.410
 water to avoid erosion 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.060
 runoff and removal of 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.090
 seed due to the effect of water 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.250
 flows on the ground from the moment the 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.280
 seed begins to germinate and is seen 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.320
 the first strands of grass and irrigations go 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.900
 made less frequently by increasing 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.300
 slightly water doses up to 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.640
 add the period of the first cut 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.260
 after which irrigation is done like 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.720
 normally for all lawns 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.150
 once every two three days 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.310
 I'm enrico you find me at the department 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.959
 agricultural gardening if you have 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.030
 need more advice on carpets 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.269
 grassy you can also write me on 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.220
 facebook page of the farm hi for 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.050
 sowing the best times are the 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.840
 spring and autumn 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.130
 I recommend sowing in the fall 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.720
 because this way you can 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.720
 limit the weed intake
