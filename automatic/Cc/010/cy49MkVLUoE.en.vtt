00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:12.809

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.210
 continental gtc v8 it is this model 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.250
 already the model year 2016 so that 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.650
 So-called facelift that is the first 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.150
 car what we have for you at all 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.830
 it is in a very special 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.619
 exterior color the colors finite 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.060
 jetstream also this color was only in the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.859
 March this year on the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.130
 car salon in geneva at all that 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.350
 first presented the car 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.820
 visually differs in the front 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.469
 and in the back of his 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.780
 predecessors namely in the light 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.000
 modified bumper front and 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.309
 rear area in the future an easy 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.950
 stronger a cornerstone in the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.090
 frame of the trunk lid and also 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.230
 slight changes in the interior 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.570
 especially in the interior you have to 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.820
 pay attention to the details of our products 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.100
 that means to understand this car 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.969
 It is completely handmade in England 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.920
 was built 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.010
 For example, if you are the cross 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.260
 sewed in the steering wheel then look closer 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.510
 There are really 50 men and women 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.159
 who are currently sitting in the factory of steering wheels 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.720
 and that with a needle and a 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.909
 thread through there and should 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.830
 at some point the name or colors 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.020
 tear 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.550
 then starting from scratch, it is 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.400
 everything freezes out and it works 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.230
 come back from the front that comes 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.620
 for example the wood in this vehicle 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.350
 a piano lacquer piano lacquer black not 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.870
 just one of me is what stuck 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.480
 or based on plastic but 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.090
 it actually makes a walnut here 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.640
 simply painted black by me 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.630
 So the ground substance is still 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.970
 a very high quality wood products 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.070
 Banker Cabriolet is a real four 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.410
 season car that means you can do it in 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.130
 every situation at any time of the year 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.680
 move 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.500
 This cable is equipped with a 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.030
 lappen warmer also has the same time 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.880
 Advantage that I am at cold temperatures 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.160
 never get problems with the train because 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.380
 around my neck always a comforting warm 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.840
 Narrow rule I can the roof 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.850
 also from the outside as well as from the inside 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.730
 open and close even during the 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.410
 ride with light roller 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.180
 it is in five obscuring were the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.910
 So also means I can in winter 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.739
 the vehicle with ice and snow also the 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.570
 Leave weather without being exposed 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.310
 Something breaks then everywhere 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.420
 double glazing itself in the real 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.830
 glass pane behind 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.830
 nobody has 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:40.340
 they test today in new gtx v8 sv 8 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.050
 stands for a four- liter v8 and that 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.350
 whole here fired with a double 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.290
 turbo this engine comes originally 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.150
 from the audi rs6 and so she next to the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.360
 plastic here still see what really 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.000
 Under the hood is this engine 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.880
 an absolute technical marvel 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.800
 because they see two turbochargers against 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.560
 here on the machine 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.300
 This makes the motor much more compact 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.730
 as all other machines we do 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.560
 currently operate with two turbochargers 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.340
 and she sits on it 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.290
 vorderachse 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.730
 So now you have diesel engine 5 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.200
 128 ps of power a cylinder 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.730
 deactivation that is four out of eight 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.230
 Cylinders can get under the ride 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.390
 also in a sleep mode what to ask 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.250
 clear ranges and fuel 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.470
 performance brings with it and 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.630
 at the same time the engine is moving 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.030
 front axle and thus they have one 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.560
 better guidance and a more agile fan 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.890
 the front axle of the car is not too 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.890
 topheavy 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.680
 next to the many different ones 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.539
 the Bentley models are already available 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.220
 For example, that's how it works 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:27.940
 coupe and two different ones 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.280
 limousines will be a world on the iaa 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.759
 premiere of our bentley band eger so 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.770
 Give a jeep a suv and we expect 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.150
 This vehicle is very hot in the next 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.729
