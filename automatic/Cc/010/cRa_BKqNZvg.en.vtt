00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
at all and in game I found that his

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.120 
at all and in game I found that his
place<00:00:24.990> didn't<00:00:25.289> let<00:00:25.380> him<00:00:25.500> down<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
place didn't let him down in the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.429 
place didn't let him down in the
slightest<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.269> now<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.779> his<00:00:27.960> shooting<00:00:28.289> his

slightest so now on to his shooting his

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.080 
slightest so now on to his shooting his
class<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.890> suggesting<00:00:29.400> he<00:00:29.490> has<00:00:29.580> an<00:00:29.730> overall

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
class that suggesting he has an overall

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.600 
class that suggesting he has an overall
shot<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.449> 82<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.230> believe<00:00:31.769> me<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.340> such

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
shot of 82 and believe me this is such

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.970 
shot of 82 and believe me this is such
an<00:00:32.790> understatement<00:00:33.270> get<00:00:34.140> him<00:00:34.320> anywhere<00:00:34.739> in

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
an understatement get him anywhere in

an understatement get him anywhere in
the<00:00:35.100> box<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.460> he<00:00:35.760> won't<00:00:36.000> power<00:00:36.300> at<00:00:36.570> home<00:00:36.719> I

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the box and he won't power at home I

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.630 
the box and he won't power at home I
found<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.559> long<00:00:37.770> shots<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.250> pretty<00:00:38.430> good

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
moving on to his passing his in game

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.369 
moving on to his passing his in game
stats<00:00:49.770> are<00:00:50.160> all<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> way<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> high<00:00:51.239> 90s

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
stats are all the way up in the high 90s

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.930 
stats are all the way up in the high 90s
very<00:00:52.379> good<00:00:52.620> link-up<00:00:52.920> player<00:00:53.129> nice<00:00:53.460> root<00:00:53.730> balls

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
very good link-up player nice root balls

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.750 
very good link-up player nice root balls
the<00:00:54.420> very<00:00:54.770> disordered<00:00:55.770> part<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> game<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the very disordered part of the game and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.000 
the very disordered part of the game and
so<00:00:56.940> he<00:00:57.030> should<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.870> 87<00:00:58.530> passed<00:00:58.770> out

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
so he should be with that 87 passed out

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.340 
so he should be with that 87 passed out
on<00:00:59.129> his<00:00:59.250> card<00:00:59.550> now<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.480> cover<00:01:00.780> his<00:01:00.960> dribbling

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
on his card now to cover his dribbling

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.200 
on his card now to cover his dribbling
he's<00:01:01.530> very<00:01:01.800> much<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> holdup<00:01:02.550> sort<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.969> player

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
he's very much a holdup sort of player

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.899 
he's very much a holdup sort of player
it<00:01:04.110> suggests<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.710> he's<00:01:04.860> got<00:01:04.979> 87<00:01:05.460> dribbling

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
it suggests that he's got 87 dribbling

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.910 
it suggests that he's got 87 dribbling
in<00:01:06.119> game<00:01:06.330> which<00:01:06.479> or<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.020> honesty<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.470> found

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
in game which or in all honesty I found

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.590 
in game which or in all honesty I found
it<00:01:08.010> hard<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.369> believe<00:01:08.549> he<00:01:08.880> basically<00:01:09.299> felt

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
it hard to believe he basically felt

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.390 
it hard to believe he basically felt
like<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> trig<00:01:10.049> we're<00:01:10.260> moving<00:01:10.680> he's<00:01:11.070> slow<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
like a trig we're moving he's slow to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.070 
like a trig we're moving he's slow to
change<00:01:11.520> direction<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.600> he<00:01:12.720> can<00:01:12.900> be

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
change direction but he can be

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.450 
change direction but he can be
occasionally<00:01:13.740> pretty<00:01:13.979> good<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> floor

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
occasionally pretty good on the floor

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.920 
occasionally pretty good on the floor
with<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.820> offense<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> right<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.900> left

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
with the offense to the right and left

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.200 
with the offense to the right and left
and<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.560> sort<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.830> ball<00:01:17.040> rolls<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.759> wouldn't

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
and a sort of ball rolls but I wouldn't

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.940 
and a sort of ball rolls but I wouldn't
suggest<00:01:18.270> doing<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.900> sort<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.229> skill<00:01:19.500> moves<00:01:19.710> with

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
suggest doing a sort of skill moves with

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.890 
suggest doing a sort of skill moves with
him<00:01:20.220> his<00:01:20.700> defense<00:01:21.060> I've<00:01:21.270> found<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.659> pretty

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
him his defense I've found to be pretty

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.570 
him his defense I've found to be pretty
good<00:01:21.990> uses<00:01:22.530> his<00:01:22.680> strength<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.220> his<00:01:23.310> ability

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
good uses his strength and his ability

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.850 
good uses his strength and his ability

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
to take the ball off his opponents he's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.340 
to take the ball off his opponents he's
got<00:01:26.040> all<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.610> stats<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.119> an<00:01:27.240> insane<00:01:27.689> CDM

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
but he's just lacking something in that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.120 
but he's just lacking something in that
area<00:01:30.329> whether<00:01:30.630> or<00:01:30.810> not<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.229> his<00:01:31.380> positioning

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.830 
area whether or not it's his positioning
he<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.610> doesn't<00:01:32.850> perform<00:01:33.180> well<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.600> that
