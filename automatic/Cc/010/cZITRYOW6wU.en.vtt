my<00:00:29.910> first<00:00:30.180> impression<00:00:30.600> on<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> bike<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.170> Wow

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.650 

the<00:00:35.710> new<00:00:35.860> overall<00:00:36.340> a<00:00:36.370> package<00:00:37.030> on<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.240> bike<00:00:37.480> is

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
the new overall a package on the bike is

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.810 
the new overall a package on the bike is
really<00:00:37.990> cool<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.560> suspension<00:00:39.190> works<00:00:39.400> so<00:00:39.610> good

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
really cool the suspension works so good

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.710 
really cool the suspension works so good
with<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.060> new<00:00:40.270> chassis<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:41.820> new<00:00:42.820> design<00:00:43.150> that

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
with the new chassis a new design that

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.600 
with the new chassis a new design that
creates<00:00:44.050> some<00:00:44.200> more<00:00:44.380> mass<00:00:44.590> centralization<00:00:45.070> of

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
creates some more mass centralization of

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.580 
creates some more mass centralization of
the<00:00:45.700> bike<00:00:45.880> this<00:00:46.450> seemed<00:00:46.660> like<00:00:46.690> your<00:00:47.380> body

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
the bike this seemed like your body

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.900 
the bike this seemed like your body
position<00:00:47.800> and<00:00:48.190> everything<00:00:48.580> was<00:00:48.700> more

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
position and everything was more

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.240 
position and everything was more
centrally<00:00:49.390> located<00:00:52.290> it<00:00:53.290> allows<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.710> bike<00:00:54.070> to

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
centrally located it allows the bike to

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.800 
centrally located it allows the bike to
get<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.490> wait<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.700> little<00:00:54.970> bit<00:00:55.120> lower<00:00:55.330> a<00:00:55.480> little

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
get the wait a little bit lower a little

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.140 
get the wait a little bit lower a little
bit<00:00:55.900> more<00:00:56.050> forward<00:00:56.380> which<00:00:57.040> in<00:00:57.370> handling<00:00:57.880> terms

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
bit more forward which in handling terms

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.700 
bit more forward which in handling terms
means<00:00:58.720> everything<00:00:59.230> I<00:01:00.930> think<00:01:01.930> that<00:01:02.140> this<00:01:02.440> bike

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
means everything I think that this bike

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.110 
means everything I think that this bike
is<00:01:02.740> definitely<00:01:03.340> one<00:01:03.490> of<00:01:03.520> the<00:01:03.640> best<00:01:03.790> handling

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
is definitely one of the best handling

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.469 
is definitely one of the best handling
bikes<00:01:04.360> I've<00:01:04.540> ever<00:01:04.690> written<00:01:04.930> in<00:01:05.110> my<00:01:05.140> life<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:07.450> be

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
bikes I've ever written in my life to be

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.469 
bikes I've ever written in my life to be
so<00:01:07.930> nimble<00:01:08.350> that's<00:01:08.650> a<00:01:08.890> that's<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.280> huge<00:01:09.610> huge

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
so nimble that's a that's a huge huge

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.219 
so nimble that's a that's a huge huge
part<00:01:10.840> of<00:01:10.900> going<00:01:11.140> fast<00:01:12.479> officially<00:01:13.479> it<00:01:13.660> jumps

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
part of going fast officially it jumps

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.200 
part of going fast officially it jumps
in<00:01:14.350> tight<00:01:14.590> corners<00:01:14.890> are<00:01:15.160> have<00:01:15.280> a<00:01:15.310> much<00:01:15.610> better

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
in tight corners are have a much better

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.250 
in tight corners are have a much better
control<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.500> bike<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:22.270> they<00:01:22.510> see<00:01:22.570> that<00:01:23.020> did

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
control and bike if they see that did

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:33.110 
control and bike if they see that did
you<00:01:23.290> like<00:01:24.869> all<00:01:25.869> right<00:01:26.050> now<00:01:30.060> nice

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.290 

it<00:01:33.900> feels<00:01:34.140> really<00:01:34.440> light<00:01:34.560> its<00:01:35.010> agile<00:01:35.310> things

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
it feels really light its agile things

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.370 
it feels really light its agile things
quick<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.960> turn<00:01:38.420> with<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.450> air<00:01:39.660> fork<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.140> feel

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
quick to turn with the air fork I feel

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.750 
quick to turn with the air fork I feel
like<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.620> does<00:01:40.800> give<00:01:41.010> you<00:01:41.100> more<00:01:41.280> traction<00:01:41.550> on

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
like it does give you more traction on

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.850 
like it does give you more traction on
the<00:01:41.850> bike<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.150> kind<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.450> for<00:01:43.140> some<00:01:43.350> reason<00:01:43.770> it

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the bike it kind of for some reason it

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.380 
the bike it kind of for some reason it
just<00:01:43.890> wants<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.400> hook<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.730> and<00:01:44.910> those<00:01:45.030> corners

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
just wants to hook up and those corners

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.780 
just wants to hook up and those corners
really<00:01:45.540> good<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.990> stay<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.470> ground<00:01:49.790> and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
really good and stay on the ground and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.400 
really good and stay on the ground and
my<00:01:50.910> first<00:01:51.210> initial<00:01:51.510> impression<00:01:52.110> was<00:01:52.200> how

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
my first initial impression was how

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.690 
my first initial impression was how
light<00:01:52.650> it<00:01:52.800> was<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.160> whole<00:01:53.340> front<00:01:53.550> of<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
light it was the whole front of the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.720 
light it was the whole front of the
bikes<00:01:53.880> feels<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.390> lot<00:01:54.510> lighter<00:01:55.310> on<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> fast

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
bikes feels a lot lighter on the fast

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.910 
bikes feels a lot lighter on the fast
corners<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.360> suspension<00:01:57.900> feels<00:01:58.050> like<00:01:58.320> much

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
corners the suspension feels like much

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.830 
corners the suspension feels like much
more<00:01:58.950> grip<00:01:59.460> especially<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> front<00:02:00.510> end<00:02:00.720> of

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
more grip especially on the front end of

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.270 
more grip especially on the front end of
the<00:02:00.900> bike

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.590 

with<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.399> new<00:02:04.520> swingarm<00:02:05.030> it<00:02:05.179> was<00:02:05.270> actually

with the new swingarm it was actually

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.910 
with the new swingarm it was actually
really<00:02:05.750> cool<00:02:06.020> when<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.229> first<00:02:06.259> hopped<00:02:06.619> on<00:02:06.829> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.140 
they have a new style of riding with
staying<00:02:27.620> lower<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.310> flipping<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:28.970> bike<00:02:29.120> a

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
staying lower and flipping the bike a

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.850 
staying lower and flipping the bike a
lot<00:02:29.390> off<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.690> jumps<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.230> believe<00:02:30.440> this<00:02:30.620> bike<00:02:30.830> is

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
lot off the jumps I believe this bike is

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.120 
lot off the jumps I believe this bike is
really<00:02:31.250> geared<00:02:31.610> towards<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:33.650> Hardy<00:02:34.040> you

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
really geared towards that so Hardy you

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.380
