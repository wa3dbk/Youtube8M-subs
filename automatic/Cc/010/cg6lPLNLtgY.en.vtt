00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.440
 After that if I flick or drive something else 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.970
 Flick is so good 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.940
 Amount of flick rotation is the rotation of the ball 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.480
 It is easy to flick because it is decreasing 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.720
 It has become a reception time 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.560
 When the other party's serve is not cut that much 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.580
 After this ball's ball comes off faster 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.270
 The ball is hard and the ball is separated 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.650
 Because this way of coming out is fast because it is fast 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.540
 Flick can play without permission 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.239
 Because bread is easy to play 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.960
 Somehow I'm going to somehow enter 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.531
 I was good at playing this flick 

00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:44.110
 I wonder if there is a good time to come 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.899
 I think pretty much more 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.310
 I think it is a good technique to use 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.559
 That's right so far 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.550
 A little while discerning that the rotation is hanging 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.550
 Is it difficult to cut 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.290
 I flicked to see if it was broken 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.079
 If it's broken, it's a bit silly 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.091
 I changed it to Tsuzuki 

00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:03.530
 If it is this new ball quite enough 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:20.969
 I think I can do it. 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.279
 After a little more and more various techniques 

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:26.679
 It's kun, but after that it's Tsutsuki 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.749
 I was a little bit worried about it 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:33.399
 I've been floating for a while 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.599
 This plastic ball is what the ball is 

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.380
 It is a ball that is easy to draw arcs 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.349
 Of the type that the ball goes up without permission 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:43.889
 Even if you are hitting it because it is a ball 

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:46.729
 Even if you drive up a little, go up 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.259
 Even if it goes down, it goes up a little 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.639
 It's kind of going up something 

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:56.159
 Hwaan will go up so far 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.649
 If you cut it down, something low and deep 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.239
 I could do it if I slipped the slippery slippery 

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:06.009
 I do not go so much now 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.009
 It seems to stop 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.120
 It is from above even if it is not really awkward than ever 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.090
 It's like a cut if you don't hold it down 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.719
 If you do not press down like a front-end cut 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:20.400
 After sliding, it's about the bottom turn 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.569
 I said a bit about stopping 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.819
 Tsutsuki is also the same stop 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.969
 If I cut it down, I'm going to go deep 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:37.129
 On the way to the opponent's court 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:43.610
 I'm going to stop If I try to hit the opponent 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.829
 I'll stop, this is a bit 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.182
 I wonder if the attacking power of Tsutsuki will fall 

00:02:49.182 --> 00:02:52.670
 When Tsutsukigan is doing and attacking 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.469
 I wonder if this is all the way away from the ball 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:01.650
 Before leaving and holding the ball because there is a gap 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.349
 It's popping and I'm out of here 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.540
 It's same as the drive and I'm out on the way 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.219
 I wanted to hang it for a while, like I'm already leaving 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.670
 Such rotation is a little 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.900
 The ball is becoming smaller while becoming smaller 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.530
 As it is lower rotation, it seems like the speed is large and not fast 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.079
 It seems like this is a stopping force 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.469
 Because it is getting lost more and more 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.421
 I would like to go back a bit more 

00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:29.430
 Fein there the other party 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.870
 It is said that there is a possibility that Don will go 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.420
 Tsutsuki is getting a little harder 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.360
 So why don't you cut it 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.749
 You just have to fit deep 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:43.920
 It looks like knuckles 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.189
 If you like a push-in system 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.060
 Rather, it may be good for development 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.810
 How to strike may be divided from now on 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.049
 There was such a feeling 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:10.439
 Tsutuki is
