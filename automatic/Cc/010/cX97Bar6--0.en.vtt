smog it's for the NOx emission I'll go

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.539 
smog it's for the NOx emission I'll go
through<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.269> couple<00:00:58.019> steps<00:00:58.290> I<00:00:58.589> took<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.100> do<00:00:59.400> the

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
through a couple steps I took to do the

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:00.979 
through a couple steps I took to do the
Diagnostics<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.299> this<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.600> find<00:01:00.629> out<00:01:00.869> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
Diagnostics on this to find out the

Diagnostics on this to find out the
problem

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.640 

on<00:01:05.490> EGR<00:01:05.940> valves<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:06.990> they<00:01:07.470> actually

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
on EGR valves because they actually

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.090 
on EGR valves because they actually
hamper<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.640> performance<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> vehicle

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
hamper the performance of the vehicle

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.860 
hamper the performance of the vehicle
they're<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> little<00:01:11.370> vacuum<00:01:12.090> diaphragm<00:01:12.390> valve

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
they're a little vacuum diaphragm valve

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.700 
they're a little vacuum diaphragm valve
and<00:01:13.140> when<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.130> add<00:01:14.670> vacuum<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> motor<00:01:16.500> that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and when you add vacuum to a motor that

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.950 
and when you add vacuum to a motor that
is<00:01:16.830> running<00:01:17.010> at<00:01:17.250> idle<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:18.360> will<00:01:18.480> notice<00:01:18.840> a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
is running at idle you will notice a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.010 
is running at idle you will notice a
change<00:01:19.490> instant<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:21.150> listen<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.510> motor<00:01:21.690> as<00:01:21.870> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
change instant you listen the motor as I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.370 
change instant you listen the motor as I
pull<00:01:22.260> a<00:01:22.290> vacuum<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.980> thing<00:01:27.050> almost<00:01:28.050> ought

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
pull a vacuum on this thing almost ought

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.180 
pull a vacuum on this thing almost ought
to<00:01:28.500> make<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> thing<00:01:28.980> die<00:01:29.190> and<00:01:29.880> run<00:01:30.660> terrible

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
to make the thing die and run terrible

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.690 
to make the thing die and run terrible
release<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.310> vacuum

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
release the vacuum

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.999 
release the vacuum
so<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.240> was<00:01:34.330> back<00:01:34.479> to<00:01:34.509> running<00:01:34.869> food<00:01:35.290> we<00:01:35.830> know

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
so I was back to running food we know

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.030 
so I was back to running food we know
the<00:01:36.220> EGR<00:01:36.430> valve<00:01:36.729> is<00:01:36.850> opening<00:01:37.240> up<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:38.350> working

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
the EGR valve is opening up and working

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.820 
the EGR valve is opening up and working
the<00:01:39.130> way<00:01:39.220> it<00:01:39.340> should<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.810> we<00:01:41.080> go<00:01:41.229> elsewhere<00:01:41.619> to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
the way it should so we go elsewhere to

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.710 
the way it should so we go elsewhere to
find<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:42.310> particular<00:01:42.970> problem<00:01:43.390> with<00:01:43.509> this

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
find a particular problem with this

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.120 
find a particular problem with this
thing<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.200> after<00:01:44.860> my<00:01:45.189> extensive<00:01:45.640> Diagnostics

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
thing and after my extensive Diagnostics

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.359 
thing and after my extensive Diagnostics
we<00:01:48.130> had<00:01:48.220> found<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:49.659> little<00:01:50.100> sensor<00:01:51.100> right

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
we had found this little sensor right

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.910 
we had found this little sensor right
here<00:01:51.700> it's<00:01:52.509> a<00:01:52.690> pressure<00:01:52.960> sensor<00:01:53.409> it<00:01:53.560> measures

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
here it's a pressure sensor it measures

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.210 
here it's a pressure sensor it measures
how<00:01:54.600> much<00:01:55.600> pressures<00:01:56.049> inside<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.560> intake<00:01:56.920> or

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
how much pressures inside the intake or

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.580 
how much pressures inside the intake or
vacuum<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:59.259> is<00:01:59.590> directly<00:02:00.149> checking<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:02.140> EGR

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
vacuum that is directly checking the EGR

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.580 
vacuum that is directly checking the EGR
valve<00:02:03.100> operation<00:02:03.670> I<00:02:04.119> found<00:02:04.960> has<00:02:05.110> got<00:02:05.289> a<00:02:05.320> little

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
valve operation I found has got a little

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.130 
valve operation I found has got a little
vacuum<00:02:05.920> hose<00:02:06.100> going<00:02:06.429> through<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.759> motor

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
vacuum hose going through the motor

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.830 
vacuum hose going through the motor
right<00:02:08.140> behind<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.739> add<00:02:08.979> a<00:02:09.009> little<00:02:09.220> break<00:02:09.459> in<00:02:09.640> it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
right behind it add a little break in it

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.600 
right behind it add a little break in it
this<00:02:10.840> is<00:02:10.899> causing<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.560> false<00:02:11.799> signal<00:02:12.280> being

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
this is causing a false signal being

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.720 
this is causing a false signal being
sent<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.060> sensor<00:02:13.530> which<00:02:14.530> in<00:02:14.830> turn<00:02:15.220> turn<00:02:15.580> on

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
sent to the sensor which in turn turn on

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.050 
sent to the sensor which in turn turn on
the<00:02:16.150> code<00:02:16.390> for<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.930> EGR<00:02:17.290> bow<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.819> shows

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
the code for the EGR bow so that shows

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.430 
the code for the EGR bow so that shows
you<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.269> just<00:02:19.720> because<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:20.080> have<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.200> code

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
you that just because you have a code

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.259 
you that just because you have a code
doesn't<00:02:20.799> mean<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.069> that<00:02:21.280> particular<00:02:21.760> part

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
doesn't mean that that particular part
