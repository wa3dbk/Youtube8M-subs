00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.220
 hello I am match is I 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.840
 works as a senior manager 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.330
 accounts at parrot and I come to you 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.240
 present flower power today 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.519
 then the flower power is a sensor that 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.830
 works in bluetooth low energy and 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.140
 who will go back on your smartphone or 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.989
 on your compatible tablet the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.270
 information of your plant is rather 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.800
 the vital needs of your plant then 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.780
 these needs are 4 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.629
 since there is on the flower power four 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.390
 sensors you have needs in 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.430
 temperature of the moisture requirements of the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.309
 needs in sunshine and needs 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.280
 in fertilizer so this is a product that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.629
 will come inserted into the plant as 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.190
 this is from the application that we 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.760
 will find on the terminals 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.890
 compatible 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.359
 we can analyze the needs of the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.159
 plant on these four parameters 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.189
 once you have identified your 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.810
 plant the flower power will go up 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.060
 every 15 minutes the data 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.500
 vital of the plant send them on a 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.630
 database that contains more than 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.000
 6000 plants and compare the data 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.009
 going up from your plant to that of the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.229
 database so this will analyze 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.630
 compare and you will receive alerts 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.670
 directly on your smartphone or 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.350
 your tablet of course without having 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.680
 need to be close to the flower 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.500
 power who will tell you whether to put 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.689
 of water or drained the plant the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.340
 back because it's too hot or 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.020
 rightly take her out because she has 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.150
 need sun etc etc 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.500
 so it's a product that works in 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.329
 bluetooth low energy 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.759
 this for two reasons the first 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.310
 reason is that bluetooth energy 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.189
 allows strong energy savings 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.780
 since this is the last version 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.990
 bluetooth integrated in version 4.0 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.670
 and it allows the battery delivered with 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.130
 to have autonomy 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.390
 six months and the second reason the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.100
 bluetooth low energy is power 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.340
 operate with terminals 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.770
 therefore compatible bluetooth compatible 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.920
 low energy bluetooth smart ready as 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:19.080
 for example iphone ipad etc 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.790
 and so it is thanks to parrot and thanks 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.620
 the parrot flower power 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.620
 you will never throw your plants again
