number<00:00:17.429> two<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.669> some<00:00:18.029> knot-tying<00:00:18.480> theory<00:00:19.880> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
number two is some knot-tying theory the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.579 
number two is some knot-tying theory the
first<00:00:21.060> question<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.599> must<00:00:21.750> be<00:00:21.869> asked<00:00:22.439> is

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:22.589 
first question that must be asked is

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.859 
first question that must be asked is
what<00:00:22.919> type<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.189> knot<00:00:23.579> are<00:00:23.849> we<00:00:23.970> tying<00:00:24.269> anyway

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
what type of knot are we tying anyway

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.349 
what type of knot are we tying anyway
the<00:00:25.649> purist<00:00:26.099> surgeon<00:00:26.489> would<00:00:26.669> say<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.149> all

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
the purist surgeon would say that all

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.150 
the purist surgeon would say that all
knots<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.989> surgeries<00:00:28.439> should<00:00:28.679> be<00:00:28.800> square

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
knots and surgeries should be square

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.009 
knots and surgeries should be square
knots<00:00:29.399> with<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.759> throws<00:00:30.149> alternating<00:00:30.899> with

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
knots with the throws alternating with

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.410 
knots with the throws alternating with
each<00:00:31.169> other<00:00:31.489> while<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.699> is<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.000> type<00:00:33.210> of

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
each other while this is the type of
