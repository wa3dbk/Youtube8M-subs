00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.830
 swing organs wim hoofakker can be there for hours 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.870
 to listen to as his working life 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.360
 as a milk farmer on the amsterdamsestraatweg 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.610
 that much free time has passed 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.980
 and making his own organ 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.480
 i went to watch a lot when turning around in 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.029
 the inner city 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.769
 and then my son said of himself 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.140
 physically he would have money at all 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.980
 then you would rather not make that she does well 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.019
 she then i want a 90 key like it 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.940
 RTV Utrecht will be finished a few years ago 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.040
 long ago for a report 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.930
 because an amateur who can do a good organ 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.820
 building is a rarity 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.950
 just as rare as the organs themselves 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.390
 meanwhile, who and how often find it 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.890
 too bad the appreciation of the public 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.890
 has declined over the years 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.370
 I heard it as you see it yourself 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.289
 they also walk with fingers in their ears 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.920
 then settle slowly 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.629
 yes what is that yes yes we are sorry 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.489
 have 10 pike I really like that 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.680
 Unfortunately 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.210
 how different is that in the years before and after 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.309
 the second World War 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.479
 when the street organ man enters the street 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.310
 stop the clocks 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.490
 people come out and then it is 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.490
 party 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.380
 you heard that coming and then yes then 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.600
 did you actually listen and then 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.380
 were the customers who come to call me 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.000
 wild huppekee 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.340
 and then he went for a spin 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.480
 damse 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.790
 Wim himself has especially good ones 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.560
 memories of jopie wither the 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.330
 organ man who in the years after the second 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.080
 world war through the streets of utrecht 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.150
 walked 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.850
 jopie you hot and I'd rather he 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.730
 and they should have together with them 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.790
 ran to naika afterwards they did 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.740
 a me a couple of goes that 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.930
 I know that was first on the side 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.970
 Red bridge made somewhere 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.560
 Jopie died and now knows Utrecht 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.620
 just another organ man 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.360
 job buddingh so it is in more cities there 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.760
 is just a single professional driver 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.770
 about one of the historical organs 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.390
 many disappeared abroad 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.760
 museum clock is fortunately still intact 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.830
 some historical organs preserved from 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.350
 music box to pierement 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.090
 the older ones behind the cathedral in Utrecht 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.770
 people who have them very much 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.560
 nostalgic feeling while 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.420
 back to the old children who used to be 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.190
 you are watching the volume 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.680
 often what comes out 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.570
 we often don't know the organs yet 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.330
 but we always get really happy 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.170
 van because that is also the experience of wim 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.250
 horseshoe 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.019
 fortunately there are people who are the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.030
 see historical value of the organs 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.769
 and the maintenance of money in the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.450
 to bake money 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:39.370
 this street culture does not receive a subsidy 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.860
 we are among those who do not listen and 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.360
 who like to give because if I have one 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.180
 to give an arrogance 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.790
 yes yes that is how it should actually be yes 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.560
 it's no it's just a piece 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.870
 culture that must be preserved 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.760
 yes, apart from wim there are a few 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.070
 utrechters who stand with heart and soul 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.959
 makes use of the organs with them you 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.290
 knowledge in the next episode of me
