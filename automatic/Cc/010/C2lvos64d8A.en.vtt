00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
could perhaps just end up doing a bust

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.080 
could perhaps just end up doing a bust
and<00:04:43.289> perhaps<00:04:43.889> hitting<00:04:44.310> right<00:04:44.580> here<00:04:44.849> would<00:04:45.030> be

the photon cannon would just end up
getting<00:04:49.110> destroyed<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:49.710> now<00:04:50.190> what's<00:04:50.789> going
