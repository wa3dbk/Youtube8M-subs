00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:13.579
 hello youtube friends today I will give you some criticism of 'fifa 11' and alps 11 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:19.169
 as we know ea sport style konami are eternal rivals because the two companies 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.779
 have created these wonderful games from 2002 to 2010 have improved 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.579
 pretty in all aspects 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.489
 well we start fifa 11 will be here 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.839
 will improve an impeccable simulation seemed impossible but it is already in itself 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:34.940
 Has got 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.470
 the title has inherited the best characteristics of the edition of the 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.190
 world 2010 and has merged them with the existing ones in fifa 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.190
 the fifa result 11 is very satisfactory 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.940
 the most striking novelty of fifa 11 is the control of the goalkeeper 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.300
 we anticipate that its handling is complicated but that it adds 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.200
 new dimension to the multiplayer games available in mode of 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.220
 eleven against eleven for the first time in the history of simulators 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.200
 soccer 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.330
 almost everything has become customizable from the chants of the fans to 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.660
 the stadiums that can now be edited from the game 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.190
 of course the fifa 11 strong is still there are the more than 30 leagues 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.540
 Official 500 teams and 15 thousand licensed players 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.400
 animations graphics and artificial intelligence have reached in fifa 11 a 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.220
 very high quality level 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.030
 the football that is played has a real flavor 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.950
 in fact the new fifa 11 penalty system much more difficult 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.509
 frustrate more than one player and the same goes for fouls for playing the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.360
 ball with hands 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.630
 fifa 11 has more aces in the manga career mode in which he will embody a 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.630
 Player a coach or manager for 15 seasons 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.280
 the new system of passes killed her pro passing 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.100
 and personal and pti a database of player behaviors 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.490
 will be 'fifa 11' the top scorer this season 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.990
 we do not know 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.619
 of which we are sure is that we are one of the soccer games 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.619
 more realistic and fun of all time 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.729
 now I will tell you the pro and cons 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.729
 incredible variety of championships and modalities 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.889
 multiplayer games hilarious and without the atp 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:20.049
 Artificial intelligence is very good 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.719
 more customization options 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.099
 unprecedented realism 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.099
 cons same graphics engine last year 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.799
 excessive difficulty of penalties 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.689
 and for those who sounded interesting about the game here I will leave the requirements 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.509
 minimum requirements pentium processor megahertz 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:42.939
