00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.680
 Yes, I let out for some reason it seemed to me 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.579
 that I am still unworthy to attend 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.800
 here in this theater I'm probably just 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:35.660
 scared and no if it is at all 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.670
 frankly in 2011 Christina Shapran 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.739
 graduated from the Russian Ballet Academy 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.530

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.910
 Kovalev and went to Moscow musical 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.230
 Stanislavsky Theater and 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.480
 Nemirovich-Danchenko 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.300
 then there was work in the mikhailovsky theater 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.430
 in Petersburg and finally something happened 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.239
 what was to happen another 4 years 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.969
 backwards 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.240
 Kristina Shapran became ballet soloists 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.020
 Mariinsky Theater 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.030
 on her first step on the first 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.280
 performance with the Mariinsky Theater can be 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.320
 say only the most positive things 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.780
 because she came at the end of the past 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.360
 the season has already done such work as 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.700
 corsair she danced at the end of the past 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.680
 season danced giselle she was on 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.780
 touring with mariinsky theater on stage 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.150
 Gordon's coven received very high 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.070
 assessment of british critique christ christ 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.550
 wrote it as about the future of Mariinsky 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.550
 theater 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.440
 as a child I liked to dance us 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.659
 told that when seashell music and 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.150
 began to move apart then I went 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.530
 on sports dance 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:53.680
 but I never had a dream 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.630
 be im observation cristina and today 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.479
 continues to be a fragile girl 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.360
 which is needed support and protection and 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.490
 and giselle in the first act looks at the world 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.549
 trustingly wide eyes of the child 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.110
 unable to survive the betrayal and in 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.110
 overnight grow and I 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.690
 I develop this quality of a fighter 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.140
 i am actually very soft me easy 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.140
 to hurt 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
 but 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.110
 falling legal defeat gonna be in 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.110
 hands go on 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.940
 and by the way if they were not there would be 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.670
 much harder and sometimes they are needed for 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.070
 shake up life happens to me 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.370
 so long ago it must be someone else 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.750
 just less is not someone a little more 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.010
 Kristina recently debuted in ballet 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.010
 park preorder 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.180
 later we danced with us recently 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.610
 touring in brazil i have his hands 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.370
 all feel calm clean 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.120
 emotionally I like bones 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.160
 how does he feel the fairy dance at rehearsals 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.440
 he on some items some things not 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.870
 prompted she knows this ballet and 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.910
 some things he feels emotionally 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.910
 and can convey it very cool 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.290
 he 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.660
 at 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.849
 In principle, there are no complicated ones. 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:02.459
 technical elements something like there y 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.349
 some hotels do not know about the skokov on 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.930
 one foot is very important to pass 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.930
 emotions 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.930
 but 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.389
 I want all of any experiment 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.130
 I don't want to dwell on one thing for me 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.220
 it seems when an artist is diverse it 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.530
 great because the ballerina is short 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.210
 Naturally, almost all at once you understand 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.750
 what is wrong you must pass 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.750
 through all 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.610
 Kristina Shapran is a ballerina 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.009
 which is intriguing because she has 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.860
 tremendous opportunities tremendous makings and 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.240
 what she especially attracts me not 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.180
 only its exterior is amazing 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.370
 harmonious texture beauty line 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.229
 Beauty face on beautiful and perfect 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.300
 it is a huge proportion in which she 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.090
 depth, and even this is a deep and 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.580
 sometimes it bothers her on stage and in general they have 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.919
 rare type extremely nervous some 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.110
 organizations are exacerbated this is a rare type 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.539
 very valuable and very fragile 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.060
 as a particularly cherish a theater with 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.500
 it works to select the repertoire at all 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.870
 would like to wish to dance more 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.840
 Here I am watching as if with a huge 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.129
 pleasure of course i am not a man 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.430
 who lives inside the ballet but with 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:47.949
 great pleasure how is mastering 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.770
 western repertoire and in ballet well 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:55.300
 what is modern ballet well for example 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.189
 opera we have so very few singers 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.500
 who will come tenor and say i want 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:01.810
 singing a player i will disappoint ballet all 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.430
 on the contrary, I will say why here is a classic 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.979
 requires the perfect 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.650
 and perfect performance the slightest 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.699
 deviations from the norm, and this is a marriage 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.039
 modern 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:13.990
 you are free you can die like that 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.360
 Can more than you can lower it 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:20.819
 approximate, I understand you, but there is 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.819
 ethics so they relax model
