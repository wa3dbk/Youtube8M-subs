00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
not doing anything of off track so I

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.150 
not doing anything of off track so I
know<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.780> way<00:00:33.870> it'll<00:00:34.020> come<00:00:34.230> off<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.770> numbers

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
know the way it'll come off the numbers

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.990 
know the way it'll come off the numbers
will<00:00:35.340> go<00:00:35.520> down<00:00:35.700> as<00:00:35.760> they<00:00:36.090> need<00:00:36.360> to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
because i am not a runner well I guess I

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.550 
because i am not a runner well I guess I
wasn't<00:02:05.110> before<00:02:05.619> now<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:07.060> yeah<00:02:08.020> I<00:02:08.050> like<00:02:08.379> to

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
wasn't before now but yeah I like to

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.380 
wasn't before now but yeah I like to

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
think I mean it took me less than 30

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.440 
think I mean it took me less than 30
minutes<00:02:10.479> I<00:02:10.989> know<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:12.129> do<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.400> run<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:13.239> do<00:02:13.360> the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
minutes I know to do the run to do the
