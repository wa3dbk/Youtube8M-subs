microtransactions<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.430> definitely<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
microtransactions and is definitely a

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.590 
microtransactions and is definitely a
full<00:01:09.390> game<00:01:10.190> be<00:01:11.190> sure<00:01:11.429> though<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.910> isn't<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
full game be sure though this isn't the

full game be sure though this isn't the
type<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.810> game<00:01:13.050> you<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.350> sit<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.649> play<00:01:13.770> for

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
six hours out of time in my opinion this

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.290 
six hours out of time in my opinion this
works<00:01:16.979> best<00:01:17.220> as<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.399> lunch<00:01:17.610> break<00:01:17.759> style<00:01:18.119> game

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300
