 Nature conservation Brechts Frank Mill from the beginning of this and we want 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.910
 otherwise Poulsen is responsible for the fire damage 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.669
 because the second tip was the Dortmund and who here 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:19.150
 Methusalem Wolfgang Kneib he has seen many players still in the Bundesliga 38 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.880

 long octopus arms Messiah almost 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.770
 two meters tall 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.890
 Wolfgang Knaak 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.739
 because the Dortmund wanted Boll 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.800
 forgetting the defeat of Rostock make shows like this one again Frank 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.450
 Mill 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.050
 Tourists in the first quarter of an hour, the amateurs from Bielefeld 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.710
 had Boll 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.659
 very much 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.560
 Respect for their guests 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.630
 definitely in the beginning 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.610
 that was Cloud Reinartz again for a lot of pressure from the left 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.550
 cared and 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.490
 I said so 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.490
 Elegant Swiss and wants to miss 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.370
 Rummenigge shoots the ball high above the goal 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.840
 one of the many Dortmund opportunities often initiated by 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.420
 this to her 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.040
 Shear Resort 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.510
 Just past Roth players over and how high Rummenigge have shot over them 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.670
 even this one 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.850
 the rain came 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.930
 a big central 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.590
 Although they do not say many problems with drugs Wolfgang Reinhart 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.310
 so very gradually 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.670
 played the amateurs free of their defense turned always better on the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.170
 Dortmund 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.840
 they also planned to go forward over the midline once 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.710
 gained respect 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.120
 not always fair 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.780
 my style is pleasing 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.110
 believing in it 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.160
 yellow in the free economy 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.670
 before the outstanding referee has another game under control safely 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:09.859
 product-update 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:11.249
 the sinner 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:14.059
 what do they do from the Free State yes the victory 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.220
 there is still the experience they have a lot of respect 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.810
 his very young team made many mistakes 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.539
 we hope to become masters and then they catch each other 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.589
 this great 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:26.609
 Renault wants 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.489
 Rummenigge 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.789
 Berbalk Corp. 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:31.960
 I did not want to fall 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.610
 still zero to zero 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.610
 played for half an hour 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.869
 Cologne lured 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:40.259
 but 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.259
 Merkel is in the way 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.969
 the rain was strong that lasted ten minutes but you could do with it 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.979
 continue to play coach Tuchel 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:52.719
 he knew well that was last year 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.719
 Westfalen performance the same feat he should with Dr 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.839
 they will not duck now either 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:01.709
 Respect and thanks 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.139
 large area clarified 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.279
 quite a few times out of his energetic run since October the 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:08.140
 spectator 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.000
 17 breaks, by the way, was always satisfied with the performance of her team 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 got better 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:23.649
 Heinemann as I said a very brutal referee Dortmund initially 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:24.619
 Fire 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:26.979
 was pretty fizzy 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.979
 and always respect 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.709
 Played often broken, the weir must again far out of his gate 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:43.649
 that was the last chance before the break half time 0 to 0 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:45.599
 a bit disappointing for the Dortmunder 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.350
 who wanted to rehabilitate there for their 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.900
 Shameful as a future Lago on it 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.900
 look at this attack of the Bielefelder 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.969
 there slips meant Vettel and cap 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:03.250
 warps from 15 meters freestanding in front of the BA same applies to OM 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.639
 have to be 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.819
 what the Dortmunders do not show very much they stick out then they make an effort 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.389
 but 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.179
 the cover of the Bielefelder 11 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:16.969
 they even go out of their way to show slow motion right away 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:19.289
 Report follows with his car 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.829
 can make you uncomfortable 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.349
 does not come 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.400
 for this 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.400
 Wolfgang Kneib 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.889
 they had a good grip on that 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.860
 Oberding sat down with a picture of Google like it does not care about the 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.470
 feet 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.639
 Luisa was awakened by Collenberg and almost certainly 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.639
 Michael Schultz a spare part here is a long shot 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.860
 to play out the Bielefeld cover was not in this phase 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.620
 still zero to zero interfering threatening already played 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.330
 the freshman always cheeky and look like you like the idea Ballack 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.330
 fight 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.070
 and then introduce a counterattack he initiated neither danger 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.599
 two steps too late 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:17.939
 very attentive 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:20.229
 for the WWF 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.439
 already dead Paulsen Dornbirn for Molotow screen Poschner 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:28.330
 Robbers did it right, he puts his nose around, appreciating it 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
 Coach of the Bielefelder 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:38.209
 dat Feith the referee foul me my Schlappe reader myself 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.570
 pushes her knee under the lower leg of Collenberg 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.210
 but there is free kick for the daughter 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.949
 Rummenigge 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.409
 That was always the one that played seven Bielefeld hands 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.949
 Schulz 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:00.879
 passbooks 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:03.879
 Walter Mayer everything can hardly be separated from the ball 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.020
 then she covers Nelles drain according to Rummenigge 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:14.110
 and the shoots from 20 meters out of 18 meters compare 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.289
 very tenderly next to the posts 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.320
 Update 15 rewards brings its Dortmund 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.320
 with one to zero 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.849
 but then also for the stomach 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:30.389
 Tobias light / to keep quite clear all night next to the post 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:35.509
 how the ball into the net one to zero so that was 72 cents lie that is with us 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.639
 always been exchanged 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.889
 is preparing nicely 4 francs 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:42.389
 and he knows no mercy 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:43.690
 2 back 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.060
 for the Dortmund Borussia in the 81 minutes 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.050
 and the wars then 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.439
 the beautiful preparation of Hausen 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:52.550
 Thurk wants is cold-blooded enough 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.559
 the ball 

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:57.379
 Approximately where the first goal has hit next to the post 

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:58.509
 Directing the gate 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:06:59.720
 Two to Zero 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.720
 for the Borussia so they are one lap further 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:12.409
 Verdict over 108 90 years but I believe Werder's goalkeeper Marek Lantz 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:14.580
 their apartments 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.610
 new goalkeeper Manuel Philipp Lahm or Ã¶zil becomes the first Bundesliga 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.870
 are going to play by a some movement but not operated apropos 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.689
 becomes 

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:25.499
 It was there a good two years ago 

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:27.009
 one or the other Harrods customer 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:29.990
 sometime be calls from the Federal Republic for the 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.869
 media entrepreneur 

00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:33.210
 he will be there near Melbourne 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.210
 in her career a much lower 

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:40.600
 Nadal serves Nadal but everything is just 

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.320
 together they chose a game that he would have tried with life
