00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
and then you let it soak in boiling

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:20.190 
and then you let it soak in boiling
water<00:01:12.500> for<00:01:13.160> 10<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.270> 20<00:01:14.570> seconds

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.490 

and<00:01:20.710> that<00:01:20.860> will<00:01:20.979> attach<00:01:21.280> itself<00:01:21.310> nicely<00:01:25.500> there

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
and that will attach itself nicely there

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.429 
and that will attach itself nicely there
we<00:01:26.590> go<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.540> that<00:01:28.750> looks<00:01:28.840> good

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439
