00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 i 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.920
 i 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.099
 gentlemen welcome to another episode 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.119
 when falcon king this time I bring you the 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.119
 update that had sent me 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:34.760
 the water shaders now running 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:36.920
 with this regular beings this 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.370
 mountains is getting a little 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.950
 famous because it is incredible the 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.950
 way you see the water 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.600
 how can they see now let's look 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.820
 here the water a bit like it looks 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.270
 and also the lights look how they are 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.180
 lighting right now and my house 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.180
 the corridor that I have to take to 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.949
 there where it says my house here too 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.150
 they have looks pretty pretty good 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.460
 we'll see 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.680
 any kind of lights is pretty 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.460
 well although it still has many errors 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.380
 in graphics this every time it loads 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.570
 the map 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.789
 in parts that should not come out in the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.930
 map but it's amazing the lights that you 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.530
 gives 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.729
 it's all very, very, very cool 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.470
 this what we were waiting for from 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.890
 a long time ago and now that what 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.909
 they will update by 1.3 will be 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.909
 very, very good 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.960
 as I tell you, you have quite a lot of mistakes 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.150
 enough errors 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.830
 but they were working on fixing them 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.830
 so that they look very chingón 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.340
 maybe one of the problems that 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.950
 have is also compatibility with 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.040
 some of the mods but mostly 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.480
 it is of the beings that it is that they need 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.260
 Fix yourself a bit like you can look 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.260
 look in the water 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.560
 I was very, very cool 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.119
 let's look over there 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.050
 look 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.050
 Sirs 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.140
 let's look here as seen between the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.959
 1 is the sun also this is quite 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.190
 pretty dark I say bright but 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.430
 it reaches a lot of shade again it's fine 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.430
 we are going to 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.230
 and put a little more brightness 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.370
 also how they look 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.740
 and once they fix these 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.140
 the details on how you look is the brightness 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.710
 looks very good but again has 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.020
 many graphic errors 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.390
 and they are already working on fixing the 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.740
 will look very much very much for the 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.800
 people who can 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.290
 this running this turn is going to be very 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.000
 chingón gentlemen the mere truth 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.000
 and now let's see again 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.300
 now it looks like a river of truth not 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:30.610
 a little lake look 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.610
 amazing, very cool 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.370
 we'll see 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.470
 as I told you they have errors to load 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.900
 but I do not know what I can do 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.890
 it's more like they know they have 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.620
 mistakes 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.209
 then they will be working for the 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.660
 competitiveness of cards so that 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.480
 work well with this either with the 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.400
 nvidia cards that is what I have or 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.200
 those of haiti that is the one with 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.980
 programming the programmer so that 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.160
 Of course it will come first 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.050
 updates for you 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.040
 but afterwards they will measure for the 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.040
 envy too 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.060
 giffords the giffords cards all 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:24.520
 that really is very small in him 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.520
 in the servers this 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.689
 As I told you, this cost me a lot 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.330
 work to implement it in 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:37.199
 in my text because they do not offer it in the 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:40.110
 you have to modify it enough texture 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.299
 things so that it works so that this 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.249
 trick because in itself it's a trick work 

00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:46.390
 in the text so that one wants if not no 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:49.140
 It is of high quality 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.140
 but let's see 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.029
 good gentlemen with this I leave you this is 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.490
 no more the first previous 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:58.800
 if they fix it well alright well I'm going 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.050
 to meet the 125 to make videos 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.770
 they are too too small as 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.229
 to not do the videos on this like this is 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.589
 that with this I say goodbye gentlemen I hope 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:13.840
 that you like this video and as I say 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:16.600
 If I fail to fix everything 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.560
 the things that are failing you right now 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.730
 Well, I'm going to start making videos 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.460
 using this text so that gentlemen we 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:29.229
 we see 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.229
