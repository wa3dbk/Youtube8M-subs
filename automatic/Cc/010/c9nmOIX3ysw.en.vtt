00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:21.250
 well this is oblivion although I've 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.590
 purchased is stainless steel and is the 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.080
 that we will put for the oven not those of 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.320
 people to touch because it's pretty 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.150
 big 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.410
 You are lucky to find it but 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.880
 Come on, it has cost me also his 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.880
 then what I have to do 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.260
 is 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:45.770
 and do it in everyone's cavity 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.410
 the bricks and once I'm stuck 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.040
 but I think that the functioning bases 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.210
 higher 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:01.760
 Well, now it's time for what is good 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:04.440
 scrubbing washed and rinsed steel 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.200
 stainless what has 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.280
 of good is why it is 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.280
 very hard very clean in the sense of 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.280
 cleaning 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.040
 and has shown a good mood 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.240
 gift to everything 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.180
 and with this clarified 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:34.020
 already begins to be ready to 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.020
 put this stainless steel tank 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.100
 It is the most important party where 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.830
 is going to make the whole region 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.830
 It is of a considerable thickness 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:54.190
 so we hope you do not have 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:58.140
 problems to heat everything that is 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.140
 is going to put him 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.590
 It has a lot of holes all 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.560
 around are threaded and there hook 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.860
 e a series of screws in addition to 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.069
 put also a way out 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.730
 for what it is 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.260
 the vapors that produce the food and 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.260
 once the doors are closed 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.170
 It's a pretty good piece 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.750
 and being stainless steel comes 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.750
 perfect for what is the shoulder
