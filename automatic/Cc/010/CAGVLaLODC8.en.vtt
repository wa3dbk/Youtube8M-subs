put<00:01:49.740> together<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.189> year<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.729> short

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
put together this year is a short

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.450 
put together this year is a short
wheelbase<00:01:51.539> 120<00:01:52.380> inch<00:01:52.530> wheelbase<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:53.219> use<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
wheelbase 120 inch wheelbase we use the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.740 
wheelbase 120 inch wheelbase we use the
rear<00:01:53.640> suspension<00:01:54.210> off<00:01:54.360> with<00:01:54.539> a<00:01:54.570> light-duty

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
rear suspension off with a light-duty

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.260 
rear suspension off with a light-duty
truck<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.039> a<00:01:56.130> link<00:01:56.340> coil<00:01:56.610> front<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.060> rear

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
truck so it's a link coil front and rear

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.539 
truck so it's a link coil front and rear
and<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:57.899> what<00:01:58.229> should<00:01:58.560> articulate<00:01:59.189> just

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
and it's what should articulate just

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.840 
and it's what should articulate just
like<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> Jeep<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:01.229> box<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.799> unique<00:02:02.130> it's

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
like a Jeep the box on it's unique it's

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.330 
like a Jeep the box on it's unique it's
made<00:02:03.090> out<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.570> ram<00:02:04.109> box<00:02:04.350> enter<00:02:04.740> and

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
made out of a ram box enter and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.150 
made out of a ram box enter and
dooley<00:02:05.700> outers<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.810> as<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.109> know<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
dooley outers but as you know it is the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.600 
dooley outers but as you know it is the
mecca<00:02:08.550> for<00:02:09.170> Japan's<00:02:10.170> world<00:02:10.709> over<00:02:11.129> they<00:02:11.459> all

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
mecca for Japan's world over they all

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.400 
mecca for Japan's world over they all
descend<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.090> there<00:02:12.269> so<00:02:12.390> for<00:02:12.870> us<00:02:12.930> it's<00:02:13.230> just

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
descend on there so for us it's just

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.470 
descend on there so for us it's just
very<00:02:13.620> very<00:02:13.950> exciting<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.489> be<00:02:14.610> there<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.090> every

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
very very exciting to be there and every

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.360 
very very exciting to be there and every
year<00:02:15.510> driven<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.230> course<00:02:16.440> by<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:17.160> know<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
those are the people to create design as

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.949 
those are the people to create design as
the<00:02:20.610> engineers<00:02:21.180> they<00:02:21.239> come<00:02:21.540> together<00:02:21.720> and

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
the engineers they come together and

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.600 
the engineers they come together and
they<00:02:22.080> create<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> series<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:23.040> vehicles<00:02:23.489> which

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
they create a series of vehicles which

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.369

is phenomenal and they use all the

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.259 
is phenomenal and they use all the
creativity<00:02:25.860> whether<00:02:26.370> that's<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.940> design

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
creativity whether that's in the design

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.460 
creativity whether that's in the design
side<00:02:27.569> or<00:02:27.840> whether<00:02:27.989> that's<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.379> the
