hopefully I can pick up a lot of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.690 
hopefully I can pick up a lot of
knowledge<00:01:34.439> from<00:01:34.619> them<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> tough

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
knowledge from them this is a tough

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.190 
knowledge from them this is a tough
course<00:01:36.000> or<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.390> mean<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.990> world

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
course or I mean and it's a world

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.840 
course or I mean and it's a world
championship<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.040> expected<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.729> it's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
championship so it's expected that it's

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.200 
championship so it's expected that it's
a<00:01:38.939> tough<00:01:39.119> course<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:40.079> guess<00:01:40.770> from<00:01:41.009> my

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
a tough course I guess from my

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
a tough course I guess from my
experience<00:01:42.210> where<00:01:42.450> probably<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:43.380> depends<00:01:43.829> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
experience where probably it depends a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.260 
experience where probably it depends a
little<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.189> guess<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.549> weather<00:01:44.759> as<00:01:45.030> well

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
little I guess on weather as well

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.090 
little I guess on weather as well
adverse<00:01:45.960> weather<00:01:46.110> conditions<00:01:46.649> obviously

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
adverse weather conditions obviously

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.010 
adverse weather conditions obviously
will<00:01:47.280> affect<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> completion<00:01:48.329> rate<00:01:48.479> on

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
will affect the completion rate on

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.359 
will affect the completion rate on
average<00:01:49.350> that's<00:01:49.710> probably<00:01:50.040> somewhere

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
average that's probably somewhere

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.310 
average that's probably somewhere
between<00:01:50.520> forty<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.030> fifty<00:01:51.329> five<00:01:51.990> percent

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
between forty and fifty five percent

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.200 
between forty and fifty five percent
that<00:01:52.740> will<00:01:52.860> successfully<00:01:53.520> complete<00:01:53.549> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
that will successfully complete I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.139 
that will successfully complete I
believe<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.200> biggest<00:01:55.950> challenge<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.880> bomb

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
believe the biggest challenge for a bomb

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.459 
believe the biggest challenge for a bomb
boy<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.689> will<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.820> just<00:01:59.820> having<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.990> many
