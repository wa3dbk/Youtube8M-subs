00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
so today's an onion you want to take the

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.269 
so today's an onion you want to take the
top<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.810> bottom<00:00:03.840> off<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.890> onion<00:00:05.130> which

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
top and the bottom off the onion which

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.550 
top and the bottom off the onion which
is<00:00:05.400> what<00:00:05.520> I've<00:00:05.640> done<00:00:05.790> here<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.810> then<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.230> cut<00:00:07.440> it

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
is what I've done here and then I cut it

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.379 
is what I've done here and then I cut it
in<00:00:07.620> half<00:00:07.700> and<00:00:08.700> I'll<00:00:08.790> go<00:00:08.970> ahead<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.210> remove

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
in half and I'll go ahead and remove

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.980 
in half and I'll go ahead and remove
that<00:00:09.960> outside<00:00:10.650> peel<00:00:11.010> which<00:00:11.460> obviously<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.269> no

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
that outside peel which obviously is no

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.709 
that outside peel which obviously is no
good<00:00:13.200> gen<00:00:13.710> Hannibal<00:00:14.099> just<00:00:14.219> toss<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.880> then

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
good gen Hannibal just toss it and then

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.540 
good gen Hannibal just toss it and then
find<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.379> root<00:00:16.619> end<00:00:16.770> there's<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.190> there's

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
find the root end there's the there's

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.150 
find the root end there's the there's
the<00:00:17.670> top<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.240> then<00:00:18.330> there's<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.630> bottom<00:00:19.160> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
the top and then there's the bottom the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.529 
the top and then there's the bottom the
bottom<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.550> can<00:00:20.609> see<00:00:20.699> kind<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.090> has<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> woody

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
bottom you can see kind of has a woody

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.529 
bottom you can see kind of has a woody
area<00:00:22.529> there<00:00:22.710> some<00:00:22.949> connective<00:00:23.369> tissue<00:00:23.609> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
area there some connective tissue and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.250 
area there some connective tissue and
just<00:00:24.689> use<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> v<00:00:25.170> cut<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.619> cut<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.279> right<00:00:26.490> out

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
just use a v cut and cut that right out

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.050 
just use a v cut and cut that right out
so<00:00:28.260> now<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.439> dice<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.830> there's<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.730> couple<00:00:29.910> ways

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
so now to dice it there's a couple ways

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.799 
so now to dice it there's a couple ways
to<00:00:30.179> do<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:31.610> one<00:00:32.610> way<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.329> cut<00:00:33.510> slices

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
to do it the one way you can cut slices

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.600 
to do it the one way you can cut slices
and<00:00:34.260> then<00:00:34.469> kind<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.739> turn<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> slices<00:00:35.489> and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
and then kind of turn the slices and

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.330 
and then kind of turn the slices and
then<00:00:35.670> dude<00:00:35.940> ice<00:00:36.149> on<00:00:36.510> them<00:00:37.079> like<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.770> don't

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
then dude ice on them like that I don't

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.060 
then dude ice on them like that I don't
really<00:00:38.460> do<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.700> method<00:00:39.290> it's<00:00:40.290> slower<00:00:40.680> than

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
really do that method it's slower than

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.500 
really do that method it's slower than
what<00:00:41.340> I'm<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.610> about<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.940> show<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.149> here

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
what I'm going about to show you here

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.860 
what I'm going about to show you here
this<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.370> technique<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.660> use

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
this is a this is a technique that I use

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.650 
this is a this is a technique that I use
where<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.340> see<00:00:47.550> I'm<00:00:47.820> cutting<00:00:48.329> through

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
where you can see I'm cutting through

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.500 
where you can see I'm cutting through
the<00:00:49.469> onion<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:49.950> not<00:00:50.309> all<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.640> way<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.390> end

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the onion but not all the way to the end

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.660 
the onion but not all the way to the end
so<00:00:52.440> there's<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.160> little<00:00:53.309> bit<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.579> that

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
so there's a little bit of that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.569 
so there's a little bit of that
connective<00:00:54.270> tissue<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:55.280> holds<00:00:56.280> everything

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
connective tissue that holds everything

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.060 
connective tissue that holds everything
together<00:00:56.910> hold<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> onion<00:00:57.690> together<00:00:57.980> and<00:00:58.980> you

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
together hold the onion together and you

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.889 
together hold the onion together and you
want<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.340> do<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.180> know<00:01:00.300> essentially<00:01:00.690> i'm

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
want to do that you know essentially i'm

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.599 
want to do that you know essentially i'm
doing<00:01:01.140> probably<00:01:01.379> eighth<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.890> an<00:01:01.980> NG<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
doing probably eighth of an NG to a

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.520 
doing probably eighth of an NG to a
quarter<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.030> an<00:01:03.149> inch<00:01:03.239> slices<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:04.170> important

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
quarter of an inch slices it's important

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.030 
quarter of an inch slices it's important
to<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.619> consistent<00:01:04.799> all<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.519> way<00:01:06.150> through

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
to be consistent all the way through

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.250 
to be consistent all the way through
however<00:01:08.040> large<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.549> want<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> dice<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
however large you want the dice is the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.539 
however large you want the dice is the
length<00:01:10.470> or<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.740> distance<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.189> want<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.430> make

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
length or the distance you want to make

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.910 
length or the distance you want to make
between<00:01:11.790> cuts<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:13.080> now<00:01:13.200> I've<00:01:13.350> got<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.680> kind<00:01:13.890> of

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
between cuts so now I've got it kind of

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.609 
between cuts so now I've got it kind of
fanned<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.760> one<00:01:15.000> way<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.420> want<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> turn<00:01:16.409> it

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
fanned out in one way I want to turn it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.219 
fanned out in one way I want to turn it
perpendicular<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:18.540> put<00:01:18.750> one<00:01:18.990> or<00:01:19.110> two

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
perpendicular and just put one or two

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.850 
perpendicular and just put one or two
cuts<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:20.900> horizontally<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.049> again<00:01:22.680> you'll

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
cuts in horizontally and again you'll

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.980 
cuts in horizontally and again you'll
notice<00:01:23.130> I'm<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.460> going<00:01:23.759> all<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.240> way<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
notice I'm not going all the way to the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.640 
notice I'm not going all the way to the
end<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.590> end<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.750> onion<00:01:27.750> I'm<00:01:28.049> going

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
end of the end of the onion I'm going

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.710 
end of the end of the onion I'm going
kind<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.890> halfway<00:01:29.100> through<00:01:29.610> put<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.479> more<00:01:30.659> in

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
kind of halfway through put one more in

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.670 
kind of halfway through put one more in
and<00:01:31.939> then<00:01:32.939> essentially<00:01:33.750> we've<00:01:33.990> got<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.500> dice

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
and then essentially we've got the dice

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.920 
and then essentially we've got the dice
created<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.670> held<00:01:35.939> together<00:01:36.090> by<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.540> end<00:01:36.630> of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
created just held together by the end of

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.109 
created just held together by the end of
the<00:01:37.020> onion<00:01:37.320> here<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.189> once<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.490> go<00:01:38.640> through<00:01:38.850> like

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the onion here so once I go through like

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.690 
the onion here so once I go through like
this<00:01:39.650> I've<00:01:40.650> got<00:01:41.009> these<00:01:41.759> nice<00:01:42.439> thanks<00:01:43.439> now<00:01:44.130> when
