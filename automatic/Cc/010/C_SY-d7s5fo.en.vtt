00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.199
 not taking away a new package from 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.369
 texture this time it's called adorable and 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.710
 well this texture I really liked not 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:28.550
 let's say the texture is not exaggerated and 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.350
 this does not feel a bit like more 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.339
 h of what is minecraft and not of 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.980
 let's first look at the earth that is what 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:40.010
 What else is worth highlighting is totally 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.409
 licit bid what is green or the 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.780
 pastito so to speak law for now 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:48.649
 can be others in everything 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.570
 which is plantations because the wheat the 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.750
 wheat that is the first one that looks the same 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.539
 that the sugar cane or sugar cane I do not know 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.780

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.579
 melons or watermelons the radishes and the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.399
 carrot the radishes that they do not have 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.940
 texture the flowers in the animals do not 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.950
 they change 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.560
 the samis good in general the modes do not 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.119
 they change into nothing and the paintings still 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.900
 they do not change them I do not know why but good 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.000
 all 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.980
 hard I 've found 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.900
 not counting the b12 because I would 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.880
 add the paintings but from there to 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.500
 there all the others do not have paintings 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.660
 I do not know why they are not adding them if 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.220
 they are forgetting everyone and still 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.150
 nobody can find the way to 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.010
 put the slat cutter or what is it called 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.070

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.229

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.050
 angry in the main finds all the 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.240
 texture so that it is completely to the 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.580
 the star as good glass the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.380

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.790
 They look the same no change at all the 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.259
 posters look beautiful I do not know why 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.899
 I like this kind of wood and with the 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.910
 posters I love that it will be like that and 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.250
 for the zombies plus skeletons and everything 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.240

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.530

 are still here in the skeletons ai wei 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.560
 because during the skeletons that are 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.540
 here and the pigments that are here inside 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.970
 tucked are still the same not 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.430
 they change in nothing we do not know when they 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.280
 wait for the light of the torches but 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.030

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.340
 there I was wrong in one of 12 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.680
 pnÃ¼ma 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.620

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.890
 air' 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.790
 what is the name of the other is I think it is 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.310
 the glossy I think you 're looking 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.390
 is this that being in ornament is called 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.760
 chords this is the right thing and what is the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.569
 straight the different types of berries that 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.739
 there are and the iron bars there is no beach 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.980
 Well, we find all the minerals 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.470
 removable from iron gold coal 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.750
 diamond lapis lazuli and their respective 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.290
 dynamite blocks the stairs 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.510
 everything that is as to after 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.489
 snow nothing but the last block I think 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.859
 that has a bug because this is ice 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.430
 it does not look good and the difference all 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:28.700
 types of stone that there is and here it is 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.319
 the quartz the second is the quartz 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.169
 Four different types of wood fan 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.329
 their respective in kraft things and here 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:37.550
 is in the last that is the sand and 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.780
 mnr things 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:44.270
 obsidian and gravel and other material 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.890
 I do not know what it is but good as 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.580
 come in mode 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.990
 what is with graphics more to the maximum with 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.930
 fans and severin 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.170
 these are the trees the grass the 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.600
 little tree dry the bushes 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.570
 these bushes this is the first step 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:08.430
 that is right here this is the tree 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:10.590
 black the white and the egg so then the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.720
 train tracks that all all all 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.540
 are modified some say that 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.700
 because they do not have to because they do not change the 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.170
 texture of fire and water as it is not 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.420
 more is the hardest thing I think of 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.950
 change here and that's why almost na 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.630
 and it also changes it because that's how it looks 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.010
 I do not know I've never asked to change the 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.080
 texture of fire and water for me 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.000
 they have always grown well they are going 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.980
 acids for me I always like 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.170
 Well, as I say in the general snot 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.480
 Well, it does not change anything 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.150
 here we are in good this place that I 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.910
 I put him as he is a tester of 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.920
 explosives good and so I put him because 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.910
 well here we can exploit people and 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.580
 watch 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.910
 respective effects without without damaging the 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.730
 magma no 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.260
 and good as you will see the cnt has no 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.630
 no book at the time of exploitation or 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.240
 nothing of it and so good this package 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.980
 texture the only thing that would be missing would be 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.530
 add the boxes and what is the 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.840
 survival mode let's play in asia 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.000
 in block 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.810
 in survival mode what is this 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.490
 it would be more than anything that the cobos good 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.720
 chests looks good problem 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.360
 all the textures that we are uploading 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.100
 is that none that modifies 100% 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.750
 minecraft only modifies the game on 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.790
 environment itself but I think so too 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.650
 had us decide if they like it because it is 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.300
