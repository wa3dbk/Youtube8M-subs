00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
leaf trim on the ground here what's

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.429 
leaf trim on the ground here what's
going<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.359> today<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.869> greenhouse<00:00:22.260> well

going on today in the greenhouse well

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.870 
going on today in the greenhouse well
what<00:00:22.590> we<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:22.920> we<00:00:23.250> leave<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
them on the greenhouse floor so those

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.200 
them on the greenhouse floor so those
good<00:00:33.750> bugs<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.260> travel<00:00:34.530> up<00:00:34.800> into<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.730> plant

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
good bugs can travel up into the plant

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.680 
good bugs can travel up into the plant
canopy<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.960> kill<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.410> bad<00:00:37.680> guys<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:39.540> we

good<00:00:43.680> bugs<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.160> kill<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.910> bad<00:00:45.059> bugs<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.510> here

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
good bugs to kill the bad bugs in here

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.350 
good bugs to kill the bad bugs in here
we<00:00:46.170> try<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.440> stay<00:00:46.739> away<00:00:46.920> as<00:00:47.129> from<00:00:47.789> chemicals<00:00:48.300> as

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
we try to stay away as from chemicals as

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.459 
we try to stay away as from chemicals as
much<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:48.690> possible<00:00:50.360> I'm<00:00:51.360> shooting<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:52.199> zero

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
much as possible I'm shooting for zero

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.619 
much as possible I'm shooting for zero
chemicals<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.100> year<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.910> actually<00:00:54.420> kill<00:00:54.600> any

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
chemicals this year to actually kill any

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.240 
chemicals this year to actually kill any
bugs<00:00:54.960> that's<00:00:55.770> outstanding<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> when<00:00:59.100> you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
bugs that's outstanding and so when you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.369 
bugs that's outstanding and so when you
cut<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.609> back<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.090> exposes<00:01:00.570> all<00:01:00.899> these<00:01:01.079> vines

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
cut that back it exposes all these vines

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.500 
cut that back it exposes all these vines
but<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:02.039> happens<00:01:02.399> well<00:01:02.760> that's<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
but then what happens well that's so the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.020 
but then what happens well that's so the
consumer<00:01:03.960> gets<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.260> nice<00:01:04.409> red<00:01:04.739> wine<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.640> pushes

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
consumer gets a nice red wine it pushes

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.730 
consumer gets a nice red wine it pushes
all<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.299> energy<00:01:06.540> towards<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> top<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
all the energy towards the top of the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.390 
all the energy towards the top of the
plant<00:01:08.060> so<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.530> gives<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.950> Sun<00:01:11.220> that

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
plant so that it gives the Sun that

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340 
plant so that it gives the Sun that
can't<00:01:11.670> chance<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.420> ripen<00:01:12.600> all<00:01:12.869> these<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
can't chance to ripen all these and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.679 
can't chance to ripen all these and
makes<00:01:13.500> them<00:01:13.680> grow<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> lot<00:01:14.250> bigger<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.420> see

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
makes them grow a lot bigger and I see

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.499 
makes them grow a lot bigger and I see
some<00:01:15.960> hooks<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.340> actually<00:01:18.030> hanging<00:01:18.240> on

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
some hooks that are actually hanging on

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.999 
some hooks that are actually hanging on
this<00:01:18.720> string<00:01:19.080> here<00:01:19.290> what's<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.830> there

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
this string here what's going on there

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.620 
this string here what's going on there
if<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.280> don't<00:01:20.400> put<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> hooks<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.119> there<00:01:21.420> your

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
if you don't put the hooks on there your

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.070 
if you don't put the hooks on there your
tomato<00:01:22.500> size<00:01:22.770> will<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.070> about<00:01:23.280> 30%<00:01:23.670> less<00:01:24.180> so

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
tomato size will be about 30% less so

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.570 
tomato size will be about 30% less so
you're<00:01:25.200> gonna<00:01:25.290> get<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> 30%<00:01:25.830> increase<00:01:26.159> in

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
you're gonna get a 30% increase in

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.550 
you're gonna get a 30% increase in
production<00:01:26.939> by<00:01:27.180> putting<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.540> hook<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.930> what

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
production by putting that hook on what

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.170 
production by putting that hook on what
happens<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.159> don't<00:01:29.400> put<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> hook<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:29.939> it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
happens if you don't put the hook on it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.420 
happens if you don't put the hook on it
the<00:01:30.630> stem<00:01:31.350> will<00:01:31.500> Bend<00:01:31.770> right<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the stem will Bend right here and it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.880 
the stem will Bend right here and it
won't<00:01:32.520> allow<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.880> nutrients<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.470> pass<00:01:34.650> in

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
won't allow the nutrients to to pass in

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.140 
won't allow the nutrients to to pass in
there<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.189> make<00:01:35.310> those<00:01:35.460> tomatoes<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
there and make those tomatoes in the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.140 
there and make those tomatoes in the
nice<00:01:36.329> big<00:01:36.540> size<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.400> how<00:01:38.400> are<00:01:38.549> these<00:01:38.640> plants

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
nice big size and how are these plants

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.120 
nice big size and how are these plants
being<00:01:39.390> fed<00:01:39.780> what<00:01:40.320> are<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:40.500> looking<00:01:40.770> at<00:01:40.860> here

what happens here is it's getting
watered<00:01:58.950> through<00:01:59.189> these<00:01:59.340> little<00:01:59.610> tubes<00:02:00.049> it'll

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
watered through these little tubes it'll

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.840 
watered through these little tubes it'll
go<00:02:01.229> into<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.969> this<00:02:02.969> rock<00:02:03.540> wall<00:02:03.719> here<00:02:04.520> all<00:02:05.520> the

go into this this rock wall here all the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.550 
go into this this rock wall here all the
nutrients<00:02:06.270> are<00:02:06.360> taken<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.750> by<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.960> plant<00:02:07.290> any

leftover<00:02:08.190> water<00:02:08.340> will<00:02:08.729> go<00:02:08.879> into<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.239> trough

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
leftover water will go into this trough

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.280 
leftover water will go into this trough
over<00:02:09.899> here<00:02:10.140> yeah

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:21.219 
ozone gets recycled and goes right back

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.280 
ozone gets recycled and goes right back
into<00:02:21.640> this<00:02:21.760> part<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:22.329> off<00:02:22.569> this<00:02:23.049> bag
