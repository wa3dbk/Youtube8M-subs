something similar the important thing is
i<00:04:36.920> think<00:04:37.840> to<00:04:38.840> work<00:04:39.020> out<00:04:39.320> that<00:04:39.920> first<00:04:40.190> opening

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
i think to work out that first opening

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.540 
i think to work out that first opening
gambit<00:04:41.510> isn't<00:04:41.870> it<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.320> strewn<00:04:42.920> around<00:04:43.070> able

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
gambit isn't it and strewn around able

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.070 
gambit isn't it and strewn around able
to<00:04:43.640> do<00:04:43.820> that<00:04:44.090> and<00:04:44.390> then<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:46.010> flow<00:04:46.250> on<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:47.080> so

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
to do that and then to flow on and so

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.630 
to do that and then to flow on and so
that's<00:04:48.560> something<00:04:48.980> i<00:04:49.190> want<00:04:49.370> you<00:04:49.430> to<00:04:49.520> think

bit of confidence there but importantly
I<00:05:25.190> think<00:05:25.280> we<00:05:25.580> need<00:05:25.760> to<00:05:26.180> relax<00:05:26.420> a<00:05:26.660> bit<00:05:26.780> don't<00:05:27.020> we

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:27.569 
I think we need to relax a bit don't we

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:28.850 
I think we need to relax a bit don't we
and<00:05:27.749> there<00:05:28.110> are<00:05:28.229> some<00:05:28.439> very<00:05:28.469> simple

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
and there are some very simple

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.249 
and there are some very simple
relaxation<00:05:29.520> exercises<00:05:30.449> that<00:05:30.779> I<00:05:30.929> can<00:05:31.080> teach

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
relaxation exercises that I can teach

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:35.450 
relaxation exercises that I can teach
you<00:05:31.819> and<00:05:32.819> that<00:05:33.779> I'd<00:05:34.469> like<00:05:34.710> you<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:34.979> go<00:05:35.129> away<00:05:35.309> and

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
you and that I'd like you to go away and

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.959 
you and that I'd like you to go away and
practice<00:05:36.300> so<00:05:37.050> that<00:05:37.080> horrid<00:05:37.649> by<00:05:38.429> next<00:05:38.759> week

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:38.969 
practice so that horrid by next week

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.839 
practice so that horrid by next week
when<00:05:39.360> you<00:05:39.479> come<00:05:39.889> you'll<00:05:40.889> practice<00:05:41.669> those

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
when you come you'll practice those

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.329 
when you come you'll practice those
relaxation<00:05:42.419> exercises<00:05:43.289> because<00:05:43.919> I<00:05:44.159> have

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:44.339 
relaxation exercises because I have

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:45.889 
relaxation exercises because I have
things<00:05:44.580> that<00:05:44.699> you<00:05:44.849> can<00:05:44.969> use<00:05:45.059> any<00:05:45.240> way<00:05:45.419> in<00:05:45.629> your

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:45.899 
things that you can use any way in your

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:48.049 
things that you can use any way in your
situation<00:05:46.110> high<00:05:46.649> kick<00:05:47.069> and<00:05:47.550> what<00:05:47.789> are<00:05:47.909> they

00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:48.059 
situation high kick and what are they

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:50.419 
situation high kick and what are they
like<00:05:48.270> a<00:05:48.330> sophomore<00:05:48.899> football<00:05:49.619> I'll<00:05:50.129> tell<00:05:50.399> you

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:50.429 
like a sophomore football I'll tell you

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:51.829 
like a sophomore football I'll tell you
what<00:05:50.610> they<00:05:50.759> are<00:05:50.789> no<00:05:51.209> you<00:05:51.270> don't<00:05:51.509> have<00:05:51.599> to<00:05:51.749> lie

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:51.839 
what they are no you don't have to lie

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:54.049 
what they are no you don't have to lie
on<00:05:51.990> the<00:05:52.080> floor<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:52.800> not<00:05:53.459> for<00:05:53.639> these<00:05:53.759> because

00:05:54.049 --> 00:05:54.059 
on the floor and not for these because

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:55.339 
on the floor and not for these because
that's<00:05:54.209> not<00:05:54.300> very<00:05:54.389> practical<00:05:54.629> to<00:05:55.020> have<00:05:55.139> for

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
that's not very practical to have for

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:59.989 
that's not very practical to have for
you<00:05:55.409> go<00:05:55.559> Sam<00:05:56.009> so<00:05:56.309> we've<00:05:56.459> got<00:05:56.639> enough<00:05:57.860> so<00:05:58.969> what<00:05:59.969> I

00:05:59.989 --> 00:05:59.999 
you go Sam so we've got enough so what I

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:02.359 
you go Sam so we've got enough so what I
suggest<00:06:00.149> is<00:06:00.839> we<00:06:01.110> look<00:06:01.529> at<00:06:01.649> you<00:06:01.770> coming<00:06:02.039> back<00:06:02.159> in

00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:02.369 
suggest is we look at you coming back in

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:05.929 
suggest is we look at you coming back in
two<00:06:02.459> weeks<00:06:02.610> time<00:06:02.789> and<00:06:04.249> your<00:06:05.249> practice<00:06:05.789> the

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:05.939 
two weeks time and your practice the

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:07.939 
two weeks time and your practice the
relaxation<00:06:06.389> exercises<00:06:07.080> will<00:06:07.469> go<00:06:07.649> through

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
relaxation exercises will go through

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:10.939 
relaxation exercises will go through
them<00:06:08.159> again<00:06:08.759> and<00:06:09.270> we<00:06:10.139> perhaps<00:06:10.379> to<00:06:10.680> another

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
them again and we perhaps to another

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.040 
them again and we perhaps to another
role<00:06:11.189> play<00:06:11.520> and<00:06:11.819> then<00:06:12.059> maybe<00:06:12.300> we<00:06:12.749> might<00:06:12.899> be

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
role play and then maybe we might be

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.540 
role play and then maybe we might be
ready<00:06:13.169> to<00:06:13.349> go<00:06:13.559> and<00:06:13.680> do<00:06:13.800> it<00:06:13.889> for<00:06:14.039> you<00:06:14.189> what<00:06:14.459> do
