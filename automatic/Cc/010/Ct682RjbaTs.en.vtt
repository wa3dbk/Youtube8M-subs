00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
I was I had to go through installing

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.730 
I was I had to go through installing
this<00:00:16.710> crown<00:00:16.949> molding<00:00:17.449> myself<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.750> as<00:00:19.109> you

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
this crown molding myself is as you

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.640 
this crown molding myself is as you
could<00:00:19.890> see<00:00:20.220> right<00:00:20.670> up<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:20.880> there<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.050> very

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
could see right up here there is very

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.150 
could see right up here there is very
little<00:00:23.430> area<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:24.300> enough<00:00:25.080> probably<00:00:25.920> about<00:00:26.099> a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
little area it's enough probably about a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.830 
little area it's enough probably about a
quarter<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.760> an<00:00:26.880> inch<00:00:27.090> um<00:00:28.789> for<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:30.359> me<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.599> nail

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
quarter of an inch um for for me to nail

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.000 
quarter of an inch um for for me to nail
the<00:00:31.080> crown<00:00:31.320> molding<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:33.079> I<00:00:34.079> would<00:00:34.860> have

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
the crown molding to it and I would have

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.910 
the crown molding to it and I would have
to<00:00:35.430> shove<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.390> down<00:00:36.420> really<00:00:36.989> close<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.770> it

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
to shove it down really close and it

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.650 
to shove it down really close and it
would<00:00:38.010> look<00:00:38.370> as<00:00:38.610> neat<00:00:38.879> as<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.300> looks<00:00:39.510> right

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
would look as neat as it looks right

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.680 
would look as neat as it looks right
here<00:00:39.840> as<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.050> see<00:00:40.200> there's<00:00:41.360> space<00:00:42.360> in

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
here as you can see there's space in

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.299 
here as you can see there's space in
between<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:46.170> cabinet<00:00:46.559> door<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.070> crown

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
between the cabinet door and the crown

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.240 
between the cabinet door and the crown
molding<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:48.030> looks<00:00:48.410> much<00:00:49.410> nicer<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:50.039> this

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
molding it looks much nicer like this

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.910 
molding it looks much nicer like this
then<00:00:50.610> if<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.910> had<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:52.289> example<00:00:52.350> will

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
then if I had to do it for example will

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.470 
then if I had to do it for example will
can<00:00:53.100> running<00:00:53.780> this<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:55.969> it<00:00:56.969> depends<00:00:57.390> on

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
can running this on it depends on

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.729 
can running this on it depends on
whatever<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.960> want<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.289> think<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.710> looks

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
whatever you want but I think it looks

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.069 
whatever you want but I think it looks
nicer<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.670> there's<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.940> space<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.660> mean<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.930> me

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
nicer if there's a space I mean to me

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.369 
nicer if there's a space I mean to me
depends<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.800> what<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.100> want<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> do<00:01:02.520> but

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
depends on what you want to do but

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.380 
depends on what you want to do but
whichever<00:01:04.379> uh<00:01:05.540> process<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:07.500> want<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.770> go<00:01:07.950> with

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
whichever uh process you want to go with

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.480 
whichever uh process you want to go with
I<00:01:10.070> found<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.250> easier<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.939> much<00:01:12.119> more<00:01:13.490> durable

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
I found it easier and much more durable

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.210 
I found it easier and much more durable
if<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.689> get<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.140> piece<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.740> wood<00:01:16.890> like

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
if you get like a piece of wood like

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.080 
if you get like a piece of wood like
this<00:01:17.610> one<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:19.130> put<00:01:20.130> some<00:01:20.310> glue<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
this one and put some glue on it and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.370 
this one and put some glue on it and
nail<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.610> cabinet<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.909> way<00:01:24.090> when<00:01:24.450> you

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
nail it to the cabinet this way when you

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.010 
nail it to the cabinet this way when you
put<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.650> crown<00:01:25.860> molding<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.689> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
put the crown molding on you have a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.890 
put the crown molding on you have a
great<00:01:28.920> area<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.520> nail<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.750> wouldn't

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
great area to nail it to and it wouldn't

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.390 
great area to nail it to and it wouldn't
be<00:01:31.430> loose<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.909> will<00:01:33.329> actually<00:01:33.450> be<00:01:33.900> solid<00:01:34.829> ah

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.730 

just<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.520> quick<00:01:38.790> tip<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:40.110> know<00:01:40.290> there's<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.590> lot

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
just a quick tip if I know there's a lot

molding<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.549> had<00:01:44.759> some<00:01:44.939> trouble<00:01:45.299> with<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.630> when

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
molding I had some trouble with it when

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.960 
molding I had some trouble with it when
I<00:01:45.810> first<00:01:46.049> started<00:01:46.439> doing<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.829> because<00:01:47.040> I've

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
I first started doing it because I've

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.710 
I first started doing it because I've
never<00:01:48.149> done<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.600> before<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:50.240> just<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.390> really

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
never done it before but just a really

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.530 
never done it before but just a really
quick<00:01:52.439> lesson<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:54.840> make<00:01:55.020> your<00:01:55.170> cuts<00:01:56.540> measure

quick lesson to make your cuts measure

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.990 
quick lesson to make your cuts measure
the<00:01:58.290> distance<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.950> want<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.689> then<00:02:02.000> grab

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the distance that you want and then grab

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.109 
the distance that you want and then grab
your<00:02:03.030> crown<00:02:03.390> molding<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.290> then<00:02:05.280> mark<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.820> it

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
your crown molding and then mark on it

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.139 
your crown molding and then mark on it
for<00:02:06.600> example<00:02:06.689> let's<00:02:07.350> take<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.740> one<00:02:07.819> mark<00:02:08.819> for

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
for example let's take this one mark for

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.200 
for example let's take this one mark for
this<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.349> will<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.770> wall<00:02:10.950> right<00:02:11.160> here

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
this is this will be the wall right here

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.800 
this is this will be the wall right here
and<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:13.170> will<00:02:13.380> be<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.650> edge<00:02:13.820> so<00:02:14.820> since<00:02:15.690> I'm

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
and this will be the edge so since I'm

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.350 
and this will be the edge so since I'm
going<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:15.990> make<00:02:16.170> an<00:02:16.350> outside<00:02:17.130> corner<00:02:17.610> meaning

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
going to make an outside corner meaning

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.210 
going to make an outside corner meaning
that's<00:02:18.450> going<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.690> be<00:02:18.840> coming<00:02:19.590> out<00:02:19.710> like<00:02:19.980> this

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
that's going to be coming out like this

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.940 
that's going to be coming out like this
one's<00:02:20.460> going<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.700> be<00:02:20.820> coming<00:02:21.150> out<00:02:21.240> like<00:02:21.420> this

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
one's going to be coming out like this

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.790 
one's going to be coming out like this
the<00:02:22.950> top<00:02:23.250> edge<00:02:23.520> is<00:02:24.000> going<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.450> be<00:02:24.630> pointing<00:02:25.110> all

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
the top edge is going to be pointing all

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.280 
the top edge is going to be pointing all
the<00:02:26.010> way<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.370> outside<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.960> bottom

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
the way to the outside and the bottom

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.270 
the way to the outside and the bottom
part<00:02:28.500> should<00:02:28.830> be<00:02:28.860> closer<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.170> inside<00:02:31.280> so

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280
