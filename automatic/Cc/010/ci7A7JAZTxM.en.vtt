00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:05.860
 Hello dear he drove only say we come today to a request and indeed 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.469
 from May Andy or an individually still sincere 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:14.680
 and he suggested that we should also look at the caps 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.369
 We will do that now too 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.529
 Sport is already a little longer in autumn still available 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:26.289
 and just to his since 25 February is a universal app costs 79 cents 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.109
 It builds first and facebook news 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.729
 especially full 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:35.480
 but what could later be annoying, we'll show you my one now 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.640
 the scientist is big there we have to load under 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.920
 and 1 screens at the beginning you never get such a little info that nothing 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.500
 activated we are supposed to go into the setting 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.560
 just by clicking on it 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.860
 and the settings mean that 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.050
 did not stop too much we can add our streams here 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.110
 Twitter Facebook or Google invites again 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.080
 There is nothing more interesting than a professional with a factor of 50 000 users took pass 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.080
 from one then that is already created 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.210
 existing team are the ones shown above which are activated with one click and 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.160
 can be disabled 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.130
 and Sierre 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.500
 here's the attitude to hitherto 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500
 you can choose between different layouts 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.440
 that of course grandma her son 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.440
 red background would like or something made of wood 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.190
 there are masses of paper here and maybe something for the girls 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.000
 and here 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.500
 is the homeland of the Bernauer in the standard 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.210
 yet 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.050
 in the mode can also choose either everything repeats itself so 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.370
 looks about to see it repeating from front to back 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.109
 either we only leave the 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.109
 see latest news or just look by chance 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.350
 we stay in rooms showed 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.720
 the Dispatch 1 1 but quite rightly there but a constant no 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.650
 plays or a facebook entry 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.730
 Denner completely loaded is to be displayed 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.750
 about five seconds already a few times hunch you do not have the one 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.030
 Message and I read and there it is quite why you should 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.419
 at least ten seconds 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.289
 and if you can see that 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.449
 Herolz game 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.939
 you should either 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.969
 on normal Oslo leave if you almost valuation you are only on the se 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.909
 The animations can be done that way 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.159
 but left smartphones we can still say that here 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.069
 because so the news 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.510
 are of course written by other people if you give them the name 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.880
 Ads in the name and picture or nothing we just want to do one man 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.139
 with it here 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.389
 privacy is guaranteed and no antenna sees its name 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:43.699
 we just activate it now 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:47.069
 driven in Twitter com of App 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.069
 the chance of what happened 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.329
 either way 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.459
 a new message 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.989
 By whom Zermatt are not all come with Twitter actually too 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.099
 leave name and picture here 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.169
 Fitness Ballack and there it has to pay 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:16.359
 Years are waiting for the 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.359
 now on the next entry 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.659
 who comes now 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.279
 there also have the name 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.279
 and thank you especially small world 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:40.869
 I can not even say that Jaron YouGov can get past approaches that old 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.859
 However, you can leave the ads and click on it 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.230
 then you will at least 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.859
 Rosa forwarded Gunther Witte opened 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.010
 of course it is now available with Intel connection 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:57.579
 and Stern anyway is not always 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.839
 Bisping several years year one 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.219
 New message from today 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:05.669
 should not agree at the beginning 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.169
 I do not want to do Rommel's old one, we can do it manually 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:10.799
 to press 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.319
 we can just Kurtz 10 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.099
 the 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.810
 we reject it 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.030
 because now i switch to the facebook account sometimes has driven out and 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.460
 switch Facebook 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.789
 Worms 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.789
 now it has to be you also have that Facebook 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:35.669
 for years 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.669
 okay, someone has uploaded a picture 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:54.059
 you see a long message we have a long time 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.280
 and yet it was, I do not know exactly, Conze was possible 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.469
 in some no bad manners it a bit different 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.370
 Valbert again briefly 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:18.439
 For example, here you can see a good overview so it is displayed 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.099
 Nina Richels was 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.169
 I know exactly, also unimportant 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.319
 so the parliament is not just the presentation of the news and then 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.020
 Of course that's just a matter of taste I personally think it's a lot more 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.050
 able to run with me dear 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.280
 the matching Facebook app for the iPhone shop and therefore one 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:41.839
 because pin board and the stream pursue their full views instead 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.389
 my thanks to Mr Maschmeyer you when printing but more it is not in there 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.759
 So I would suggest you save over the 79 cents and access the 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.669
 CeBIT is the Thunder Facebooker back this tip for the free there 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.520
 you do not need 9 70 cents 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.919
 build now builds 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.159
 to get only such great views you because the settings 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.789
 Not too much either, you can not get groups of lehman-crash easy 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.059
 everything against claps what you want to have 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:09.469
 so they prefer it 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:10.559
 keep your hands off it
