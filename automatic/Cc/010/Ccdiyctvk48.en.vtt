hoses<00:04:26.700> on<00:04:26.820> each<00:04:27.000> side

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
hoses on each side

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.450 
hoses on each side
and<00:04:28.050> there's<00:04:28.290> more<00:04:28.500> missiles<00:04:28.980> on<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.220> top

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
and there's more missiles on the top

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.520 
and there's more missiles on the top
here<00:04:29.730> prior<00:04:30.330> I'll<00:04:30.630> just<00:04:30.780> gonna<00:04:30.990> do<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.290> press

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
here prior I'll just gonna do it press

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.330 
here prior I'll just gonna do it press
the<00:04:31.710> back<00:04:31.860> of<00:04:32.100> each<00:04:32.310> missile<00:04:33.950> these<00:04:34.950> are<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.160> lot

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
the back of each missile these are a lot

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.250 
the back of each missile these are a lot
stronger<00:04:35.670> and<00:04:35.940> faster<00:04:36.180> than<00:04:36.510> flick<00:04:36.990> fire

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
missiles and then a little area on the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.030 
missiles and then a little area on the
top<00:04:39.630> where<00:04:40.260> you<00:04:40.410> could<00:04:40.590> put<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:41.040> spoke<00:04:41.430> Kitty

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.930 
panel for her
another<00:04:46.710> cool<00:04:46.980> thing<00:04:47.040> about<00:04:47.190> this<00:04:47.610> is<00:04:47.850> that

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
another cool thing about this is that

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.790 
another cool thing about this is that
this<00:04:48.270> area<00:04:48.600> is<00:04:48.810> also<00:04:49.320> a<00:04:49.350> hatch<00:04:51.350> once<00:04:52.350> you<00:04:52.500> open

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
this area is also a hatch once you open

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.250 
this area is also a hatch once you open
it<00:04:52.860> up<00:04:53.040> reveals<00:04:53.760> another<00:04:53.940> control<00:04:54.780> centers

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
it up reveals another control centers

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.740 
it up reveals another control centers
there's<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.890> couple<00:04:56.100> seats<00:04:56.490> here<00:04:56.910> there's<00:04:57.630> a

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
there's a couple seats here there's a

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.140 
there's a couple seats here there's a
couple<00:04:57.990> computer<00:04:58.560> monitors<00:04:59.100> there's<00:04:59.760> also<00:04:59.970> a

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
couple computer monitors there's also a

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.200 
couple computer monitors there's also a
reactor<00:05:00.870> floor<00:05:01.290> with<00:05:01.890> a<00:05:01.920> thermostat<00:05:02.730> you<00:05:03.030> can

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
reactor floor with a thermostat you can

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.570 
reactor floor with a thermostat you can
also<00:05:03.480> monitor<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.110> temperature<00:05:04.950> right<00:05:05.550> here

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
also monitor the temperature right here

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.300 
also monitor the temperature right here
on<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:06.000> back<00:05:06.120> pan<00:05:06.419> warm<00:05:06.750> engine<00:05:07.260> this<00:05:08.040> thing

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
on the back pan warm engine this thing

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.760 
on the back pan warm engine this thing
comes<00:05:08.550> up<00:05:08.850> to<00:05:09.180> reveal<00:05:09.450> satellite<00:05:10.200> dish<00:05:10.530> and

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
comes up to reveal satellite dish and

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.159 
comes up to reveal satellite dish and
inside<00:05:11.700> we<00:05:11.910> see<00:05:11.940> more<00:05:12.300> of<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.570> mechanics

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
inside we see more of the mechanics

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.860 
inside we see more of the mechanics
there's<00:05:13.890> actually<00:05:14.250> two<00:05:14.520> little<00:05:14.850> droids<00:05:15.240> and

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
there's actually two little droids and

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.650 
there's actually two little droids and
you<00:05:16.140> can<00:05:16.290> take<00:05:16.500> them<00:05:16.650> out<00:05:16.800> like<00:05:17.280> this<00:05:17.730> one<00:05:18.540> is

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
you can take them out like this one is

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.290 
you can take them out like this one is
yellow<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:19.140> one<00:05:19.410> is<00:05:19.560> red<00:05:19.890> there's<00:05:20.790> also<00:05:20.970> some

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
yellow and one is red there's also some

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.450 
yellow and one is red there's also some
red<00:05:21.540> light<00:05:21.810> to<00:05:22.020> your<00:05:22.140> pieces<00:05:22.470> in<00:05:22.830> there<00:05:23.040> and<00:05:23.310> I

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
red light to your pieces in there and I

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.159 
red light to your pieces in there and I
guess<00:05:23.669> that's<00:05:23.820> kind<00:05:24.090> of<00:05:24.120> like<00:05:24.270> an<00:05:24.419> energy<00:05:24.930> bar

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
guess that's kind of like an energy bar

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.320 
guess that's kind of like an energy bar
so<00:05:25.860> you<00:05:25.980> just<00:05:26.160> put<00:05:26.340> the<00:05:26.430> droids<00:05:26.700> back<00:05:26.940> in<00:05:27.120> lay

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
so you just put the droids back in lay

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.230 
so you just put the droids back in lay
this<00:05:27.620> clothes<00:05:28.620> on<00:05:28.800> top<00:05:29.160> there's<00:05:29.760> also<00:05:29.970> some

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
this clothes on top there's also some

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.630
