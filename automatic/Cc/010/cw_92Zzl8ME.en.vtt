00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.160

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:16.220
 episode very cool to rt the oil 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.890
 back of the pack how cool 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:25.140
 when all the history here 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.110
 of the wolf and even counting on the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.060
 his appearance in Superman's drawing and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.950
 after the drawing of the league of justice which 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.960
 I just talked to you, look what 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.180
 The way he gave a hoot ripped the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.500
 back of the house where the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:48.090
 characters 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:51.350
 that's it we 'll open because I'm not 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.350
 american guard 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.160
 is the globe finally out of the pack 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.310
 look at the picture closely and it is 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.290
 much the same that appeared in the drawings is 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:24.750
 very cool the episodes that he 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:28.209
 appears the brute is way too much 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.610
 really a really cool figure in the 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.380
 Justice League Collection 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.799
 just so you have an idea of ​​the size 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.810
 of course he does not measure the 4 75 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.360
 inches of freedom collection o 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:45.870
 chivas is a little bigger 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.950
 I would say it does average the 55 inch 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.400
 bye, right? 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.319
 But you see here we put a 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.810
 superman and his side 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:07.480
 You'll see here, this lets you stay 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:10.390
 little face near the globe 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.130
 a figure of size we take another 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:18.630
 and arcsight figure by 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.630
 example and we see the comparison is not 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.030
 a really cool figure 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.950
 so if you have the opportunity you 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.690
 has the Justice League Collection if it has 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.560
 the opportunity to get a globe of 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.500
 if it's really worth a lot of stone, it 's because it's 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.440
 a fantastic figure 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.380
 So you have an idea of ​​his size. 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:49.690
 compared to superman compared to 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:51.400
 dark side a personal opinion, I guess 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.190
 that for being a launch of san diego 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.299
 comic con he could have come with more 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.799
 things for example his bike is both the 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.379
 in the episode of super well as the 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.490
 episode of the Justice League he arrives 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.820
 bike with this 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.040
 photo of him flying there then to a 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.780
 san diego comic with me release 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.980
 I found it a little weak. 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.959
 It's the crowd at the time of the 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:23.080
 Justice League always looked forward to 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:25.900
 the special dolls and the 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.880
 wolf was a character so generated 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.270
 enough expectation but could have 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:36.580
 It has been launched with accessory right on the bike 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:39.930
 with for example a weapon he uses it 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.930
 could have come with her 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:49.360
 and here just to show you here he 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:53.950
 I came in this little box here, wolf and 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.700
 White and the pack to him was there 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.750

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.700
