00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
tokens

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.419 
tokens
I<00:02:03.840> think<00:02:04.469> coin<00:02:04.679> tokens<00:02:05.100> are<00:02:05.189> one<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
I think coin tokens are one of the

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.459 
I think coin tokens are one of the
coolest<00:02:05.579> things<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.179> Dominion<00:02:06.600> giving<00:02:07.380> you

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
coolest things in Dominion giving you

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.230 
coolest things in Dominion giving you
coins<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.190> use<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.610> later<00:02:08.819> turns

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
coins that you can use on later turns

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.420 
coins that you can use on later turns
and<00:02:09.600> so<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.440> could<00:02:10.740> have<00:02:10.830> picked<00:02:10.950> maybe<00:02:11.190> any

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
and so I could have picked maybe any

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.800 
and so I could have picked maybe any
number<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.910> cards<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.360> wish<00:02:12.540> there<00:02:12.690> were<00:02:12.780> more

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
number of cards I wish there were more

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.410 
number of cards I wish there were more
cards<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.530> use<00:02:13.680> coin<00:02:13.980> tokens<00:02:14.430> but<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.210> Baker

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420

from<00:02:30.569> play<00:02:30.840> if<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.769> didn't<00:02:32.010> buy<00:02:32.099> a<00:02:32.129> victory

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
from play if you didn't buy a victory

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.399 
from play if you didn't buy a victory
point<00:02:32.760> card<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.150> put<00:02:33.269> on<00:02:33.390> top<00:02:33.629> of<00:02:33.659> your<00:02:33.810> deck

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
point card you put on top of your deck

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.500 
point card you put on top of your deck

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
so if you buy Treasury just keeps coming

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.500 
so if you buy Treasury just keeps coming
it's<00:02:36.750> like<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.870> free<00:02:37.260> action<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:38.430> card<00:02:39.209> and

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.680 
it's like a free action and card and
coin<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:41.129> it<00:02:41.280> basically<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.180> free<00:02:42.390> coin

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690

would have been eight fishing village is
one<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.209> duration<00:03:24.810> cards<00:03:25.109> which<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.409> really

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
one of the duration cards which I really

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.559 
one of the duration cards which I really
enjoy<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.639> is<00:03:26.790> probably<00:03:27.000> my<00:03:27.120> favorite<00:03:27.510> of

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
enjoy this is probably my favorite of

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.210 
enjoy this is probably my favorite of
all<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:27.840> them<00:03:27.989> this<00:03:28.500> one<00:03:28.769> gives<00:03:28.919> you<00:03:29.040> two

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
all of them this one gives you two

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.370 
all of them this one gives you two
actions<00:03:29.609> in<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.819> coin<00:03:30.030> but<00:03:30.630> your<00:03:30.780> next<00:03:31.109> turn

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
actions in a coin but your next turn

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.349 
actions in a coin but your next turn
gives<00:03:31.889> you<00:03:32.010> another<00:03:32.310> action<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:33.000> another

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
gives you another action and another

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.140 
gives you another action and another
coin<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:34.079> better<00:03:34.470> than<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:35.160> village<00:03:35.459> in<00:03:36.030> my

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
coin so better than a village in my

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.300 
coin so better than a village in my
opinion<00:03:36.569> I<00:03:36.750> like<00:03:37.169> it<00:03:37.319> quite<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.500> bit<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.889> it's

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
opinion I like it quite a bit and it's

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.430 
opinion I like it quite a bit and it's
only<00:03:38.459> three<00:03:38.730> coins<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.209> buy<00:03:39.359> also<00:03:40.049> I<00:03:40.200> like<00:03:40.410> the

card<00:05:27.629> definitely<00:05:28.190> a<00:05:29.190> card<00:05:29.849> that's<00:05:30.029> a<00:05:30.150> promo

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
card definitely a card that's a promo

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.719 
card definitely a card that's a promo
card<00:05:30.840> and<00:05:30.990> that's<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.259> black-market<00:05:31.729> the

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
card and that's the black-market the

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.249 
card and that's the black-market the
reason<00:05:33.000> I<00:05:33.060> like<00:05:33.210> the<00:05:33.360> black<00:05:33.569> market<00:05:34.020> so<00:05:34.199> much

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
reason I like the black market so much

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.110 
reason I like the black market so much
is<00:05:34.680> not<00:05:34.889> because<00:05:35.250> of<00:05:35.279> the<00:05:35.400> two<00:05:35.639> that<00:05:35.819> it<00:05:35.969> gives

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
is not because of the two that it gives

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.879 
is not because of the two that it gives
you<00:05:36.300> but<00:05:36.779> it<00:05:36.870> allows<00:05:37.110> you<00:05:37.289> to<00:05:37.379> purchase<00:05:37.590> from

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
you but it allows you to purchase from

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.800 
you but it allows you to purchase from
the<00:05:37.979> black<00:05:38.189> market<00:05:38.490> now<00:05:39.210> you<00:05:39.270> can<00:05:39.479> create<00:05:39.629> a

black market if the other players let me
I<00:05:58.379> think<00:05:58.860> it's<00:05:59.190> really<00:05:59.370> fun<00:05:59.729> I<00:06:00.029> think<00:06:00.060> it's

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
I think it's really fun I think it's

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.140 
I think it's really fun I think it's
entertaining<00:06:00.960> to<00:06:01.710> have<00:06:02.219> a<00:06:02.250> card<00:06:02.610> that<00:06:02.669> no<00:06:03.000> one

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
entertaining to have a card that no one

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.640 
entertaining to have a card that no one
else<00:06:03.330> does<00:06:03.599> it<00:06:03.960> gives<00:06:04.080> your<00:06:04.169> deck<00:06:04.409> just<00:06:04.529> a

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
else does it gives your deck just a

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.839 
else does it gives your deck just a
little<00:06:04.860> bit<00:06:04.949> more<00:06:05.129> character

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:05.849 
little bit more character

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:09.140 
little bit more character

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
so this while 2 through 10 there might

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.490

to<00:06:23.250> seeing<00:06:23.460> the<00:06:23.580> new<00:06:23.699> expansion<00:06:24.120> come<00:06:24.479> out

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:24.629 
to seeing the new expansion come out

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:26.240 
to seeing the new expansion come out
this<00:06:24.810> year<00:06:24.990> especially<00:06:25.110> with<00:06:25.500> more<00:06:25.680> duration

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250

think those are a lot of fun but as it

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:31.339
