00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
balotelli I wouldn't really recommend it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.810 
balotelli I wouldn't really recommend it
because<00:01:45.810> he's<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.500> drop<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.399> much<00:01:47.640> in

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
because he's going to drop so much in

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.030 
because he's going to drop so much in
prize<00:01:48.030> like<00:01:48.240> he<00:01:48.420> really<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.170> there's<00:01:49.829> only

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.639 
prize like he really is and there's only
one<00:01:50.460> player<00:01:50.790> different<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.720> don't<00:01:52.350> think

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
one player different and I don't think

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.410 
one player different and I don't think
he's<00:01:52.829> worth<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.310> coin<00:01:53.549> fell<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.970> leave<00:01:54.180> them<00:01:54.329> in

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.400 
strikers in this full measure because it
gets<00:04:35.310> rid<00:04:35.729> of<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:36.060> fact<00:04:36.810> that<00:04:36.930> it's<00:04:37.080> a<00:04:37.139> very

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
gets rid of the fact that it's a very

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.860 
gets rid of the fact that it's a very
narrow<00:04:37.800> formation<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:38.669> usually<00:04:39.150> all<00:04:39.449> you

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
narrow formation and usually all you

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.260 
narrow formation and usually all you
would<00:04:39.990> do<00:04:40.199> is<00:04:40.410> feed<00:04:40.860> your<00:04:41.100> striker<00:04:41.430> but<00:04:42.120> with

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
would do is feed your striker but with

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.790 
would do is feed your striker but with
having<00:04:42.660> two<00:04:42.840> strikers<00:04:43.229> that<00:04:43.530> central

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
having two strikers that central

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.070 
having two strikers that central
attacking<00:04:43.979> mid<00:04:44.400> it<00:04:45.000> means<00:04:45.270> you<00:04:45.389> don't<00:04:45.660> have<00:04:45.750> to

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
attacking mid it means you don't have to

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.070 
attacking mid it means you don't have to
do<00:04:46.290> that<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:46.740> this<00:04:47.280> formation<00:04:47.699> become<00:04:48.600> so

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
do that and this formation become so

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.740 
do that and this formation become so
deadly<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:49.919> so<00:04:50.520> good<00:04:50.820> because<00:04:51.000> it's<00:04:51.300> not<00:04:51.540> as

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
deadly and so good because it's not as

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.080 
deadly and so good because it's not as
narrow<00:04:52.080> as<00:04:52.199> it's<00:04:52.620> meant<00:04:52.889> to<00:04:53.100> be<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.520> that<00:04:54.000> is

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
narrow as it's meant to be and that is

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.219 
narrow as it's meant to be and that is
one<00:04:54.240> of<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.389> problems<00:04:54.720> that<00:04:54.750> I've<00:04:54.900> found<00:04:55.020> with

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
one of the problems that I've found with

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.140 
one of the problems that I've found with
43<00:04:55.620> 1<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.010> a<00:04:56.040> lot<00:04:56.220> of<00:04:56.250> you<00:04:56.370> guys<00:04:56.400> have<00:04:56.550> said<00:04:56.970> is

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
43 1 and a lot of you guys have said is

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.330 
43 1 and a lot of you guys have said is
too<00:04:57.750> narrow<00:04:57.960> all<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:58.740> can<00:04:58.919> do<00:04:59.100> is

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
too narrow all you can do is

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.370 
too narrow all you can do is
over-the-top<00:04:59.940> through<00:05:00.330> balls<00:05:00.540> together<00:05:00.720> the

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
over-the-top through balls together the

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.140 
over-the-top through balls together the
ball<00:05:01.590> to<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:01.830> striker<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:02.550> to<00:05:02.790> repair<00:05:03.060> that

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
ball to the striker and to repair that

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.940 
ball to the striker and to repair that
it's<00:05:03.300> kind<00:05:03.450> of<00:05:03.479> true<00:05:03.630> that<00:05:03.810> is<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.470> way<00:05:04.680> that

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
it's kind of true that is the way that

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.940 
it's kind of true that is the way that
43<00:05:05.460> one<00:05:05.700> is<00:05:05.880> often<00:05:06.750> played<00:05:07.080> when<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:07.740> only

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
43 one is often played when you only

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.560 
43 one is often played when you only
have<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.280> one<00:05:08.400> striker<00:05:08.700> but<00:05:08.940> by<00:05:09.030> converting

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
have the one striker but by converting

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.900 
have the one striker but by converting
them<00:05:09.660> down<00:05:09.870> into<00:05:10.110> cam<00:05:10.410> it's<00:05:10.710> amazing<00:05:11.520> it's

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
them down into cam it's amazing it's

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.730 
them down into cam it's amazing it's
also<00:05:12.210> cool<00:05:12.690> and<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:13.110> thought<00:05:13.260> I'd<00:05:13.380> brings<00:05:13.560> to

add a little fun squad to use the normal
