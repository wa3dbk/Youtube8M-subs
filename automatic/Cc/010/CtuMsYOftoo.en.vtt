00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
basic maps that I've actually been that

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.350 
basic maps that I've actually been that
have<00:00:52.590> shown<00:00:52.890> up<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:54.149> know<00:00:54.270> the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
sequences you know sequence one sequence

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.590 
sequences you know sequence one sequence
two<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:33.640> forth<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:34.060> don't<00:02:34.210> even<00:02:34.270> know<00:02:34.450> how

two and so forth I don't even know how
many<00:02:34.660> sequences<00:02:35.290> there<00:02:35.470> are<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:35.800> would<00:02:36.160> be

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
many sequences there are I would be

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.560 
many sequences there are I would be
doing<00:02:36.490> those<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.180> then<00:02:37.270> I<00:02:37.360> would<00:02:37.480> be

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
doing those and then I would be

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.100 
doing those and then I would be
spreading<00:02:37.990> it<00:02:38.140> out<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.740> little<00:02:39.220> bit<00:02:39.400> more<00:02:39.580> to

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
spreading it out a little bit more to

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.090 
spreading it out a little bit more to
kind<00:02:41.110> of<00:02:41.200> like<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.500> know<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.740> secret

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
kind of like you know the secret

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.830 
kind of like you know the secret
locations<00:02:42.730> like<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.120> had<00:02:43.300> in<00:02:43.420> Brotherhood

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
locations like you had in Brotherhood

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.590 
locations like you had in Brotherhood
you<00:02:43.990> have<00:02:44.230> those<00:02:44.410> tombs<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.790> then<00:02:46.120> there

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
you have those tombs and then there

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.600 
you have those tombs and then there
would<00:02:46.750> be<00:02:46.780> like<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.290> thief<00:02:47.560> missions<00:02:48.100> and

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
would be like the thief missions and

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.670 
would be like the thief missions and
whatever<00:02:48.940> else<00:02:49.030> missions<00:02:49.660> there<00:02:49.870> would<00:02:50.020> be<00:02:50.050> so

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
whatever else missions there would be so

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.080 
whatever else missions there would be so
it<00:02:50.950> would<00:02:51.040> just<00:02:51.160> all<00:02:51.340> be<00:02:51.459> spread<00:02:51.700> apart<00:02:51.910> like

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
it would just all be spread apart like

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.260 
it would just all be spread apart like
that<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.540> then<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:52.750> obviously<00:02:52.990> have<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:54.270> the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
that and then you obviously have the the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.530 
that and then you obviously have the the
inner<00:02:55.860> intercessions<00:02:56.860> kind<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.370> like<00:02:57.580> in<00:02:57.880> the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
inner intercessions kind of like in the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.000 
inner intercessions kind of like in the
same<00:02:58.750> thing<00:02:58.930> as<00:02:59.050> in<00:02:59.170> Brotherhood<00:02:59.590> where<00:02:59.800> you

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
same thing as in Brotherhood where you

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.550 
same thing as in Brotherhood where you
pretty<00:03:01.000> much<00:03:01.060> played<00:03:01.480> outside<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.050> Animus<00:03:02.410> as

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
pretty much played outside the Animus as

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.190 
pretty much played outside the Animus as
Desmond<00:03:03.040> Miles<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:03.490> I<00:03:03.730> would<00:03:04.300> also<00:03:04.420> have<00:03:04.690> those

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
Desmond Miles so I would also have those

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.780 
Desmond Miles so I would also have those

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
considering a lot of the problems that I

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.009

it's<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:08.920> guess<00:04:09.070> it's<00:04:09.340> a<00:04:09.400> problem<00:04:09.640> that's<00:04:09.760> been

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
it's I guess it's a problem that's been

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.400 
it's I guess it's a problem that's been
prevailing<00:04:10.480> since<00:04:10.720> Brotherhood<00:04:11.140> and<00:04:11.290> I've

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
prevailing since Brotherhood and I've

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.009 
prevailing since Brotherhood and I've
noticed<00:04:11.769> it<00:04:11.920> for<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.760> long<00:04:13.000> time<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.570> and<00:04:13.810> the

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
noticed it for a long time is and the

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.640 
noticed it for a long time is and the
fact<00:04:14.049> is<00:04:14.410> that<00:04:14.440> you<00:04:15.100> pretty<00:04:15.130> much<00:04:15.519> just<00:04:15.670> get

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
fact is that you pretty much just get

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.740 
fact is that you pretty much just get
almost<00:04:17.650> nerfed<00:04:18.070> when<00:04:18.820> you're<00:04:19.060> in<00:04:19.180> first<00:04:19.479> place

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
like i'll be playing first place and I

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.970 
like i'll be playing first place and I
can<00:04:21.549> almost<00:04:21.900> anticipate<00:04:22.900> who<00:04:23.140> is<00:04:23.350> going<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.620> be

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980
