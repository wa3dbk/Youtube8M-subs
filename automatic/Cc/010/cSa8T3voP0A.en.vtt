well<00:00:25.710> I've<00:00:25.980> wondered<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.519> same<00:00:26.550> thing<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
well I've wondered the same thing and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.500 
well I've wondered the same thing and
therefore<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.279> have<00:00:29.519> written<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.970> quick<00:00:30.210> mod

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
therefore I have written a quick mod

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.360 
therefore I have written a quick mod
which<00:00:31.439> adds<00:00:32.120> command<00:00:33.120> blocks<00:00:34.190> to<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
which adds command blocks to the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.049 
which adds command blocks to the
creative<00:00:35.880> inventory<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.190> see<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
creative inventory so you see in the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.709 
creative inventory so you see in the
redstone<00:00:39.450> tab<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.870> now<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.290> command<00:00:41.040> blocks

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
redstone tab we now have command blocks

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:48.910 
redstone tab we now have command blocks
but<00:00:42.719> what<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.079> also<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:45.260> barriers<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
but what we also do have is barriers and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.709 
but what we also do have is barriers and
farmland<00:00:49.940> gift<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.210> well<00:00:53.449> doesn't<00:00:54.449> have

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
farmland gift that as well doesn't have

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.380 
farmland gift that as well doesn't have
a<00:00:54.809> proper<00:00:55.460> texture<00:00:56.460> though<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.940> that's

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
a proper texture though and that's

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.760 
a proper texture though and that's
probably<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.870> reason<00:00:58.020> why<00:00:58.140> merging<00:00:58.559> didn't

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
probably the reason why merging didn't

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.789 
probably the reason why merging didn't
edit<00:00:58.890> and<00:01:00.829> I've<00:01:01.829> also<00:01:02.039> added<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.609> new<00:01:03.390> tab<00:01:03.930> for

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
edit and I've also added a new tab for

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.050 
edit and I've also added a new tab for
something<00:01:05.339> which<00:01:05.519> might<00:01:05.760> seem<00:01:06.030> pretty

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
something which might seem pretty

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.320 
something which might seem pretty
outdated<00:01:06.439> but<00:01:07.439> it's<00:01:08.280> one<00:01:08.490> source<00:01:08.700> bonus<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
outdated but it's one source bonus and

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.750 
outdated but it's one source bonus and

entity but whether they spawn of course

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.870 
entity but whether they spawn of course
depends<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.280> light<00:01:35.490> level<00:01:35.820> etc<00:01:36.240> etc<00:01:36.299> and
