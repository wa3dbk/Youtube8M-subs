00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
lot of lava so that can be tough to get

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.670

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
going to show you a 9 x 9 room that's

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.670 
going to show you a 9 x 9 room that's
only<00:01:23.790> three<00:01:24.210> high<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.450> well<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.530> it's

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
only three high as well here and it's

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.560 
only three high as well here and it's
dealing<00:01:26.100> all<00:01:26.340> my<00:01:26.490> slabs<00:01:26.790> from<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.240> other<00:01:27.360> room

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
dealing all my slabs from the other room

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.080 
dealing all my slabs from the other room
so<00:01:28.380> if<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.650> made<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> slime<00:01:29.250> farm<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.880> your

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
so if you made a slime farm in your

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.609 
so if you made a slime farm in your
world<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.750> had<00:01:30.900> been<00:01:31.049> working<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.590> a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
world and it had been working for a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.219 
world and it had been working for a
while<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:32.040> stopped<00:01:32.369> working<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.689> reason<00:01:34.079> is

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
while but stopped working the reason is

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.039 
while but stopped working the reason is
probably<00:01:34.470> because<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:36.030> made<00:01:36.180> another<00:01:36.509> room

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
probably because you made another room

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.910 
probably because you made another room
that<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:38.310> game<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.900> recognizes<00:01:40.740> as

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
that the game is it recognizes as

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.999 
that the game is it recognizes as
another<00:01:41.220> slam<00:01:41.520> spawner<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.180> i<00:01:43.170> think<00:01:43.770> they

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
another slam spawner and i think they

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.010 
another slam spawner and i think they
developed<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.610> game<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.030> only<00:01:45.210> let<00:01:45.450> people

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
developed the game to only let people

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.440 
developed the game to only let people
out<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:46.500> slime<00:01:46.770> spawner<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:47.820> her<00:01:48.240> world

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
face so another thing is if you want

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.910 
face so another thing is if you want
slots<00:03:30.550> limes<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.360> spot<00:03:31.570> for<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.590> need<00:03:32.739> to

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
slots limes the spot for you you need to

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.650 
slots limes the spot for you you need to
be<00:03:33.070> within<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.520> certain<00:03:33.760> radius<00:03:34.030> but<00:03:34.360> you<00:03:34.450> can't

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
be within a certain radius but you can't

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.290 
be within a certain radius but you can't
be<00:03:34.780> too<00:03:34.989> far<00:03:35.020> either<00:03:35.410> because<00:03:36.310> monsters<00:03:37.090> can't

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
be too far either because monsters can't

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.070 
be too far either because monsters can't
spawn<00:03:37.540> within<00:03:37.870> 25<00:03:39.030> blocks<00:03:40.030> of<00:03:40.390> you<00:03:40.540> but<00:03:40.900> they

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
spawn within 25 blocks of you but they

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.229 
spawn within 25 blocks of you but they
can't<00:03:41.320> spawn<00:03:41.560> with<00:03:41.800> in<00:03:42.010> too<00:03:42.640> many<00:03:42.760> far<00:03:43.090> away

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
can't spawn with in too many far away

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.970 
can't spawn with in too many far away
either<00:03:43.270> because<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.050> monsters<00:03:44.500> don't<00:03:44.709> really

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
either because the monsters don't really

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.820 
either because the monsters don't really
do<00:03:45.100> anything<00:03:45.340> if<00:03:45.640> they're<00:03:45.790> not<00:03:45.910> by<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:47.290> the

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
do anything if they're not by you so the

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.140 
do anything if they're not by you so the
game's<00:03:48.040> only<00:03:48.280> develop<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.820> really<00:03:49.030> have

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
game's only develop to really have

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.680 
game's only develop to really have
monsters<00:03:49.810> nearby<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.310> instead<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.600> far<00:03:52.600> away

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
monsters nearby you instead of far away

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.449 
monsters nearby you instead of far away
so<00:03:52.810> you<00:03:53.050> have<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.290> be<00:03:53.320> fairly<00:03:53.620> close<00:03:53.920> usually<00:03:54.430> I

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
so you have to be fairly close usually I

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.830 
so you have to be fairly close usually I
just<00:03:54.489> hang<00:03:54.820> out<00:03:54.910> at<00:03:55.120> one<00:03:55.270> side<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.780> they

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
just hang out at one side and they

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.420 
just hang out at one side and they
usually<00:03:56.080> spawn<00:03:56.500> in<00:03:56.620> front<00:03:56.800> of<00:03:56.860> my<00:03:56.920> face<00:03:57.100> like

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
usually spawn in front of my face like

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.580 
usually spawn in front of my face like
that<00:03:57.580> one<00:03:57.790> did<00:03:57.970> I'm<00:03:58.570> a<00:03:58.630> couple<00:03:59.020> more<00:03:59.260> are<00:03:59.440> going

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
go make some mushroom soup so that i can

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.750 
go make some mushroom soup so that i can
finish<00:04:04.060> fighting<00:04:04.510> this<00:04:04.630> day<00:04:05.160> yeah<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:06.489> when<00:04:06.730> I

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
finish fighting this day yeah so when I

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.850 
finish fighting this day yeah so when I
made<00:04:07.000> this<00:04:07.150> room<00:04:07.480> I'd<00:04:07.959> been<00:04:08.260> hitting<00:04:08.470> lots<00:04:08.680> of

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
made this room I'd been hitting lots of

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.160 
made this room I'd been hitting lots of
lava<00:04:09.040> so<00:04:09.459> that<00:04:09.640> may<00:04:09.970> be<00:04:10.000> one<00:04:10.360> thing<00:04:10.630> that<00:04:10.930> is

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
lava so that may be one thing that is

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.050 
lava so that may be one thing that is
really<00:04:11.830> hard<00:04:12.130> to<00:04:12.190> get<00:04:12.340> by<00:04:12.519> when<00:04:12.790> you're<00:04:12.880> just

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
really hard to get by when you're just

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.210 
really hard to get by when you're just
digging<00:04:13.300> out<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:14.070> space<00:04:15.070> down<00:04:15.430> here<00:04:15.460> the

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
digging out the space down here the

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.729 
digging out the space down here the
then<00:04:16.370> getting<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.239> when<00:04:18.019> you<00:04:18.110> hit<00:04:18.260> lava<00:04:18.470> it's

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
then getting and when you hit lava it's

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.500 
then getting and when you hit lava it's
really<00:04:18.920> hard<00:04:19.070> to<00:04:19.190> get<00:04:19.310> past<00:04:19.489> and<00:04:19.970> it<00:04:20.239> really

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
really hard to get past and it really

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.430 
really hard to get past and it really
pisses<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.959> off<00:04:21.280> so<00:04:22.280> that's<00:04:22.400> one<00:04:22.640> thing<00:04:22.910> I

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
pisses you off so that's one thing I

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.710 
pisses you off so that's one thing I
this<00:04:24.440> really<00:04:24.770> requires<00:04:25.280> patience<00:04:25.850> but<00:04:26.600> yeah

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
this really requires patience but yeah

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.270 
this really requires patience but yeah
there's<00:04:26.930> not<00:04:27.080> much<00:04:27.260> more<00:04:27.290> to<00:04:27.470> talk<00:04:27.680> about<00:04:27.740> just

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
there's not much more to talk about just

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.620 
there's not much more to talk about just
because<00:04:28.700> basically<00:04:28.880> it's<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.330> giant

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
because basically it's a giant

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.580 
because basically it's a giant
underground<00:04:30.080> room<00:04:30.850> close<00:04:31.850> by<00:04:32.030> bedrock<00:04:32.480> it<00:04:33.470> has

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
underground room close by bedrock it has

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.910 
underground room close by bedrock it has
to<00:04:33.740> be<00:04:33.800> on<00:04:34.660> eight<00:04:35.660> layers<00:04:36.020> from<00:04:36.530> bedrock

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
to be on eight layers from bedrock

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.340 
to be on eight layers from bedrock
bedrock<00:04:37.250> I<00:04:37.820> think<00:04:38.120> it's<00:04:38.270> 16<00:04:38.690> in<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:38.930> computer

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
bedrock I think it's 16 in the computer

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.650 
bedrock I think it's 16 in the computer
version<00:04:39.770> I<00:04:39.950> could<00:04:40.640> be<00:04:40.790> wrong<00:04:40.970> because<00:04:41.240> I'm

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
version I could be wrong because I'm

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.330 
version I could be wrong because I'm
just<00:04:42.080> saying<00:04:42.740> off<00:04:42.920> memory<00:04:43.280> so<00:04:43.790> but<00:04:44.780> um<00:04:45.310> yeah<00:04:46.310> I

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
just saying off memory so but um yeah I

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.080 
just saying off memory so but um yeah I
just<00:04:46.610> make<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.210> a<00:04:47.390> bedrock<00:04:47.750> because<00:04:48.110> it's<00:04:48.350> a

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
just make it a bedrock because it's a

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.790 
just make it a bedrock because it's a
safer<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.420> it<00:04:50.750> will<00:04:50.870> definitely<00:04:51.230> get<00:04:51.500> you<00:04:51.620> the

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
safer and it will definitely get you the

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.760 
safer and it will definitely get you the
slimes<00:04:52.540> so<00:04:53.540> yeah<00:04:53.810> that's<00:04:53.960> basically<00:04:54.140> all<00:04:54.440> I'm

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
slimes so yeah that's basically all I'm

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.500 
slimes so yeah that's basically all I'm
going<00:04:54.890> to<00:04:54.950> talk<00:04:55.130> about<00:04:55.310> if<00:04:55.640> I<00:04:55.760> didn't<00:04:56.090> cover

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
going to talk about if I didn't cover

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.620 
going to talk about if I didn't cover
