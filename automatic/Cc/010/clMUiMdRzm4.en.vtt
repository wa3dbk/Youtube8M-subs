you how to make one just out of a limb

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.330 
you how to make one just out of a limb
that<00:00:59.610> would<00:00:59.820> have<00:00:59.940> fallen<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.540> the<00:01:00.750> tree

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
that would have fallen out of the tree

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:10.580 
that would have fallen out of the tree
nice<00:01:02.340> piece<00:01:02.640> oak<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:06.770> it<00:01:07.770> works<00:01:07.979> good<00:01:09.380> just<00:01:10.380> as

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
know I it up and you know the cross

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.230 
know I it up and you know the cross
parts<00:01:20.010> got<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> little<00:01:20.670> bit<00:01:20.820> smaller

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
parts got to be a little bit smaller

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:57.830 
parts got to be a little bit smaller
than<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:23.159> length<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.540> whole<00:01:24.720> thing

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.910 

this<00:01:58.840> looks<00:01:59.110> like<00:01:59.290> a<00:01:59.350> good<00:01:59.650> cross<00:02:01.320> put<00:02:02.320> it<00:02:02.440> on

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
this looks like a good cross put it on

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.749 
this looks like a good cross put it on
here<00:02:03.790> I'll<00:02:04.780> cut<00:02:05.020> my<00:02:05.200> length<00:02:06.479> probably<00:02:07.479> about

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
here I'll cut my length probably about

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:24.890 
here I'll cut my length probably about
right<00:02:09.759> there

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.929 

that's<00:02:25.900> pretty<00:02:26.200> good<00:02:26.439> right<00:02:26.709> there<00:02:27.459> locked<00:02:27.700> up

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
that's pretty good right there locked up

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.080 
that's pretty good right there locked up
on<00:02:28.569> my<00:02:28.689> next<00:02:28.989> step<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.379> to<00:02:29.560> debark<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.760> then<00:02:30.969> I

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
on my next step is to debark and then I

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.710 
on my next step is to debark and then I
have<00:02:31.359> to<00:02:31.599> sand<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.140> on<00:02:32.500> my<00:02:32.769> sander<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:34.000> make<00:02:34.540> it

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
have to sand it on my sander and make it

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.869 
have to sand it on my sander and make it
around<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.590> make<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.069> kind<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.400> nice<00:02:36.609> and

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
around it make it kind of nice and

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.289 
around it make it kind of nice and
presentable<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.720> then<00:02:38.409> I'll<00:02:39.370> do<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.849> takes

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
presentable and then I'll do that takes

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.210 
presentable and then I'll do that takes
a<00:02:40.420> lot<00:02:40.629> of<00:02:40.659> work<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:41.290> I'll<00:02:41.439> turn<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:41.890> camera

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
a lot of work so I'll turn the camera

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.920 
a lot of work so I'll turn the camera
off<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.370> I'll<00:02:42.670> come<00:02:42.849> back<00:02:43.030> show<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.629> to<00:02:43.780> you

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
off and I'll come back show it to you

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:53.520 
off and I'll come back show it to you
sanded<00:02:44.379> I<00:02:50.700> thought<00:02:51.700> maybe<00:02:51.939> I<00:02:52.120> just<00:02:52.540> show<00:02:53.470> you

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
sanded I thought maybe I just show you

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.559 
sanded I thought maybe I just show you
you<00:02:53.799> know<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:53.950> didn't<00:02:54.400> tell<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.849> I<00:02:54.909> was<00:02:55.030> using

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
you know I didn't tell you I was using

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.879 
you know I didn't tell you I was using
an<00:02:55.780> ax<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:56.409> D<00:02:56.590> bar<00:02:56.829> and<00:02:57.819> I<00:02:58.090> switched<00:02:58.540> logs<00:02:59.439> I

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
an ax to D bar and I switched logs I

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.039 
an ax to D bar and I switched logs I
like<00:03:00.519> this<00:03:00.760> one<00:03:01.000> because<00:03:01.599> it<00:03:01.870> had<00:03:02.019> more

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
like this one because it had more

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.539 
like this one because it had more
character<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.069> it<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.150> like<00:03:04.359> to<00:03:04.599> figure<00:03:05.200> out

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
character to it and I like to figure out

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.110 
character to it and I like to figure out
you<00:03:06.549> know<00:03:06.609> how<00:03:06.939> it's<00:03:07.269> going<00:03:07.569> to<00:03:07.659> sit<00:03:08.470> on<00:03:08.500> wall

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
you know how it's going to sit on wall

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.220 
you know how it's going to sit on wall
and<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.269> kind<00:03:10.659> of<00:03:10.750> use<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:11.739> as<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.340> bottom<00:03:12.909> and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
and you kind of use that as a bottom and

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.449 
and you kind of use that as a bottom and
sand<00:03:15.060> nicely<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.629> it's<00:03:16.780> got<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.930> flat<00:03:17.230> spot<00:03:17.560> also

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
sand nicely so it's got a flat spot also

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.819 
sand nicely so it's got a flat spot also
this<00:03:19.150> one<00:03:19.419> I<00:03:19.450> started<00:03:19.720> sanding<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.470> little<00:03:20.680> bit

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
this one I started sanding a little bit

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.520 
this one I started sanding a little bit
takes<00:03:21.760> more<00:03:22.060> you<00:03:22.449> know<00:03:22.569> a<00:03:22.599> lot<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:22.930> time<00:03:23.139> so

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
takes more you know a lot of time so

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.660 
takes more you know a lot of time so
okay<00:03:24.250> I'll<00:03:24.549> get<00:03:24.879> back<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.090> it

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.110 

okay<00:03:31.670> I've<00:03:31.940> got<00:03:32.150> it<00:03:32.300> all<00:03:32.510> sanded<00:03:33.379> nicely<00:03:34.220> my

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
okay I've got it all sanded nicely my
