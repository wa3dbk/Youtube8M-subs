00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.460
 the likeable image of the road 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.440
 exalted the cinema of the 50s and well 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.180
 tarnished it does not happen a week 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.500
 without either raised the issue of 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.690
 800,000 heavy goods vehicles crisscrossing the 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.470
 France of which 20,000 carry 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.010
 Hazardous Material 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.960
 in 1973 there was on our road 195 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.460
 traffic accident concerning the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.990
 transport of dangerous goods and 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.850
 in most cases the product 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.380
 transport the hydrocarbons 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.039
 chemicals liquefied gases from 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.319
 explosives 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.999
 even radioactive material 

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:37.039
 are dumped out of the tank 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:38.870
 provocative twenty deaths but 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.780
 also house destructions of 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.429
 losses of culture of pollution that 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.440
 In this respect Alsatians are 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:48.109
 particularly concerned all the water 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.190
 used comes from the very pro tablecloth 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.289
 bull is sad we can not 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.699
 physically protect her and the tablecloth 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.440
 Alsatian is very sick 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.999
 facilities that are common to 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.829
 the civilian airport and the military base 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.690
 for example concerns those who are 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.399
 responsible for watching over the water 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.350
 times the filling of the vats 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.210
 kerosene was not controlled with the 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.000
 necessary rigor and the cube 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.420
 overwhelmed is a then in a few 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.399
 month 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.600
 the water supply of strasbourg 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.500
 risk of being against 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.500
 especially because 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.240
 it is also necessary that from outside 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.110
 can identify the truck carrying 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.760
 hazardous materials 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.950
 they are subject to safety rules 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.840
 special speed limits 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.250
 equipping security as 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.530
 fire extinguishers suitable for products 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.180
 transported and especially signaling 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.440
 for some time any vehicle 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.930
 carrying dangerous goods 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.360
 have to prominently display a 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.190
 orange rectangle next to must be affixed 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.790
 a rhombus on which is symbolized the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.790
 nature of the product 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.810
 finally on the side windows of the 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.920
 cab the instructions to apply in case 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.240
 accident must also be displayed at 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.710
 the future it will no longer be possible on a 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.410
 Special permits for heavyweights 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.030
 porting that we reform the permit that 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.830
 we adapt it to angels in our day 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.390
 all the better still do not you have to 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.979
 continue to encourage drivers to 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.119
 take risks especially when they 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.119
 carry dangerous goods 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.170
 50% of accidents in which are 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.340
 applied the material carriers 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.190
 dangerous goods are due to mistakes in 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.900
 but 50% are because 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.710
 specific safety conditions do not 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.300
 are not respected 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.590
 the interministerial commission of 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.150
 transport of dangerous goods without 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.550
 the tribes in a few months 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.960
 the fines will be multiplied by 100 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.400
 as to the security organs 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.400
 the realistic specialists 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.900
 this equipped with a brake system 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.580
 electric brake system of 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.900
 electric rescue is mandatory on 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.380
 coaches in some areas 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.330
 rough 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.650
 it is regrettable that such a measure 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.870
 not be extended to tanker trucks 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.850
 who license the entire territory 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.410
 a tanker truck that no longer has a brake 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.390
 becomes a real bomb 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.150
 while waiting for the authorities to 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.250
 impose it or refund near us we have 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.660
 canceled specific course and 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.920
 until effect outside the courses 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.920
 is not refunded 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.380
 yes the big transport companies 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.700
 repays the facts but not all 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.350
 sections to borrow are well 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.850
 determined but overall the 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.860
 drivers do not like highways 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.840
 they find them monotonous and above all they 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.430
 do not find their truck stop and 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.130
 the highway restaurants distill his 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.420
 dear is dead so let's take stock the 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.860
 number of accidents in which 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.060
 applied trucks carrying 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.950
 hazardous materials and no doubt 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.569
 low but their gravity and dramatic 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.370
 as cautious as may be the 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.020
 private as sophisticated as it can be 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.580
 the material it remains nonetheless 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.220
 that there are always risks 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.840
 so why not use the train 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.120
 road transport is practically 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.940
 guarantees you a half day close 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.230
 the execution of a transport the sncf does 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.180
 can not do it in the current state of 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.160
 its organization and its delegates 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.290
 sometimes several days 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.630
 on the other hand also not forget that he 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.500
 there is all the transport of distribution 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.300
 which can only be done by the road 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.130
 thought in the case of very matters 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.780
 dangerous like the club it's obvious 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.130
 that there is no question of banning the 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.810
 transport by road of materials 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.180
 dangerous but could not we 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.829
 limit to only small distances and 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.390
 no longer grant licenses while 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.470
 department to the carriers of 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.110
 Hazardous Material 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.610
 it would be desirable that the sncf is 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.740
 a more aggressive commercial policy 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.750
 which would make it competitive with 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.729
 carriers or whoever it is at 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.890
 level of delays whether at the level 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.200
 sizes but would have to 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.550
 administrations know how to resist one 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.440
 most pressure groups 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.039
 powerful of France that of 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.039
 road hauliers
