alright<00:00:01.199> so<00:00:01.380> we're<00:00:01.589> here<00:00:01.740> at<00:00:01.979> our<00:00:02.190> test

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
alright so we're here at our test

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.550 
alright so we're here at our test
location<00:00:02.939> number<00:00:03.030> two<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:03.659> we're<00:00:04.290> going<00:00:04.470> to

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
location number two and we're going to

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.079 
location number two and we're going to
show<00:00:04.650> you<00:00:04.710> like<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.130> signal<00:00:05.490> strength<00:00:05.730> here

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
show you like the signal strength here

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.900 
show you like the signal strength here
and<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:07.049> ATT<00:00:07.470> iphone<00:00:07.799> 4<00:00:07.980> has<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.189> solid<00:00:08.550> five

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
and the ATT iphone 4 has a solid five

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
bars while the verizon one has only

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.860 
bars while the verizon one has only
three<00:00:10.920> but<00:00:11.519> as<00:00:11.670> we've<00:00:11.910> mentioned<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.480> as<00:00:12.719> we

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
three but as we've mentioned it as we

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.110 
three but as we've mentioned it as we
would<00:00:12.990> mention<00:00:13.200> again<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.740> verizon<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.820> for

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
would mention again the verizon I for

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.240 
would mention again the verizon I for
still<00:00:15.420> post<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.870> better<00:00:16.080> calling<00:00:16.680> quality<00:00:16.859> than

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
still post a better calling quality than

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.820 
still post a better calling quality than
the<00:00:17.279> AT&amp;T<00:00:17.730> iphone<00:00:18.359> 4<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:19.289> let's<00:00:19.439> run<00:00:19.619> be<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
the AT&amp;T iphone 4 so let's run be a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.130 
the AT&amp;T iphone 4 so let's run be a
quick<00:00:20.189> speed<00:00:20.520> test<00:00:20.789> here<00:00:21.029> again<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.510> show<00:00:22.080> you

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
quick speed test here again and show you

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.750 
quick speed test here again and show you
what<00:00:22.350> kind<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.710> results<00:00:23.130> we're<00:00:23.460> going<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.640> get

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
what kind of results we're going to get

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.820 
what kind of results we're going to get
here<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> test<00:00:24.420> location<00:00:24.869> number<00:00:24.930> two<00:00:25.170> will<00:00:25.650> do

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
here a test location number two will do

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.920 
here a test location number two will do
it<00:00:25.949> three<00:00:26.160> times<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.849> better<00:00:27.090> gauge<00:00:27.180> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
it three times just to better gauge a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.620 
it three times just to better gauge a
pretty<00:00:28.380> good<00:00:28.560> tally<00:00:28.859> here<00:00:29.359> so<00:00:30.359> here<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.599> go

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
pretty good tally here so here we go

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.030 
pretty good tally here so here we go
with<00:00:30.900> test<00:00:31.170> number<00:00:31.260> one<00:00:33.739> okay<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:34.800> far<00:00:34.860> as

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
with test number one okay as far as

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.220 
with test number one okay as far as
latency<00:00:35.550> looks<00:00:35.850> like<00:00:36.059> almost<00:00:36.329> approximately

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
latency looks like almost approximately

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.799

we've been seeing test location number
one<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.119> far<00:02:09.360> here<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:10.140> looks<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
one and so far here it looks like the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.580 
one and so far here it looks like the
download<00:02:11.039> speeds<00:02:11.310> are<00:02:11.430> vastly<00:02:12.030> superior

download speeds are vastly superior

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.970

the verizon iphone 4 and finally we're

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.619 
the verizon iphone 4 and finally we're
going<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.370> finish<00:02:22.489> up<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.940> upload<00:02:23.269> speeds

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
going to finish up the upload speeds

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.940 
going to finish up the upload speeds
here<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.620> we<00:02:25.160> got<00:02:25.340> 15<00:02:25.730> 97<00:02:26.420> k<00:02:26.720> up<00:02:26.989> for<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.620> AT&amp;T

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.119

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
to 33 k up for the verizon so once again

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.880 
to 33 k up for the verizon so once again
something<00:02:31.489> like<00:02:31.760> 18<00:02:32.180> 18<00:02:32.930> c<00:02:33.110> iphone<00:02:33.410> 4<00:02:33.650> is

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
something like 18 18 c iphone 4 is

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.220 
something like 18 18 c iphone 4 is
better<00:02:34.250> as<00:02:34.489> far<00:02:34.730> as<00:02:34.849> data<00:02:35.120> data<00:02:35.720> speeds<00:02:36.110> are

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
better as far as data data speeds are

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.140 
better as far as data data speeds are
concerned<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:36.769> walk<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> test<00:02:37.700> location

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
concerned so walk to a test location

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.599 
concerned so walk to a test location
number<00:02:38.239> three
