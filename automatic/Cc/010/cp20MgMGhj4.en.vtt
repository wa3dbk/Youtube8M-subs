00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.069
 good afternoon now we will demonstrate 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.480
 you unique column 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:15.839
 a column of perhaps unity in everything in the world 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:20.279
 since on the basis of ordinary household 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.430
 installation room 1 and 2 according to the certificate 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.220
 trade name liters to one of 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.680
 organizations gathered special 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.960
 device 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.270
 more than 10 meters high 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.340
 see this column 10 meters in which 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.420
 which is composed of 22 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.640
 the villagers of the so-called pike for 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.430
 not to complicate and not expensive 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.070
 the experiment they took enhanced 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:57.489
 our tank here you see here I will connect 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:01:01.510
 l power 1.25 kilowatts 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.239
 and the system got its name from alcohol 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:09.009
 system 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.950
 125 which means 1.25 drank water here 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.170
 here there is a drain tap here in this 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.229
 the experiment is filled with the mixture 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.679
 of unknown composition consisting of 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:25.320
 components with a boiling point of 20 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:27.880
 up to 100 degrees here this setting 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.950
 possesses separation ability 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.100
 over a thousand shifts, that's what they say 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.210
 cleaning a thousand times a day i'm cleaning 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.950
 stylistically it is not true your speech 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:44.409
 talking about thermodynamic transfer or about 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.700
 theoretical plate ah here for example 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:51.810
 Vodka according to GOST gets on installations 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.000
 now with a different ability 100 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.500
 here we have 10 times as big 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.240
 separation ability here 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.890
 separation capacity of a thousand something 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.549
 there is if on this colony did 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.460
 alcohol for vodka but it would be very 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.799
 pure very good alcohol here you see 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.260
 so here we go here 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:14.769
 cooling water connections 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.650
 cooling water ready selection of selection 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.519
 product and two wires two cables 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.310
 telemetry 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:25.030
 which transmit temperature by the way 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.750
 very important issue we noticed 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.720
 what our colleagues other firms offer 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.989
 many devices with simple thermometers 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.850
 simple why but they are almost there 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.769
 bimetallic ie accuracy 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.260
 determine the temperature plus minus 5 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:46.570
 degrees we believe that having such 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.290
 thermometers but not entirely correct and 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.360
 quite right 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.700
 away here are thermometers 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.370
 the cost of each of which is 5 thousand 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.129
 dollars this without mounting 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.260
 there are five thermometers here 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.450
 put on every king guterman then 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.879
 because the column can work in two 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.939
 modes it can work periodically 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:10.519
 mode pushing through each component 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:14.870
 through the node selection and measure the temperature 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:17.510
 and maybe all the contents of the cube hang in 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.700
 colonies and put on each form 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.000
 thermometer measures temperature to carry 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.909
 what's in the area 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.389
 columns is located which component 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:31.879
 Here we showed you as one of 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.829
 organizations to perform contractual work 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.689
 very expensive very important 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:39.560
 because they needed to investigate 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:41.269
 product based on the usual serial 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.980
 installations that you offered 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:47.540
 sales made serious 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.699
 research complex which 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.229
 allows with very high accuracy 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:57.440
 determine percentage 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:59.479
 components in the mixture of the finished product and 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.930
 so plan 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:06.109
 technological processes 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.900
 Now the operator shows us the panorama 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:18.079
 up unfortunately we were no longer allowed 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:20.780
 shoot here the farms alien work alien 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.449
 the contract here is a panorama of what they did 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.930
 using our equipment to us 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:30.010
 above the indignation again be kind 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.010
 show it is no reason 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.550
 our dear owners for whom we are 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:05.330
 contract assembled installation which 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:09.140
 showed you this big showed 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.760
 there are samples in their main hall 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:16.430
 our installations that we gave them for 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:19.850
 experimental works are the same 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:25.580
 installations you offer and sales through 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:27.770
 your stores need to say that here 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:38.270
 there is a total of these installations 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:40.460
 two very important elements 2 and 3 for example 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.990
 put a reflux dish on a very high 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.450
 installation of this type 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:50.620
 from pipe 43 dia 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:54.080
 Dephlegmator at the time of sale 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:58.010
 dephlegmator and all the same performed 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:02.780
 with copper fridges by the way the most 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:08.750
 effective here this installation here 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:12.200
 worth 1 2 125 she is able to give alcohol 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:15.830
 94 degrees with a slight will 500 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:18.350
 milliliters per hour if the selection and a half 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.230
 liter for example it is capable of up to 90 years 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:24.590
 up to 90 degrees and give alcohol from 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.780
 good quality alcohol is raw 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.500
 eat yourself 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:33.050
 This unit is already capable of issuing 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:37.220
 alcohol to 95 degrees is a compound 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:39.340
 Set the video component and the side-bar 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:43.580
 this unit is already capable of issuing 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.990
 Gostovsky alcohol with with stocks of dews with 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:51.530
 100 theoretically metal 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:54.080
 as we say, we believe that it is not experts 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.510
 with 100 times the purification of such food and that 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.290
 you are worth some counting but there cleans 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:02.660
 no sieve in the columns there is no 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:06.610
 cleaning cartridge to be replaced 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:10.760
 in columns not in decks is 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.440
 active zone consisting of nozzles here 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.820
 these are all the columns fulfilled 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.860
 ceramic us from the most durable 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.960
 the most reliable 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:23.450
 do not tolerate changes in the process 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.880
 operating 10 years twenty years 

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.800
 exploit a hundred years the deck will 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.580
 work so to speak as worked in 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.370
 the very beginning 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:34.430
 Unfortunately, unlike the copper nozzle 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:37.280
 copper nozzle the first two years of work 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:40.400
 well then begin to appear 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:43.460
 problems so we showed you 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.600
 those nodes and those settings on words that 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:49.760
 the world's largest was assembled 

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:53.030
 laboratory laboratory installation 

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:56.260
 actions which are collected from elements 

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:58.340
 about ordinary household installations 

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:01.120
 since we are releasing household 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.120
 laboratory equipment
