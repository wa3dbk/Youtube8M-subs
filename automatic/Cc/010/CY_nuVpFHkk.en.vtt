one how many of these are there we're

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.799 
one how many of these are there we're
building<00:00:52.199> 2000<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.250> year<00:00:53.489> wow<00:00:53.910> he's<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.600> got

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
building 2000 this year wow he's you got

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.060 
building 2000 this year wow he's you got
the<00:00:54.930> first<00:00:55.140> two<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.500> one<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.890> first

the first two this is one of the first

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.200 
the first two this is one of the first
two<00:00:56.280> they've<00:00:56.489> been<00:00:56.579> driving<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:57.120> about

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
two they've been driving this for about

two they've been driving this for about
a<00:00:57.300> year<00:00:57.690> and<00:01:00.289> they<00:01:01.289> put<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.739> many<00:01:02.190> thousand

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
a year and they put on many thousand

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.780 
a year and they put on many thousand
miles<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:03.149> it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
miles on it

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.940 
miles on it
now<00:01:04.330> most<00:01:04.600> of<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.840> torque<00:01:05.110> we've<00:01:05.470> dialed<00:01:05.770> up

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
now most of the torque we've dialed up

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.030 
now most of the torque we've dialed up
above<00:01:06.310> 30<00:01:06.840> miles<00:01:07.840> per<00:01:07.930> hour<00:01:08.140> so<00:01:08.590> if<00:01:08.890> you're

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
above 30 miles per hour so if you're

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.160 
above 30 miles per hour so if you're
under<00:01:09.280> 30<00:01:09.520> okay<00:01:10.090> we've<00:01:10.330> softened<00:01:10.600> that<00:01:10.930> with

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
under 30 okay we've softened that with

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.580 
under 30 okay we've softened that with

30 we give them passing power they

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.510 
30 we give them passing power they
didn't<00:01:16.120> want<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:16.330> lot<00:01:16.780> of<00:01:17.040> stop<00:01:18.040> sign<00:01:18.310> red

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520

didn't want a lot of stop sign red
lights<00:01:18.750> screeches<00:01:21.210> there<00:01:22.210> are<00:01:22.270> no<00:01:22.360> fun<00:01:23.700> this

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
lights screeches there are no fun this

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.410

has<00:01:24.880> one<00:01:25.090> gear<00:01:25.360> zero<00:01:25.540> to<00:01:26.020> 85<00:01:26.350> in<00:01:26.500> first<00:01:26.680> gear<00:01:27.420> as

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
has one gear zero to 85 in first gear as

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.969 
has one gear zero to 85 in first gear as
we<00:01:28.600> put<00:01:28.870> the<00:01:28.990> same<00:01:29.200> powertrain<00:01:29.530> in<00:01:29.800> bigger

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
we put the same powertrain in bigger

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.590 
we put the same powertrain in bigger
vehicles<00:01:30.490> will<00:01:30.640> gear<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:30.970> first<00:01:31.150> gear<00:01:31.360> down

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
vehicles will gear the first gear down

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.020 
vehicles will gear the first gear down
it's<00:01:32.470> got<00:01:32.590> 402<00:01:33.100> horsepower<00:01:33.490> so<00:01:33.700> if<00:01:33.820> you're<00:01:33.940> the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
it's got 402 horsepower so if you're the

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.670 
it's got 402 horsepower so if you're the
first<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.450> hear<00:01:34.479> down<00:01:34.870> and<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.170> sexier<00:01:35.530> will

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
first to hear down and the sexier will

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.620 
first to hear down and the sexier will
use<00:01:35.770> for<00:01:35.979> cruising<00:01:36.310> so<00:01:37.210> we'll<00:01:37.360> put<00:01:37.479> this

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
use for cruising so we'll put this

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.350 
use for cruising so we'll put this
everything<00:01:37.960> up<00:01:38.080> to<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:38.350> class<00:01:38.619> five<00:01:38.920> perhaps<00:01:39.490> so

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
everything up to a class five perhaps so

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.600 
everything up to a class five perhaps so
be<00:01:40.509> automatic<00:01:41.050> transmission<00:01:41.560> or<00:01:41.770> is<00:01:42.460> it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
be automatic transmission or is it

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.520 
be automatic transmission or is it
automatic<00:01:42.729> to<00:01:43.210> cfd<00:01:43.660> okay<00:01:43.960> we're<00:01:44.170> building<00:01:44.440> at

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
automatic to cfd okay we're building at

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.670 
automatic to cfd okay we're building at
ourselves<00:01:44.619> with<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.130> Tier<00:01:45.729> one<00:01:45.759> supplier<00:01:46.680> so

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
ourselves with a Tier one supplier so

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.890 
ourselves with a Tier one supplier so
it'll<00:01:47.920> drive<00:01:48.220> like<00:01:48.400> an<00:01:48.520> automatic

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900
