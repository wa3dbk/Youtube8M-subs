does not mean of all five years of pro
and<00:01:58.710> other<00:01:58.829> organizations<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> goal<00:02:00.450> is

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.300 
and other organizations so the goal is
still<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.020> win<00:02:01.350> by<00:02:01.469> WMBF

part<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.670> next<00:02:02.880> few<00:02:03.000> years<00:02:04.009> but<00:02:05.009> seeing<00:02:05.159> as

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
part of the next few years but seeing as

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.850 
part of the next few years but seeing as
I<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.460> barely<00:02:05.939> 20<00:02:06.240> years<00:02:06.390> old<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.899> fairly

small<00:02:08.069> as<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.280> competitor<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.880> think<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.050> will<00:02:10.110> be

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.809 
small as a competitor I think it will be
at<00:02:10.470> least<00:02:10.500> between<00:02:11.099> three<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.580> five<00:02:11.760> years

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
at least between three and five years

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.300 
at least between three and five years
