my last video I'm finishing up my

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.280 
my last video I'm finishing up my
training<00:00:11.639> cycle<00:00:12.150> I'm<00:00:12.210> on<00:00:12.360> my<00:00:12.480> fifth<00:00:12.540> week<00:00:12.990> and

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
training cycle I'm on my fifth week and

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.169 
training cycle I'm on my fifth week and
what<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:13.980> actually<00:00:14.130> ended<00:00:14.370> up<00:00:14.580> doing<00:00:14.940> during

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
what I actually ended up doing during

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.180 
what I actually ended up doing during
this<00:00:15.420> training<00:00:15.660> cycle<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.590> decreased<00:00:17.070> my

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
this training cycle is I decreased my

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.340 
this training cycle is I decreased my
training<00:00:17.609> max<00:00:17.789> by<00:00:18.029> five<00:00:18.270> percent<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.230> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
training max by five percent this is the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.439 
training max by five percent this is the
standard<00:00:19.650> protocol<00:00:20.100> if<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.340> miss<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.609> rep<00:00:20.939> but

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
standard protocol if you miss a rep but

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.450 
standard protocol if you miss a rep but
it's<00:00:21.660> also<00:00:21.840> an<00:00:22.109> option<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.650> my<00:00:22.769> program<00:00:23.039> if<00:00:23.369> you

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
it's also an option on my program if you

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.529 
it's also an option on my program if you
feel<00:00:23.609> like<00:00:23.730> you're<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:24.000> pushing<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.510> bit

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
feel like you're just pushing it a bit

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.150 
feel like you're just pushing it a bit
too<00:00:24.720> hard<00:00:25.140> most<00:00:25.529> people<00:00:25.769> are<00:00:25.859> going<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.070> have

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
too hard most people are going to have

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.620 
too hard most people are going to have
to<00:00:26.250> worry<00:00:26.430> about<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.789> but<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.060> adjustment

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
to worry about it but that adjustment

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.599 
to worry about it but that adjustment
can<00:00:27.810> be<00:00:27.869> necessary<00:00:28.590> depending<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.429> how

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
can be necessary depending on how

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.519 
can be necessary depending on how
advanced<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.210> lifter<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.660> are<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.140> your

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
advanced of a lifter you are and your

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.680 
advanced of a lifter you are and your
diet<00:00:31.800> but<00:00:32.340> I'll<00:00:32.489> explain<00:00:32.730> all<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:32.969> later<00:00:33.210> and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
diet but I'll explain all that later and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.240 
diet but I'll explain all that later and
videos<00:00:33.989> dedicated<00:00:34.170> specifically<00:00:35.130> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
videos dedicated specifically to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.700 
videos dedicated specifically to
explaining<00:00:35.910> my<00:00:36.120> program<00:00:36.600> anyways<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:37.380> far<00:00:37.590> as

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
explaining my program anyways as far as

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.410 
explaining my program anyways as far as
my<00:00:37.829> training<00:00:38.219> moving<00:00:38.550> forward<00:00:38.940> what<00:00:39.300> I'm

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
my training moving forward what I'm

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.270 
my training moving forward what I'm
going<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:39.809> after<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.410> cycle<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.829> finished

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
going to do after this cycle is finished

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.670 
going to do after this cycle is finished
is<00:00:41.430> move<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.270> my<00:00:42.390> linear<00:00:42.719> strength<00:00:43.200> control

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
is move on to my linear strength control

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.380 
is move on to my linear strength control
program<00:00:44.190> I'm<00:00:44.399> doing<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.239> add

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
program I'm doing this that I can add

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.180 
program I'm doing this that I can add
some<00:00:45.539> variation<00:00:46.050> into<00:00:46.230> my<00:00:46.350> training<00:00:46.649> as<00:00:46.920> well

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
some variation into my training as well

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.709 
some variation into my training as well
as<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:47.760> some<00:00:47.940> more<00:00:48.090> flexibility

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
as just have some more flexibility

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.720 
as just have some more flexibility
leading<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> Arnold<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.370> it'll<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
leading up to the Arnold so it'll be a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.910 
leading up to the Arnold so it'll be a
bit<00:00:50.969> easier<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.449> transition<00:00:51.870> into<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.649> meat

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
bit easier to transition into that meat

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.279 
bit easier to transition into that meat
preparation<00:00:53.610> mode<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.570> want<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.870> try<00:00:55.050> low

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
preparation mode and I want to try low

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.660 
preparation mode and I want to try low
bar<00:00:55.469> squatting<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.250> see<00:00:56.370> how<00:00:56.399> that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
bar squatting and just see how that

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.310 
bar squatting and just see how that
feels<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.149> well<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.629> was<00:00:57.930> thinking<00:00:58.260> about

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
feels as well I was thinking about

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.049 
feels as well I was thinking about
running<00:00:58.590> my<00:00:58.800> strength<00:00:59.129> power<00:00:59.340> program<00:00:59.850> to

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
running my strength power program to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.240 
running my strength power program to
focus<00:01:00.420> more<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.690> increasing<00:01:01.079> my<00:01:01.289> vertical<00:01:01.649> but

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
focus more on increasing my vertical but

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.709 
focus more on increasing my vertical but
what<00:01:02.370> I've<00:01:02.489> decided<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.210> I'm<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.600> going

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
what I've decided is that I'm just going

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.210 
what I've decided is that I'm just going
to<00:01:03.750> save<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.350> after<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.830> Arnold

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
to save that for after the Arnold

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.859 
to save that for after the Arnold
because<00:01:05.760> right<00:01:05.970> now<00:01:06.000> I'm<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.330> focusing<00:01:06.780> on

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
because right now I'm just focusing on

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.510 
because right now I'm just focusing on
increasing<00:01:07.049> my<00:01:07.530> total<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.010> much<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:08.369> possible

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
increasing my total as much as possible

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.609 
increasing my total as much as possible
I<00:01:08.970> still<00:01:09.330> might<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.720> some<00:01:09.930> jump<00:01:10.170> training<00:01:10.350> but

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
I still might do some jump training but

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.990 
I still might do some jump training but
it'll<00:01:10.770> just<00:01:10.920> be<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> side<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.850> won't

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
it'll just be on the side and it won't

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.730 
it'll just be on the side and it won't
be<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> real<00:01:12.330> focal<00:01:12.810> point<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.110> my<00:01:13.170> training<00:01:13.530> as

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
be a real focal point of my training as

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.140 
be a real focal point of my training as

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
full squats without a belt for an entire

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.410 
full squats without a belt for an entire
training<00:02:56.340> cycle<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.239> how<00:02:57.360> i

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
training cycle and this is how i

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.000 
training cycle and this is how i
integrate<00:02:57.930> different<00:02:58.110> styles<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.680> squatting

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
integrate different styles of squatting

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.550 
integrate different styles of squatting
into<00:02:59.519> my<00:02:59.640> training<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:00.720> find<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.110> if<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.350> try

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
into my training is I find that if I try

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.500 
into my training is I find that if I try
to<00:03:01.620> integrate<00:03:01.950> both<00:03:02.370> at<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.730> same<00:03:02.940> time<00:03:02.970> use

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
to integrate both at the same time use

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.449 
to integrate both at the same time use
Olympic<00:03:03.959> squats<00:03:04.260> as<00:03:04.440> an<00:03:04.560> accessory<00:03:04.860> movement

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
for example I find that just don't

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.930 
for example I find that just don't
really<00:03:07.530> get<00:03:07.769> that<00:03:07.950> efficient<00:03:08.549> that<00:03:08.700> one

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
really get that efficient that one

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.789
