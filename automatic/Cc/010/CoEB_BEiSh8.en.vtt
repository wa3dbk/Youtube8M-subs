00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
going to do that because I am I can

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.770 
going to do that because I am I can
imagine<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.189> but<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.729> think<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
imagine that but I think like the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.660 
imagine that but I think like the
opportunity<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.290> go<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.740> place<00:01:19.920> cone<00:01:20.159> was

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
opportunity to go to the place cone was

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.609 
opportunity to go to the place cone was
as<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.240> said<00:01:21.450> before<00:01:21.630> pretty<00:01:22.229> much<00:01:22.409> your

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
as you said before pretty much your

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.300 
as you said before pretty much your
goals<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.310> um<00:01:23.909> what<00:01:24.570> do<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.750> think<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.320> going

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
goals so um what do you think is going

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.730 
goals so um what do you think is going
to<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.430> different<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:27.360> at<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.659> blizzcon<00:01:27.990> you

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
to be different like at the blizzcon you

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.050 
to be different like at the blizzcon you
think<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.250> will<00:01:29.369> baby<00:01:29.670> change<00:01:30.000> something

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.760 

home<00:01:34.180> you<00:01:34.450> were<00:01:34.570> playing<00:01:34.840> or<00:01:35.170> like<00:01:35.590> just

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
home you were playing or like just

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.920 
home you were playing or like just
practicing<00:01:36.369> more<00:01:36.579> I<00:01:36.850> think<00:01:37.689> we'll<00:01:37.810> be

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
practicing more I think we'll be

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.270 
practicing more I think we'll be
practicing<00:01:38.079> a<00:01:38.409> few<00:01:38.560> different<00:01:38.799> comps<00:01:39.009> as<00:01:39.130> well

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
practicing a few different comps as well

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.560 
practicing a few different comps as well
because<00:01:39.520> escalade<00:01:39.909> seems<00:01:40.180> to<00:01:40.299> be<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.450> pretty

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
because escalade seems to be a pretty

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.910 
because escalade seems to be a pretty
massive<00:01:40.780> problem<00:01:41.290> and<00:01:41.439> if<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:41.649> can't<00:01:41.829> get

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
massive problem and if you can't get

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.069 
massive problem and if you can't get
over<00:01:42.130> that<00:01:42.159> then<00:01:42.689> it's<00:01:43.689> going<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.840> be<00:01:43.930> tough

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
over that then it's going to be tough

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.410 
over that then it's going to be tough
over<00:01:44.289> there<00:01:44.439> and<00:01:44.710> as<00:01:45.490> for<00:01:45.700> blizzcon<00:01:45.909> I<00:01:46.149> mean

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
over there and as for blizzcon I mean

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.179 
over there and as for blizzcon I mean
you<00:01:46.930> have<00:01:47.049> people<00:01:47.200> coming<00:01:47.470> from<00:01:47.619> Korea<00:01:47.950> and

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
you have people coming from Korea and

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.950 
you have people coming from Korea and
the<00:01:48.250> Americans<00:01:48.759> themselves<00:01:48.880> they<00:01:49.420> all<00:01:49.539> have<00:01:49.750> a

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
the Americans themselves they all have a

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.779 
the Americans themselves they all have a
different<00:01:50.110> play<00:01:50.439> style<00:01:50.740> then<00:01:51.100> we<00:01:51.429> used<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.729> in

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
different play style then we used to in

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
them was actually a miscommunication

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.879 
them was actually a miscommunication
between<00:03:05.100> basically<00:03:06.100> me<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.700> Fabio<00:03:07.620> but<00:03:08.620> I

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
between basically me and Fabio but I

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.129 
between basically me and Fabio but I
mean<00:03:09.280> we<00:03:09.670> came<00:03:09.850> back<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.389> we<00:03:10.450> finished<00:03:11.049> the
