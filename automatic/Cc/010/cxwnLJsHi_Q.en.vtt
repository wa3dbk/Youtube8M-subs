00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.920
 hi this is the video site team 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.620
 test.com today a test of the 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.230
 creati monohydrate creatures in 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.290
 myprotein so the label and creatures 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.570
 unionized here so this is a bag of 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:24.039
 20 kg it's worth about this one 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:27.340
 kilo and so I have thirty razes all 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:30.910
 this in a pot that I bought I did not 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.270
 proteins so see you have the 1 kg 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.170
 inside and that dose is 3 g that 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.809
 I also bought that is not 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.940
 provide so it's more to associate 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.270
 practical and for conservation it's 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.120
 top 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.030
 and besides, we know who is here 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.760
 so you quickly introduce what 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.059
 it is in the creative then there its synthesis 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.379
 did in fact call for 3 amino acids 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.780
 so it's a natural production at 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.370
 your body therefore produces naturally 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.109
 even if it's not something 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.260
 priority for him hence the interest of 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.160
 supplement and on top of that these 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.190
 present in the food 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.050
 so that's his function and well it serves 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.090
 especially when you contract a 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.870
 muscle it's using energy 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.880
 it's the tp is the creatine as well 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.900
 that fatty acids and cose goes 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.660
 produce this energy 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.250
 this is the use of his correspondents 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.860
 type to test protocol a little bit 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.040
 way it's a product that I use 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.650
 personally 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.690
 so you have to learn the year then 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.510
 do not talk about cure or then 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.230
 phase ii load of ckoi in that itself 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.960
 takes the year of agreement to reason so 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.600
 from 3 to 5 grams per day depending on whether you 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.910
 you train or not and we took a 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.440
 grain not repeated everything to mix 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.080
 obviously with a source 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.150
 proteins and that's the ideal 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.000
 and therefore we must avoid taking it 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.350
 before training it's advice 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.200
 that I did not want this crude like this 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.120
 you will see on the test video site 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.040
 for more details 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.350
 so we will soon be voting 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.840
 now so I have a bottle a 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.390
 shaker that makes little by little a little 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.330
 more than 100 milliliters of water and I'm going 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.490
 do the test then taking so for 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.040
 the 2 to ja must not be precise it is necessary 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.100
 not having fun is to weigh me a serious 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.740
 here I am half this business is to 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.300
 g bag his alpha ats with 5 grams of 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.270
 product anyway it's because you 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:36.760
 will use daily 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:38.580
 that's very very simple here you see 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.970
 that the water is cloudy we see small 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.380
 tigers like that it turns out like 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.000
 it's playing with Morocco 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.840
 but now that's so there is not the 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.800
 taste has no particular smell 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.690
 some take it with drinks 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.780
 some white grape juice that's fine 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.030
 want but the ideal with a source 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.160
 proteins and in the end what you have 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.220
 saw rsa small deposits inside at 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.880
 good background it's a little normal all and 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.750
 creative anyway I've ever seen 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.790
 otherwise there are always small 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.560
 residues in conclusion so this is a 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.690
 product to which I personally 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.190
 react some do not react I 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.060
 believe she gave you 20% of the 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.350
 population that does not react creatine 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.580
 afterwards to distinguish them from the effects 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.989
 beneficial so in the short term and the 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.280
 long term so its long term it's 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.550
 more interesting since it takes a 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.670
 year so we can sometimes observe a 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.230
 small but very nasty water retention but 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.780
 also a reinforcement of strength it is this 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.030
 that I've seen since I take and 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.310
 cool a little muscle mass 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.950
 so this basic effective clash 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.069
 and indispensable for sports 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.959
 force especially attention to the beats and 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.280
 reality then it's a term that is that 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.230
 you find a clear sound 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.470
 it's especially julien and sounds that has 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.530
 wrote a very interesting article his 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.500
 subject and in particular in his book is 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.810
 basically there are a lot of rumors of 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.450
 false beliefs etc that circulate to 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.610
 about the creative do not need 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.220
 believe all this is behind it will do 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.810
 the subject of a video very soon 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.300
 so in conclusion really to summarize 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.210
 the strengths of this product me this 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.150
 that I appreciate so it's a product of 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.360
 base that works indispensable for 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:35.110
 force all say that they say to each other or 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.890
 well by there is no taste no smell even 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.300
 if it's small deposits 1 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.430
 as I said earlier but 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.780
 it's not embarrassing at all it will suffice 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.990
 just a little bit of water and then you drink 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.790
 the background the beautiful creature that's it 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.960
 interesting because anyway that's it 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.810
 basically means that the lawsuit 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.430
 fabrications and is better 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.500
 basically that's it's with the 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.120
 creatively of the normal hydrate it is 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.979
 a shame because it because bags 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.110
 20 kg it will kill you almost any 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.880
 year 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.580
 so much to do as much take a 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.150
 better quality product 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.590
 that's it and it's effective 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.060
 so that's it for me and I tell you 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.290
 See you soon for more tests on 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.290
 video test in point as a hi
