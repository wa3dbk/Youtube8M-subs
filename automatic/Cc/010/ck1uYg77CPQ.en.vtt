00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
way of doing things so I've got my stuff

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.170 
way of doing things so I've got my stuff
here<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:21.000> say<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.240> example<00:00:22.189> this<00:00:23.189> here<00:00:23.910> is

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
here and say for example this here is

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.390 
here and say for example this here is
just<00:00:24.210> your<00:00:24.630> humble<00:00:24.960> shack<00:00:25.170> okay<00:00:25.500> i<00:00:25.680> would

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
just your humble shack okay i would

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.580 
just your humble shack okay i would

fridge without going to break down poor
break<00:01:38.640> down<00:01:39.090> blocks<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:40.320> could<00:01:40.530> look<00:01:40.680> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
break down blocks you could look a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.319 
break down blocks you could look a
painting<00:01:41.340> here<00:01:41.549> or<00:01:41.670> something<00:01:41.939> babe<00:01:42.119> look

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.889 
we're on back to the house it's got
bigger<00:01:44.850> house<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.360> obviously<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.780> an

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899

entrance concealed by a painting inside

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.319 
entrance concealed by a painting inside
so<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:51.630> could<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:52.130> interesting<00:01:53.130> there<00:01:53.939> an

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
so this could be interesting there an

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:03.270 
so this could be interesting there an
example<00:01:55.700> come<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.790> up

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.770 

so<00:02:04.280> I<00:02:04.310> can<00:02:04.610> put<00:02:04.730> a<00:02:04.760> painting<00:02:05.000> here<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.630> then
