into a new form vocabulary you know a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.299 
into a new form vocabulary you know a
new<00:00:36.629> sense<00:00:36.900> of<00:00:37.050> sculpture<00:00:37.530> something<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.190> we

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
new sense of sculpture something that we

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.910 
new sense of sculpture something that we
haven't<00:00:38.580> seen<00:00:38.940> before<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.989> any<00:00:40.140> or<00:00:40.410> any<00:00:40.620> other

Corvette<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:42.120> really<00:00:42.450> weren't<00:00:43.200> limited<00:00:43.470> by

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
Corvette we really weren't limited by

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.160 
Corvette we really weren't limited by
any<00:00:44.489> manufacturing<00:00:45.180> process<00:00:45.540> if<00:00:45.690> within<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
any manufacturing process if within the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.319 
any manufacturing process if within the
shape<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.340> put<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> car<00:00:48.059> I

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
shape that we that we put on the car I

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.420 
shape that we that we put on the car I
would<00:00:48.719> say<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> lot<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.649> lot<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.130> the<00:00:50.219> drama

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
would say a lot of a lot of the drama

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.459 
would say a lot of a lot of the drama
and<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> sculpture<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:51.750> was

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
and the sculpture that you see was

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.139 
and the sculpture that you see was
carefully<00:00:52.860> honed<00:00:53.040> and<00:00:53.250> tuned<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.700> the<00:00:53.790> window

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
carefully honed and tuned in the window

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.139 
carefully honed and tuned in the window
and<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.620> was<00:00:55.770> getting<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.670> that

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
and you know that was getting that that

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.180 
and you know that was getting that that
look<00:00:57.540> to<00:00:57.750> fit<00:00:57.930> over<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.290> new<00:00:58.410> architecture

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
look to fit over the new architecture

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.819 
look to fit over the new architecture
was<00:00:59.700> important<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.899> one<00:01:01.079> thing<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.320> had<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.590> do

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
was important so one thing we had to do

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.959 
was important so one thing we had to do
a<00:01:01.860> new<00:01:02.010> design<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.579> everybody<00:01:02.820> was

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
a new design that everybody was

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.969 
a new design that everybody was
appealing<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:03.960> we<00:01:04.110> had<00:01:04.410> to<00:01:04.619> use<00:01:04.770> better

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
appealing but we had to use better

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.040 
appealing but we had to use better
materials<00:01:05.550> so<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> big<00:01:06.630> thing<00:01:06.660> that<00:01:06.960> we

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
materials so the big thing that we

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.100 
materials so the big thing that we
pushed<00:01:07.259> for<00:01:07.500> was<00:01:07.649> if<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.460> was<00:01:08.600> aluminum<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:10.050> is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
pushed for was if it was aluminum it is

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.800 
pushed for was if it was aluminum it is
real<00:01:10.470> aluminum<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.759> carbon<00:01:12.119> fiber<00:01:12.390> it's

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
real aluminum if it is carbon fiber it's

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.380 
real aluminum if it is carbon fiber it's
real<00:01:13.080> carbon<00:01:13.440> fiber<00:01:13.679> we're<00:01:14.640> using<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.300> know

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
real carbon fiber we're using you know

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.790 
real carbon fiber we're using you know
really<00:01:15.720> good<00:01:15.840> quality<00:01:15.990> leather<00:01:16.410> we're

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
really good quality leather we're

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.550 
really good quality leather we're
wrapping<00:01:17.250> every<00:01:17.580> letter<00:01:17.759> every<00:01:18.060> level<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:19.380> put

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
wrapping every letter every level we put

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.590 
wrapping every letter every level we put
a<00:01:19.590> live<00:01:19.830> stitch<00:01:20.190> in<00:01:20.459> so<00:01:20.940> the<00:01:21.030> big<00:01:21.179> thing<00:01:21.209> was<00:01:21.450> we

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
a live stitch in so the big thing was we

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.570 
a live stitch in so the big thing was we
really<00:01:22.050> had<00:01:22.289> to<00:01:22.319> make<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.890> look<00:01:23.069> like<00:01:23.280> what<00:01:23.490> it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
really had to make it look like what it

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.639 
really had to make it look like what it
was<00:01:23.759> no<00:01:24.119> fake<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:25.020> could<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.349> do<00:01:25.500> anything

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
was no fake we could not do anything

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.290 
was no fake we could not do anything
faking<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.369> car<00:01:26.610> we've<00:01:26.910> made<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.090> major

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
faking this car we've made a major

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.820 
faking this car we've made a major
improvement<00:01:27.929> in<00:01:27.959> that<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.440> seats<00:01:28.679> for

improvement in that and the seats for
the<00:01:28.890> Corvette<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.459> we're<00:01:29.580> actually<00:01:29.729> doing

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the Corvette and we're actually doing

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.480

two<00:01:30.410> different<00:01:31.410> seats<00:01:31.830> now<00:01:32.099> there's<00:01:32.340> two

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
two different seats now there's two

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.190 
two different seats now there's two
seats<00:01:32.670> available<00:01:32.849> a<00:01:33.209> GT<00:01:33.780> C<00:01:33.929> which<00:01:34.050> is<00:01:34.170> like

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
seats available a GT C which is like

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.809 
seats available a GT C which is like
it's<00:01:34.410> great<00:01:34.619> all-around<00:01:34.830> sports<00:01:35.399> car<00:01:35.610> seat

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
it's great all-around sports car seat

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.540 
it's great all-around sports car seat

redesigning<00:02:00.569> the<00:02:00.750> roof<00:02:00.899> latch<00:02:01.140> now<00:02:01.550> at<00:02:02.550> least

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
redesigning the roof latch now at least

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.609 
redesigning the roof latch now at least
a<00:02:02.880> little<00:02:03.000> bit<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.569> that<00:02:03.720> would<00:02:03.840> be<00:02:03.899> new<00:02:04.410> as

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
a little bit and so that would be new as

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.710 
a little bit and so that would be new as
well<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.130> essentially<00:02:05.670> every<00:02:05.819> component<00:02:06.390> and

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
well so essentially every component and

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.630 
well so essentially every component and
as<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.380> see<00:02:07.619> when<00:02:07.800> you<00:02:07.890> look<00:02:07.920> at<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
as you can see when you look at the the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.279 
as you can see when you look at the the
body<00:02:08.819> structure<00:02:09.119> there's<00:02:09.420> not<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.630> single<00:02:09.929> part

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
body structure there's not a single part

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.800 
body structure there's not a single part
single<00:02:10.800> tool<00:02:11.039> used<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:12.030> making<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.540> structure

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
single tool used in making the structure

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.580 
single tool used in making the structure
that's<00:02:13.170> carried

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
that's carried

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.790 
that's carried
from<00:02:13.860> today's<00:02:14.160> car<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.840> know<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.080> this<00:02:16.410> for

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
from today's car you know this this for

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.410 
from today's car you know this this for
us<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.099> design<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:17.610> car<00:02:17.819> was<00:02:18.030> all<00:02:18.209> about

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
us in design this car was all about

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.380 
us in design this car was all about
looking<00:02:18.840> forward<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.239> we<00:02:21.239> really

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
looking forward and that we really

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.350 
looking forward and that we really
wanted<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.290> break<00:02:22.620> some<00:02:22.830> tradition<00:02:23.400> in<00:02:23.670> that

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
wanted to break some tradition in that

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.059 
wanted to break some tradition in that
we<00:02:24.510> wanted<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.230> be<00:02:25.260> as<00:02:25.530> new<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.739> statement

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
we wanted this to be as new a statement

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.820 
we wanted this to be as new a statement
as<00:02:26.280> possible<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.060> doing<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.510> we<00:02:28.379> came<00:02:28.650> up

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
as possible and in doing so we came up

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.589 
as possible and in doing so we came up
with<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> new<00:02:29.519> shape<00:02:29.760> for<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.000> tail<00:02:30.209> lamp<00:02:30.480> it's

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
with a new shape for the tail lamp it's

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.300 
with a new shape for the tail lamp it's
still<00:02:30.810> dual<00:02:31.049> element<00:02:31.379> which<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.010> can<00:02:32.220> argue

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
still dual element which you can argue

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.160 
still dual element which you can argue
you<00:02:32.549> know<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.879> for<00:02:33.180> us<00:02:33.269> as<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.510> formula<00:02:33.870> for

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
you know that for us as a formula for

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.140 
you know that for us as a formula for
Corvette<00:02:34.590> but<00:02:35.280> it's<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.459> very<00:02:35.670> it's<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.120> very

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
Corvette but it's a very it's a very

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.509 
Corvette but it's a very it's a very
modern<00:02:36.720> contemporary<00:02:37.170> do<00:02:37.560> element<00:02:38.040> that

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
modern contemporary do element that

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.030 
modern contemporary do element that
leverages<00:02:39.330> indirect<00:02:40.019> LED<00:02:40.410> lighting<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:40.920> were

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
leverages indirect LED lighting so were

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.130 
leverages indirect LED lighting so were
leveraging<00:02:41.730> our<00:02:41.849> latest<00:02:42.150> technology<00:02:42.840> with<00:02:42.959> it

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
leveraging our latest technology with it

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.869 
leveraging our latest technology with it
but<00:02:43.260> we<00:02:43.349> really<00:02:43.470> felt<00:02:43.799> for<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.549> customer

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
but we really felt for the customer

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.490 
but we really felt for the customer
would<00:02:45.000> be<00:02:45.090> important<00:02:45.569> for<00:02:45.690> them<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:46.200> this

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
would be important for them to have this

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.830 
would be important for them to have this
lit<00:02:47.280> signature<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.120> was<00:02:48.269> very<00:02:48.510> identifiable

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
lit signature that was very identifiable

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.050 
lit signature that was very identifiable
at<00:02:49.349> night<00:02:49.560> my<00:02:50.040> studio<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.730> Cologne<00:02:50.910> trim

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
at night my studio and the Cologne trim

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.089 
at night my studio and the Cologne trim
Co<00:02:51.239> worked<00:02:51.510> very<00:02:51.750> closely<00:02:51.989> together<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.709> make

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
Co worked very closely together to make

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.770 
Co worked very closely together to make
sure<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.280> we<00:02:53.400> picked<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.819> best<00:02:54.090> materials

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
sure that we picked the best materials

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.080 
sure that we picked the best materials
and<00:02:55.079> some<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.590> them<00:02:55.680> are<00:02:55.860> just<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.730> Corvette

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
and some of them are just the Corvette

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.190 
and some of them are just the Corvette
we're<00:02:57.239> not<00:02:57.329> using<00:02:57.510> them<00:02:57.630> anywhere<00:02:57.870> else<00:02:58.049> as

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
we're not using them anywhere else as

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.720 
we're not using them anywhere else as
well<00:02:58.319> that<00:02:58.890> was<00:02:58.980> another<00:02:59.190> goal<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.549> we

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
well that was another goal that we

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.490 
well that was another goal that we
really<00:03:00.269> pushed<00:03:00.450> an<00:03:00.540> eye<00:03:00.569> push<00:03:00.810> for<00:03:01.079> that<00:03:01.379> we

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
really pushed an eye push for that we

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.869 
really pushed an eye push for that we
had<00:03:01.650> exclusive<00:03:02.250> things<00:03:02.459> for<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.700> Corvette

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
had exclusive things for the Corvette

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.759 
had exclusive things for the Corvette
there's<00:03:03.840> nothing<00:03:04.049> worse<00:03:04.170> than<00:03:04.200> buying<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.650> and

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
there's nothing worse than buying it and

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.140 
there's nothing worse than buying it and
spending<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.099> lot<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.430> money<00:03:05.579> on<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.700> Corvette

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
spending a lot of money on a Corvette

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.610 
spending a lot of money on a Corvette
and<00:03:06.480> then<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.840> see<00:03:07.019> it<00:03:07.079> in<00:03:07.170> something<00:03:07.349> else

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
and then you see it in something else

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.960 
and then you see it in something else
you<00:03:07.860> know<00:03:07.950> even<00:03:08.250> though<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.400> looks<00:03:08.549> great<00:03:08.790> in

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
you know even though it looks great in

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.400 
you know even though it looks great in
that<00:03:09.090> vehicle<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.900> want<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.170> feel<00:03:10.290> that

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
that vehicle you want to feel that

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.229 
that vehicle you want to feel that
you're<00:03:10.590> getting<00:03:10.769> what<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.160> pay<00:03:11.340> for<00:03:11.370> that

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
you're getting what you pay for that

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.089 
you're getting what you pay for that
every<00:03:12.480> Kaizen<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.019> designed<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.799> you've

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
every Kaizen is designed and you've

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.979 
every Kaizen is designed and you've
chosen<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.730> for<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:15.690> was<00:03:15.780> very

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
chosen it for you that was very

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.740 
chosen it for you that was very
important<00:03:16.560> when<00:03:16.950> we<00:03:17.099> set<00:03:17.670> out<00:03:17.819> to<00:03:18.120> design<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
important when we set out to design the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.270 
important when we set out to design the
c7<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.319> really<00:03:19.530> didn't<00:03:19.769> see<00:03:19.799> it<00:03:20.010> as<00:03:20.100> being

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
c7 I really didn't see it as being

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.710 
c7 I really didn't see it as being
fixing<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.209> c6

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
fixing the c6

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.240 
fixing the c6
you<00:03:22.290> really<00:03:22.500> saw<00:03:22.680> this<00:03:22.739> as<00:03:22.920> being<00:03:23.130> a

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
you really saw this as being a

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.160 
you really saw this as being a
transformational<00:03:24.060> opportunity<00:03:24.720> for<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.959> car

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
transformational opportunity for the car

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.319 
transformational opportunity for the car
to<00:03:25.290> really<00:03:25.590> do<00:03:25.739> something<00:03:25.950> new<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:27.180> something

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
to really do something new and something

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.059 
to really do something new and something
different<00:03:27.660> really<00:03:28.019> push<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.380> boundaries<00:03:28.709> and

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
different really push the boundaries and

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.940
