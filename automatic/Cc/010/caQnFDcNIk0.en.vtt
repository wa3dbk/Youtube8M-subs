00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.669
 two 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.809
 these two version 2 is the same as the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.299
 only version that is transparent 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.550
 and little else and I 'll be showing you 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.590
 a little bit of the box so they can see it 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.509
 the box that exists is not that important 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.420
 because it is who has no function 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.460
 below what you may notice though 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.619
 this part of the box has been changed 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.619
 because on 32 occasions 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.900
 dismiss 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:44.670
 and here we show you three modes and that 's 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:44.670
 what are the instructions 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:56.470
 listening because he's not crying a lot 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.629
 Here you can see what the 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.620
 instructions like without doubt the modes 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:05.030
 now it has a code but 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.030
 and here is the code 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.070
 we wanted to show also if 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.260
 They want to see 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.720
 all stress codes can all 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.200
 enter go in and watch the video 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.090
 this gift and tricks is very truthfully not 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.890
 so difficult but it's a bit difficult to 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.890
 get version 2 I really do not know 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.160
 because I got it at 20 dollars in 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.650
 amazon right now and still more 20 copies and 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.560
 on ebay they can get it from 30 to 60 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.540
 dollars varying the prices and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.580
 including the shipping is this for the case 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.540
 I received it with free shipping because I did 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.090
 amazon fine to truth I still do not know how 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.400
 it is said that national but you can save 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.770
 a look has been fine text indeed 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.930
 it's all transparent to me I like that 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.500
 is in a 1 of the product 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.470
 I think that in truth everyone is equal only 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.650
 that transparent plastic and color 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.220
 I think 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.560
 you can see that here 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.240
 games for either the sound or its 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.120
 you put the cartridge quoted him as telling 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.500
 new voices you can see the side 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.050
 from behind inside and when I know 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.050
 you can see the light only 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.220
 I also liked everything, everything is 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.230
 transparent everything green is 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.660
 transparent looks more realistic and ccoo 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.000
 as if we were going to a movie and 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.310
 we would be aggravating with this nice is 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.680
 really fantastic when we go to 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.680
 put him level 1 and this level or not 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.680
 over all the verified voices and all 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.540
 the voices are the same as in version 1 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.950
 in truth there is not much difference if 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.840
 you want to know if you want 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.000
 buy recommends version 1 that 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.000
 It costs 4 dollars less in amazon 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.360
 well these were the sounds of the 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.780
 aliens and now we're going to invoke 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.780
 feedback 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.530
 this is the sound with the plates in the 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.080
 unne 3 with 2 co that are poorly indigenous 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.050
 now we go to second mode 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.000
 the second is the sound and when it does not touch 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.270
 no voter this sound that I do not 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.270
 like 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.320
 good indeed in the way of healing not 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.050
 I'm interested so much though you can 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.050
 make your own music or tell my dream 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.460
 and they go before the only thing that does mode 2 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.960
 we tried mode 303 have to put a 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.880
 cartridge these get from 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.310
 introduction as I was reading the 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.110
 the instructions there can show them 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.110
 a code and we're going to put that code 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.240
 There he is telling you to sell him 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.450
 has a great potential that is 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.050
 talking the creator of thin while 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.180

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.780
 better but if you want 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.380
 We grabbed dolaritos I recommend them to 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.630
