00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.049
 in this block we want to share with you one more report of our 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.030
 Companion Cesar Villagra of that field day of the colony blue water 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.920
 where we talk to the technician of the cooperative aguas who tells us 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.300
 how is the general situation of the cultivation of soy in that area and 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.199
 mainly how soybean rust is affecting that region 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.549
 We share with you this report of Caesar Illiano 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.210
 a torch 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.530
 in some businesses regarding the situation of alarming in the cultivation of 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.950
 soybean with the appearance of the knee that has been propitiated by the 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.330
 favorable climatic conditions for gat 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.440
 tells us a manager of the agricultural sector of the cooperative they are 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.220
 making a wake-up call to the producers 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.700
 to analyze applications in time 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.430
 to control minimize damage caused by rust 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.240
 in age the night conditions at these times are very favorable for 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.620
 that they manifest their fullness 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.300
 and can percent perform their work to the detriment of performance 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.840
 It is a very delicate situation that we are going through in the countryside 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.720
 I honestly believe that from the technical point of view we can 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.140
 consider that in some of the important lots on the surface we are 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.650
 having losses very relevant for late entry 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.590
 with relationship 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.800
 it is worrying 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.310
 people are talking about that the first start of the others themselves 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.920
 we are talking about 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.999
 upside down performance result between three thousand 403 thousand 500 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.010
 that day a normal harvest for us but 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.689
 today the situation is alarming in the sense of 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:20.589
 that the rust is practically doing where center late with 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:24.909
 applications is being a drying out of soy 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.520
 this is worrying 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.840
 because it enters directly 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.940
 to the detriment of performance and of course a significant loss for 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.129
 hectare 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.699
 the living forces for the cultivation of soy in this area was very encouraging 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:45.010
 nowadays the situation has changed a bit with the appearance of the problem 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.329
 our expectations are falling you have to be realistic 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.680
 you have to be realistic because we live in the countryside, day to day was 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.079
 so the reality is that today we have a high presence of rust in soybeans 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.949
 then it is worrying soy rust is a disease of high potential 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:06.489
 sports 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.919
 mainly affects the foliage 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:12.209
 causing premature defoliation of the plant 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.139
 which can be visualized as a reduction in the number of fouls and 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.309
 mainly decrease in the size the weight of the grains 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:23.899
 the thermal one offered some recommendations for the control of this 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:29.279
 important disease well let's be very attentive to the issue of rust 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.519
 between monfort a mind 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.599
 with the sprayers 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.489
 i 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.339
 it's mostly using products 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:43.319
 of high technology to be able to have good results the other master hotel 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.650
 even with the first or second application is falling is falling 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.029
 importantly the residual power of the products that are being used to 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:55.929
 the control 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:57.959
 of the rust is to say that 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.959
 if we entered in twenty-one days today 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.689
 percent and with the second application or with the third application 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.519
 we would be entering 12 hopper that day maximum is shortening the 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.789
 residual powers of the products that we have chosen to control it 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:18.229
 rolle or osalan 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:23.279
 is a preventive control and prior planning is measured 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:25.069
 been developed from the colony 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:28.580
 well we are trying to do 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.000
 percent use the sea in the best way the tool available the 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.570
 application container mainly because the percent rust and its 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:43.759
 attack starts initially starts from downwards of the soy rising towards the 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.009
 upper part 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.770
 quickly if this does not become an application at the exact moment when 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.309
 it has to be done 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:54.530
 that is, the measures 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.370
 preventive normally in the leaves and you can make a fun application 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.759
 anticipate where 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.629
 we could have a residual power or a little longer because ever 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:11.919
 that the soybean sweeper is installed 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.550
 in important severity go 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:19.039
 intensity 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.659
 the residual power of the product either cuts very much because 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.779
 because the product will be working to control 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.779
 percent heavily and not 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.900
 e acting in preventive measure to be able to 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.470
 control what enters
