00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.140
 ok in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:07.140
 the broken spark plugs stand out 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:15.970
 of a 2005 f150 with the 5.4 engine 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.980
 I was making him a saw when I was 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.140
 working on the spark plug number 2 on the side 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.210
 of the passenger 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.250
 it broke 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.820
 look if you can see here is the spark plug 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.820
 ravine 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.540
 this was what stayed inside 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.640
 and it is a problem 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.600
 a very big problem because it stays 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.150
 stuck this inside if they see 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.760
 okay 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.640
 then to make this jale we have 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.680
 what to have 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.090
 a special tool that has to 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.329
 sort your provider 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.159
 tools 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.900
 this tool is not found in 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:06.830
 any renovation in any of this 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.830
 and auto parts 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.360
 this extractor and this extractor are two 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.570
 different 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.620
 this is to take out the piece of metal 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.890
 and this is to take out the white coast 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.790
 what is it called 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.310
 what the spark plug brings in because 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.100
 and the glue is the glue is not 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.400
 this glue is very for sticking like 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.230
 ceramics or ceramics the name of the 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.230
 white plastic ok 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.740
 the first thing we have to do 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.430
 is to put him 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.930
 glue on the tip of then on the in 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.170
 the thin wire 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.900
 it is very good 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.200
 is practically gout when 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.950
 jealousy put it like this 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.950
 in the engine 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.480
 so they practically put it 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.740
 and here is the nut that you know 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.930
 which is for 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.609
 to extract 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.810
 they want it what they were what they were what 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:21.450
 that were until it comes out until it comes out 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.930
 this part 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.930
 okay 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:31.290
 this part has to come here this 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.360
 if you see the glue is for it to stick 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.360
 the ceramic with the metal 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.650
 and what they have battled because if they go 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.720
 to battle to get this this little thing all 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.860
 this ruckus is to avoid removing heads 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.130
 remove you know is jaleen cake 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.930
 it's a problem to show them ok and 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.150
 they can not try to break it because if 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.290
 they want it goes to the piston and for 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.940
 take it out is going to be more problem still ok 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.950
 good and what they have taken in the 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.950
 ceramics grab 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.000
 this will be this tool destinen 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.480
 which is a little too long to do 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.480
 thread 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.070
 then they put it 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.070
 little by little they put 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.360
 the before me 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.770
 or oil so that it is lubricated and not 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.770
 Do not break 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.270
 this is to take out the piece of metal the 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.270
 that goes here 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:51.450
 and when they take out the first west 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.940
 this already taking this work already this 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.640
 it's the easiest because they know what to do 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.260
 screw and pull it so it's easier ok 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.790
 this is the second tool 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.790
 what this 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.590
 when they give him a thread 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.860
 that you no longer because I think that already 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.389
 has about five laps here is the 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.590
 large extractor 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.590
 this is the big extract 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.140
 otherwise you can not after 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:39.230
 that is practically impossible because 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:41.090
 they can break what they can not 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.950
 they do nothing else other than to use 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.770
 the special tool 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.860
 correct tool rather 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.670
 I will continue uploading videos of 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.300
 the questions that you ask me 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:58.389
 I am a mechanic 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.419
 Well I have several years but that's not 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.280
 matter what matters is the practice ok 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:06.220
 I'm going to keep uploading more videos 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.560
 It depends if you like it if I 'm not 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.810
 we stopped 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.820
 Any question any suggestion 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.820
 they can do it to me with all the confidence 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.660
 come out then see you later
