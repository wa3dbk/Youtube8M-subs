00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.960
 technique she 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.380
 do not forgive mistakes if something is done 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.160
 wrong then this error and the price of this 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.460
 mistakes can be high enough this 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.130
 your life and therefore in this video we 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.780
 tell you how on the basis of standard frames 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.660
 the edge can be made light motorcycle 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.040
 then a standard face frame was taken 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.040
 absolutely standard and 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.300
 used in assembling this frame 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:53.980
 Fully company photos 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:57.910
 here is used because the bike 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.480
 Accordingly, this is a steel fork 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.829
 has a large enough entrance 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.570
 respectively 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:14.100
 caliper is used on the sleeve on 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.100
 the wheel on the rim is also moto respectively 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.510
 You can see the thickness of their order there 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.080
 three millimeters 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.260
 disk means 19-inch experience for 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.730
 spoke also moto spokes 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.030
 rubber which is used in yes to 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.830
 this modification she also has a moto 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.680
 speed index t 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.700
 which means speed should not 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.470
 exceed 150 kilometers it is clear that 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.310
 most people ride sports 80 90 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.810
 kilometers but enough of this speed 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.380
 you can already safely ride this 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.920
 rubber 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.900
 on public roads like 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.850
 say that when assembling this one 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.490
 fashion company pelvis garlic is up 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.180
 stress on what's up something they have 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.710
 let's get heavier 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.270
 our views are more reliable 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.210
 brakes are also used here 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.220
 hydraulic from bike can be viewed 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.440
 oil window then all for control 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:25.170
 here everything is provided 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:27.870
 here is the rear suspension on the rear suspension 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.690
 we also use support because 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.750
 bike 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:37.200
 brake disc here 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.090
 scooter 160 millimeters the only thing 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.670
 had to redo due to that 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.950
 which is super wide enough to carry 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.380
 braked the plate in the far left 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.620
 put 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.170
 accordingly the shock absorber stands here 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.160
 300 70 millimeters along the axes 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.190
 from the pit bike well let's say the rest is all 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.980
 we have here use standard a 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.240
 that led the component ie the chain and 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.960
 asterisks and 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.960
 100 millimeters 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.190
 and what batteries do you have? 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.100
 batteries can i put 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.290
 put the battery on this model based on 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.470
 from own experience and own 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:32.320
 needs based on what i have 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.290
 average duration of run is rare 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.170
 more than 50 kilometers I set 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.020
 ordinary folk burgers did not 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.700
 greedy that is put order 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:48.590
 half ampere hours 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.060
 other respectively 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.810
 michael antiquity more than enough 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.810
 if a 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:04:00.800
 batteries on cells 12 months based 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.240
 of 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.060
 cut off about four and a half 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.060
 kilowatt is very good 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.540
 here again the question arises 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.640
 expediency whether such large 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.060
 runs 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.780
 if someone should then we can say so 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.060
 install large batteries 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.070
 tell me about the saddle about luggage 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.260
 which new look you got 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.590
 but made quick detach with 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:37.070
 turning mechanism she is hiding 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.250
 removed and made such a big inside 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.430
 glove box which is also possible 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.990
 use prayer and well for the ACT 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.510
 own needs or there are some 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.510
 carry small things accordingly 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.430
 and the trunk is also a carry handle 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:02.300
 convenient enough made specially 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:04.170
 its small well to say from 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.730
 enable feature 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:12.030
 sheets on it 2 people we think that 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:15.670
 ride together on such a technique 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.510
 it is wrong and even dangerous therefore 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:23.320
 we try as if people who will 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.880
 can our technology still protect on 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.690
 who is about the speed calculated 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.730
 apparatus and load capacity apparatus 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.770
 zealous for speeds up to 100 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:36.200
 kilometers hour dragon picking 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.620
 and whether it is generally based on 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.620
 came 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.360
 their conditions which now exist on 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.230
 the market and those rules of the road 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.610
 which now 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.889
 the manufacturer does not give for like 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.310
 arrange 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.280
 decision and 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.409
 kilometers an hour 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.369
 are an exception 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.369
 because 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.500
 various 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.270
 and their relationship. quite different 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.669
 carry as responsible for 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.039
 untrained people no what 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.259
 manufacturer 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:19.669
 you exceptions with how would stand 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:20.529
 This unit is given on my cheeks 150 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:25.370
 gram 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:27.550
 the pentagon when more than got 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.490
 was painted 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.520
 she paint 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.520
 and 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.380
 visual 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.960
 the flow of oncoming cars, respectively 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:41.440
 make this spike more noticeable in 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.300
 dark on the road bright 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.990
 tell and here as well as contributes 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.250
 security 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.250
 movement strike
