00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.409
 Grade of Art Lovers of Learners Super this school for 3 to 8 years 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:00.709
 and then, among other things, as Karin, you also learn how to support vegetables and fruit 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.949

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:24.780
 something here 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.840
 and if they're scared of it all day, they have to 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.230
 Not 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.650
 if anywhere on the ship there are delicious fruits cereal food or something 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.990
 delicious cocktails 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.970
