00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello this video I want to show but 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.330
 is-8 3 beta 4 which came out yesterday for 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.940
 developers and for public 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.250
 testing exactly want to show 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.540
 work speed and on device 3 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.540
 so let's get started 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:26.460
 first check the speed 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:29.970
 spotlight and as you can see completely 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.540
 animation is not very well compared to 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:41.970
 previous versions of ios 8 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:43.610
 better see bang as it appears 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.550
 the panel then disappears 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.219
 it was in previous versions as well 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.879
 we'll see more 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.879
 emoji keyboard 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.820
 Now try setting behind 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.820
 change our wallpaper 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.550
 Also we will go in the update to 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:18.810
 showed it with 83 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:22.119
 and go to the wallpaper 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.600
 for we would always have problems remember how 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.920
 updated on c7 there it is very signed on 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.650
 ios 8 also freezes 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:38.100
 but now try to change the wallpaper well 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.100
 interchange on something such example 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.470
 As you can see, she thinks not very quickly, but everything 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.350
 same typo3 him for three years now 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.350
 then gvp well let's see how it works 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.179
 the chains are more or less normal 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:32.710
 principle of new wait and typo3 already 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:36.940
 not the topic because the device is already like 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.680
 three years is the last with which 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.930
 it comes out in principle 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.030
 the developers probably finished everything 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:48.220
 could already like you lived the last bitch 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.500
 from this device so now for one in 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.920
 safari we test the speed of the safari 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.830
 how it will be loaded and so on 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.830
 so let's lay down eurosport he's heavy 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.530
 Now matter how smooth yet 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.069
 describe did not plunge well a little bit 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:24.920
 podlagivaet as you can see then on the other 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:24.920
 some apple 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.090
 like everything is fine now for example 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.849
 our tab 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.180
 cafe or hangs there now let's go in 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:42.290
 Siri Siri as you remember went out with 8 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.060
 tibet 2 vs 8 tibet 4 all for some reason she 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.090
 did not give birth it say that the mood is dumber 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.560
 and some requests are badly processed 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.510
 has become 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:56.720
 then ask a couple of inert questions 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:59.870
 in front of the village this is what I managed to find in 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:05.239
 internet on request hello questions 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:08.470
 i say hello to you tell me please 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.470
 weather for today 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:15.980
 Here is the forecast for this script inside 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.829
 authorities see some problems 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:25.970
 It appeared that she was on some discounts 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:28.570
 start like your mood that's what i like 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:34.729
 managed to find on the internet on request as 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:36.350
 where's the nearest mcdonalds and so here's what 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.820
 I managed to find on the Internet on request 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:44.000
 where is the nearest mcdonalds in general here 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.600
 so here the network works with 8 and it's like 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.020
 you can try a brief overview 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.729
 build publicly beta ios 8 3 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.880
 try it yourself after so see 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:05:02.150
 the speed of the animation of this battery 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:03.650
 and scroll through 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.120
 scrolling more or less normal 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.290
 work smoothly opening folders 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.310
 also more or less normal but with 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:17.200
 first opening 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:17.200
 like sid podlagivaet then 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.969
 let's say music is still the rest 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:34.219
 I donâ€™t see applications to launch 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.219
 example camera can be run but 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:40.830
 more or less it starts quickly 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.569
 our main applications are 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:47.129
 loaded it is just always 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:50.129
 freezes or safari crashes principle 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:52.770
 The speed from Tanya is also normal and 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:55.620
 the main thing is not noticed when the example 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:59.999
 out of 8 there it was noticeable that everything 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:06.960
 signed the animation still try 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:10.710
 then multitasking you want more 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:17.279
 less work see speed 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:20.009
 screen rotation in this 5 all as 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:21.839
 see the heat on goes like in 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:23.669
 comparison with the previous about it and nothing 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:27.270
 did not change in speed 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:30.569
 the animations are not as essentially new 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.310
 some changes also they did not lead in 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:34.319
 In general, all the basics complain that 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.229
 Syria has become worse work and so in 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:39.810
 In principle, I have nothing particularly noticeable and 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:43.219
 so the conclusion would also like to say something 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:46.139
 what is not if you are a user with 6 or 7 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:49.379
 as if when the final version comes out 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:52.439
 83 when you should upgrade already 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:55.830
 that there will be a Russian siri and a lot 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:58.169
 all sorts of other features as well if you sit 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:01.589
 On this, as if you must go 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:02.939
 I need to upgrade and weight 83 when she 

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:07.379
 come out because 

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:10.330
 compared to s7 s8 3 

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:12.939
 works very very well 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:16.169
 and if this video was useful for you 

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:16.169
 husky thank you for your attention
