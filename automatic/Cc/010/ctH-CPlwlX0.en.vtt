okay the main difference is that it has
what's<00:01:23.759> called<00:01:23.850> their<00:01:24.119> air<00:01:24.359> induction<00:01:24.749> system

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
what's called their air induction system

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.349 
what's called their air induction system
okay<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.219> air<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.729> travel<00:01:27.119> from<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
okay so air is going to travel from the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
top here and it's all an open cavity

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.309 
top here and it's all an open cavity
right<00:01:30.060> here<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.479> air<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.749> going<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.990> funnel

right here that air is going to funnel

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.440 
right here that air is going to funnel
right<00:01:31.859> through<00:01:32.100> here<00:01:32.369> again<00:01:32.759> these<00:01:33.210> things

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
right through here again these things

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.749 
right through here again these things
this<00:01:33.659> uses<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.200> EPP<00:01:34.829> technology<00:01:35.579> that

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
this uses the EPP technology that

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.989 
this uses the EPP technology that
expanded<00:01:36.359> polypropylene<00:01:37.369> for<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.520> padding

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999
