screen<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.799> protected<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> flap<00:01:53.759> is

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
screen is protected and the flap is

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.080 
screen is protected and the flap is
staying<00:01:54.479> closed<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.280> apple<00:01:56.610> case<00:01:56.790> this

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
staying closed like the apple case this

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.690 
staying closed like the apple case this
case<00:01:57.329> does<00:01:57.600> double<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> stand<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:59.280> has<00:01:59.430> two

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
case does double as a stand it has two

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.880 
case does double as a stand it has two
more<00:01:59.939> snaps<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.630> back<00:02:00.960> there<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.770> you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
more snaps on the back there that you

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.670 
more snaps on the back there that you
simply<00:02:02.130> flip<00:02:02.610> open<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.270> then<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.320> flip<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
simply flip open and then you flip the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.249 
simply flip open and then you flip the
cover<00:02:04.920> around<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.969> case<00:02:06.180> lines<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.750> into

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
cover around and the case lines up into

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.369 
cover around and the case lines up into
a<00:02:07.290> stand<00:02:07.890> very<00:02:08.640> similar<00:02:09.030> angle<00:02:09.390> again<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
a stand very similar angle again to the

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.440 
a stand very similar angle again to the
apple<00:02:10.739> case<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.610> keep<00:02:11.819> comparing<00:02:12.180> this<00:02:12.390> to

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
apple case and I keep comparing this to

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.790 
apple case and I keep comparing this to
the<00:02:12.720> apple<00:02:12.959> case<00:02:13.050> because<00:02:13.319> i<00:02:13.379> think<00:02:13.440> is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the apple case because i think is

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.860 
the apple case because i think is
very<00:02:13.920> similar<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.400> design<00:02:14.520> it's<00:02:15.300> very<00:02:15.420> slim

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
very similar in design it's very slim

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.260 
very similar in design it's very slim
very<00:02:16.410> form-fitting<00:02:17.070> just<00:02:17.490> like<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.910> apple

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
very form-fitting just like the apple

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.300 
very form-fitting just like the apple
case<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.690> have<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.140> say<00:02:19.380> though<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.560> do<00:02:19.710> like<00:02:20.130> it

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
case I have to say though I do like it

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.450 
case I have to say though I do like it
much<00:02:21.000> more<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:22.020> think<00:02:22.410> it's<00:02:22.530> better<00:02:22.710> looking<00:02:23.250> it

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
much more I think it's better looking it

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.640 
much more I think it's better looking it
seems<00:02:23.730> more<00:02:23.940> durable<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.900> material<00:02:25.380> feels

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
seems more durable the material feels

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.040 
seems more durable the material feels
better<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.250> hand<00:02:26.490> as<00:02:26.760> well<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.780> that's<00:02:27.960> how

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
better in the hand as well so that's how

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.540 
better in the hand as well so that's how
you<00:02:28.140> use<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.320> in<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> stand<00:02:28.860> can't<00:02:29.430> really

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
you use it in the stand can't really

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.490 
you use it in the stand can't really
adjust<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.210> angle<00:02:30.360> too<00:02:30.810> much<00:02:30.990> you<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.410> move

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
adjust the angle too much you can move

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.440 
adjust the angle too much you can move
it<00:02:31.650> around<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:32.010> little<00:02:32.040> bit<00:02:32.520> but<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.120> likes<00:02:33.330> to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
it around a little bit but it likes to

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.630 
it around a little bit but it likes to
kind<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.750> stay<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.110> one<00:02:34.470> position<00:02:34.980> as<00:02:35.190> I

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
kind of stay in that one position as I

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.240 
kind of stay in that one position as I
said<00:02:35.880> very<00:02:36.240> similar<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.840> apple<00:02:37.350> case<00:02:37.980> you

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
said very similar to the apple case you

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.830 
said very similar to the apple case you
can<00:02:38.400> see<00:02:38.550> kind<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.880> viewing<00:02:39.300> angle<00:02:39.660> there

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
can see kind of the viewing angle there

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.480 
can see kind of the viewing angle there
prop<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.530> up<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.740> little<00:02:40.860> bit<00:02:41.070> so<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.280> can<00:02:41.340> see

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
prop it up a little bit so you can see

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.630 
prop it up a little bit so you can see
it's<00:02:42.090> kind<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.300> seated<00:02:42.690> back<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.290> little<00:02:43.500> bit<00:02:43.740> so

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
it's kind of seated back a little bit so

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.980 
it's kind of seated back a little bit so
once<00:02:44.820> you're<00:02:44.970> done<00:02:45.120> with<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.540> stand<00:02:45.810> you

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
once you're done with the stand you

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.500 
once you're done with the stand you
simply<00:02:46.290> flap<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.680> down<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.300> snap<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.330> back

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
simply flap it down and snap it back

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.290 
simply flap it down and snap it back
shot<00:02:49.200> again<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.190> can<00:02:50.280> close<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:50.670> top<00:02:50.880> as<00:02:51.120> well

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
shot again you can close the top as well

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.170 
shot again you can close the top as well
keep<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.320> snap<00:02:52.680> closed<00:02:53.160> as<00:02:53.670> far<00:02:53.850> as<00:02:53.970> using

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
keep that snap closed as far as using

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.490 
keep that snap closed as far as using
all<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.540> ports<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.050> buttons<00:02:55.320> and

cut out there for the 30-pin dock
connector<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.970> then<00:03:00.090> it's<00:03:00.210> got<00:03:00.360> kind<00:03:00.510> of

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
connector and then it's got kind of

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.780 
connector and then it's got kind of
three<00:03:00.930> pinhole<00:03:01.500> cutouts<00:03:01.950> for<00:03:02.100> your<00:03:02.310> speakers

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790

headset jack kind of have to make sure
that<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.140> mic<00:03:22.380> there<00:03:22.650> gets<00:03:23.250> lined<00:03:23.550> up<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:24.150> can

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
that the mic there gets lined up you can

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.729 
that the mic there gets lined up you can
see<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.510> was<00:03:24.600> kind<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:24.989> buried<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.380> little<00:03:25.470> bit

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
see it was kind of buried a little bit

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.500 
see it was kind of buried a little bit
but<00:03:26.010> there's<00:03:26.489> enough<00:03:26.700> play<00:03:27.000> in<00:03:27.060> there<00:03:27.330> that

the mic to you know come through the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.240 
the mic to you know come through the
case<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:33.150> I'm<00:03:33.780> not<00:03:33.959> sure<00:03:34.020> that<00:03:34.380> this<00:03:34.709> case<00:03:35.010> at

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
case so I'm not sure that this case at

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.060 
case so I'm not sure that this case at
ninety<00:03:35.820> dollars<00:03:36.080> offers<00:03:37.080> you<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.530> much<00:03:37.800> more

ninety dollars offers you that much more

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.740

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
than some of the other cases like it

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.960 
than some of the other cases like it
that<00:03:39.930> are<00:03:40.050> a<00:03:40.080> little<00:03:40.290> bit<00:03:40.590> less<00:03:40.830> expensive<00:03:41.580> it

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
that are a little bit less expensive it

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.000 
that are a little bit less expensive it
is<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.270> very<00:03:42.480> nice<00:03:42.660> case<00:03:42.959> don't<00:03:43.320> get<00:03:43.440> me<00:03:43.560> wrong<00:03:43.739> I

is a very nice case don't get me wrong I
like<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.820> slimness<00:03:45.390> of<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.959> lot<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:47.130> one

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
like the slimness of it a lot it's one

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.030 
like the slimness of it a lot it's one
of<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.670> slimmest<00:03:48.150> cases<00:03:48.600> on<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:49.200> market<00:03:49.590> yet

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
features with the ability to keep the

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.000 
features with the ability to keep the
flap<00:03:53.760> close<00:03:54.060> as<00:03:54.360> well<00:03:54.570> as<00:03:54.750> use<00:03:55.020> it<00:03:55.170> as<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.350> stand

so<00:03:56.700> is<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.090> worth<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.360> ninety<00:03:57.600> dollars<00:03:57.720> in<00:03:58.440> my

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
so is it worth a ninety dollars in my

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.110 
so is it worth a ninety dollars in my
opinion<00:03:58.980> it's<00:03:59.220> one<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.520> better<00:03:59.670> cases

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
opinion it's one of the better cases

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.160 
opinion it's one of the better cases
around<00:04:00.360> if<00:04:00.600> you're<00:04:00.720> looking<00:04:00.959> for<00:04:00.989> a

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.560 
around if you're looking for a
slim-fitting<00:04:02.100> case<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:03.000> doubles<00:04:03.239> as<00:04:03.510> a

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
slim-fitting case that doubles as a

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.680 
slim-fitting case that doubles as a
stand<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.470> would<00:04:04.860> say<00:04:05.040> yes<00:04:05.220> it's<00:04:05.489> worth<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:05.940> you
