feel that sorta it's doing this almost

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.459 
feel that sorta it's doing this almost
pulsating<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.359> me<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.050> people<00:01:01.379> who<00:01:01.440> are

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
pulsating and me so people who are

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.900 
pulsating and me so people who are
sensitive<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.039> mean<00:01:02.190> I'm<00:01:02.309> quite<00:01:02.550> sensitive

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
sensitive I mean I'm quite sensitive

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.230 
sensitive I mean I'm quite sensitive
probably<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:05.760> way<00:01:05.880> I've<00:01:06.000> lived

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
probably because of the way I've lived

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.820 
probably because of the way I've lived
like<00:01:06.570> organic<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.290> things<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.740> you

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
like organic and things like that so you

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.320 
like organic and things like that so you
tend<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.220> more<00:01:08.369> sensitive<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.880> radical

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
tend to be more sensitive to radical

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.359 
tend to be more sensitive to radical
things<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.070> buzzing

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
things but it's just it's just a buzzing

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.740 
things but it's just it's just a buzzing
and<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.760> actually<00:01:11.880> feel<00:01:12.240> almost<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.659> a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
and I can actually feel almost like a

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.100 
and I can actually feel almost like a
pulse<00:01:13.080> coming<00:01:13.350> from<00:01:13.560> them<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.920> they<00:01:17.070> odd<00:01:17.159> noise

so they were supposed to be kind of
no-go<00:01:55.770> area<00:01:56.130> which<00:01:56.219> gets<00:01:56.460> more<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.729> more

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
no-go area which gets more and more

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.039 
no-go area which gets more and more
attractive
