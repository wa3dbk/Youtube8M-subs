00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.660
 let's prepare our ice creams myself 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:17.300
 I have a banana here but very mature 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:20.300
 this is going to give sweetness to the ice cream and 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.460
 the strawberries a recommendation is that 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.130
 when they see it their strawberries do not take away 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.110
 the leaves because if you take away 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.410
 the leaves before washing it will enter 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.379
 water in the strawberry and also loses 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:38.360
 vitamins so they are washed first and 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:42.160
 then they are used once washed with the 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.160
 little leaf then the leaves are removed 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.719
 I have put my 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.930
 fresita and now I'm going to put the 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.930
 raspberries 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.079
 and now 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.850
 I'm going to add the yogurt so everyone is 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.900
 chop together 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.540
 look these are the yogurts that prepare 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.710
 in the yogurt maker and look how it has been 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.710
 very creamy 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.160
 if you have seen my videos they will realize 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.880
 that was so creamy because milk 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.880
 quite 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.640
 milk powder 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.020
 If I had not put milk powder 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.020
 I would have remained liquid 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.170
 now we are going to chop everything all our 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.170
 fruits 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.479
 Well, I 've been beaten 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.929
 as puree now I'm going to pass it on to 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.929
 molds 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.780
 I have these molds that I bought from 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.780
 silicone and now I'm going to throw here 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.700
 do not forget to remove the sticks 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.850
 that is but very rich 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:17.540
 portman and by 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.540
 but to fill the molds 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.270
 and I've left all this full for 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.270
 everywhere 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.310
 now it will be my turn to clean 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.500
 the dump that I left here 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.870
 Well now I'll just have to put this and 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.510
 clean them 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.460
 these evils are very easy to clean 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:53.330
 very easy to take out then the ice cream 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.330
 already frozen 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.790
 so if you can buy this kind of 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.790
 molds is very good
