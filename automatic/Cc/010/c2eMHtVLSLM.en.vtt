00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.670
 I 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.469
 or did you say national with armani in the 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.480
 arch street medina burillo and days a 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.940
 change in the central pair after 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.820
 later I would be baloy and mejía 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:23.050
 in front of them macnelly german uribe and 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.180
 an angel 4-2-2-2 very marked team 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.040
 of osorio the return of germán the 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.570
 return of chairman and the intention from 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.070
 the protagonist of the directive very 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.899
 complicated this and also that what 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.970
 complicated again in each well the arch 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.040
 Arboleda correa maturana y rodríguez 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.170
 fantastic maturana blankets and a good 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.710
 I work so if choronta aguirre 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:46.110
 gómez and quiñones and the curo cuts in that 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.110
 false position 'nine' false 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.000
 referred long from 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.540
 here that good gentlemen bullet plucked 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.540
 the party 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:04.070
 and attention that there are three players left 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:07.400
 out of action action and a serve 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.560
 of a band of things you do not want anymore 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.369
 national long does not mean that 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.860
 come back to nobody and if you see Germanic 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.899
 it was at minute 18 and the 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.580
 incredible account 3 player goes for a 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.229
 ball and the three are out of action 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.850
 things that one can not believe in a 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.590
 team from your osorio team and a lot 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.899
 less played geographic teams 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.880
 he is long if they are teams that pass 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.070
 quickly the transitions here of 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.229
 front came out well cadavid very well but 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.810
 the road cuts the canal to the painting 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.820
 double 9 not because I was going uribe and Juan Pablo 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.840
 angel up there and hits him to hit 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.119
 in the face 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.039
 equally sitting for me to 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.030
 give them away and to finish the last 30 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.700
 minutes we think that was the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.520
 strategy macnelly macnelly auction that 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.110
 he liked this manuel ball and 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.119
 that as you saw in the graph that 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.619
 we presented 4 dwindling was double 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.899
 hitch conserve chairman shot by 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.179
 magnetic left more freedom though 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.350
 in addition it was thrown also to the center 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.760
 is it so 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.860
 open but he also played for 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.900
 in very good position of ball like 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.050
 always from this team and also that 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.729
 plays well that is like nationally known 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.620
 and here ends up saving it and 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.209
 after a great football play with 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.830
 this team like soccer for the 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.270
 minute creators of national and the best 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.310
 is to dictate windows agree all the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.630
 football sessions that we show when 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.250
 he lost with Tolima that he had played well 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.930
 and it is very good and sometimes you lose 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.340
 you gain attention with this because what 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.620
 they gave as a skirt you saw the 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.690
 Assistant in the upper part 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.270
 yon gonzález that raised the players 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.270
 of national pararon authorized points 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.910
 but after the start raised the flag 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.110
 the referee is wrong because the 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.380
 National players can only 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.390
 stop when they do not have to retract 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.190
 do not interact will be in no time 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.140
 never gave the norm the long advantage to the 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.880
 sale city player does not have to 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.130
 stop does not have to for sure I 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.080
 they found the flag and stopped 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.489
 clear but the only one that can stop the 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.760
 game is the central referee and that's what 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.290
 you have to know a clear advantage 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.209
 granted he did well points after 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.100
 threw back good and ends up failing 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.040
 in the qualification 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.730
 if it is maintained it surely does not lose 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.530
 qualification but when I assume the 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.020
 responsibility was a difficult decision 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.140
 end up supporting your partner but 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.360
 it's cheap and aguirre ends with that 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.780
 it is difficult to maintain sanity when 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.510
 follow if not unless we know that when 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.950
 aguirre fails a goal does not want to fail 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.960
 the referee on horseback and maybe he does not want 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.810
 fail but failure came the play 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.030
 next a shot to the area and a 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.500
 bad then remember that national 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.150
 lost in a quiet ball the game 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.040
 against grass but I do not know if it's a bad 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.440
 clear a wrong positioning an evil 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.450
 I think that movement has reached 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.100
 mejía and there are two men and I do not understand 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.690
 why are you jumping with the player 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.850
 more important in football to him and the 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.410
 central where they are are those that have 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.600
 that answer for that area seems to me not 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.820
 the game is over they gave five minutes 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.760
 for everything that happened the goal nullified a 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.210
 hit of uribe this move had it 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.210
 medina 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.890
 stephen medina who played as a center 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.650
 when the game started in the second 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.660
 time it happened to be lateral exit street was 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.400
 good and here is all national athletic 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:20.050
 had about 10 15 minutes where 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:23.060
 He inclined the court angel Rodriguez and 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:26.060
 rodrigo medina playing well from lateral 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.470
 see how it overflows by playing with 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.510
 more meliá inward chairman than 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.830
 he received chairman that goes cheats very well 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.200
 is always 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.940
 macnelly magné smooth still and uribe not 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.170
 he has fortune he did everything athletic 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.540
 national to tie the match 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.220
 take off with the beginnings played very well 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.050
 they arrived very well here played well 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.240
 atlantic national not in its doors what 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.220
 better here I hold it it 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.460
 Yes good was already Duke is that it has 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.440
 entered the pitch by angel the 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.090
 ball that falls there to macnelly intense 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.490
 win the wache brother and the friend was from 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.720
 first hand of one everything had 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.430
 athletic national to tie the 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.340
 party came this lawyer of chairman 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.050
 najera head and is tied there the 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.240
 best time in national I said is going to 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.220
 go over it will continue there crowned 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.900
 not the mountain prize was coming 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.110
 pedaling pedaling 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.300
 merits to tie and equal ties 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.520
 now for the very good return the 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.560
 tracks again and sir then one 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.320
 he says good he's arrived now he has to 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.090
 go down and win the fraction continued 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.240
 attacking a good sherman match 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.240
 Cardenas 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.520
 the owner after the injury and 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.560
 it was coming little by little it came very 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.870
 behind the center waves at the last 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.000
 I got fourth point I stand 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:46.580
 it serves 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.650
 national I have not passed the play 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.450
 of the duke who invents fighting not 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.400
 changing leg touching for way 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.290
 and very stuck players were missing open 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.580
 the court all around the center and 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.230
 we ended up being desperate 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.120
 By sending, remember please go well 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.270
 pressure work of itagüí not joined 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.050
 well or well stuck he did what he had to 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.820
 do 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.820
 national had two men inside 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.060
 mosquera like a magnet in front of the 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.040
 ball was practically all 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.930
 athletic national is not opinion is the 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.850
 delivery one billion stays hand in hand 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.820
 hand in hand and there is no backup there is no 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.960
 backing away from the center marker 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.390
 the second marker 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.540
 who is watching appear one arrive today 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.880
 they are living great great definition our 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.840
 measure and najera does not reach the 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:36.220
 speed enters a guy so there's virtue 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.220
 total we show 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.740
 it never makes it national that it seemed that 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.950
 I was going to recover that came from behind 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:48.840
 appeared the quality of the great 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.840
 New time missions for more
