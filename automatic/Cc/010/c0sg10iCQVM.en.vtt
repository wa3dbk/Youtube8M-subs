00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
building out like that and then I'm just

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.980 
building out like that and then I'm just
gonna<00:01:04.559> keep<00:01:04.710> repeating<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.810> doing

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
way over to here and just keep doing the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:20.240 
way over to here and just keep doing the
same<00:01:11.310> thing<00:01:11.760> over<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:13.020> over<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:19.560> count<00:01:19.979> I

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
same thing over and over the count I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.080 
same thing over and over the count I
have<00:01:20.549> no<00:01:20.759> idea<00:01:21.030> what<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> count<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.540> probably

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
have no idea what the count is probably

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.200 
have no idea what the count is probably
like<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:25.369> honestly<00:01:26.369> don't<00:01:26.549> know<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.970> won't<00:01:27.150> be

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
like I honestly don't know I won't be

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.330 
like I honestly don't know I won't be
able<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.450> figure<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.320> right<00:01:28.650> now<00:01:28.829> but

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
able to figure that out right now but

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.460 
able to figure that out right now but
just<00:01:29.579> keep<00:01:30.270> building<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.020> until<00:01:31.409> you

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
just keep building like this until you

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.100 
just keep building like this until you
get<00:01:31.650> everything<00:01:31.860> done<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.520> know<00:01:32.659> it's<00:01:33.659> like

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
get everything done you know it's like

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.050 
get everything done you know it's like
just<00:01:34.290> look<00:01:34.799> over<00:01:34.979> eventually<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> see<00:01:35.820> when

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
just look over eventually to see when

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.690 
just look over eventually to see when
you<00:01:36.180> match<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.590> that's<00:01:37.590> fine<00:01:37.829> just<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.579> go

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
you match up that's fine just you can go

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.670 
you match up that's fine just you can go
over<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.939> little<00:01:39.060> bit<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.350> connect

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
over a little bit you can just connect

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.300 
over a little bit you can just connect
at<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.009> end<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.549> doesn't<00:01:42.090> really<00:01:42.240> matter<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.330 

yeah<00:01:51.380> okay<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.649> see<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.100> just

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
yeah okay and you see and you just

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.580 
yeah okay and you see and you just
connect<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.700> right<00:01:53.850> though<00:01:54.090> well<00:01:54.960> crap<00:01:55.320> I

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
connect it right though well crap I

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.690 
connect it right though well crap I
don't<00:01:56.520> have<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> pickaxe<00:01:57.259> everyone<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.890> it

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
don't have a pickaxe everyone and it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.669 
don't have a pickaxe everyone and it
should<00:02:00.240> look<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:00.540> that

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
should look like that

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.740 
should look like that
just<00:02:03.310> make<00:02:03.490> sure<00:02:03.520> both<00:02:03.909> sides<00:02:03.939> are<00:02:04.329> matching

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
just make sure both sides are matching

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.889 
just make sure both sides are matching
up<00:02:04.929> and<00:02:05.109> all<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:05.409> and<00:02:06.420> then<00:02:07.420> when<00:02:07.659> you<00:02:07.750> do

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
up and all that and then when you do

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.369 
up and all that and then when you do
that<00:02:07.929> just<00:02:08.440> start<00:02:08.769> on<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.039> inside<00:02:10.379> building

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
that just start on the inside building

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.290 
that just start on the inside building
on<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.590> inside<00:02:11.950> like<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.760> know<00:02:12.970> and

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
on the inside like that you know and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:34.530 
on the inside like that you know and
then<00:02:14.550> that's<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:30.629> yeah<00:02:31.629> just<00:02:32.080> keep<00:02:33.540> just

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
then that's it and yeah just keep just

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.740 
then that's it and yeah just keep just
keep<00:02:34.660> building<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.680> like<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:36.760> got<00:02:37.660> my

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
keep building and like that I got my
