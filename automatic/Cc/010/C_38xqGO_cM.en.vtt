technology NFC technology uses chips
that<00:00:42.149> are<00:00:42.210> inside<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> base<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> amiibo

probably<00:00:51.289> how<00:00:52.289> many<00:00:52.559> more<00:00:52.739> times<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.190> scan

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
probably how many more times can I scan

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.910 
probably how many more times can I scan
my<00:00:53.520> favorite<00:00:54.030> amiibo<00:00:54.390> well<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:55.649> now<00:00:55.739> you're

not<00:00:56.010> gonna<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.430> worry<00:00:56.610> about<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:57.230> but

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
not gonna have to worry about it but

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.950 
not gonna have to worry about it but
maybe<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.530> year<00:00:58.859> or<00:00:58.980> two<00:00:59.100> down<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.340> line<00:00:59.960> the

maybe a year or two down the line the

maybe a year or two down the line the

scans<00:01:08.270> ok<00:01:09.270> ok<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> know<00:01:09.900> you're<00:01:10.320> probably

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
scans ok ok I know you're probably

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.160 
scans ok ok I know you're probably
really<00:01:10.860> relieved<00:01:11.310> right<00:01:11.610> now<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.930> so

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
really relieved right now or not so

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.950 
really relieved right now or not so
relieved<00:01:13.500> either<00:01:14.070> way<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.610> decided<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.689> put<00:01:15.869> it

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
relieved either way I decided to put it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.499 
relieved either way I decided to put it
to<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.170> test<00:01:16.490> not<00:01:17.490> scanning<00:01:17.909> them<00:01:18.150> over<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
to the test not scanning them over and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.090 
to the test not scanning them over and
over<00:01:18.720> again<00:01:18.810> because<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.560> would<00:01:19.740> take<00:01:19.830> far

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
over again because that would take far

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.700 
over again because that would take far
too<00:01:20.130> long<00:01:20.450> but<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.479> calculating<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> amount

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
too long but just calculating the amount

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.899 
too long but just calculating the amount
of<00:01:22.799> time<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.159> would<00:01:23.250> take<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> average

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
of time it would take for the average

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.429 
of time it would take for the average

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
amiibo to run dry for this test we're

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.750 
amiibo to run dry for this test we're
using<00:01:28.710> Super<00:01:29.159> Smash<00:01:29.280> Bros<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.750> example

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
using Super Smash Bros as the example

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.900 
using Super Smash Bros as the example
if<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.330> want<00:01:33.510> to<00:01:33.600> scan<00:01:33.840> your<00:01:34.020> amiibo<00:01:34.820> into<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
if you want to scan your amiibo into the

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.910 
if you want to scan your amiibo into the
games<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> match<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:37.140> would<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.380> one<00:01:37.590> skin

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
games for a match that would be one skin

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.280 
games for a match that would be one skin
and<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:39.210> scan<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.630> out<00:01:39.720> later

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and to scan it out later

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.940 
and to scan it out later
that'll<00:01:40.710> be<00:01:40.830> two<00:01:41.040> skins<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.990> let's<00:01:43.740> say<00:01:43.890> you

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
that'll be two skins so let's say you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.310 
that'll be two skins so let's say you
use<00:01:44.220> your<00:01:44.370> amiibo<00:01:44.730> twice<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> day<00:01:45.360> that'll<00:01:46.200> be

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
use your amiibo twice a day that'll be

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.100 
use your amiibo twice a day that'll be
four<00:01:46.590> scans<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.510> first<00:01:48.690> time<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.050> a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
four scans so for the first time in a

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.500 
four scans so for the first time in a
while<00:01:49.280> we're<00:01:50.280> gonna<00:01:50.400> be<00:01:50.580> using<00:01:50.730> math<00:01:51.120> all

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
while we're gonna be using math all

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.270 
while we're gonna be using math all
right<00:01:52.670> second<00:01:53.670> grade<00:01:53.850> math<00:01:54.060> at<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:55.280> hold

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
right second grade math at that but hold

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.070 
right second grade math at that but hold
your<00:01:56.340> horses

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
your horses

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.590 
your horses
so<00:01:58.080> take<00:01:58.530> 10,000<00:01:59.190> divided<00:01:59.670> by<00:01:59.850> four<00:02:00.120> what<00:02:00.510> does

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
so take 10,000 divided by four what does

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.670 
so take 10,000 divided by four what does
that<00:02:00.690> give<00:02:00.870> you<00:02:02.120> 2,500<00:02:03.470> okay

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
that give you 2,500 okay

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.180 
that give you 2,500 okay
there's<00:02:04.860> 365<00:02:05.850> days<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.300> year<00:02:06.920> assuming<00:02:07.920> you

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
there's 365 days in a year assuming you

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.030 
there's 365 days in a year assuming you
use<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.580> amiibo<00:02:08.880> everyday<00:02:09.750> scanning<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:10.830> four

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
use the amiibo everyday scanning it four

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.650 
use the amiibo everyday scanning it four
times<00:02:11.690> it'll<00:02:12.690> last<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.050> around<00:02:13.310> 6.8<00:02:14.310> years

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
times it'll last you around 6.8 years

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.690 
times it'll last you around 6.8 years
keep<00:02:15.660> in<00:02:15.810> mind<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.710> last<00:02:16.950> smash<00:02:17.310> game

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
keep in mind that the last smash game

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.960 
keep in mind that the last smash game
came<00:02:18.390> out<00:02:18.570> seven<00:02:18.990> years<00:02:19.320> ago<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.760> got<00:02:20.940> a

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
came out seven years ago so you got a

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.690 
came out seven years ago so you got a
point<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.570> your<00:02:21.810> gap<00:02:22.110> right<00:02:22.350> there<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:23.400> not

point to your gap right there of not

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.850
