this<00:00:04.560> is<00:00:05.100> pretty<00:00:05.400> common<00:00:05.670> it<00:00:06.629> is

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
this is pretty common it is

this is pretty common it is
differential<00:00:07.560> signaling<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.130> watch<00:00:08.910> the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
differential signaling so watch the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.250

signals from the source to load so how

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.920 
signals from the source to load so how
does<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.309> look<00:00:50.460> let<00:00:50.820> me<00:00:50.850> pause<00:00:51.390> scroll<00:00:51.899> down

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
does it look let me pause scroll down

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.010 
does it look let me pause scroll down
and<00:00:52.199> draw<00:00:53.870> this<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.050> how<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.289> looks<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.739> have<00:00:56.100> a

in<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.329> case<00:02:00.630> we're<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.909> this

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
in this case we're going to have this

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.679 
in this case we're going to have this
transistor<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:04.399> this<00:02:05.399> transistor<00:02:05.460> turned<00:02:06.450> on

transistor and this transistor turned on

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.990 
transistor and this transistor turned on
so<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.710> current<00:02:08.129> will<00:02:09.000> come<00:02:09.860> down<00:02:10.860> here<00:02:11.400> out

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
so the current will come down here out

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.520 
so the current will come down here out
here

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
here

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.110

here<00:02:14.040> come<00:02:14.610> back<00:02:15.510> here<00:02:15.930> back<00:02:16.620> here<00:02:17.060> back<00:02:18.060> here

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.940 
here come back here back here back here
back<00:02:18.540> here<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.650> come<00:02:19.830> down<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:21.319> 3.5<00:02:22.319> mm<00:02:22.380> so

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
back here and come down to the 3.5 mm so

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.680 
back here and come down to the 3.5 mm so
V<00:02:23.700> out<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.360> going<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.110> be<00:02:27.110> plus<00:02:28.760> 0.35<00:02:29.760> volts

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690

V out is going to be plus 0.35 volts

output is going to be minus 0.35 volts
you<00:02:56.540> convince<00:02:57.540> yourself<00:02:57.900> that's<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.170> case<00:02:58.550> so

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
you convince yourself that's a case so

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.949 
you convince yourself that's a case so
this<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.730> pretty<00:02:59.880> simple<00:03:00.150> it's<00:03:00.540> just<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.810> way<00:03:00.930> to

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
this is pretty simple it's just a way to

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.410 
this is pretty simple it's just a way to
toggle<00:03:01.620> back<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:01.950> forth<00:03:02.160> between<00:03:03.060> these

signaling<00:03:11.160> is<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.580> our<00:03:12.080> load<00:03:13.080> here<00:03:13.319> is<00:03:13.470> low

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680

impedance<00:03:14.030> rather<00:03:15.030> than<00:03:15.239> high<00:03:15.420> impedance<00:03:15.720> but

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170

the<00:03:16.500> cables<00:03:17.160> are<00:03:17.900> pairs<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:19.110> cables<00:03:19.260> maybe

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
the cables are pairs of cables maybe

the cables are pairs of cables maybe
twisted<00:03:20.190> pairs<00:03:20.370> maybe<00:03:20.760> not<00:03:21.470> but<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.769> is<00:03:23.280> as

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
twisted pairs maybe not but it is as

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
the other and there you're not comparing

you're comparing one signal to one
return<00:03:34.579> alright<00:03:35.579> so<00:03:35.970> this<00:03:36.090> is<00:03:36.180> pretty<00:03:36.269> simple

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
return alright so this is pretty simple

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.880 
return alright so this is pretty simple
but<00:03:36.930> we<00:03:37.019> do<00:03:37.140> want<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.350> failsafe

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
but we do want to failsafe

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.500 
but we do want to failsafe
and<00:03:38.130> there<00:03:38.370> often<00:03:38.519> will<00:03:38.760> be<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.910> failsafe<00:03:39.150> in

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
and there often will be a failsafe in

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.509 
and there often will be a failsafe in
case<00:03:39.570> something<00:03:40.049> goes<00:03:40.079> wrong<00:03:40.320> let<00:03:41.250> me<00:03:41.310> just

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
case something goes wrong let me just

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.300 
case something goes wrong let me just
pause<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.060> draw<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.750> out<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.290> scroll<00:03:43.799> down

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.069 

these<00:03:47.310> are<00:03:47.370> two<00:03:47.910> pretty<00:03:48.209> common<00:03:48.540> solutions

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
these are two pretty common solutions

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.500 
these are two pretty common solutions
here<00:03:49.500> there's<00:03:49.829> just<00:03:49.890> some<00:03:50.700> resistances

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
here there's just some resistances

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.220 
here there's just some resistances
between<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.820> 3.3<00:03:53.820> volt<00:03:54.680> rail<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:56.040> ground<00:03:56.850> and

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
between the 3.3 volt rail and ground and

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.099 
between the 3.3 volt rail and ground and
often<00:03:58.230> r1<00:03:59.220> will<00:03:59.790> be<00:04:00.000> equal<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.510> about<00:04:00.720> four

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
often r1 will be equal to about four

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:06.500 
often r1 will be equal to about four
point<00:04:01.410> two<00:04:01.620> kilo<00:04:02.579> ohms<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:04.040> r2<00:04:05.060> will<00:04:06.060> be<00:04:06.090> equal

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
point two kilo ohms and r2 will be equal

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.390 
point two kilo ohms and r2 will be equal
to<00:04:06.660> two<00:04:06.840> point<00:04:07.079> five<00:04:07.350> kilo<00:04:07.920> ohms<00:04:08.190> and

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
to two point five kilo ohms and

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.710 
to two point five kilo ohms and
basically<00:04:08.700> we<00:04:08.910> want<00:04:09.060> this<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.299> pull<00:04:09.510> the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
basically we want this to pull the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.770 
basically we want this to pull the
system<00:04:10.019> up<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.320> logic<00:04:10.859> high<00:04:11.269> in<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.420> case<00:04:12.570> of

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
a failure in another example it's very

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.630 
a failure in another example it's very
