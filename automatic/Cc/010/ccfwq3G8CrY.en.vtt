another<00:00:42.930> group<00:00:43.200> they<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.469> got<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> placebo

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
another group they just got a placebo

another group they just got a placebo
and<00:00:44.690> they<00:00:45.690> put<00:00:46.620> these<00:00:46.739> guys<00:00:46.950> through<00:00:47.010> an

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and they put these guys through an

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.630 
and they put these guys through an
eight-week<00:00:47.820> weight<00:00:48.660> lifting<00:00:48.989> program<00:00:49.640> and

eight-week weight lifting program and
what<00:00:50.789> they<00:00:50.910> found<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> fenugreek

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
what they found out on the fenugreek

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.619 
what they found out on the fenugreek
group<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.730> they<00:00:53.879> increase<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:54.510> bench

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
group is that they increase your bench

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.279 
group is that they increase your bench
press<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.230> have<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> 15<00:00:56.160> pounds<00:00:56.820> and

press but I have the 15 pounds and

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.470 
press but I have the 15 pounds and
here's<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> killer<00:00:58.559> one<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.039> hundred<00:00:59.910> pounds

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
here's the killer one a hundred pounds

here's the killer one a hundred pounds
on<00:01:00.600> their<00:01:00.780> leg<00:01:00.989> press<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.710> they<00:01:02.699> reduced

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
on their leg press and they reduced

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.160 
on their leg press and they reduced
their<00:01:03.539> body<00:01:04.019> fat<00:01:04.439> by<00:01:05.070> six<00:01:05.460> times<00:01:06.110> compared<00:01:07.110> to

their body fat by six times compared to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.070 
their body fat by six times compared to
the<00:01:07.409> placebo<00:01:07.799> group<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:09.390> know<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the placebo group you know this was a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.640 
the placebo group you know this was a
dramatic<00:01:10.790> improvements<00:01:12.140> some<00:01:13.140> interesting

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
dramatic improvements some interesting

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.620 
dramatic improvements some interesting
some<00:01:14.070> other<00:01:14.220> interesting<00:01:15.030> studies<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.509> were

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
some other interesting studies that were

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.649 
some other interesting studies that were
done<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:16.080> fenugreek<00:01:16.680> was<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.580> uh<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:18.090> also

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
done on fenugreek was that uh I also

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.120 
done on fenugreek was that uh I also
chose<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.170> increase<00:01:20.009> insulin<00:01:20.670> sensitivity

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
chose to increase insulin sensitivity

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.039 
chose to increase insulin sensitivity
which<00:01:23.130> means<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.850> they're<00:01:24.600> getting<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
which means that they're getting the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.200 
which means that they're getting the
sugar<00:01:25.320> out<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.770> blood<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.310> into<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
sugar out of the blood and into the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.260 
sugar out of the blood and into the
cells<00:01:27.540> which<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.680> want<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.820> how<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.060> may

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
cells which what you want and how it may

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.679 
cells which what you want and how it may
help<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.659> diabetes<00:01:31.790> also<00:01:32.790> helps<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.540> get<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
help with diabetes also helps to get the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.469 
help with diabetes also helps to get the
sugar<00:01:33.990> into<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.380> mussel<00:01:34.829> shells<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.850> which<00:01:36.299> is

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
sugar into the mussel shells so which is

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.190 
sugar into the mussel shells so which is
really<00:01:36.509> good<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.400> if<00:01:38.549> you're

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
really good it's a you know if you're

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.350 
really good it's a you know if you're
also<00:01:40.200> shown<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.920> people<00:01:41.460> who<00:01:41.640> were<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.329> know

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
also shown like people who were you know

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.389 
also shown like people who were you know
doing<00:01:42.689> bodybuilding<00:01:43.110> they'll<00:01:43.649> take<00:01:43.829> insulin

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
doing bodybuilding they'll take insulin

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.020 
doing bodybuilding they'll take insulin
to<00:01:45.240> help<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:46.110> more<00:01:46.710> sugar<00:01:46.979> into<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.430> cells<00:01:47.549> so

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to help get more sugar into the cells so

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.030 
to help get more sugar into the cells so
they<00:01:48.149> could<00:01:48.329> work<00:01:48.420> out<00:01:48.659> harder<00:01:49.110> suppose<00:01:49.860> I

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
they could work out harder suppose I

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.120 
they could work out harder suppose I
think<00:01:50.520> that's<00:01:50.670> what<00:01:50.850> they<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.130> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
think that's what they do that for and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.460 
think that's what they do that for and
also<00:01:53.490> here's<00:01:54.360> an<00:01:54.509> interesting<00:01:54.750> study<00:01:55.140> they

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
also here's an interesting study they

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.760 
also here's an interesting study they
gave<00:01:56.000> fenugreek<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.689> obese<00:01:58.140> mice<00:01:58.770> oh<00:02:00.740> who<00:02:01.740> are

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
gave fenugreek to obese mice oh who are

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.399 
gave fenugreek to obese mice oh who are
drinking<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.460> lot<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.670> alcohol<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:04.020> actually

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
drinking a lot of alcohol and actually

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.280 
drinking a lot of alcohol and actually
found<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.799> there<00:02:05.149> they<00:02:06.149> prevented<00:02:06.719> alcohol

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
found that there they prevented alcohol

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.410 
found that there they prevented alcohol
or<00:02:07.469> liver<00:02:07.860> damage<00:02:08.129> by<00:02:08.670> drinking

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
or liver damage by drinking

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.960 
or liver damage by drinking
by<00:02:09.539> taking<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.929> fenugreek<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.970> they

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
by taking this fenugreek and they

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.970 
by taking this fenugreek and they
believe<00:02:12.210> this<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.569> from<00:02:12.780> because<00:02:13.770> the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
believe this is from because the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.260 
believe this is from because the
fenugreek<00:02:14.370> took<00:02:14.700> out<00:02:14.880> some<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.209> the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
fenugreek took out some of the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.360 
fenugreek took out some of the
triglycerides<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.290> fatty<00:02:16.560> acid<00:02:17.100> in<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.940> liver

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
triglycerides is fatty acid in the liver

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.640 
triglycerides is fatty acid in the liver
it<00:02:20.370> also<00:02:20.520> helped<00:02:21.090> uh<00:02:21.270> here's<00:02:22.080> another<00:02:22.350> fun

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
it also helped uh here's another fun

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.610 
it also helped uh here's another fun
study<00:02:22.920> they<00:02:23.670> took<00:02:24.300> rats<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.080> see<00:02:25.260> how<00:02:25.410> long

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
study they took rats and see how long

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.770 
study they took rats and see how long
they<00:02:25.860> could<00:02:26.040> swim<00:02:26.670> for<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.270> know<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:27.630> they're

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
they could swim for I know if they're

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.840 
they could swim for I know if they're
trying<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.110> drown<00:02:28.410> them<00:02:28.770> but<00:02:29.430> they<00:02:29.520> found<00:02:29.670> that

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
trying to drown them but they found that

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.350 
trying to drown them but they found that
one<00:02:30.090> -<00:02:30.360> who<00:02:30.810> ate<00:02:30.930> more<00:02:31.200> on<00:02:31.410> fenugreek<00:02:32.400> or<00:02:32.760> took

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
one - who ate more on fenugreek or took

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.280 
one - who ate more on fenugreek or took
this<00:02:33.510> fenugreek<00:02:34.140> supplement<00:02:35.900> were<00:02:36.900> able<00:02:37.260> to

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
this fenugreek supplement were able to

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.550 
this fenugreek supplement were able to
swim<00:02:37.500> longer<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:39.300> also<00:02:39.569> increase<00:02:39.989> they

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
swim longer and also increase they

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.430 
swim longer and also increase they
believe<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:40.950> made<00:02:41.489> because<00:02:42.020> maybe<00:02:43.020> because

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
believe this made because maybe because

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.640 
believe this made because maybe because
they<00:02:43.790> increased<00:02:44.790> their<00:02:45.000> fatty<00:02:45.360> acid<00:02:45.989> usage

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
they increased their fatty acid usage

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.840 
they increased their fatty acid usage
they're<00:02:47.250> able<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.580> burn<00:02:47.850> off<00:02:48.000> more<00:02:48.030> fat<00:02:48.680> also

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
they're able to burn off more fat also

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.530 
they're able to burn off more fat also
there's<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.940> chemical<00:02:51.800> called<00:02:52.800> glycol<00:02:53.610> -<00:02:54.269> man

triglycerides which I just mentioned and

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.550 
triglycerides which I just mentioned and
it<00:03:44.160> increases<00:03:44.670> 8co<00:03:45.420> so<00:03:45.720> this<00:03:45.930> is<00:03:46.049> really<00:03:46.410> good

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
it increases 8co so this is really good

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.520 
it increases 8co so this is really good
for<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.829> heart<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:48.079> also<00:03:49.079> they<00:03:49.230> did<00:03:49.410> an

increases breast milk by a lot actually

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.409 
increases breast milk by a lot actually
too<00:04:28.289> much<00:04:28.470> some<00:04:28.800> women<00:04:29.160> were<00:04:29.490> Tommy<00:04:29.699> that<00:04:30.180> they

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
then I put a big handful of fenugreek
