this teeny little coffee pot which
obviously<00:00:13.440> didn't<00:00:13.710> do<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.889> job<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:15.020> I'll<00:00:16.020> show

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.260 
obviously didn't do the job so I'll show
you<00:00:16.230> how<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.500> start<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.369> hole<00:00:17.580> here<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:17.820> first<00:00:18.150> I

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
you how I start the hole here so first I

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.380 
you how I start the hole here so first I
use<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.449> quarter<00:00:19.140> inch<00:00:19.350> drill<00:00:19.939> to<00:00:20.939> put<00:00:21.150> two

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
use a quarter inch drill to put two

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.460 
use a quarter inch drill to put two
holes<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:22.289> here<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.369> then<00:00:23.789> I've<00:00:24.420> enlarged<00:00:25.140> it

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
holes in here and then I've enlarged it

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.950 
holes in here and then I've enlarged it
with<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.810> nibbler

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
with a nibbler

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.169 
with a nibbler
and<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.130> hole<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.460> now<00:00:29.580> big<00:00:29.849> enough<00:00:29.880> that

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
and so that hole is now big enough that

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.790 
and so that hole is now big enough that
I<00:00:30.240> can<00:00:30.359> get<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> saw<00:00:30.720> blade<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.199> there<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.710> I'm

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
I can get a saw blade in there and I'm

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.380 
I can get a saw blade in there and I'm
going<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.009> use<00:00:32.130> my<00:00:32.279> reciprocating<00:00:32.910> saw<00:00:33.090> to

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
going to use my reciprocating saw to

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.630 
going to use my reciprocating saw to
open<00:00:34.140> up<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> rest<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.680> hole<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:35.070> have

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
open up the rest of the hole I have

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.780 
open up the rest of the hole I have
stuck<00:00:36.450> my<00:00:36.890> hardware<00:00:37.890> wire<00:00:38.100> down<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.579> there<00:00:38.760> so

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
stuck my hardware wire down in there so

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.990 
stuck my hardware wire down in there so
now<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.149> forms<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.690> basket<00:00:40.550> which<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.670> can<00:00:41.820> put

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
using as these pine wood shavings and I

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.060 
using as these pine wood shavings and I
only<00:00:54.840> used<00:00:55.050> about<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.289> third<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.860> fill<00:00:56.010> up

gallon<00:01:30.659> filter<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:32.430> I'm<00:01:32.610> gonna<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.909> driving

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
gallon filter and I'm gonna be driving

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.460 
gallon filter and I'm gonna be driving
this<00:01:33.509> with<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:34.079> small<00:01:34.530> air<00:01:35.520> mattress<00:01:35.970> pump<00:01:36.470> and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
this with a small air mattress pump and

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.319 
this with a small air mattress pump and
what<00:01:37.619> I've<00:01:37.740> done<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.159> I've<00:01:38.310> rigged<00:01:38.579> myself<00:01:39.119> a

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
what I've done is I've rigged myself a

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.120 
what I've done is I've rigged myself a
dimmer<00:01:39.930> control<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.979> actually

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
dimmer control here so I can actually

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.950 
dimmer control here so I can actually
control<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.790> speed

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.050 

and<00:01:51.010> nothing<00:01:52.010> gonna<00:01:52.130> be<00:01:52.280> burning<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.580> gas<00:01:52.820> out

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
and nothing gonna be burning the gas out

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.840 
and nothing gonna be burning the gas out
here<00:01:53.270> at<00:01:53.330> this<00:01:53.450> end<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.860> don't<00:01:55.370> know<00:01:55.520> how<00:01:55.700> it's

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
here at this end so don't know how it's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.190 
here at this end so don't know how it's
gonna<00:01:55.940> work<00:01:56.090> but<00:01:56.540> I'm<00:01:56.690> gonna<00:01:56.840> light<00:01:57.080> her<00:01:57.170> up

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
gonna work but I'm gonna light her up

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.090 
gonna work but I'm gonna light her up
and<00:01:57.410> see<00:01:57.530> what<00:01:57.560> happens

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
and see what happens

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.280 
and see what happens
been<00:01:58.940> burning<00:01:59.060> for<00:01:59.420> about<00:01:59.480> half<00:01:59.870> an<00:02:00.020> hour<00:02:00.140> now

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
been burning for about half an hour now

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.210 
been burning for about half an hour now
and<00:02:00.850> I<00:02:01.850> think<00:02:01.910> it's<00:02:02.270> burning<00:02:03.170> very<00:02:03.410> cleanly<00:02:03.890> as

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
and I think it's burning very cleanly as

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.730 
and I think it's burning very cleanly as
near<00:02:04.520> as<00:02:04.550> I<00:02:04.729> can<00:02:04.790> tell

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.710 

rather<00:02:07.920> than<00:02:11.060> dude<00:02:12.060> there<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.390> still<00:02:12.599> that

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
rather than dude there is still that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.150 
rather than dude there is still that
stick<00:02:13.020> in<00:02:13.170> there<00:02:13.440> but<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.739> can<00:02:13.860> see<00:02:14.040> it's

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
stick in there but you can see it's

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.540 
stick in there but you can see it's
burning<00:02:15.260> quite<00:02:16.260> nicely<00:02:16.620> there<00:02:17.099> that's<00:02:17.400> just

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
burning quite nicely there that's just

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:29.700 
burning quite nicely there that's just
to<00:02:17.670> keep<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:18.030> fire<00:02:18.239> going

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.860 

you'll<00:02:30.490> be<00:02:30.580> working<00:02:30.730> just<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.510> show<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:31.750> can

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
you'll be working just to show you can

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.240 
you'll be working just to show you can
get<00:02:31.960> useful<00:02:32.140> amount<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.620> energy<00:02:32.920> out<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.130> this

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
get useful amount of energy out of this

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.670 
get useful amount of energy out of this
thing<00:02:33.460> I'm<00:02:33.640> gonna<00:02:33.720> put<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:34.840> tan<00:02:35.140> over<00:02:35.410> here

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
thing I'm gonna put this tan over here

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:57.880 
thing I'm gonna put this tan over here
we're<00:02:35.920> gonna<00:02:36.930> boil<00:02:37.930> little<00:02:38.260> water<00:02:38.470> here

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.340 

getting

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
getting

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:09.460 
getting
will<00:03:00.710> not<00:03:00.890> energy<00:03:01.340> out<00:03:01.460> of<00:03:01.490> this<00:03:01.730> thing

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:37.460 

can't<00:03:10.010> even<00:03:10.100> see<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.370> brain

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.300 

after<00:03:38.370> about<00:03:38.580> an<00:03:38.730> hour<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.860> seemed<00:03:41.190> to

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
after about an hour the it seemed to

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.220 
after about an hour the it seemed to
shut<00:03:41.580> itself<00:03:41.940> off<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.780> didn't<00:03:42.990> seem<00:03:43.080> like

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
shut itself off and it didn't seem like

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.500 
shut itself off and it didn't seem like
we're<00:03:43.410> getting<00:03:43.590> very<00:03:43.800> much<00:03:43.980> flow<00:03:44.310> through<00:03:44.790> so

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
we're getting very much flow through so

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.390 
we're getting very much flow through so
I<00:03:45.540> shut<00:03:46.170> down<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.530> reactor<00:03:46.890> by<00:03:47.040> putting<00:03:47.310> a

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
I shut down the reactor by putting a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.670 
I shut down the reactor by putting a
tile<00:03:47.670> on<00:03:47.880> there<00:03:48.320> and<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.530> was<00:03:49.650> just<00:03:49.860> inspecting

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
tile on there and I was just inspecting

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.080 
tile on there and I was just inspecting
what's<00:03:52.680> going<00:03:52.920> on<00:03:53.040> here<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:53.400> this<00:03:53.520> is<00:03:53.700> a<00:03:53.730> stick

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
what's going on here so this is a stick

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.350 
what's going on here so this is a stick
that<00:03:54.720> was<00:03:54.870> inside<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.790> plastic<00:03:56.790> tube<00:03:56.970> here

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
that was inside the plastic tube here

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.540 
that was inside the plastic tube here
and<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.470> looks<00:03:58.620> pretty<00:03:58.830> clean<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.490> doesn't

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
and it looks pretty clean it doesn't

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.220 
and it looks pretty clean it doesn't
look<00:03:59.760> like<00:03:59.910> there's<00:04:00.150> any<00:04:00.360> tar<00:04:00.570> on<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.200> I

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
look like there's any tar on it so I

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.330 
look like there's any tar on it so I
think<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.800> tar<00:04:02.460> wise<00:04:02.640> we<00:04:02.880> probably<00:04:03.090> did<00:04:03.390> okay

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
think that tar wise we probably did okay

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.570 
think that tar wise we probably did okay
and<00:04:06.410> there<00:04:07.410> was<00:04:07.530> some<00:04:07.740> moisture<00:04:07.890> coming<00:04:08.370> out

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
and there was some moisture coming out

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.920 
and there was some moisture coming out
here<00:04:08.790> in<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:08.940> pump<00:04:09.210> and<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.450> pump<00:04:09.480> looks<00:04:09.840> like

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
here in the pump and the pump looks like

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.930 
here in the pump and the pump looks like
it's<00:04:10.080> got<00:04:10.230> some<00:04:10.260> gunk<00:04:10.890> in<00:04:11.100> it<00:04:11.900> so<00:04:13.850> not<00:04:14.850> exactly

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
it's got some gunk in it so not exactly

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.180 
it's got some gunk in it so not exactly
sure<00:04:15.420> what<00:04:15.450> that's<00:04:16.200> about<00:04:16.470> I'll<00:04:16.830> have<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:17.040> take

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
sure what that's about I'll have to take

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.599 
sure what that's about I'll have to take
it<00:04:17.310> apart<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:17.670> see<00:04:17.790> what's<00:04:17.820> going<00:04:18.150> on<00:04:19.609> because

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
it apart and see what's going on because

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.510 
it apart and see what's going on because
I've<00:04:20.850> taken<00:04:21.060> apart<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.570> fan<00:04:21.900> here<00:04:22.290> and<00:04:22.520> quite

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
I've taken apart the fan here and quite

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.150 
I've taken apart the fan here and quite
clearly<00:04:23.790> there<00:04:24.000> was<00:04:24.120> some<00:04:24.500> tar<00:04:25.500> getting<00:04:25.890> into

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
clearly there was some tar getting into

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.830 
clearly there was some tar getting into
the<00:04:26.310> fan<00:04:26.550> I'm<00:04:26.970> not<00:04:27.000> sure<00:04:27.300> whether<00:04:27.450> that<00:04:27.690> was

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
the fan I'm not sure whether that was

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.770 
the fan I'm not sure whether that was
during<00:04:28.140> a<00:04:28.200> startup<00:04:28.560> process<00:04:28.850> or<00:04:29.850> whether<00:04:30.720> that

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
during a startup process or whether that

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.590 
during a startup process or whether that
came<00:04:31.170> from<00:04:31.670> previous<00:04:32.670> runs<00:04:33.030> because<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.450> was

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
came from previous runs because I was

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.600 
came from previous runs because I was
using<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.930> old<00:04:34.140> hose<00:04:35.660> but<00:04:37.370> that's<00:04:38.370> what's

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
using the old hose but that's what's

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.920 
using the old hose but that's what's
happening<00:04:39.060> with<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.300> fan<00:04:39.480> here<00:04:39.690> I<00:04:39.720> think

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
happening with the fan here I think

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.930 
happening with the fan here I think
that's<00:04:40.080> what<00:04:40.260> probably<00:04:41.100> ultimately<00:04:41.280> stopped

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
that's what probably ultimately stopped

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.100 
that's what probably ultimately stopped
it<00:04:42.120> my<00:04:42.840> flare<00:04:43.169> tube<00:04:43.470> dropped<00:04:43.830> out
