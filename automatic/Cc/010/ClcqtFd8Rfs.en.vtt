launching l-drago the are controlled up
the<00:01:20.189> tornado<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:22.280> anyways<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:24.049> guess<00:01:25.049> I'll

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the tornado one anyways I guess I'll

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:36.710 
the tornado one anyways I guess I'll
just<00:01:25.470> look<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.400> now<00:01:26.790> I'll<00:01:27.479> open<00:01:27.689> it

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:53.240 

this<00:01:37.720> would<00:01:37.870> take<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.080> little<00:01:38.230> bit<00:01:38.380> long<00:01:47.730> so

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.980 

anyways<00:01:54.250> we<00:01:54.700> got<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.000> tornado<00:01:55.390> tab<00:01:55.690> and

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
anyways we got the tornado tab and

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.440 
anyways we got the tornado tab and
Durango<00:01:56.920> which<00:01:57.370> looks<00:01:57.730> amazing

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
Durango which looks amazing

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.500 
Durango which looks amazing
I<00:01:59.220> think<00:02:00.220> they're<00:02:00.310> kind<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.640> copying<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.330> one

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
I think they're kind of copying the one

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.240 
I think they're kind of copying the one
from<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.900> 40<00:02:02.200> series<00:02:02.550> code<00:02:04.620> finally<00:02:05.620> no

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
from the 40 series code finally no

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.520 
from the 40 series code finally no
