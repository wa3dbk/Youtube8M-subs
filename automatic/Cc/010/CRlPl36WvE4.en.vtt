00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
here how do you treat breakage now of

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.639 
here how do you treat breakage now of
course<00:00:33.420> most<00:00:33.719> stylists<00:00:34.200> will<00:00:34.320> talk<00:00:34.500> about

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
course most stylists will talk about

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.889 
course most stylists will talk about
cutting<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.489> hair<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.969> if<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.600> really

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
cutting the hair and if it's really

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.530 
cutting the hair and if it's really
damaged<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.160> important<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.760> cut<00:00:39.420> it

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
damaged that is important to do cut it

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.080 
damaged that is important to do cut it
first<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:40.379> if<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:40.980> if<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.550> enough

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
first it's if it's if it's a enough

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.760 
first it's if it's if it's a enough
where<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.600> kind<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.960> camouflage<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.620> and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
where you can kind of camouflage it and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.680 
where you can kind of camouflage it and
keep<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> length<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.460> hair<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:45.149> Whitney's<00:00:45.539> I

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
keep the length of hair like Whitney's I

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.600 
keep the length of hair like Whitney's I
don't<00:00:45.840> have<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.020> go<00:00:46.140> too<00:00:46.200> short<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.430> keep

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
don't have to go too short you can keep

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.150 
don't have to go too short you can keep
it<00:00:47.730> there<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.360> cutting<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.989> hair<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.410> key<00:00:49.860> so

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
it there but cutting the hair is key so

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.299 
it there but cutting the hair is key so
getting<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.239> good<00:00:51.510> instrum<00:00:52.140> every<00:00:52.800> four<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
getting the good instrum every four to

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.790 
getting the good instrum every four to
six<00:00:53.340> weeks<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.030> important<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.559> what's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
six weeks is important that is what's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.770 
six weeks is important that is what's
gonna<00:00:55.949> stop<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.730> breakage<00:00:56.969> because<00:00:57.360> what

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
gonna stop the breakage because what

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.869 
gonna stop the breakage because what
happens<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.680> hair<00:00:58.890> strand<00:00:59.219> splits<00:00:59.609> at<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
happens is the hair strand splits at the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.479 
happens is the hair strand splits at the
end<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.809> moves<00:01:01.140> up<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.590> Strand<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
end and it moves up the Strand of the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.310 
end and it moves up the Strand of the
hair<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.329> called<00:01:03.690> they<00:01:03.930> had<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.170> break

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
hair and it is called they had to break

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.289 
hair and it is called they had to break
off<00:01:04.530> at<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.860> point<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.580> want<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.820> trim<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
off at that point you want to trim the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.539 
off at that point you want to trim the
hair<00:01:06.479> nice<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.200> clean<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:08.010> continues<00:01:08.430> to

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
hair nice and clean and it continues to

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.550 
hair nice and clean and it continues to
grow<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.210> Whitney<00:01:09.510> has<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> typical<00:01:09.930> breakage

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
grow so Whitney has the typical breakage

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.320 
grow so Whitney has the typical breakage
most<00:01:10.830> women<00:01:11.130> experience<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.909> lot<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.060> breakers

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
most women experience a lot of breakers

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.940 
most women experience a lot of breakers
around<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> hairline<00:01:13.020> which<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.590> could<00:01:13.740> see

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
around the hairline which you could see

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.390 
around the hairline which you could see
here<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:15.080> around<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> nape<00:01:16.560> area<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
here and around the nape area in the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.429 
here and around the nape area in the
back<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.240> reason<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.409> because

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
back now the reason for that is because

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.920 
back now the reason for that is because
this<00:01:20.159> area<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.630> more

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
this area that can can be the more

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.440 
this area that can can be the more
coarse<00:01:22.530> textures<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.520> hair<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.090> you

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
coarse textures of hair and you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.390 
coarse textures of hair and you
sometimes<00:01:24.810> kind<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.350> go<00:01:25.500> over<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.040> over<00:01:26.220> it

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
sometimes kind of go over it over it

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.010 
sometimes kind of go over it over it
when<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.610> flat<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.270> heat<00:01:27.450> down<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.869> just

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
when you flat on and heat down it just

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.630 
when you flat on and heat down it just
to<00:01:28.409> get<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.650> maximum<00:01:28.890> amount<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.310> straighten

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
to get that maximum amount of straighten

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.460 
to get that maximum amount of straighten
as<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.939> want<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.869> cause<00:01:31.049> breakage

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
as that you want that can cause breakage

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.340 
as that you want that can cause breakage
you<00:01:31.799> see<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:32.520> those<00:01:32.820> short<00:01:33.150> pieces<00:01:33.450> all

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
you see here those short pieces all

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.020 
you see here those short pieces all
throughout<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.159> really<00:01:35.430> focused<00:01:35.909> on

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
throughout but it's really focused on

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.940 
throughout but it's really focused on
the<00:01:36.090> back<00:01:36.360> area<00:01:36.689> here<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.020> there's<00:01:37.500> no<00:01:37.590> need

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
the back area here so there's no need

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.440 
the back area here so there's no need
