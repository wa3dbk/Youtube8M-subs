00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.450
 I hope you like the truth that 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.369
 I've been trying for a while

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.740
 let's start with the special is going to be 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 some questions and answers that I 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.640
 you have been sending you and the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.699
 questions are going to make my name 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.770
 that is here with me and so we're going to 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.860
 start let's start with the first 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.750
 nothing asks what is your true 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.060
 name and how much nation and the question 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.860
 Ramon Valdez, well, it 's my real 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.230
 name is for now pressured to say it 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.030
 because channel I started it with focus 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.770
 and the truth that I think was very 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.900
 important so much so that when you carry a 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.010
 little more time maybe I'll say it and 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.010
 I am 20 years old 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.969
 and says that when and how many years 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.390
 you started on youtube 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:04.960
 Well, I started with 19 years old, I think yes and 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.330
 I started about 9 or 8 months ago I think 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.460
 was for February or March I'm not very 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.820
 safe 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.390
 and that I have right now 20 and I started with 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.869
 19 Natalia asks us what you started in 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.030
 Youtube 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.119
 Well, I started the truth because to me 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.520
 I like to play played 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.920
 habitually and the truth that I started to 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.369
 watch videos and I said why I'm not going to upload 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.780
 also my video playing my matches 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.220
 so you can see it since I 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.990
 I had a great time playing and I say 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.970
 maybe people also have fun 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.010
 commenting me and I play 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.990
 1,037 asks you how you came up with the 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.640
 name of the souk, well, the name of the 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.160
 I know the truth that is a story 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.000
 quite curious because to me the music 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.270
 favorite of mine is the rap I like 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.520
 a lot and good I do about three or four 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.810
 years I think I came up with this name 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.310
 since I sang songs like that then 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.930
 I said to see if I had to have 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.300
 an artistic number like it has a lot 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.150
 people of what my name would be I do not know and it 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.580
 the souk happened to me and the truth was that 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.550
 quite pretty funny and I like it 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.770
 pretty so more than anything it was because 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.170
 that left the villa 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.180
 says that youtube is inspired by 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.730
 when commenting on play 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.340
 Well, the first youtubers that I 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.920
 willy saw were racks and vegeta 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.770
 blonde I started to go watching videos of 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.090
 willis light because I found videos like this 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.440
 of the blondes 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.849
 I do not know william and let's see how it's done 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.440
 this because I was when minecraft 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.720
 he does not know how something is done then 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.750
 they look for it in youtube and I saw that it appeared 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.180
 his name then I started watching a video 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.250
 and more than anything because of there I said oysters 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.220
 if these people do this and the 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.110
 People like I say because I can not 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.519
 do and also and I say good because I'm going to 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.940
 try to see if people also get 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.990
 have fun with what I do 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.910
 doodle asks about four questions 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.190
 we started with the first one that saw the 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.390
 pause of the channel good as the pause of 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.640
 channel 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.720
 have enough reasons because one of 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.480
 it was that the computer broke 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.800
 and I lost the world of the second season 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.070
 I lost a lot of files and the truth 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.230
 that bothered me a lot since I had a 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.940
 a lot of things and I got a little pissed but 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.850
 well more than anything was also due to 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.850
 that overwhelms me a little with the fact 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.830
 that the channel was growing little by little 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.630
 I wanted it to grow faster for 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.090
 that had more people in me 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.610
 said 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.310
 giving me comments giving me advice and 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.190
 see more like by the effort I saw I did 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.349
 for the videos because it cost a little and 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.990
 It makes me very nervous at the beginning 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:55.330
 Well, that was more than anything 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.310
 the next question how long 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.530
 think I followed youtube without abandoning 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.550
 completely the channel good to follow 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.790
 on youtube I would like to continue 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.129
 many years 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.099
 but if I had to abandon it, it would be 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:11.180
 because I do not know imagine that from here to 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:14.329
 three months the channel is very slow 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.400
 I feel overwhelmed or it no longer entertains me so much 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.449
 no longer entertains you what is it 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.229
 What matters most to me to entertain you 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:25.180
 you every time I walk and I think that 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.180
 for me it would be a very long time 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.880
 if it could be a youtube of these which 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.060
 would be 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.229
 willy vegetable net blond or standing 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.449
 Well, some of these honestly 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:42.440
 willy rex or the blond willis is why 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.390
 because will wright started from below and 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.360
 it started 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.080
 uploading videos and the truth that was 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.389
 very well 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.449
 and he's going up I think there are two or 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.639
 three years or something like daily video the 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.139
 true that that saw it with much merit 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.539
 the truth because upload a daily video 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.479
 it is quite complicated and more had 12 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:06.599
 channels as it goes up in a channel and in 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.550
 another one and I think that has a lot of 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.800
 complication and I think that it curra 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.259
 pretty good to have two 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.389
 channels or the blonde stopped to a 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:19.439
 person that the truth that I love 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:22.020
 as he says how is the truth that 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.310
 I fall very very well is very has to 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.319
 see a lot with my personality because I 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.030
 I'm also pretty much like doing many 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.259
 nonsense what happens here many 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.629
 Sometimes I'm nervous when it comes to 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.360
 comment but I think that one of those 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:35.370
 two the last question this topic in 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.280
 youtube as a hobby or try more as 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.690
 work or future of work because youtube 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.699
 at the moment I had it as a hobby as 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.789
 to entertain you and parente 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:47.219
 to have a friend so I would like 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.750
 like a job yes yes I would like to have 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:51.780
 like work but it's quite complicated 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.270
 since youtube requires 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.250
 a lot of effort and a lot of dedication and 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.470
 I do not know if I would become like 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.410
 a future of work since you have to 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.750
 get very very high so up there the 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.940
 I hope you liked that 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.400
 you have had a good time and that you have me 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.600
 known a little more and well I hope that 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.130
 share the video because it has cost me 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.770
 a lot of see to share it with 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.790
 your friends or with whom you want and 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.860
 leave like 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.860
 any comment and nothing until then
