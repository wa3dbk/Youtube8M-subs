00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
much that would increase your vertical

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.310 
much that would increase your vertical
leap<00:01:49.520> so<00:01:50.329> that<00:01:50.450> would<00:01:50.539> be<00:01:50.630> kind<00:01:50.810> of<00:01:50.930> a<00:01:51.079> funny

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
leap so that would be kind of a funny

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.359 
leap so that would be kind of a funny
way<00:01:52.600> that<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:53.719> could<00:01:53.840> actually<00:01:53.960> no<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:55.310> know

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
way that you could actually no you know

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.310 
way that you could actually no you know
if<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:55.640> lost<00:01:55.909> that<00:01:56.240> much<00:01:56.479> dead<00:01:56.840> weight<00:01:56.869> that

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
if you lost that much dead weight that

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.060 
if you lost that much dead weight that
much<00:01:57.530> fat<00:01:57.920> how<00:01:58.670> much<00:01:58.969> higher<00:01:59.240> would<00:01:59.509> you<00:01:59.659> jump

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
much fat how much higher would you jump

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.169 
much fat how much higher would you jump
so<00:02:01.070> if<00:02:01.219> you<00:02:01.310> don't<00:02:01.429> understand<00:02:01.729> that<00:02:01.880> post<00:02:02.090> in

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
I have not trained sumo wrestlers which

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.780 
I have not trained sumo wrestlers which
is<00:02:15.680> probably<00:02:16.070> one<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.280> only<00:02:16.430> people<00:02:16.640> that

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
is probably one of the only people that

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.149 
is probably one of the only people that
I<00:02:16.940> haven't<00:02:17.150> trained<00:02:17.480> would<00:02:17.690> that<00:02:17.810> be<00:02:17.960> cool<00:02:18.170> so

is it's just dead weight that's not

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.699 
is it's just dead weight that's not
doing<00:02:26.209> any<00:02:26.360> favors<00:02:26.599> it's<00:02:27.019> not<00:02:27.140> functional

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
doing any favors it's not functional

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.050 
doing any favors it's not functional
it's<00:02:27.890> not<00:02:28.069> helping<00:02:28.519> you<00:02:29.019> okay<00:02:30.019> so<00:02:30.739> uh<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:31.549> at

it's not helping you okay so uh and at
the<00:02:32.180> same<00:02:32.360> time<00:02:32.650> losing<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.980> body<00:02:34.310> fat<00:02:34.720> maybe

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
the same time losing that body fat maybe

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.259 
the same time losing that body fat maybe
isn't<00:02:35.989> your<00:02:36.349> most<00:02:37.010> high<00:02:37.250> priority<00:02:37.819> unless<00:02:38.090> you

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
isn't your most high priority unless you

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.300 
isn't your most high priority unless you
have<00:02:38.480> maybe<00:02:39.110> you're<00:02:39.349> 30<00:02:39.680> percent<00:02:40.159> or<00:02:40.280> more

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
have maybe you're 30 percent or more

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.110 
have maybe you're 30 percent or more
maybe<00:02:41.209> you're<00:02:41.450> very<00:02:41.959> high<00:02:42.230> body<00:02:42.739> fat

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
maybe you're very high body fat

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.369 
maybe you're very high body fat
individual<00:02:44.120> then<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.019> would<00:02:45.110> be<00:02:45.230> more

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
individual then it would be more

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.800 
individual then it would be more
important<00:02:45.709> but<00:02:45.799> if<00:02:46.159> you're<00:02:46.340> in<00:02:46.450> 1015<00:02:47.450> in<00:02:47.659> that

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
important but if you're in 1015 in that

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.229 
important but if you're in 1015 in that
range<00:02:48.099> you<00:02:49.099> should<00:02:49.280> really<00:02:49.459> be<00:02:49.519> focusing<00:02:50.000> on

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
range you should really be focusing on

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.420 
range you should really be focusing on
increasing<00:02:50.720> your<00:02:50.930> strengths<00:02:51.379> and<00:02:51.709> increasing
