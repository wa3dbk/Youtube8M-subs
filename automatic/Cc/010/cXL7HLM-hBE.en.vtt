00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.890
 hello how about youtube friends greets you 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.809
 to your friend javier arc speak one i 'm going to 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.419
 do this time a video that is 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:14.570
 very interesting for all people 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:16.740
 who like electronics 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.920
 there have been several people who have 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:25.340
 asked why I do not make a video 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:28.880
 where he teaches how this is going 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:34.400
 how the cables go to throw 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.140
 operate an investor with one with a 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.460
 switch 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.250
 and a connector of these that go to a 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.100
 socket 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.829
 and well, this time I'm going to 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:53.170
 do the video I just ordered a 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:56.710
 a card an investor 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.270
 and this is the cable 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.210
 I'm going to teach it 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.540
 I'm going to show you the process that should 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.100
 to continue to run this 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.100
 inverter and be able to test lamps 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.740
 if they get on ebay with a 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.110
 an inverter an investor game and not 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.040
 universal like this 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.320
 to one like this 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.480
 the cable the way the cable goes is 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.270
 the same this this cable is compatible 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.850
 is compatible for this the card and 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.870
 for this also right now I'm going to 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:48.130
 teach the process as bbva 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.130
 to start this card 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.790
 to start an inverter from 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.510
 lamps is required 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.530
 Have this cable at hand 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.710
 a switch is also required here 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.020
 this time I have a switch 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.850
 this one too 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.890
 they are also required 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:20.770
 another part that I do not find you or that 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.200
 it is also required is a a connector 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.540
 of these 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.599
 a battery or a power supply 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.989
 a battery with cables where they can 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.989
 connect the source to a socket 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.670
 The first thing we are going to do here is 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.880
 cut this cable the cable can 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.980
 cut to taste this I in this case what 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.980
 I will cut approximately half 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.650
 we cut in half 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.370
 what 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.920
 the part that I'm going to use in the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.550
 investor 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.340
 is the one with the red color cable 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.620
 left hand the one with the cable 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.920
 red on the left is what I owe 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.920
 use 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.450
 the inverter or lamp tester 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.410
 Now what I 'm going to do is take you out 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.700
 point to the cables 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.800
 once we have already sharpened the 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.490
 cables let's proceed to start the 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.490
 connections 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.960
 first cables that we are going to connect 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.870
 here is going to be him 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.730
 the black wire 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:49.120
 the black wire that is on the right side 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.810
 together with the yellow wire the two that 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.769
 they are juntitos black and yellow cable 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:59.500
 we are going to join the negative cable 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:02.940
 to the negative of the battery or source of 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.940
 food they will use 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.900
 I'm going to put a stopper 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.830
 here we have one step 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:19.390
 now we have the red cable 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:22.220
 and the yellow a red wire a yellow 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.400
 you have to put these two red wires together and 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.400
 yellow 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.240
 this we are going to join 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.849
 to the cable 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.560
 black switch here I have the 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:41.520
 switch with a red wire and a cable 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.600
 black actually the cable the color 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.430
 it does not matter anymore 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.980
 but good in this case I will use 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.520
 here the red cable plus watching the cable 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:54.600
 black black wire from the switch with the 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.600
 yellow and red 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.960
 I'm going to put a stopper cited security 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.960
 of protection 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:10.330
 now the other switch cable what 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.900
 let's put straight to what is the 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:17.010
 power supply or battery in this 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.010
 I have a battery here 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.690
 placed a stopper cited security 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.690
 protection 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.090
 well at this point we have here the 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:36.930
 connections now I 'm going to 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.930
 there is to show 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.380
 now I am going to show you the drawing 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.880
 here we have what is the battery 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.360
 black cable with the yellow cable go to the 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:01.340
 negative battery yellow cable 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:04.620
 which is next to the red cable go together 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.540
 attached to the cable to a cable 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.640
 switch the other cable 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.150
 switch goes directly to what 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.150
 it's the battery 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.470
 well now we're just going to connect the 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.470
 lamps that we are going to try
