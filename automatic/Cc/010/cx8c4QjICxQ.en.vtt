 there is a threat to the system 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.070
 public services by

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.350
 uk two million arrived 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.759
 of the eight poorest citizens 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.100
 Eastern European countries and with and only 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.530
 13 thousand people have submitted a request for 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.700
 giving them benefits as individuals 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.740
 job seekers 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.780
 we also know that the budget 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.939
 State Labor Service 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.340
 migrants uk is 100

 10 to 12 million of this amount were not 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.340
 and hard-earned citizens from countries 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.920
 of Eastern Europe 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.229
 thus, these conclusions do not have 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:52.290
 is the basis of the present state of affairs 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.549
 talks about back if it's just a myth 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.549
 distributed media 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.930

 if we want someday 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.630
 balance our economy 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.610
 so that all Europeans live better then 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.480
 we should abandon the policy 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.490
 protectionism thank you very much habib 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.690
 Freedom of Movement Directive 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.090
 is one of the fundamental 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.310
 principles and with but it seems that now 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.590
