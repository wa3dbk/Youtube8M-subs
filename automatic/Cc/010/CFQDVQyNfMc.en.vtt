00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:13.470
 Hello in this video I want to show you 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.799
 they the 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.140
 currently as often and can change from Windows XP 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.750
 Strictly speaking, there are many types of any file 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.740
 a responsible program anyway if the program this file type 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.649
 in Windows also registered 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.049
 but it is not uncommon for us to have several 

00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:31.460
 graphics programs 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.300
 or have multiple web browsers installed on one computer and all 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.239
 of course want 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.270
 who have registered corresponding file types for themselves 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.319
 Some programs simply grab the file type of other programs 

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:44.650
 At least ask questions 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.820
 which are probably annoyed so soon or 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.789
 accordingly 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.239
 that we had to click on the construction soon 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.409
 the ver di 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:55.050
 Allow file type takeover yourself 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.410
 that's the way it can be 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.080
 that we do not want 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.110
 the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.780
 a program which registers AVG files for itself, for example if we have the a4 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.800
 want to look at the file with the vlc player and the media player 3 for themselves 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.800
 There are two ways to do that again 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.110
 the first option is the program 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.750
 we want it from 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.540
 finalizing this file type 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.990
 just to reinstall then he takes the file type 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.150
 most likely back again 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.550
 but there is still a bit easier 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.550
 By way of example I have an HTML document here now 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.040
 You can already see a Michel here 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.490
 that is the state that I say now 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.060
 the Firefox 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.960
 feels responsible for this file type html 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.230
 that is, if I just lay on the document now 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.230
 Firefox starts and shows more 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.740
 Files 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.120
 so that would like to change that says okay 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.240
 But I want that html files for example for another browser 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.200
 being represented 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.079
 I can easily change that by going to my explorer menu 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.980
 Extras like here 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.880
 and there the sub-item also options on voters 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.549
 but rump can continue file type 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:17.829
 Bought 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.730
 sorry but now a list of all registered file types 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.259
 and here we just have to 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:24.040
 the 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.709
 currently find 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.819
 want to change accordingly that means in this case html 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.349
 Besigye the extension is html about it is also htm 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.400
 and currently in addition to Firefox document 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.739
 which and once again is honest details about the extension 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.950
 so and here next dragon went 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.430
 Enderlein asked the hot one to change that 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.139
 we also click on that then wait 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.969
 and we get here a new overview with recommended programs 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:55.999
 That's what Windows does, which makes sense, I'll just say it 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:57.560
 Firefox is highlighted 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.560
 the silver standard he could still the vines 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.290
 Internet Explorer or the 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.639
 all roles 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.079
 Replacement for the Google Chrome browser, so to speak 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.019
 on the lip I could take also completely foreign applications 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.340
 Walter for example or to death 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.449
 we can also if our program 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:18.989
 we wanted to use it is not listed 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.989
 just click here on the searches 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:24.809
 or we live on ours 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.839
 Select registration once 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.329
 and then wonder 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.349
 she had Mel 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:31.299
 page 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.310
 to be opened with this program is limited in this case 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:37.709
 but now that it all with the one and do 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.580
 the Licher so okay here the checkbox I hold the Czech so that always 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.629
 with this program in the future 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:49.120
 Just click on the biscuit it's different here for something else 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.289
 as others show and out 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:55.599
 Firefox document is now as defender had Mel 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:00.369
 the dough has become okay so close that is about to change now 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:04.049
 not so fast that it may take up to a reboot before you do that 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.969
 updated accordingly is still working immediately 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:11.909
 that means if I open here now on Klika no longer Firefox 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.230
 but Dr Chrome Browser should be so Dr 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.620
 Iron Browser 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.440
 the same applies of course with the 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.489
 Pictures I have here 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.479
 the check carries 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.039
 jpg 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.300
 must of course always pay attention to the ending 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.200
 if we have just seen I had just html documents and a 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.610
 had in the document 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.939
 I did not change that in the document 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.939
 But what does that mean most of the time, that is, if it is now 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.759
 for one and the same file types Iran are present then these must be 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.879
 Show clearly twice because if I now for example the 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.110
 html file problems 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.400
 in HCC Cham 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.370
 that was the overlying one 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.669
 file format 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.669
 and that's what Firefox still feels like 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:00.809
 responsible that is now how Firefox has been opened 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:04.139
 if I say that change and there are several shared for one and the same 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.339
 File then must be changed accordingly several times 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.650
 so back to our jetpack because here are several 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.860
 Spellings for the file modification Jad BG I have here but there are synonymous 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.120
 Genpact so GGG in the end 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.039
 at the moment you can already have seen 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.210
 will Windows will and Fox will display 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.470
 used around 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.180
 to show the screenshot 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.439
 but what else can I change? 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:35.659
 Extras menu 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.529
 also the options 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.009
 currently added 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.759
 so natural and Logitech looking for 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.639
 and in that sense, of course, that can be more elaborate if you now to 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.309
 Say an example 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:51.509
 any graphics program has cloned too many foreign graphics file types 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.879
 then they have to be heroes several times here for men next to for example 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:00.249
 Greed if you want and Jerry Pelka and BMP and water 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:02.759
 Vulture what else for 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.610
 Graphics formats are then variant a could be more meaningful that Â«very 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.150
 simple promise program reinstall again 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.969
 how so 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.089
 Home is Jack Black 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:16.039
 there it is and luckily in the band right next to it are also the other ones 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.039
 Formats underneath is jpg that I have to do now on the inner wall of my graphic 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:23.039
 So then get up here again 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:25.809
 Click on the end of the baking 

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:26.979
 say it 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.900
 but it should be Perrin's here 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.180
 otherwise I'll take it now 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.509
 But I could long now synonymous for Firefox take that's what we do now 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.849
 In change Scripps is on the fast 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.849
 Demel Firefox 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:42.770
 you click on it 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.469
 opened with Firefox 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:47.709
 and the image is displayed makes sense in this case, of course, if now 

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:50.129
 for example, word processing is taken 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:53.039
 Of course it will not work as easily as any browser can 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:54.360
 of course also pictures 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.180
 So much for the simple change of individual file types
