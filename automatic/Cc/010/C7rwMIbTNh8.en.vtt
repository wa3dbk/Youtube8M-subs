00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
loads of the adjustments about the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.150 
loads of the adjustments about the
choreography<00:02:06.270> because<00:02:06.650> earlier<00:02:07.650> it<00:02:07.770> was<00:02:07.950> like

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
choreography because earlier it was like

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.730 
choreography because earlier it was like
too<00:02:08.399> easy<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:09.330> go<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.539> world<00:02:09.929> cup<00:02:10.289> I'd<00:02:10.500> have

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
too easy to go to world cup I'd have

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.830 
too easy to go to world cup I'd have
done<00:02:10.890> already<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.550> world<00:02:11.940> cup<00:02:12.150> seasons<00:02:12.600> but

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
done already to world cup seasons but

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.680 
done already to world cup seasons but
this<00:02:13.410> time<00:02:13.650> we<00:02:13.890> have<00:02:13.920> really<00:02:14.430> put<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.360> up<00:02:15.510> to

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
this time we have really put it up to

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.640 
this time we have really put it up to
the<00:02:15.780> maximum<00:02:17.240> does<00:02:18.240> he<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.990> movement<00:02:19.560> that

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
the maximum does he have a movement that

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.150 
the maximum does he have a movement that
is<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:21.110> showpiece<00:02:22.110> what's<00:02:22.440> his<00:02:22.620> favorite<00:02:22.830> thing

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
is a showpiece what's his favorite thing

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.640 
is a showpiece what's his favorite thing
to<00:02:23.280> do<00:02:23.400> well<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.150> easiest<00:02:24.180> one<00:02:24.810> for<00:02:24.840> us<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.500> the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
to do well the easiest one for us is the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
to do well the easiest one for us is the
half<00:02:25.830> passes<00:02:26.550> which<00:02:26.910> are<00:02:27.150> like<00:02:27.390> he's<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> very

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
half passes which are like he's a very

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.180 
half passes which are like he's a very
flexible<00:02:29.900> good<00:02:30.900> horse<00:02:31.200> for<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.650> one<00:02:31.950> so

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
flexible good horse for that one so

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.250 
flexible good horse for that one so
that's<00:02:32.370> probably<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.150> extensions<00:02:33.930> and

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
that's probably and the extensions and

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.560 
that's probably and the extensions and
