00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:57.249 
was out the other night and I saw a very

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:59.940 
was out the other night and I saw a very
attractive<00:01:57.759> woman<00:01:58.119> and<00:01:58.689> as<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.289> stood<00:01:59.560> just<00:01:59.619> a

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
attractive woman and as I stood just a

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.700 
attractive woman and as I stood just a
few<00:02:00.249> feet<00:02:00.280> away<00:02:00.850> from<00:02:01.179> her<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:02.109> dawned<00:02:02.439> on<00:02:02.649> me

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
few feet away from her it dawned on me

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.059 
few feet away from her it dawned on me
that<00:02:03.130> she<00:02:03.520> may<00:02:03.820> have<00:02:04.149> possibly<00:02:04.899> been<00:02:05.200> wearing

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
that she may have possibly been wearing

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.790 
that she may have possibly been wearing
hair<00:02:06.429> extensions<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.929> reason<00:02:08.140> that<00:02:08.619> I

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
hair extensions and the reason that I

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.220 
hair extensions and the reason that I
thought<00:02:09.100> about<00:02:09.399> this<00:02:09.729> was<00:02:10.270> because<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.780> just

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
thought about this was because I just

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.250 
thought about this was because I just
saw<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:12.100> same<00:02:12.310> woman<00:02:12.760> out<00:02:13.030> not<00:02:13.630> too<00:02:13.930> long<00:02:13.960> ago

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
saw the same woman out not too long ago

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.670 
saw the same woman out not too long ago
and<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.460> just<00:02:15.670> don't<00:02:15.940> remember<00:02:16.150> her<00:02:16.690> hair<00:02:17.050> being

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
and I just don't remember her hair being

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.270 
and I just don't remember her hair being
so<00:02:18.070> long<00:02:18.370> I'm<00:02:19.150> starting<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.870> see<00:02:20.320> that<00:02:20.680> more

models are going to hair extensions now

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.240 
models are going to hair extensions now
I<00:02:34.270> always<00:02:34.810> have<00:02:34.959> people<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:35.500> talk<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:36.100> it

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
I always have people that I talk to it

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.479 
I always have people that I talk to it
asked<00:02:36.670> me<00:02:36.790> if<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.209> guys<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.989> can<00:02:38.890> wear<00:02:39.160> hair

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
asked me if the guys to can wear hair

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.720 
asked me if the guys to can wear hair
extensions<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.450> yes<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.410> do<00:02:41.530> think<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:42.489> if

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
extensions and yes I do think that if

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.449 
extensions and yes I do think that if
you<00:02:42.880> are<00:02:42.910> God<00:02:43.450> with<00:02:43.840> an<00:02:43.989> incredibly<00:02:44.709> amount<00:02:45.280> of

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
you are God with an incredibly amount of

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.970 
you are God with an incredibly amount of
thick<00:02:45.700> hair<00:02:46.090> then<00:02:46.510> yes<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:47.110> can<00:02:47.380> wear<00:02:47.650> hair

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
thick hair then yes you can wear hair

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.070 
thick hair then yes you can wear hair
extensions<00:02:48.640> but<00:02:49.150> if<00:02:49.270> you're<00:02:49.450> losing<00:02:49.900> your

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
extensions but if you're losing your

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.910 
extensions but if you're losing your
hair<00:02:50.440> I<00:02:50.739> wouldn't<00:02:51.640> recommend<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.450> as<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:53.590> can

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
hair I wouldn't recommend it as it can

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.300 
hair I wouldn't recommend it as it can
cause<00:02:54.220> what's<00:02:54.640> known<00:02:54.880> as<00:02:55.120> traction<00:02:55.630> alopecia

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
cause what's known as traction alopecia

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.360 
cause what's known as traction alopecia
and<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:58.450> can<00:02:58.780> actually<00:02:59.019> cause<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.950> lose

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
and that can actually cause you to lose

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.530 
and that can actually cause you to lose
more<00:03:00.760> hair<00:03:00.820> at<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.530> faster<00:03:02.530> pace<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:03.360> say<00:03:04.360> the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
more hair at a faster pace I say the

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.650 
more hair at a faster pace I say the
same<00:03:04.810> thing<00:03:05.200> about<00:03:05.470> wearing<00:03:06.190> hats<00:03:06.420> if<00:03:07.420> you

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
same thing about wearing hats if you

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.479 
same thing about wearing hats if you
think<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:08.110> you're<00:03:08.260> losing<00:03:08.709> your<00:03:08.890> hair<00:03:09.280> and

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
think that you're losing your hair and

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.240 
think that you're losing your hair and
you<00:03:09.760> wear<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.030> hat<00:03:10.360> often<00:03:10.930> it's<00:03:11.410> in<00:03:11.650> my<00:03:11.680> opinion

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
you wear a hat often it's in my opinion

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.090 
you wear a hat often it's in my opinion
that<00:03:12.550> the<00:03:12.730> hat<00:03:13.000> will<00:03:13.360> cause<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:14.050> to<00:03:14.230> lose<00:03:14.739> hair

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
that the hat will cause you to lose hair

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.640 
that the hat will cause you to lose hair
faster<00:03:15.819> and<00:03:16.120> take<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.870> good<00:03:17.110> hair<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.530> you

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
faster and take the good hair that you

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.120 
faster and take the good hair that you
have<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.160> make<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.819> look<00:03:18.970> thinner<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.680> as<00:03:20.830> far

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
have and make it look thinner so as far

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.520 
have and make it look thinner so as far
as<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.430> extensions<00:03:22.000> ago<00:03:22.300> I<00:03:22.330> really<00:03:23.110> wouldn't

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
as the extensions ago I really wouldn't

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.310 
as the extensions ago I really wouldn't
recommend<00:03:23.590> them<00:03:24.310> for<00:03:24.340> men<00:03:24.819> or<00:03:25.030> women<00:03:25.660> unless

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
recommend them for men or women unless

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.800 
recommend them for men or women unless
you<00:03:26.530> have<00:03:26.739> an<00:03:26.920> incredibly<00:03:27.610> thick<00:03:28.120> amount<00:03:28.690> of

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
you have an incredibly thick amount of

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.140 
you have an incredibly thick amount of
hair<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.350> know<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.459> you<00:03:30.610> see<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:30.880> lot<00:03:31.120> of

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
hair I know that you see a lot of

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.479 
hair I know that you see a lot of
african-american<00:03:32.040> women<00:03:33.040> with<00:03:33.220> hair

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
african-american women with hair

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.509 
african-american women with hair
extensions<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.450> weaves<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:35.140> they<00:03:36.040> really

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
extensions and weaves and they really

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.759 
extensions and weaves and they really
have<00:03:36.730> those<00:03:37.030> things<00:03:37.420> tied<00:03:37.780> in<00:03:38.019> pretty<00:03:38.410> tight

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
have those things tied in pretty tight

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.280 
have those things tied in pretty tight
but<00:03:39.100> what<00:03:39.880> can<00:03:40.030> happen<00:03:40.239> is<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:40.900> over<00:03:41.260> a

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
but what can happen is that over a

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.620 
but what can happen is that over a
period<00:03:41.350> of<00:03:41.739> time<00:03:42.040> they<00:03:42.670> can<00:03:42.730> end<00:03:43.090> up<00:03:43.239> getting

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
period of time they can end up getting

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.650 
period of time they can end up getting
traction<00:03:44.019> alopecia<00:03:44.530> and<00:03:45.310> then<00:03:45.850> end<00:03:46.150> up<00:03:46.329> being

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
traction alopecia and then end up being

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.110 
traction alopecia and then end up being
worse<00:03:46.930> off<00:03:47.260> than<00:03:47.590> before<00:03:47.829> they<00:03:48.400> even<00:03:48.519> had<00:03:48.880> the

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
worse off than before they even had the

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.140

it is taken me from about a Norwood
three<00:04:16.000> when<00:04:16.209> I<00:04:16.239> started<00:04:16.959> to<00:04:17.769> what<00:04:18.039> I<00:04:18.070> feel<00:04:18.370> now

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
three when I started to what I feel now

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.070 
three when I started to what I feel now
is<00:04:19.169> just<00:04:20.169> a<00:04:20.350> little<00:04:20.650> bit<00:04:20.979> under<00:04:21.640> a<00:04:21.880> Norwood<00:04:22.690> too

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.040 
is just a little bit under a Norwood too
and<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:24.100> funny<00:04:24.340> thing<00:04:24.430> is<00:04:24.940> that<00:04:25.030> I<00:04:25.450> feel<00:04:25.750> that

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
and the funny thing is that I feel that

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.590 
and the funny thing is that I feel that
even<00:04:26.500> after<00:04:26.680> taking<00:04:27.190> this<00:04:27.580> for<00:04:28.000> four<00:04:28.240> years

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
even after taking this for four years

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.219 
even after taking this for four years
that<00:04:29.260> I<00:04:29.320> seem<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.979> still<00:04:30.340> be<00:04:30.640> improving<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.659> I

feel<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:32.650> my<00:04:32.710> hair

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
feel that my hair

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.350 
feel that my hair
tinues<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.350> look<00:04:34.530> thicker<00:04:34.830> or<00:04:35.220> should<00:04:36.210> I<00:04:36.330> say

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
tinues to look thicker or should I say

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.690 
tinues to look thicker or should I say
because<00:04:37.140> I<00:04:37.380> feel<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.620> I've<00:04:37.920> stopped<00:04:38.280> my<00:04:38.490> hair

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
because I feel that I've stopped my hair

hair rapidly at that rate of about a

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.230 
hair rapidly at that rate of about a
negative<00:05:35.190> 20<00:05:35.960> that<00:05:36.960> starts<00:05:37.650> to<00:05:37.830> add<00:05:38.010> up<00:05:38.240> after

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
negative 20 that starts to add up after

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.680 
negative 20 that starts to add up after
a<00:05:39.270> while<00:05:39.660> and<00:05:40.250> what<00:05:41.250> many<00:05:41.520> men<00:05:41.820> eventually<00:05:41.970> do

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
a while and what many men eventually do

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.850 
a while and what many men eventually do
is<00:05:43.170> just<00:05:43.650> give<00:05:43.950> up<00:05:44.190> and<00:05:44.490> shave<00:05:45.060> it<00:05:45.240> all<00:05:45.360> off

well when you're doing what I do would

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.770 
well when you're doing what I do would
just<00:05:49.500> take<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:49.980> big<00:05:50.160> three<00:05:50.670> you'll<00:05:51.420> stop

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
just take the big three you'll stop

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.830

losing 100 hairs per week and that

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.950 
losing 100 hairs per week and that
number<00:05:55.170> will<00:05:55.350> drop<00:05:55.770> down<00:05:56.070> to<00:05:56.400> about<00:05:56.700> 25<00:05:57.480> to<00:05:57.720> 30

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
number will drop down to about 25 to 30

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.800 
number will drop down to about 25 to 30
and<00:05:58.410> you'll<00:05:59.340> grow<00:05:59.930> 40<00:06:00.930> or<00:06:01.320> 50<00:06:01.890> years<00:06:02.690> so<00:06:03.690> the

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
number that you were losing due to the

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.110 
number that you were losing due to the
DHT<00:06:06.510> attacking<00:06:07.380> your<00:06:07.500> follicle<00:06:08.280> will<00:06:08.940> be

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
DHT attacking your follicle will be

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.930 
DHT attacking your follicle will be
lower<00:06:09.480> than<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:10.470> amount<00:06:10.800> you'll<00:06:11.340> be<00:06:11.520> able<00:06:11.640> to

lower than the amount you'll be able to

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.630 
lower than the amount you'll be able to
grow<00:06:12.300> and<00:06:12.750> after<00:06:13.620> a<00:06:13.650> while<00:06:13.950> of<00:06:14.010> getting

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
grow and after a while of getting

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.450 
grow and after a while of getting
positive<00:06:15.300> gains<00:06:15.690> you'll<00:06:16.560> find<00:06:16.860> yourself<00:06:17.070> back

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
positive gains you'll find yourself back

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.820 
positive gains you'll find yourself back

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
almost close to how it was looking

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.180 
almost close to how it was looking
before<00:06:24.840> the<00:06:25.230> hair<00:06:25.410> loss<00:06:25.590> started<00:06:26.100> to

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
before the hair loss started to

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.940 
before the hair loss started to
