00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.590
 me 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.130
 you 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.890
 March 8 the forecourt of the esses de cluses 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.470
 had a little air of plain Irish 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.690
 with the advent of the celtic legend a 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.220
 highly anticipated evening close to 1000 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.470
 people were present for 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.090
 to cheer these artists off the ground they have 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.050
 created a special show for their 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.210
 tenth anniversary 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.370
 after crossing the whole of France 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.510
 they made a kind of melting pot of 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.220
 all they know how to do is to say 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.610
 live music and also the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.560
 dance 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.940
 let's try the two years by just trying to 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.940
 dance or just try music 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.280
 25 Irish artists were on stage 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.410
 to offer the public a vibrant show 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.900
 on the unbridled rhythms of music 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.040
 but the grace of dances and the 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.040
 beat of the tap 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.409
 currently touring throughout the 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.630
 France this show transports you to 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.030
 heart of wild ireland in a 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.350
 warm and electric atmosphere 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.350
 an unforgettable moment 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.959
 far from the big celtic productions 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.780
 legend is based on authenticity the 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.459
 tradition and Irish culture and 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.159
 that's probably why he wins 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.159
 such a success for 10 years now
