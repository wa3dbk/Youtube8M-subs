00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
now let's get to a few of the problems

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.789 
now let's get to a few of the problems
which<00:00:03.480> you<00:00:03.600> haven't<00:00:03.810> been<00:00:04.049> many<00:00:04.259> but<00:00:04.680> they

which you haven't been many but they

which you haven't been many but they
have<00:00:04.950> popped<00:00:05.339> up<00:00:05.670> there's<00:00:06.330> been<00:00:06.540> issues<00:00:06.720> with

have popped up there's been issues with

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.259 
have popped up there's been issues with
maybe<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.740> two<00:00:07.950> point<00:00:08.189> no<00:00:08.309> firmware<00:00:08.670> has<00:00:09.120> been

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
maybe the two point no firmware has been

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.440 
maybe the two point no firmware has been
a<00:00:09.300> little<00:00:09.450> buggy<00:00:09.780> it's<00:00:10.110> led<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.380> some<00:00:10.559> crashes

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
a little buggy it's led to some crashes

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.910

gaming<00:00:12.450> has<00:00:12.690> already<00:00:12.870> begun<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.500> terms<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
gaming has already begun in terms of the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.189 
gaming has already begun in terms of the
app<00:00:14.040> sort<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.429> jockey<00:00:14.670> for<00:00:14.969> those

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
app sort of jockey for those

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.470 
app sort of jockey for those
all-important<00:00:16.199> top<00:00:16.410> ten<00:00:16.710> positions<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.480> sync

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
all-important top ten positions and sync

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.150 
all-important top ten positions and sync
times<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.990> dramatically<00:00:19.350> increased<00:00:19.529> since

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
times have dramatically increased since

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.490 
times have dramatically increased since
I<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.910> backs<00:00:21.210> up<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.480> program<00:00:21.779> every<00:00:22.199> single

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
I it backs up the program every single

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.599 
I it backs up the program every single
time<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.650> plug<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.010> iphone<00:00:23.310> into<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
time you plug the iphone into the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.519 
time you plug the iphone into the
computer<00:00:24.060> what<00:00:24.840> do<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:24.960> think<00:00:25.050> some<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
computer what do you think some of the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.769 
computer what do you think some of the
solutions<00:00:26.189> are<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:26.730> Apple<00:00:27.150> going<00:00:27.420> forward

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
solutions are for Apple going forward

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.330 
solutions are for Apple going forward
specifically<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.470> terms<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.859> maybe<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.160> new

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
specifically in terms of maybe a new

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.910 
specifically in terms of maybe a new
version<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.820> firmware<00:00:30.740> yeah<00:00:31.740> definitely

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
version of the firmware yeah definitely

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.549 
version of the firmware yeah definitely
I<00:00:32.250> think<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.790> Apple<00:00:33.239> may<00:00:33.510> have<00:00:33.809> been<00:00:34.050> pressed

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
I think that Apple may have been pressed

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.130 
I think that Apple may have been pressed
for<00:00:34.770> time<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.130> get<00:00:35.280> everything<00:00:35.989> set<00:00:36.989> up<00:00:37.020> for

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
for time to get everything set up for

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.250 
for time to get everything set up for
the<00:00:38.010> OS<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.610> be<00:00:38.730> as<00:00:38.850> rock<00:00:39.059> solid<00:00:39.360> as<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the OS to be as rock solid as the the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.930 
the OS to be as rock solid as the the
one<00:00:40.440> dot<00:00:40.649> o<00:00:40.680> software<00:00:41.309> was<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.700> was<00:00:41.820> just

party applications that were not

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.080 
party applications that were not
authorized<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:53.250> much<00:00:53.430> more<00:00:53.460> stable<00:00:53.879> than

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
authorized was so much more stable than

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.569 
authorized was so much more stable than
the<00:00:54.300> two<00:00:54.510> daughters<00:00:54.809> software<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.649> hardly

last you know in the time since that i
got<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.900> 3g<00:01:07.260> phone<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> two<00:01:08.070> dot<00:01:08.250> of

got the 3g phone that the two dot of

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.080 
got the 3g phone that the two dot of
software<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:10.350> quite<00:01:10.650> buggy<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.000> you

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
software is is is quite buggy so do you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.420 
software is is is quite buggy so do you
think<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.420> could<00:01:12.630> see<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> new<00:01:13.170> new<00:01:14.159> form

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
think that we could see a new new form

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.429 
think that we could see a new new form
where<00:01:14.580> sometime<00:01:14.970> soon<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.990> rumor<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.320> that

where sometime soon the rumor is that

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.820 
where sometime soon the rumor is that
we're<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.119> 201<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.409> currently

we're going to that the 201 is currently
in<00:01:20.430> testing<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.570> actually<00:01:21.869> been<00:01:21.990> in

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
in testing and it's actually been in

in testing and it's actually been in
testing<00:01:22.640> before<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.290> allowed<00:01:25.310> software<00:01:26.310> was

backup feature was really really

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.270 
backup feature was really really
valuable<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.729> people<00:02:09.000> now<00:02:09.869> with<00:02:10.379> with<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.160> to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
application

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.070 
application
that's<00:02:14.100> actually<00:02:14.370> carried<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.090> through<00:02:15.510> with

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
that's actually carried on through with

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.710 
that's actually carried on through with
the<00:02:16.290> backup<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.819> that's<00:02:17.940> every<00:02:18.240> single<00:02:18.540> time

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
the backup and that's every single time

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.380 
the backup and that's every single time
that<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.990> sink<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.130> even<00:02:20.400> if<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.150> have

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
that you sink and so even if you have

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.090 
that you sink and so even if you have
those<00:02:21.569> applications<00:02:22.080> in<00:02:22.530> your<00:02:22.770> iTunes

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
those applications in your iTunes

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.520 
those applications in your iTunes
library<00:02:23.220> because<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.090> can<00:02:24.209> really<00:02:24.840> just<00:02:25.200> sink

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
library because you can really just sink

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.220 
library because you can really just sink
those<00:02:26.030> applications<00:02:27.030> into<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.690> library<00:02:28.110> and

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
those applications into the library and

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.990 
those applications into the library and
you<00:02:28.319> can<00:02:28.470> see<00:02:28.770> them<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.069> browse<00:02:29.310> them<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.850> and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
you can see them and browse them and and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.050 
you can see them and browse them and and
store<00:02:30.720> them<00:02:30.900> there<00:02:31.290> it's<00:02:32.100> still<00:02:32.459> backing<00:02:32.760> it

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
store them there it's still backing it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.790 
store them there it's still backing it
up<00:02:33.150> every<00:02:33.450> single<00:02:33.600> time<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.440> we're<00:02:34.620> not

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
up every single time and so we're not

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.979 
up every single time and so we're not
really<00:02:34.980> sure<00:02:35.180> why<00:02:36.180> that's<00:02:36.390> happening<00:02:36.540> if

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
really sure why that's happening if

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.360 
really sure why that's happening if
there's<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.230> good<00:02:37.350> reason<00:02:37.560> for<00:02:37.739> that<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.069> happen

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
there's a good reason for that to happen

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.250 
there's a good reason for that to happen
and<00:02:38.819> if<00:02:38.940> Apple<00:02:39.239> plans<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.630> change<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.080> in<00:02:40.200> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
and if Apple plans to change that in the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.050 
and if Apple plans to change that in the
future<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.220> could<00:02:41.430> maybe<00:02:41.640> just<00:02:41.760> be<00:02:42.030> a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
future so this could maybe just be a

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.030 
future so this could maybe just be a
social<00:02:42.630> thing<00:02:42.660> with<00:02:43.020> iPhone<00:02:43.440> owners<00:02:43.650> where

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
social thing with iPhone owners where

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.970 
social thing with iPhone owners where
maybe<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:44.550> keep<00:02:44.810> only<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.260> applications<00:02:46.830> that

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
maybe we keep only the applications that

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.979 
maybe we keep only the applications that
we<00:02:47.070> really<00:02:47.370> want<00:02:47.580> on<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.850> phone<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.480> cut<00:02:48.870> down

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
we really want on the phone to cut down

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.550 
we really want on the phone to cut down
on<00:02:49.050> sync<00:02:49.470> time<00:02:50.000> well<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.239> know<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.959> can't<00:02:52.410> use

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
on sync time well you know you can't use

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.410 
on sync time well you know you can't use
the<00:02:52.709> applications<00:02:53.250> if<00:02:53.519> phenomenal<00:02:54.030> on<00:02:54.180> the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
the applications if phenomenal on the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.330 
the applications if phenomenal on the
phone<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:54.900> if<00:02:54.959> they're<00:02:55.110> right<00:02:55.320> there<00:02:56.010> there

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
phone so if they're right there there

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.940 
phone so if they're right there there
but<00:02:56.910> you'd<00:02:57.030> have<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.360> sync<00:02:57.570> them<00:02:57.720> back<00:02:57.959> I

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
but you'd have to sync them back I

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.740 
but you'd have to sync them back I
honestly<00:02:59.790> don't<00:02:59.970> think<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.360> there's<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.600> good

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
honestly don't think that there's a good

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.320 
honestly don't think that there's a good
reason<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:02.069> sync<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.610> back<00:03:02.940> up<00:03:03.150> those

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
reason to to sync to back up those

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.120 
reason to to sync to back up those
applications<00:03:03.930> every<00:03:04.260> single<00:03:04.530> time<00:03:04.709> I<00:03:04.739> think

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
applications every single time I think

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.970 
applications every single time I think
it<00:03:05.250> definitely<00:03:05.430> makes<00:03:05.940> sense<00:03:06.300> for<00:03:07.140> for<00:03:07.650> itunes

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
it definitely makes sense for for itunes

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.309 
it definitely makes sense for for itunes
to<00:03:08.280> make<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.910> single<00:03:09.390> backup<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.170> those

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
to make a single backup of those

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.540 
to make a single backup of those
applications<00:03:11.360> into<00:03:12.360> itunes<00:03:13.040> database<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.310> X

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
applications into itunes database of X

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.440 
applications into itunes database of X
there<00:03:15.360> but<00:03:15.959> once<00:03:16.140> that's<00:03:16.290> done<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:17.329> backup<00:03:18.329> of

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
there but once that's done a backup of

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.880 
there but once that's done a backup of
those<00:03:18.630> applications<00:03:19.019> really<00:03:19.650> isn't

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
those applications really isn't

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.400 
those applications really isn't
necessary<00:03:19.920> maybe<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:21.090> backup<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.750> data

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
necessary maybe a backup of the data

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.949 
necessary maybe a backup of the data
that<00:03:22.709> accompanies<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:24.420> applications

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
that accompanies the applications

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.470 
that accompanies the applications
something<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.650> would<00:03:25.769> change<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:27.150> know<00:03:27.269> as

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
something that would change you know as

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.150 
something that would change you know as
you<00:03:27.720> use<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.049> application<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.709> makes<00:03:28.920> sense

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
you use the application that makes sense

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.460 
you use the application that makes sense
to<00:03:29.310> be<00:03:29.430> backed<00:03:29.640> up<00:03:29.850> but<00:03:30.570> otherwise<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.110> just<00:03:31.140> it

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
to be backed up but otherwise it just it

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.259 
to be backed up but otherwise it just it
just<00:03:31.560> really<00:03:32.220> bloats<00:03:32.579> up<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.910> backup

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
just really bloats up the backup

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.819 
just really bloats up the backup
especially<00:03:33.690> with<00:03:33.780> things<00:03:34.079> that<00:03:34.200> are<00:03:34.650> really

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
especially with things that are really

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.539 
especially with things that are really
content<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.900> media<00:03:37.140> rich<00:03:37.500> such<00:03:37.739> as<00:03:37.890> games<00:03:38.190> and

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
content and media rich such as games and

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.400 
content and media rich such as games and
you<00:03:38.730> know<00:03:38.820> for<00:03:39.090> example<00:03:39.150> super<00:03:39.690> monkey<00:03:39.989> ball<00:03:40.019> I

you know for example super monkey ball I
think<00:03:40.620> is<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.739> third<00:03:41.100> 30<00:03:41.850> megabyte<00:03:42.299> application

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
think is a third 30 megabyte application

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.270 
think is a third 30 megabyte application
and<00:03:43.049> that's<00:03:43.170> being<00:03:43.380> backed<00:03:43.650> up<00:03:43.799> every<00:03:44.010> single

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280

time<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:44.549> said<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.090> takes<00:03:45.359> a<00:03:45.570> lot<00:03:46.470> of<00:03:46.530> time

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
time and said that takes a lot of time

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.160 
time and said that takes a lot of time
to<00:03:47.519> do<00:03:47.970> every<00:03:48.239> single<00:03:48.390> one<00:03:48.600> of<00:03:48.630> these<00:03:48.750> sinks

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
to do every single one of these sinks

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.270 
to do every single one of these sinks
especially<00:03:49.590> if<00:03:49.680> it's<00:03:49.799> just<00:03:50.010> something
