00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.110 
don't think Mario is that great an actor
I<00:04:40.470> think<00:04:40.590> he<00:04:40.950> found<00:04:41.190> out<00:04:41.370> Wednesday<00:04:41.760> morning

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
I think he found out Wednesday morning

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.190 
I think he found out Wednesday morning
they<00:04:42.240> called<00:04:42.390> him<00:04:42.570> up<00:04:42.660> and<00:04:42.690> said<00:04:42.810> you<00:04:42.960> want<00:04:43.110> to

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
they called him up and said you want to

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.630 
they called him up and said you want to
run<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.410> first<00:04:43.560> three<00:04:43.770> races<00:04:43.980> before<00:04:44.250> sight

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
run the first three races before sight

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.160 
run the first three races before sight
so<00:04:45.090> remember<00:04:45.450> it's<00:04:45.570> just<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.810> first<00:04:45.960> three

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
so remember it's just the first three

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.080 
so remember it's just the first three
races<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:46.950> imagine<00:04:47.340> if<00:04:47.400> he<00:04:47.460> takes<00:04:47.700> Petey

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
races and I imagine if he takes Petey

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.340 
races and I imagine if he takes Petey
out<00:04:48.210> of<00:04:48.360> any<00:04:48.480> of<00:04:48.600> those<00:04:48.690> races<00:04:49.110> he's<00:04:49.200> probably

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
out of any of those races he's probably

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.050 
out of any of those races he's probably
going<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.680> lose<00:04:49.740> his<00:04:50.040> ride<00:04:50.220> but<00:04:50.760> this<00:04:50.880> just

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
going to lose his ride but this just

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.580 
going to lose his ride but this just
goes<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.360> show<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:51.570> how<00:04:51.720> screwed<00:04:52.020> up<00:04:52.230> Champ
