00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that's over you know when you when you

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.369 
that's over you know when you when you
look<00:00:41.550> at<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.850> by<00:00:41.969> railroad<00:00:42.480> stock<00:00:42.780> cars<00:00:43.110> and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
look at it by railroad stock cars and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.170 
look at it by railroad stock cars and
compare<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> ark<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.250> railroad<00:00:44.610> stock<00:00:44.879> cars

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
compare the ark with railroad stock cars

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.819 
compare the ark with railroad stock cars
that's<00:00:45.539> about<00:00:45.750> five<00:00:46.020> hundred<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.530> twenty-two

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
that's about five hundred and twenty-two

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.400 
that's about five hundred and twenty-two
railroad<00:00:47.460> stock<00:00:47.820> cars<00:00:48.149> now<00:00:48.719> I'm<00:00:48.899> weird<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.350> know

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
railroad stock cars now I'm weird I know

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.029 
railroad stock cars now I'm weird I know
that

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
that

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.760 
that
so<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.340> started<00:00:50.820> figuring<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.329> out<00:00:51.510> how<00:00:52.140> long

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
so I started figuring it out how long

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.139 
so I started figuring it out how long
have<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.160> ever<00:00:53.280> been<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.670> other<00:00:53.789> side<00:00:54.030> of

the tracks and you're driving and the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.279 
the tracks and you're driving and the
train<00:00:55.500> comes<00:00:55.739> along<00:00:56.210> how<00:00:57.210> long<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.750> train<00:00:58.050> is

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
train comes along how long of a train is

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.830 
train comes along how long of a train is
522<00:00:59.219> Railroad<00:00:59.550> stock<00:00:59.850> cars<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.359> did<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> math

450 feet long and then like thirty five

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.660 
450 feet long and then like thirty five
seconds<00:03:30.390> later<00:03:30.570> he<00:03:31.230> goes<00:03:31.380> that's<00:03:31.670> 522

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
seconds later he goes that's 522

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:40.280 
seconds later he goes that's 522

cars<00:03:40.620> let<00:03:41.220> me<00:03:41.340> make<00:03:41.519> sure<00:03:41.549> my<00:03:41.700> math<00:03:42.060> is<00:03:42.239> correct

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
cars let me make sure my math is correct

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.160 
cars let me make sure my math is correct
here<00:03:42.840> if<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.530> boat<00:03:43.799> is<00:03:44.010> 450<00:03:44.970> feet<00:03:45.150> long<00:03:45.209> than<00:03:46.019> to

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
here if a boat is 450 feet long than to

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.060 
here if a boat is 450 feet long than to
get<00:03:46.290> 450<00:03:47.690> stock<00:03:48.690> cars<00:03:48.989> in<00:03:49.320> there<00:03:49.560> they'd<00:03:49.950> have

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
get 450 stock cars in there they'd have

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.789 
get 450 stock cars in there they'd have
to<00:03:50.190> each<00:03:50.340> be<00:03:50.609> a<00:03:50.790> foot<00:03:51.570> long<00:03:52.940> so<00:03:53.940> yeah<00:03:54.180> okay<00:03:54.799> 522

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
to each be a foot long so yeah okay 522

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.460 
to each be a foot long so yeah okay 522
railroad<00:03:56.340> stock<00:03:56.670> cars<00:03:57.030> if<00:03:57.359> they<00:03:57.900> are<00:03:57.959> smaller

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
railroad stock cars if they are smaller

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.440 
railroad stock cars if they are smaller
than<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:58.859> foot<00:03:59.370> long<00:03:59.700> each<00:04:01.850> are<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.239> this

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
than a foot long each are the is this

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.750 
than a foot long each are the is this
not<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.870> biggest<00:04:04.319> math<00:04:04.680> fail<00:04:05.190> you've<00:04:05.489> ever

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
not the biggest math fail you've ever

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.900 
not the biggest math fail you've ever
seen<00:04:06.150> in<00:04:06.329> your<00:04:06.359> life<00:04:07.250> he<00:04:08.250> went<00:04:08.400> from<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.730> boat

is 450 feet long to 522 railroad stock

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.900 
is 450 feet long to 522 railroad stock
cars<00:04:13.500> which<00:04:14.400> would<00:04:14.639> be<00:04:14.840> way<00:04:15.840> longer<00:04:16.289> than<00:04:16.910> 450

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
cars which would be way longer than 450

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.949 
cars which would be way longer than 450
feet<00:04:18.320> that's<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:20.160> much<00:04:20.459> longer<00:04:20.820> than<00:04:21.030> 450<00:04:21.810> feet

these<00:04:34.530> are<00:04:34.740> just<00:04:34.770> low<00:04:35.400> IQ<00:04:36.120> people<00:04:36.540> that<00:04:36.720> we're

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
these are just low IQ people that we're

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.870 
these are just low IQ people that we're
listening<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.320> here<00:04:37.919> and<00:04:38.100> then<00:04:38.700> they're

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880
