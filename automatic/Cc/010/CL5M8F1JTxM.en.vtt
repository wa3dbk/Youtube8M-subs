00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
left hand for instance to use all the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.410 
left hand for instance to use all the
dry<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.890> know<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.430> coconut<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.120> you're<00:02:45.329> not

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
dry you know the coconut so you're not

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.020 
dry you know the coconut so you're not
mixing<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.530> now<00:02:46.920> with<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.190> with<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> wet

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
mixing it and now with it with a wet

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.090 
mixing it and now with it with a wet
batter<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.510> gets<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.140> bit<00:02:49.260> messy<00:02:49.410> if<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:49.859> do<00:02:50.010> all

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
batter it gets a bit messy if you do all

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.449 
batter it gets a bit messy if you do all
right<00:02:50.310> it's<00:02:50.549> really<00:02:50.790> easy<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.150> do<00:02:52.340> like<00:02:53.340> I'm

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
right it's really easy to do like I'm

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:05.800 
right it's really easy to do like I'm
doing<00:02:53.670> right<00:02:53.819> now

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.130 

so<00:03:06.410> you<00:03:06.500> want<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.770> shake<00:03:06.950> off<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.160> excess<00:03:08.140> like

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
so you want to shake off the excess like

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.840 
so you want to shake off the excess like
this<00:03:09.350> I<00:03:09.560> don't<00:03:09.680> have<00:03:10.100> too<00:03:10.280> much<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:10.730> want

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
this I don't have too much and you want

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.140 
this I don't have too much and you want
to<00:03:10.940> just<00:03:12.250> Pat<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.280> down<00:03:13.520> so<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.910> coconut

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
to just Pat it down so the coconut

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.760 
to just Pat it down so the coconut
sticks<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.990> shrimp<00:03:17.050> and<00:03:18.050> here<00:03:18.380> we<00:03:18.500> have<00:03:18.740> a

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
sticks to the shrimp and here we have a

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.940 
sticks to the shrimp and here we have a
two<00:03:19.760> cups<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.150> coconut<00:03:20.330> in<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.900> quarter<00:03:21.740> cup<00:03:21.920> of

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
two cups of coconut in a quarter cup of

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.860 
two cups of coconut in a quarter cup of
flour<00:03:22.190> sometimes<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.030> coconuts<00:03:23.510> kind<00:03:23.780> of

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
flour sometimes the coconuts kind of

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.180 
flour sometimes the coconuts kind of
sticky<00:03:24.140> because<00:03:24.380> when<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.680> buy<00:03:24.830> it's<00:03:25.040> got

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
sticky because when you buy it's got

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.790 
sticky because when you buy it's got
sugar<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:25.670> it's<00:03:26.450> kind<00:03:26.750> of<00:03:26.870> easy<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.560> work<00:03:27.739> with

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
sugar and it's kind of easy to work with

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.150 
sugar and it's kind of easy to work with
little<00:03:28.340> drier<00:03:28.610> so<00:03:28.910> it's<00:03:29.060> thick<00:03:29.360> doodles<00:03:29.690> that

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
little drier so it's thick doodles that

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.530 
little drier so it's thick doodles that
doesn't<00:03:31.160> stick<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.430> your<00:03:31.459> hands<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.180> it's

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
doesn't stick to your hands and it's

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:41.320 
doesn't stick to your hands and it's
nice<00:03:32.720> in<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:33.610> dry

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.000 

as<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:41.960> can<00:03:42.110> see<00:03:42.260> it's<00:03:42.380> very<00:03:42.410> easy<00:03:42.710> process

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
as you can see it's very easy process

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.280 
as you can see it's very easy process
but<00:03:43.280> just<00:03:43.670> uh<00:03:43.820> we<00:03:44.570> have<00:03:44.690> little<00:03:44.930> patience

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
but just uh we have little patience

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.050 
but just uh we have little patience
because<00:03:45.440> little<00:03:46.070> time-consuming<00:03:48.820> now<00:03:49.820> there

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
because little time-consuming now there

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.310 
because little time-consuming now there
are<00:03:50.150> shrimp<00:03:50.270> it's<00:03:50.510> time<00:03:50.720> to<00:03:50.900> set<00:03:51.110> in<00:03:51.230> the

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
are shrimp it's time to set in the

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.200 
are shrimp it's time to set in the
refrigerator<00:03:51.440> we're<00:03:51.980> going<00:03:52.100> to<00:03:52.190> ready<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:52.910> fry

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
refrigerator we're going to ready to fry

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.960 
refrigerator we're going to ready to fry
that<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:54.260> want<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.530> put<00:03:54.710> a<00:03:54.740> pan<00:03:55.550> with<00:03:55.730> some<00:03:55.760> oil

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
that you want to put a pan with some oil

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.670 
that you want to put a pan with some oil
this<00:03:56.240> is<00:03:56.330> called<00:03:56.510> shallow<00:03:56.780> frying<00:03:57.230> since<00:03:57.560> we

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
this is called shallow frying since we

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.830 
this is called shallow frying since we
don't<00:03:57.800> have<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:58.010> dip<00:03:58.430> fry<00:03:58.670> most<00:03:59.420> of<00:03:59.540> our<00:03:59.690> homes

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
don't have a dip fry most of our homes

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.200 
don't have a dip fry most of our homes
you<00:04:00.440> can<00:04:00.470> do<00:04:00.740> this<00:04:00.920> in<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.190> just<00:04:01.640> regular<00:04:01.940> pan

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
you can do this in a just regular pan

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.540 
you can do this in a just regular pan
and<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:03.020> oil<00:04:03.050> should<00:04:03.410> be<00:04:03.440> between<00:04:03.590> 350<00:04:04.340> and

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
and the oil should be between 350 and

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.360 
and the oil should be between 350 and
360<00:04:05.300> so<00:04:05.990> that<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:06.560> way<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:06.740> don't<00:04:06.920> burn<00:04:07.010> the

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
360 so that that way you don't burn the

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.100 
360 so that that way you don't burn the
outside<00:04:07.400> of<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.000> shrimp<00:04:08.210> and<00:04:08.450> if<00:04:08.570> you<00:04:08.720> if<00:04:08.960> it's

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
outside of the shrimp and if you if it's

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.420 
outside of the shrimp and if you if it's
too<00:04:09.260> hard<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.740> outside<00:04:10.100> is<00:04:10.190> going<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.370> be

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
too hard the outside is going to be

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.250 
too hard the outside is going to be
really<00:04:10.640> Brown<00:04:11.030> in<00:04:11.240> the<00:04:11.330> in<00:04:11.450> size<00:04:11.660> mess<00:04:11.900> or<00:04:12.050> raw

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
really Brown in the in size mess or raw

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.080 
really Brown in the in size mess or raw
if<00:04:12.800> this<00:04:13.040> will<00:04:13.310> be<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.430> little<00:04:13.610> bit<00:04:13.760> too<00:04:13.910> high

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
if this will be a little bit too high

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.090 
if this will be a little bit too high
right<00:04:14.270> now<00:04:14.330> as<00:04:14.510> you<00:04:14.690> can<00:04:14.720> see<00:04:14.870> it's<00:04:15.860> going<00:04:16.010> to

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
right now as you can see it's going to

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.420 
right now as you can see it's going to
Brown<00:04:16.340> rather<00:04:17.150> quickly<00:04:17.739> so<00:04:18.739> this<00:04:18.890> is<00:04:19.010> nice<00:04:19.190> but

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
Brown rather quickly so this is nice but

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.830 
Brown rather quickly so this is nice but
you<00:04:19.489> don't<00:04:19.519> have<00:04:19.730> a<00:04:19.820> lot<00:04:20.000> of<00:04:20.030> oil<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.540> on

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
you don't have a lot of oil and on

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.650 
you don't have a lot of oil and on
touching<00:04:21.260> these<00:04:21.500> shrimp<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:23.060> again<00:04:23.360> is<00:04:23.540> to

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
touching these shrimp and again is to

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.210 
touching these shrimp and again is to
distribute<00:04:24.110> that<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.590> oil<00:04:24.830> is<00:04:25.010> from<00:04:25.130> high

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
distribute that the oil is from high

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.770
