00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
first thing I'm going to do is check the

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.880 
first thing I'm going to do is check the
tension<00:00:02.490> on<00:00:02.639> my<00:00:02.669> bedroom<00:00:03.240> machine<00:00:03.629> I<00:00:03.870> like<00:00:04.740> to

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
tension on my bedroom machine I like to

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.829 
tension on my bedroom machine I like to
use<00:00:05.220> these<00:00:05.520> clamps<00:00:05.940> that<00:00:06.240> came<00:00:06.420> with<00:00:06.690> the

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
use these clamps that came with the

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.640 
use these clamps that came with the
stringing<00:00:07.259> machine<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:08.370> connect<00:00:09.120> up<00:00:09.300> my

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.099 

tension<00:00:13.650> gauge<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:14.250> put<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.150> string<00:00:15.660> there's

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
tension gauge I put the string there's

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.859 
tension gauge I put the string there's
actually<00:00:16.440> two<00:00:16.650> strings<00:00:17.180> on<00:00:18.180> both<00:00:18.480> ends<00:00:18.810> of

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
actually two strings on both ends of

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.679 
actually two strings on both ends of
this<00:00:19.050> tension<00:00:19.289> gauge<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.949> put<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.670> on<00:00:20.850> one

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
this tension gauge I put it on one

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.710 
this tension gauge I put it on one
string<00:00:22.080> on<00:00:22.350> each<00:00:22.650> side<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.720> twelve

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
string on each side of the twelve

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.019 
string on each side of the twelve
o'clock<00:00:25.019> support<00:00:25.470> one<00:00:25.859> side<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.400> one<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:26.880> each

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
o'clock support one side of one on each

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.790 
o'clock support one side of one on each
side<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:29.000> six<00:00:30.000> o'clock<00:00:30.150> support<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.080> use

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
side of the six o'clock support I use

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.180 
side of the six o'clock support I use
Kevlar<00:00:32.340> string<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.230> set<00:00:34.230> my<00:00:34.469> tension<00:00:34.980> gauge

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
Kevlar string I set my tension gauge

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.670 
Kevlar string I set my tension gauge
over<00:00:35.850> here<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.510> 60<00:00:36.930> pounds<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.770> full<00:00:38.340> tension

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
over here to 60 pounds in full tension

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.130 
over here to 60 pounds in full tension
then<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:41.040> look<00:00:41.579> at<00:00:41.730> my<00:00:41.910> gauge<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.540> find<00:00:42.750> out<00:00:42.930> what

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
then I look at my gauge to find out what

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.950 
then I look at my gauge to find out what
the<00:00:43.260> tension<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:44.309> set<00:00:44.670> right<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.090> sixty

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the tension is it's set right on sixty

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.709 
the tension is it's set right on sixty
pounds<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:47.160> reason<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.520> use<00:00:47.730> Kevlar<00:00:48.239> strings

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
pounds the reason I use Kevlar strings

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.430 
pounds the reason I use Kevlar strings
is<00:00:49.110> because<00:00:50.149> they<00:00:51.149> tend<00:00:51.449> not<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.690> stretch<00:00:52.230> as

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
is because they tend not to stretch as

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.100 
is because they tend not to stretch as
much<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:54.000> reads<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.420> same<00:00:54.629> thing<00:00:54.930> right

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
much and it reads the same thing right

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.970 
much and it reads the same thing right
now<00:00:55.170> as<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.829> did<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.370> minute<00:00:56.610> ago<00:00:57.230> I<00:00:58.230> can

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
now as it did just a minute ago I can

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.510 
now as it did just a minute ago I can
release<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.699> now<00:01:00.469> but<00:01:01.469> if<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.890> tension<00:01:02.370> was

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
release this now but if that tension was

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.000 
release this now but if that tension was
off<00:01:02.789> let<00:01:03.750> me<00:01:03.809> show<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.049> how<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.350> would<00:01:04.680> adjust

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
off let me show you how I would adjust

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.149 
off let me show you how I would adjust
it<00:01:05.280> hey<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.960> look<00:01:07.140> real<00:01:07.380> closely<00:01:07.650> there's

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
it hey if you look real closely there's

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.390 
it hey if you look real closely there's
a<00:01:08.250> small<00:01:08.909> Allen<00:01:09.510> set<00:01:09.840> screw<00:01:10.200> right<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:10.590> that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
where it won't close as much if it the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.890 
where it won't close as much if it the
string<00:02:33.070> is<00:02:33.250> slipping<00:02:33.880> through<00:02:34.420> this<00:02:34.570> gripper

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
string is slipping through this gripper

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.840 
string is slipping through this gripper
first<00:02:35.380> thing<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.680> want<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:35.950> do<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.220> make<00:02:36.430> sure<00:02:36.610> my

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
first thing I want to do is make sure my

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.590 
first thing I want to do is make sure my
gripper<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.210> clean<00:02:38.110> if<00:02:38.550> that's<00:02:39.550> clean<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.300> can

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
gripper is clean if that's clean I can

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.650

turn<00:02:40.810> this<00:02:41.050> screw<00:02:41.500> counterclockwise<00:02:42.660> which

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
turn this screw counterclockwise which

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.440 
turn this screw counterclockwise which
will<00:02:43.900> make<00:02:44.080> it<00:02:44.110> travel<00:02:44.710> in<00:02:45.010> further<00:02:45.520> which

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
will make it travel in further which

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.750 
will make it travel in further which
means<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:46.930> closes<00:02:47.500> more<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.400> grips<00:02:48.640> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
means it closes more and it grips the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.230 
means it closes more and it grips the

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.069 
inside of this clamp it's just a narrow

ordinary cotton ball and isopropyl
alcohol<00:05:09.289> again<00:05:11.139> and<00:05:12.139> I<00:05:12.229> take<00:05:12.469> my<00:05:12.740> plant<00:05:13.550> base

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:13.819 
alcohol again and I take my plant base

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:15.730 
alcohol again and I take my plant base
where<00:05:14.150> my<00:05:14.330> pipes<00:05:14.960> are<00:05:15.139> running<00:05:15.409> back<00:05:15.590> and

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
where my pipes are running back and

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.040 
where my pipes are running back and
forth<00:05:16.009> and<00:05:16.219> just<00:05:16.460> wipe<00:05:17.120> it<00:05:17.300> down<00:05:17.509> pretty<00:05:17.750> good

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
forth and just wipe it down pretty good

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:37.300 
forth and just wipe it down pretty good
with<00:05:18.319> the<00:05:20.800> cotton<00:05:21.800> balls<00:05:35.020> okay<00:05:36.020> and<00:05:36.349> that's

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
with the cotton balls okay and that's

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.390 
with the cotton balls okay and that's
pretty<00:05:37.490> much<00:05:37.639> all<00:05:38.000> I<00:05:38.029> do<00:05:38.680> every<00:05:39.680> once<00:05:40.130> in<00:05:40.310> a

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
pretty much all I do every once in a

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.070 
pretty much all I do every once in a
while<00:05:40.460> what<00:05:40.909> I'll<00:05:41.060> do<00:05:41.270> is<00:05:41.509> I'll<00:05:41.659> take<00:05:41.870> these

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
while what I'll do is I'll take these

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.070 
while what I'll do is I'll take these
clamps<00:05:42.469> completely<00:05:43.159> off<00:05:43.340> here<00:05:43.759> because<00:05:44.449> the

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
clamps completely off here because the

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.249 
clamps completely off here because the
clamps<00:05:45.469> themselves<00:05:46.129> the<00:05:46.279> way<00:05:46.430> they<00:05:47.020> fix<00:05:48.020> on

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
clamps themselves the way they fix on

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:50.140 
clamps themselves the way they fix on
there<00:05:48.500> the<00:05:48.740> bottom<00:05:49.190> of<00:05:49.430> these<00:05:49.550> clamps<00:05:49.879> could

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
there the bottom of these clamps could

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.939 
there the bottom of these clamps could
get<00:05:50.330> dirty<00:05:50.569> too<00:05:50.870> so<00:05:51.229> I'll<00:05:51.379> take<00:05:51.620> them<00:05:51.740> off

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
get dirty too so I'll take them off

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.700 
get dirty too so I'll take them off
clean<00:05:52.580> up<00:05:52.729> both<00:05:52.969> sides<00:05:53.270> of<00:05:53.569> it<00:05:53.599> but<00:05:54.349> most<00:05:54.620> of

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
clean up both sides of it but most of

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.149 
clean up both sides of it but most of
the<00:05:54.800> time<00:05:55.039> I<00:05:55.250> just<00:05:55.279> simply<00:05:55.819> wipe<00:05:56.240> down<00:05:56.509> the<00:05:57.159> top

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:58.159 
the time I just simply wipe down the top

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:01.480 
the time I just simply wipe down the top
of<00:05:58.190> my<00:05:58.460> base<00:05:58.699> and<00:05:58.729> that's<00:05:59.120> about<00:05:59.270> it<00:06:00.370> to<00:06:01.370> adjust

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
of my base and that's about it to adjust

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.659 
of my base and that's about it to adjust
my<00:06:01.879> clamps<00:06:02.330> now<00:06:02.650> I'll<00:06:03.650> take<00:06:03.979> the<00:06:04.129> clamp<00:06:04.430> and

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
my clamps now I'll take the clamp and

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.089 
my clamps now I'll take the clamp and
turn<00:06:04.879> it<00:06:05.060> clockwise<00:06:05.599> to<00:06:06.050> make<00:06:06.680> them<00:06:06.830> close

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
turn it clockwise to make them close

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.110 
turn it clockwise to make them close
further<00:06:08.000> for<00:06:08.840> a<00:06:08.870> thinner<00:06:09.229> string

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
further for a thinner string

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.240 
further for a thinner string
counterclockwise<00:06:11.169> to<00:06:12.169> make<00:06:12.349> them<00:06:12.500> close<00:06:12.800> less

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
counterclockwise to make them close less

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.529 
counterclockwise to make them close less
for<00:06:14.060> a<00:06:14.090> thicker<00:06:14.419> string<00:06:14.990> I<00:06:15.289> rotate<00:06:16.190> this<00:06:16.539> lever

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539 
for a thicker string I rotate this lever

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:19.420 
for a thicker string I rotate this lever
down<00:06:17.810> here<00:06:18.199> it<00:06:18.289> locks<00:06:18.560> the<00:06:18.740> base<00:06:19.039> so<00:06:19.340> it

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
down here it locks the base so it

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.659 
down here it locks the base so it
doesn't<00:06:19.789> move<00:06:20.000> I<00:06:20.360> can<00:06:21.139> turn<00:06:21.409> this<00:06:21.710> an<00:06:22.039> Allen

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
doesn't move I can turn this an Allen

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.670 
doesn't move I can turn this an Allen
screw<00:06:23.000> right<00:06:23.270> here<00:06:23.330> clockwise<00:06:24.050> to<00:06:24.650> increase

no<00:06:32.200> as<00:06:32.470> I<00:06:33.280> look<00:06:33.490> at<00:06:33.580> this<00:06:33.700> machine<00:06:33.940> now<00:06:34.420> a<00:06:34.450> lot

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
no as I look at this machine now a lot

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.470 
no as I look at this machine now a lot
of<00:06:35.020> these<00:06:35.110> parts<00:06:35.530> like<00:06:36.130> right<00:06:36.940> here<00:06:37.180> on<00:06:37.210> the

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
of these parts like right here on the

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.780 
of these parts like right here on the
base<00:06:37.690> where<00:06:38.020> this<00:06:38.670> plant

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
base where this plant

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.590 
base where this plant
laughs<00:06:40.120> back<00:06:40.450> and<00:06:40.660> forth<00:06:41.730> it<00:06:42.730> seems<00:06:43.150> like<00:06:43.420> it

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
laughs back and forth it seems like it

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.650 
laughs back and forth it seems like it
would<00:06:43.750> slide<00:06:44.110> back<00:06:44.530> a<00:06:44.560> little<00:06:44.950> bit<00:06:45.270> better<00:06:46.270> to

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
would slide back a little bit better to

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.560 
would slide back a little bit better to
me<00:06:46.870> if<00:06:47.170> I<00:06:47.290> put<00:06:47.560> like<00:06:47.980> a<00:06:48.010> light<00:06:48.370> coat<00:06:48.670> of<00:06:48.820> oil<00:06:49.120> on

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
me if I put like a light coat of oil on

me if I put like a light coat of oil on
the<00:06:50.110> base<00:06:50.320> here<00:06:50.740> but<00:06:50.890> my<00:06:51.880> owners<00:06:52.330> manual<00:06:52.780> never

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
the base here but my owners manual never

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.860 
the base here but my owners manual never
told<00:06:53.200> me<00:06:53.350> to<00:06:53.470> do<00:06:53.620> that<00:06:53.650> so<00:06:54.310> I've<00:06:55.150> never<00:06:55.480> done<00:06:55.720> it

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
told me to do that so I've never done it

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.920 
told me to do that so I've never done it
all<00:06:56.050> I<00:06:56.140> do<00:06:56.380> is<00:06:56.880> clean<00:06:57.880> off<00:06:58.090> the<00:06:58.300> gram<00:06:58.540> every

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
all I do is clean off the gram every

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.140 
all I do is clean off the gram every
once<00:06:59.140> in<00:06:59.260> a<00:06:59.350> while<00:06:59.500> and<00:06:59.890> that's<00:07:00.610> pretty<00:07:00.970> much

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
once in a while and that's pretty much

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.420 
once in a while and that's pretty much
it
