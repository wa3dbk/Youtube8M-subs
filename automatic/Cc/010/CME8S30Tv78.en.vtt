00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
I think it needs a little bit back so I

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.370 
I think it needs a little bit back so I
went<00:04:38.310> ahead<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.730> added<00:04:38.910> another<00:04:39.570> quarter<00:04:40.350> of

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
tablespoons of brown sugar it just

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.290 
tablespoons of brown sugar it just
needed<00:04:47.550> some<00:04:47.940> more<00:04:48.090> sweetness<00:04:48.480> to<00:04:48.900> it<00:04:48.930> and

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
needed some more sweetness to it and

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.600
