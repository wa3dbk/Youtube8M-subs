00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 
all right we got a L 2350 Kubota

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.380 
all right we got a L 2350 Kubota
and<00:00:11.260> what<00:00:11.380> happened<00:00:11.740> is

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:13.390 
and what happened is

and what happened is
the<00:00:13.450> oil<00:00:13.600> sitting<00:00:13.990> right<00:00:14.290> here

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
the oil sitting right here

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.230 
the oil sitting right here
has<00:00:15.059> been<00:00:15.240> leaking<00:00:15.509> for<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.839> good<00:00:16.020> while<00:00:16.230> and

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
has been leaking for a good while and

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.580 
has been leaking for a good while and
first<00:00:18.240> time<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.599> leaked<00:00:18.779> out<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:18.990> got<00:00:19.259> into<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
first time it leaked out I got into the

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.010 
first time it leaked out I got into the
motor<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> starter<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.970> we<00:00:21.150> took<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
motor of the starter so we took the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.420 
motor of the starter so we took the
starter<00:00:22.380> part<00:00:22.619> cleaned<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.009> out<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.340> it's

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
starter part cleaned it out and it's

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.380 
starter part cleaned it out and it's
been<00:00:23.520> working<00:00:23.700> good<00:00:24.950> um<00:00:26.000> we<00:00:27.000> got<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> new<00:00:27.360> oil

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
been working good um we got a new oil

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.150 
been working good um we got a new oil
sending<00:00:27.840> unit<00:00:28.079> and<00:00:28.230> put<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.470> there<00:00:28.680> stopped<00:00:29.039> a

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
sending unit and put in there stopped a

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.729 
sending unit and put in there stopped a
little<00:00:29.250> leaks<00:00:29.689> but<00:00:30.689> now<00:00:30.930> every<00:00:31.410> once<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.649> a

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
little leaks but now every once in a

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.260 
little leaks but now every once in a
while<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.130> doesn't<00:00:32.340> want<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> start<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.120> just

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
while it doesn't want to start it just

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.580 
while it doesn't want to start it just
doesn't<00:00:33.540> do<00:00:33.600> anything<00:00:33.899> hey<00:00:34.020> one<00:00:34.170> other<00:00:34.350> thing

doesn't do anything hey one other thing
to<00:00:34.680> remember<00:00:35.129> this<00:00:35.790> little<00:00:36.149> wire<00:00:36.450> here<00:00:36.870> is

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
to remember this little wire here is

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.360 
to remember this little wire here is
what<00:00:37.950> energizes<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.670> solenoid<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.300> stuff<00:00:39.510> so

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
what energizes the solenoid and stuff so

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.100 
what energizes the solenoid and stuff so
what<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.489> want<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.719> want<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.989> be

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
able to try to start the unit up and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.110 
able to try to start the unit up and
check<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.440> wire<00:00:46.680> with<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.249> test<00:00:47.550> light<00:00:47.789> or<00:00:48.089> a

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
check this wire with a test light or a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.549 
check this wire with a test light or a
meter<00:00:48.480> or<00:00:48.690> something<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.050> make<00:00:49.140> sure<00:00:49.199> you<00:00:49.440> have

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
meter or something to make sure you have

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.189 
meter or something to make sure you have
power<00:00:49.829> here<00:00:50.480> before<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.629> condemn<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
power here before you condemn the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.899 
power here before you condemn the
starter<00:00:52.620> because<00:00:52.859> without<00:00:53.129> power<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.760> this

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
starter because without power on this

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.630 
starter because without power on this
wire<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.269> will<00:00:54.359> never<00:00:54.510> start<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.319> I<00:00:55.640> tested

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
wire it will never start so I tested

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.899 
wire it will never start so I tested
that<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.819> had<00:00:57.030> power<00:00:57.269> so<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:59.100> another<00:00:59.640> thing

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
that and had power so and another thing

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.439 
that and had power so and another thing
on<00:01:00.059> these<00:01:00.179> Coppola's<00:01:01.670> has<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.850> lawyer<00:01:03.120> right

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
on these Coppola's has this lawyer right

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.469 
on these Coppola's has this lawyer right
here<00:01:04.250> it's<00:01:05.250> always<00:01:05.430> close<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.030> starter

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
here it's always close to the starter

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.830 
here it's always close to the starter
has<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> 30<00:01:07.080> amp<00:01:07.320> fusible<00:01:07.920> link<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:09.690> you

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
has a 30 amp fusible link so if you

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.980 
has a 30 amp fusible link so if you
start<00:01:10.080> having<00:01:10.229> any<00:01:10.530> kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.830> issues<00:01:11.250> that

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
start having any kind of issues that

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.310 
start having any kind of issues that
would<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> good<00:01:13.320> place<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.590> check<00:01:15.080> okay<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.140> I

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
would be a good place to check okay so I

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.760 
would be a good place to check okay so I
got<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.620> starter<00:01:17.010> off<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:18.470> got<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> back

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
got the starter off of it I got the back

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.690 
got the starter off of it I got the back
cover<00:01:20.100> off<00:01:21.740> there's<00:01:22.740> two<00:01:22.890> contacts<00:01:23.430> right

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
cover off there's two contacts right

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.750 
cover off there's two contacts right
here<00:01:24.800> that's<00:01:25.800> what<00:01:25.920> makes<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.310> electric<00:01:26.370> go

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
here that's what makes the electric go

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.720 
here that's what makes the electric go
across<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:28.010> whenever<00:01:29.010> this<00:01:29.220> lark<00:01:29.640> is

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
across and whenever this lark is

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.820 
across and whenever this lark is
energized<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:31.860> makes<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.280> magnetic<00:01:32.730> force<00:01:33.830> and

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
energized it makes a magnetic force and

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.480 
energized it makes a magnetic force and
you<00:01:35.190> have<00:01:38.300> second<00:01:39.300> here<00:01:40.010> you<00:01:41.010> have<00:01:41.190> this

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
you have second here you have this

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.480 
you have second here you have this
plunger<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.120> here<00:01:42.890> with<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.950> spring<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.460> it

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
plunger in here with a spring on it

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.410 
plunger in here with a spring on it
alright<00:01:44.940> that<00:01:45.800> goes<00:01:46.800> down<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.370> hole<00:01:50.420> like

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
alright that goes down in this hole like

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.790 
alright that goes down in this hole like
so<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.400> cover<00:01:53.640> gets<00:01:53.940> on<00:01:54.120> it<00:01:54.800> then

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
so and the cover gets on it then

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.830 
so and the cover gets on it then
whenever<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.370> get<00:01:56.550> the<00:01:56.760> power<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.540> it

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
whenever you get the power going to it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.880 
whenever you get the power going to it
it<00:01:58.500> sucks<00:01:58.980> this<00:01:59.190> down<00:02:00.050> makes<00:02:01.050> contact<00:02:01.650> in

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
it sucks this down makes contact in

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.560 
it sucks this down makes contact in
between<00:02:02.220> these<00:02:02.400> two<00:02:02.640> with<00:02:02.910> this<00:02:03.030> ring<00:02:03.360> right

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
between these two with this ring right

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.180 
between these two with this ring right
here<00:02:04.580> okay<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:06.650> that's<00:02:07.650> what<00:02:07.830> makes<00:02:08.039> this

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
here okay and that's what makes this

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.420 
here okay and that's what makes this
power<00:02:08.910> come<00:02:09.149> out<00:02:09.269> this<00:02:09.420> side<00:02:09.950> put<00:02:10.950> onto<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
power come out this side put onto the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.000 
power come out this side put onto the
motor<00:02:11.610> or<00:02:11.909> makes<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.269> motor<00:02:12.450> turn<00:02:12.720> over<00:02:13.019> as

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
motor or makes the motor turn over as

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.740 
motor or makes the motor turn over as
that's<00:02:14.340> doing<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.849> it<00:02:15.060> also<00:02:15.209> shows<00:02:15.599> the

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
that's doing this it also shows the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.550 
that's doing this it also shows the
Bendix<00:02:16.110> out<00:02:17.239> so<00:02:18.239> I'm<00:02:18.750> going<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.050> wipe<00:02:19.230> all<00:02:19.440> this

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
Bendix out so I'm going to wipe all this
