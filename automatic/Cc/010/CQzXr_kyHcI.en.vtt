00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:10.849
 Today we have a new one before purchasing it 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.849
 samura knife 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:25.369
 the chef comes all bought but we all have it 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:36.600
 compare with the old look current in 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:42.510
 so everything is neat I am city chic rubles 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:46.649
 and pens and media cards that do not like it 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:54.079
 that there is no here to the point very comfortable 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:56.420
 keep for we have a box of steel shaves 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:02.000
 this knife 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.000
 aus-8 fuchs knife goin 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.200
 seen on 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:21.220
 here guys 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:31.090
 small opponent chinese knife 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:41.510
 Compiled with standard Chinese steel 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:45.050
 even though I read x30 chrome 13 it turns out x 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.350
 30 chrome 13 on interesting I transfer it 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:53.590
 in the Samara corner by and large 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.590
 now they are uniquely equivalent 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:05.020
 we will start with the bow first old 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.020
 proven 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:28.990
 half these paris well of course mixing 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:33.590
 Of course more thin knife you cut the alley 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:36.110
 simple and love i must say that 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:48.790
 samara products stick more 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:48.790
 intense blade even more clay 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:03:00.670
 wide filigree 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
 cut out 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.409
 or subtly stronger 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:27.720
 halogen weight turned out to be something else 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:30.600
 kicks and start they can say 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:45.419
 same then the uranium itself ends and 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:45.810
 the tip the tip is not a sight from now on 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:56.930
 herself 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:56.930
 tomato side 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:21.790
 here is a special difference I thought that 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:45.480
 felt also here a special difference to 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:58.810
 the end of the hole there is no passage behind it 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:06:07.350
 it turns out somewhere up to 2 times just 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:12.850
 wonderful knife balanced handle 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:25.690
 keep him comfortable exactly work by 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:32.669
 products balanced middle weight 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:32.669
 flour from more convenient seems to me 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:41.640
 just great love the internet 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.430
 throw a tomato small not 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:57.350
 indicative therefore such tests 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:57.350
 so I decided to just be recognized 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.310
 while everyone will continue to use everything
