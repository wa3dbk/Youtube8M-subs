what this reef putty is all about or
this<00:00:09.960> reef<00:00:10.170> glue<00:00:10.440> basically<00:00:11.340> comes<00:00:11.580> in<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.790> tube

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
this reef glue basically comes in a tube

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.959 
this reef glue basically comes in a tube
about<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.599> size<00:00:13.219> this<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.519> small<00:00:14.759> size

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
about this size this is the small size

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.080 
about this size this is the small size
you<00:00:15.150> can<00:00:15.240> get<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.560> larger<00:00:16.560> amount<00:00:16.980> from<00:00:17.460> your

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
you can get a larger amount from your

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.120 
you can get a larger amount from your
pet<00:00:18.300> store<00:00:18.600> or<00:00:18.750> petco<00:00:19.260> or<00:00:19.289> wherever<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.980> guys

pet store or petco or wherever you guys

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.570 
pet store or petco or wherever you guys
get<00:00:21.119> your<00:00:21.270> fish<00:00:21.510> stuff<00:00:21.810> from<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.859> basically

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
get your fish stuff from but basically

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.179 
get your fish stuff from but basically
what<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:25.550> putty<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:27.019> a<00:00:28.019> tube<00:00:28.830> that

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
what this is is putty in a tube that

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.229 
what this is is putty in a tube that
basically<00:00:30.000> has<00:00:30.810> sort<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.380> like<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:32.239> greenish

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
basically has sort of like a greenish

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.590 
basically has sort of like a greenish
interior<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.820> what<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.149> have<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.510> do

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
interior to it and what you have to do

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.930 
interior to it and what you have to do
is<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.930> cut<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> piece<00:00:37.440> off<00:00:37.649> I'm<00:00:38.610> not<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:38.879> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
is you cut a piece off I'm not going to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.290 
is you cut a piece off I'm not going to
do<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.149> now<00:00:39.270> because<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.750> only<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.260> hand

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
do it now because I only have one hand

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.850 
do it now because I only have one hand
but<00:00:42.300> you'd<00:00:43.260> cut<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> piece<00:00:43.770> off<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.430> basically

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
but you'd cut a piece off and basically

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.470 
but you'd cut a piece off and basically
you<00:00:46.860> would<00:00:47.010> mix<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.579> together<00:00:47.730> with<00:00:48.059> your<00:00:48.180> hand

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
you would mix it together with your hand

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.069 
you would mix it together with your hand
so<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.870> interior<00:00:50.719> texture<00:00:51.719> or<00:00:51.840> whatever

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
so that the interior texture or whatever

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.319 
so that the interior texture or whatever
that<00:00:52.170> part<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> interior<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.340> mixes<00:00:54.180> with

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
that part of the interior is mixes with

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.450 
that part of the interior is mixes with
the<00:00:54.360> exterior<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.800> would<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.039> roll<00:00:56.280> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the exterior and you would just roll it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.000 
the exterior and you would just roll it
into<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.789> ball<00:00:56.879> until<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.840> finally<00:00:58.379> all<00:00:58.559> mixes

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
into a ball until it finally all mixes

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.790 
into a ball until it finally all mixes
together<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.550> forms<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.559> specific<00:01:01.559> color

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
together and forms a specific color

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.969 
together and forms a specific color
which<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> dark<00:01:02.910> grayish<00:01:03.780> color<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.350> as

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
which is a dark grayish color and as

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.679 
which is a dark grayish color and as
soon<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.369> see<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.610> color<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.360> apply

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
soon as you see that color you can apply

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.130 
soon as you see that color you can apply
anywhere<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> tank<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:09.090> what<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:09.990> have

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
anywhere in the tank and what you have

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140 
anywhere in the tank and what you have
to<00:01:10.290> make<00:01:10.530> sure<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.830> remember<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> turn<00:01:11.970> off

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
to make sure you remember is turn off

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.730 
to make sure you remember is turn off
your<00:01:12.360> protein<00:01:12.780> skimmer<00:01:13.049> because<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.500> didn't

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
your protein skimmer because we didn't

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.620 
your protein skimmer because we didn't
turn<00:01:13.890> off<00:01:14.040> our<00:01:14.189> protein<00:01:14.580> skimmer<00:01:14.850> it's

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
turn off our protein skimmer it's

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.090 
turn off our protein skimmer it's
setting<00:01:15.930> them<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.049> directions<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:16.860> didn't

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
setting them in directions and we didn't

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.310 
setting them in directions and we didn't
do<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.369> because<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:17.880> didn't<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.540> why<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.810> have

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
do it because we didn't see why you have

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.530 
do it because we didn't see why you have
to<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:20.930> you<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.950> some<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.210> now

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
to and you can see some of it now

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.920 
to and you can see some of it now
there's<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.409> whole<00:01:25.680> bunch<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.100> bubbles<00:01:26.930> located

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
there's a whole bunch of bubbles located

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.530 
there's a whole bunch of bubbles located
in<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.140> general<00:01:28.470> area<00:01:28.670> it's<00:01:29.670> clearing<00:01:30.329> up

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
in this general area it's clearing up

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.020 
in this general area it's clearing up
now<00:01:30.720> because<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.140> been<00:01:31.740> past<00:01:32.009> 48<00:01:32.430> hours<00:01:32.549> it's

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
now because it's been past 48 hours it's

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.420 
now because it's been past 48 hours it's
already<00:01:33.329> four<00:01:33.810> days<00:01:34.020> since<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:34.890> applied<00:01:35.189> this

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
already four days since we applied this

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.160 
already four days since we applied this
but<00:01:37.939> what<00:01:38.939> happens<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> protein<00:01:39.930> skimmer

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
but what happens is the protein skimmer

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.010 
but what happens is the protein skimmer
will<00:01:40.259> begin<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.939> you<00:01:41.939> know<00:01:42.090> flip<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.780> because

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
will begin to you know flip out because

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.920 
will begin to you know flip out because
that's<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.790> putty<00:01:44.790> stuff<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.600> put<00:01:45.810> in

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
that's that putty stuff that you put in

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.020 
that's that putty stuff that you put in
there<00:01:46.079> has<00:01:46.530> whatever<00:01:47.009> chemicals<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
there has whatever chemicals in it and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.139 
there has whatever chemicals in it and
it<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.200> protein<00:01:49.619> skimmer<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.159> skims<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.060> all

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
it the protein skimmer just skims it all

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.660 
it the protein skimmer just skims it all
out<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.720> takes<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.530> whatever<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.280> there<00:01:53.460> out

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
out it takes it whatever is in there out

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.609 
out it takes it whatever is in there out
of<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.850> water<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.899> whole<00:01:55.079> protein

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
of the water and the whole protein

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.459 
of the water and the whole protein
skimmer<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.119> exploded<00:01:58.020> all<00:01:58.409> over

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
skimmer just you know exploded all over

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.630 
skimmer just you know exploded all over
the<00:01:59.100> place<00:01:59.340> with<00:01:59.880> all<00:01:59.939> this<00:02:00.360> water<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.640> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
the place with all this water and the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.370 
the place with all this water and the
bubbles<00:02:03.060> are<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.420> coming<00:02:03.630> from<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.020> protein

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
bubbles are just coming from the protein

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.950 
bubbles are just coming from the protein
