the<00:00:08.049> blade<00:00:08.320> uses<00:00:08.920> four<00:00:09.280> LF<00:00:09.940> drivers<00:00:10.420> these<00:00:10.660> are

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
the blade uses four LF drivers these are

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.020 
the blade uses four LF drivers these are
8-inch<00:00:11.379> drivers<00:00:11.860> and<00:00:12.039> we've<00:00:12.580> completely

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
8-inch drivers and we've completely

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.910 
8-inch drivers and we've completely
redesigned<00:00:13.629> them<00:00:13.869> compared<00:00:14.349> to<00:00:14.440> the<00:00:14.559> ones<00:00:14.740> we

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
redesigned them compared to the ones we

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.790 
redesigned them compared to the ones we
used<00:00:15.129> on<00:00:15.280> the<00:00:15.400> concept<00:00:15.879> and<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:17.230> reason<00:00:17.710> we

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
used on the concept and the reason we

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.320 
used on the concept and the reason we
did<00:00:17.949> that<00:00:18.010> is<00:00:18.160> we<00:00:18.310> wanted<00:00:18.490> an<00:00:18.880> even<00:00:19.119> better

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
did that is we wanted an even better

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.990 
did that is we wanted an even better
level<00:00:19.750> of<00:00:19.960> bass<00:00:20.199> performance<00:00:20.910> compared<00:00:21.910> to

what<00:00:22.150> we<00:00:22.269> were<00:00:22.359> getting<00:00:22.480> before<00:00:22.779> and<00:00:23.199> in

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
what we were getting before and in

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.460 
what we were getting before and in
redesigning<00:00:24.970> them<00:00:25.150> we've<00:00:25.330> included<00:00:25.840> some<00:00:26.230> new

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
redesigning them we've included some new

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.430 
redesigning them we've included some new

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
level of performance for example there's

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.959 
level of performance for example there's
a<00:00:31.960> vented<00:00:32.410> coupler<00:00:32.770> system<00:00:33.190> which<00:00:33.430> joins<00:00:33.760> the

with<00:00:36.550> some<00:00:36.789> conventional<00:00:37.449> drivers<00:00:38.260> is<00:00:38.410> that

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
with some conventional drivers is that

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.020
