00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.830
 Today is about this cast there yesterday. 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.420
 is seen on from yesterday I with the help of 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.910
 watching staff made a cast 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.010
 then he counts on the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.500
 presence of thiago neves report that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.109
 left on August 14 he was in the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.480
 Week ago has some selection 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.010
 You borrowed from my friend of mine. 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.320
 friend vieira lucas lent me this 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.349
 lucas pretto there came the loaned me 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.640
 Lucas, I'll tell you this and he's there. 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.040
 nor has ronaldinho gaucho who is a 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.440
 player I love oscar o paulinho 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.290
 It's also quite good, I bought the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.489
 thiago silva for 520 thousand he was 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.250
 very cheap 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.719
 thiago silva 90 has the blue light felipe 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.700
 that I paid a little bit more expensive 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.590
 very worth it because it is much better 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.780
 that Marcelo and I can still change 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.000
 he for the marcelo in my team too 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.120
 of them is my main team 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.710
 I did not buy thiago davi luiz 83 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.539
 because I thought it was not worth it and is 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.550
 Of course I wanted to have daniel 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.890
 bristot here but it costs type 80 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.409
 million and ac galera among several 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.869
 goalkeepers I prefer diego alves who 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.119
 he has 90 jumps and 90 reflexes 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.680
 I think it's a lot better but the goal is not just 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.170
 show the cast we will not play the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.420
 departure goes very well guys we go 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.880
 Face a very good guy here. 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.890
 He has incredible players. 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.210
 well then come in yesterday at the station 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.490
 When I finished setting up this team. 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.350
 I left the match tied, people stayed 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.110
 very very angry because we played 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.140
 much better and this team is very good 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.610
 thiago snows is the left tip him me 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.890
 disappointed a bit I took and put 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.329
 the Christian ronaldo but still the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.340
 people could not win 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.950
 sincerely was close but we will see if 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.850
 now we can go-go neymar 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.950
 Neymar's father will score neymar already arrived 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.079
 with the pressure there what I wanted to talk about 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.659
 For you, I wish I had put 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.360
 that uniform that looks like Brazil knows 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.070
 why for those who do not know the ultimate in 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.409
 team does not have a selection uniform 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.360
 only of teams but has a uniform that is 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.520
 very similar to that of Brazil, which is 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.619
 yellow blue with white stocking 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.270
 only that the uniform text does not really 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.619
 I do not even know the name of this uniform. 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.780
 What can we say the name of this 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.250
 uniform says that I put it here for us 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.690
 because I loved it 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.790
 I want this team to be my 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.790
 brazilian selection because chupa dunga 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.220
 dwarf galley already taking a very silly goal 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.030
 face of a kick in the middle of the field to 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.580
 Touch him, man, this is bad. 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:44.340
 good as they say turning is hotter 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:47.390
 Come on, we can never get here. 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:53.100
 you have not requested 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:55.440
 I do not believe this, man. I was 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.540
 prevented at the time that ronald is meun and 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.410
 It's a little strange and I asked no more. 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.530
 Afi, and good lucas. 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:11.810
 baylay is going and neither are you the best 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.810
 attacker had neymar going almost there 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:25.650
 ooo almost tim and hi after a crap 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:27.269
 How are you? 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:35.670
 It's good that davi luiz made it 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:40.980
 our ae almost the shit does shit 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:45.360
 Oh my God, what's going on? 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.100
 lucas lucas lucas cross on 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.850
 paulinho left for paulinho to kick 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.700
 paulinho ae tony kicked better than 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.040
 I really thought it was lacking for the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.380
 Guys, the first half is not over. 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.000
 guys, I believe that's what we are. 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.220
 playing better but I have one 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.900
 problem to finalize I do not know why 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.670
 that then if we had neymar 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.860
 green as the left and the other 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.090
 attacker could be better equipped to arm 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.950
 plays but I think we'll go 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.950
 get the turn in the second half goes 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.600
 I believe that this ball went through so much 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.650
 people when they arrived in the middle did not 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.650
 got the 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:35.190
 the ronaldinho ronaldinho will go 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:42.710
 Oh my god, I kicked the sky 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:42.710
 lots of beautiful cars to call 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.540

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.880

 Goalie look at this 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.860

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.090

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.090
 what a beautiful goal 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.360
 No, I do not like that kind of 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.460
 I do not like this type yet. 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:17.670

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.380
 paulinho calmly goes, Lucas I am 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.090
 relying heavily on Lucas to head 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.090
 He's too quiet for this. 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.160
 Ok, the team's filipe luis is 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.890

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:12.600

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.320
 turn this game 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:27.780
 no, this is not good, it's not good to have 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:30.170
 rui alves best goalkeeper of Brazil 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.170

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.940
 I got something with that corner 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.020
 We have succeeded was david luiz 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:45.030

 will end tied guys I will not 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:29.320
 I think it's just that the game is 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:32.260
 to end up not the galley that I play another one 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.180
 Like yesterday, we played better only yesterday. 

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.940
