 also my music education is a bit 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.449
 limited but good it is to fight them 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.670
 this roll comes during the 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.079
 The main melody of the song is 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.640
 that they redouble the tarola while going 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.070
 accentuating the toms and ends up in the 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.230

 I went up this is the roll 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.490
 well let's start this roll is based 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.030
 in a performance or combination that 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:16.350

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.350

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.810
 Y 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.630
 then we add accent the first 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.750
 performance beat the accent is what 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.420
 We give in the tarola with the right hand 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.709
 in the setback with the left foot 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.709
 and in the kick with the right foot 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.940
 after the seat that we were taking out 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.010
 a tarola with the right hand we 're going 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.900
 to play in both volumes and the last 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.850

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.740

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.720
 slow speed just going up and 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.160
