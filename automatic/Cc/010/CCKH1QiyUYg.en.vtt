satellites that they can tell where we
are<00:01:21.510> we<00:01:22.510> should<00:01:22.750> tell<00:01:22.990> us<00:01:23.080> that<00:01:23.229> we're

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
are we should tell us that we're

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:33.070 
are we should tell us that we're
somewhere<00:01:23.680> near<00:01:24.160> Nevada

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.820 

right<00:01:34.080> now<00:01:34.200> we're<00:01:34.380> about<00:01:35.720> 38.5<00:01:36.720> 3.4<00:01:37.560> miles

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
right now we're about 38.5 3.4 miles

two-part<00:01:50.540> cash<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:53.270> now<00:01:53.300> we've<00:01:53.600> gotten

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
two-part cash and so now we've gotten

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.200 
two-part cash and so now we've gotten
the<00:01:53.990> coordinates<00:01:54.410> of<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:55.400> first<00:01:55.640> part<00:01:55.880> we

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
the coordinates of the first part we

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.940 
the coordinates of the first part we
have<00:01:56.300> to<00:01:56.390> find<00:01:56.660> the<00:01:56.810> coordinates<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.530> second

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
have to find the coordinates the second
