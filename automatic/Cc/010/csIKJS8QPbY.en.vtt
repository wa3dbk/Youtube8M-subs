still<00:02:22.739> has<00:02:22.950> he<00:02:23.220> stalls<00:02:23.459> be<00:02:23.609> precise<00:02:24.000> and

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
still has he stalls be precise and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.590 
still has he stalls be precise and
pinpoint<00:02:24.630> be<00:02:25.200> comes<00:02:25.380> up<00:02:25.530> short<00:02:25.709> in<00:02:25.829> this<00:02:25.950> bowl

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
pinpoint be comes up short in this bowl

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.180 
pinpoint be comes up short in this bowl
yeah<00:02:28.600> absolutely<00:02:29.290> has<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.680> go<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.040> rail

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
yeah absolutely has to go to the rail

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.070 
yeah absolutely has to go to the rail
with<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.430> becomes<00:02:31.209> I'm<00:02:31.360> short<00:02:31.600> with<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:31.870> ball

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
with it becomes I'm short with this ball

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.040 
with it becomes I'm short with this ball
just<00:02:32.250> having<00:02:33.250> done<00:02:33.819> set<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.569> playing<00:02:34.780> shaped

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
just having done set of playing shaped

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.570 
just having done set of playing shaped
straight<00:02:35.410> on<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:35.800> then<00:02:35.920> just<00:02:35.950> blowing<00:02:36.490> it

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
straight on it and then just blowing it

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.120 
straight on it and then just blowing it
we<00:02:37.060> should<00:02:37.330> go<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.840> rail<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.410> come<00:02:38.920> off

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
we should go to the rail and come off

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.860 
we should go to the rail and come off
the<00:02:39.310> way<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.550> hair<00:02:39.880> it's<00:02:40.120> easier<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.690> go<00:02:40.810> to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
the way the hair it's easier to go to

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.930 
the way the hair it's easier to go to
the<00:02:41.080> rail<00:02:41.230> with<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.590> speed<00:02:41.860> then<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.760> it

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
the rail with the speed then it is it

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.030 
the rail with the speed then it is it
just<00:02:43.120> drift<00:02:43.569> forward<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.319> get<00:02:44.590> perfectly

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
just drift forward and get perfectly

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.270 
just drift forward and get perfectly
sure<00:02:45.280> than<00:02:45.459> yeah<00:02:45.550> absolutely<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.980> then<00:02:48.130> that

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
sure than yeah absolutely and then that

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.800 
sure than yeah absolutely and then that
you<00:02:48.400> were<00:02:48.520> a<00:02:48.550> little<00:02:48.730> bit<00:02:48.940> tight<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.360> going<00:02:49.690> to

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
you were a little bit tight to going to

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.900 
you were a little bit tight to going to
the<00:02:49.930> rail<00:02:50.080> make<00:02:50.470> sure<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.860> get<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.459> least<00:02:51.700> far

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
the rail make sure you get the least far

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.059 
the rail make sure you get the least far
enough<00:02:51.940> forward<00:02:52.450> if<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.319> go<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.650> wrap<00:02:53.860> up

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
enough forward if you go to the wrap up

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.510 
enough forward if you go to the wrap up
shorty<00:02:54.400> straight<00:02:54.640> up<00:02:56.069> alright<00:02:57.069> if<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.310> may<00:02:57.400> not

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
shorty straight up alright if it may not

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.580 
shorty straight up alright if it may not
had<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.850> angle<00:02:58.150> he<00:02:58.300> hit<00:02:58.390> that<00:02:58.540> good<00:02:58.750> either

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
had the angle he hit that good either

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.199 
had the angle he hit that good either
they're<00:02:59.830> really<00:03:00.100> good<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.489> thought<00:03:00.910> he<00:03:01.000> had<00:03:01.120> the

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
they're really good I thought he had the

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.640 
they're really good I thought he had the
angle<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.480> go<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.720> rail<00:03:01.870> could<00:03:02.410> achieve

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
angle to go the rail could achieve

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.729 
angle to go the rail could achieve

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
that I don't like this at all I would

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.100 
that I don't like this at all I would
rather<00:04:13.010> choose<00:04:13.580> to<00:04:14.330> one<00:04:14.540> of<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:14.750> other<00:04:14.780> two

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
rather choose to one of the other two

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.430 
rather choose to one of the other two
balls<00:04:15.349> first<00:04:15.699> you<00:04:16.699> draw<00:04:17.090> it<00:04:17.150> back<00:04:17.329> and<00:04:17.600> I<00:04:17.780> mean

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
balls first you draw it back and I mean

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.870 
balls first you draw it back and I mean
if<00:04:18.590> it<00:04:18.709> goes<00:04:18.889> it<00:04:19.130> could<00:04:19.280> either<00:04:19.459> real<00:04:19.699> good

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
if it goes it could either real good

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.250 
if it goes it could either real good
look<00:04:20.180> it<00:04:21.109> looks<00:04:21.320> like<00:04:21.380> it's<00:04:21.590> easy<00:04:21.799> but<00:04:23.260> they're

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
look it looks like it's easy but they're

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.010 
look it looks like it's easy but they're
good<00:04:24.470> ones<00:04:24.729> he<00:04:25.729> almost<00:04:26.120> missed<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.870> whole

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
good ones he almost missed the whole

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.920 
good ones he almost missed the whole
ball<00:04:27.700> he<00:04:28.700> just<00:04:28.880> barely<00:04:29.060> waved<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.510> egg<00:04:29.660> is<00:04:29.690> it

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
ball he just barely waved that egg is it

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.159 
ball he just barely waved that egg is it
barely<00:04:30.620> move<00:04:30.860> I<00:04:31.040> wonder<00:04:31.430> if<00:04:31.520> he<00:04:31.960> almost<00:04:32.960> had<00:04:33.139> a

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
barely move I wonder if he almost had a

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.950 
barely move I wonder if he almost had a
