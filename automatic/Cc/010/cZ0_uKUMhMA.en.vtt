 welcome to metabolism tv your source 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.390
 of correct information about the 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.300
 metabolism and health and tuna but 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.130
 as in water or in oil I do frank 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.739
 Suarez specialist in obesity in the 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.660
 good tourism I want to answer one of 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.489
 the questions of the friend Emilio Torres 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.680
 who writes to us and thanks for writing 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.520
 us in metabolism tv 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.280
 on the subject of tuna fish 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.080
 that it must be in oil or in water for 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.410
 to be able to answer that question which is a 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.390
 question more than valid and that would be 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.340
 recommended for effects of one power 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.870
 lose weight more easily 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.390
 I'm going to go momentarily the blackboard 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.090
 refresh the theme of the difference between 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.970
 the passive nervous system and the system 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.590
 nervous excited maybe remember in 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.740
 previous episodes I was talking about 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.600
 of the importance of you knowing if 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.600
 you have a passive nervous system 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.380
 excited if you have doubts about this topic 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.470
 please 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.259
 look at the metabolism screen tv 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.500
 look for previous episodes look for the 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.110
 passive or excited topic there is like 15 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.119
 videos 15 episodes that explain this 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.300
 issue and there are a couple of them for example 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.250
 I think that the number 199 gives 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.600
 exactly as you determine if 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.330
 you have a passive nervous system 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.580
 excited I can tell you from now on that 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.229
 if you are in doubt with that subject say 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.970
 your nervous system is passively excited 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.890
 it's going to be very difficult to lose weight 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.380
 you have to be certain 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.270
 security of whether he is passive or excited by 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.390
 example I know that my body has a 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.270
 passive nervous system therefore a 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.250
 carnivorous body fat does not make me fat 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.440
 much what fattens me is the bread the 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.259
 flour the rice that kind of stuff if 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.080
 you have nervous system excited 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.450
 like 'Jorge or my wife are bodies that 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.520
 fatten very easily with fat and 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.649
 with salt that is a type of 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.480
 body that works differently needs a 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.980
 different fuel so it's 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.770
 important that you know if your body 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.140
 is the passive nervous system or the 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.459
 nervous system excited while more 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.130
 we work with this with thousands of 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.500
 more important people we give to the 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.000
 fact that we are not all the same as 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.630
 is explained in the book the power of 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.450
 metabolism 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.400
 We are not all equal, therefore we do not 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.280
 there may be a diet that is the same 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.260
 for everyone now going briefly on 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.690
 the subject this of passive excited 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.470
 Well, the person who has a system 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.600
 passive nervous 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.600
 versus the one who has an excited 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.180
 is basically what reflects how many 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.820
 body movements has the form 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.840
 natural the passive nervous system is a 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:59.680
 body that what diet right for him 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.120
 is a diet that you owe a diet that 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.630
 can use red meats without 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.390
 problems 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.670
 red meat benefits the system 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.690
 nervous excited because he needs more 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.460
 White meats 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.470
 white meat we are talking about chicken 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.440
 turkey and fish those things with less 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.760
 fat this the passive nervous system 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.310
 Well, you can, for example, eat cheese 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.620
 no problems and cheese with fat and no 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.970
 has problem does not make you fat though 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.269
 which has the nervous system excited 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.780
 digital more go move towards the cheese 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.239
 white country cheese country cheese 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.459
 it's a much lower fat cheese 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.260
 the cheese creams are high in 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.940
 fats and it will not suit you 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.140
 that they have nervous system located like 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.180
 you know if it is passive 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.370
 mainly looking like his body 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.620
 reacts if the body has a lot 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.180
 ease to sleep sleeps deep and 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.799
 nothing wakes him up and he can eat up 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.650
 stone you have nervous system 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:01.290
 passive if you have a one body system 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.870
 who complains about some meals that are 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.940
 eat late does not sleep well that salt 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.260
 it falls badly that bad dekay fat has 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.750
 nervous system excited but that is 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.909
 explains well in the episode of 199 the 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.180
 200 and others can not be more detailed 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:18.539
 the point is that the type of diet 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.220
 diet what is consumed because the diet is 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.790
 as the fuel of the body 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.070
 gas 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.350
 there are cars that run on gasoline and there are 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.640
 cars that run with diesel the car of 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.020
 gasoline is not going to run well with 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.280
 Diesel and the one you say will not run 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.600
 well with gasoline because they are engines 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.550
 different for the same thing happens with the 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.110
 body so basically the diet is 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.240
 as if it were the fuel of the body 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.550
 it is important that you know and to 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.040
 answer this question from the friend towers 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.010
 Emilio Torre asks us if the 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.670
 fish if the tuna should choose it in 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.650
 water or tuna in oil because the question 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.450
 with questions Emilio answered 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.790
 Knowing if your body has a system 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.430
 nervous excited or passive if you have a 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.350
 passive nervous system that has a 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.210
 carnivorous body that eats meat that 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.040
 sleep well that everything you eat well 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.240
 everything digests well because you can not 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.130
 eat in fat without any kind of 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.950
 problem if you have a nervous system 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.830
 excited so we're going to recommend that 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.730
 you eat it in water, maybe even the 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.110
 Tuna is not the type of fish please 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.430
 preferable for your body type not 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.560
 for the person who has a system 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.409
 nervous excited is recommended the 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.479
 white fish white fish 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.469
 and that we're going to see now for the 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.719
 person who has the nervous system 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:35.779
 passive so you can use any fish 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:37.159
 anyone is anyone's fish 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:38.539
 the advantage that you have to have a 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.509
 passive nervous system that can eat 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.339
 of everything and nothing fattens you nothing more than 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.529
 the bread the flour the rice the potato the 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:46.759
 sweet that kind of thing and that is that they have 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:48.019
 excited nervous system has to 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.999
 be careful with fat because where 

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:51.739
 want there to be thank you come fat where 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:53.839
 I wanted to hunt the van gogh so, so 

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:54.979
 let's see for a moment some images 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:56.899
 that we're going to see it here in the 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.999
 computer to see a little bit 

00:05:56.899 --> 00:06:01.969
 photos of fish and as you know is a 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:05.239
 fish is recommended for your type of 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:07.650
 body or is not the piece over here 

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:10.889
 I have some images already separated 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.300
 here they are seeing for example fish 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:14.190
 White 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.280
 the fish is white or fish 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:22.350
 as in puerto rico we say mexican chile 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:24.150
 they call it chimichanga this the sea bass the 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.180
 cod 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:30.420
 elmer or tilapia all those fish 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.610
 they are white that white which means 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.050
 is that a person is low in fat 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.090
 who has an excited nervous system 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.040
 having trouble sleeping the 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.280
 body retains salt that red meat 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.740
 they fall ill is a body that kind of 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.290
 fish that you like is the fish 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.990
 white because everything is low in fat 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.280
 having fat does not help to lose weight 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.620
 the person who has nervous system 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.970
 excited so if you have the 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.280
 nervous system excited and has 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.950
 difficulty sleeping keeps fluid 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.630
 the body some things fall to him marsico 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.340
 metal at night falls badly because 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.410
 have you try to eat more 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.570
 fish if you like fish should be 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.700
 white fish not now if you have a 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.070
 passive nervous system like mine that 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.680
 as it is stone and I can eat at 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:17.550
 three in the morning and I sleep like a baby 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:20.039
 then you can already give the fish 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.750
 like the salmon of the salmon the red that 

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:23.699
 salmon red which means that 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.009
 it has grease what makes it reddish in the 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:28.259
 fat so the fish the more 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:30.660
 reddish ones are more fats have by 

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:32.580
 example the salmon has fat but the 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.050
 tuna has more fat than the 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.229
 salmon and that's why it's redder than 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:39.479
 salmon so the same color tells you 

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:41.759
 you for example the sardines are like 

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:44.490
 reddish orange because they have more 

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:47.099
 fat so you can know in base 

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.870
 to the color of the fish meat if it is 

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:51.120
 convenient for you or not 

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.250
 convenient for this and the reality is 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.330
 that all this is discussed because the 

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.330
 truth always triumphs
