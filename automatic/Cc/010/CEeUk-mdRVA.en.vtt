00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.710 
a lot more so we'll see yesterday the
app<00:02:09.440> said<00:02:09.740> that<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:09.950> only<00:02:10.160> did<00:02:10.580> like<00:02:10.819> 5,000

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
app said that I only did like 5,000

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.020 
app said that I only did like 5,000
steps<00:02:11.900> which<00:02:12.140> even<00:02:13.040> with<00:02:13.160> two<00:02:13.459> walks

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
steps which even with two walks

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.150 
steps which even with two walks
I<00:02:14.209> don't<00:02:15.170> know<00:02:15.230> how<00:02:15.349> accurate<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.830> app<00:02:15.920> is

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
I don't know how accurate the app is

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.910 
I don't know how accurate the app is
compared<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:16.970> pedometer<00:02:17.560> but<00:02:18.560> on<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.740> flip

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
compared to a pedometer but on the flip

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.290 
compared to a pedometer but on the flip
side<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.190> pedometer<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.610> also<00:02:20.000> being

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
side of pedometer and also being

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.720 
side of pedometer and also being
accurate<00:02:20.780> because<00:02:20.870> every<00:02:21.500> slight<00:02:22.190> move<00:02:22.490> my

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
accurate because every slight move my

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.240 
accurate because every slight move my
step<00:02:22.940> count<00:02:23.390> as<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.540> step<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.560> guess<00:02:25.160> you

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
step count as a step so I guess you

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.410 
step count as a step so I guess you
don't<00:02:25.370> take<00:02:25.459> it<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.580> grain<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.880> salt<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.330> think

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
don't take it the grain of salt I think

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.110 
don't take it the grain of salt I think
about<00:02:26.720> getting<00:02:26.900> one<00:02:26.989> of<00:02:27.020> those<00:02:27.110> fitbit's

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
about getting one of those fitbit's

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.250 
about getting one of those fitbit's
