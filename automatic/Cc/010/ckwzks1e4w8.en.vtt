 merciless lord of people and animals 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.640
 she could sow fear where she pleases 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.020
 now she was far away from her homeland 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.020
 on the verge of madness 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.340
 from hunger and months of wandering and her army 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.219

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.590
 either they were caught worse than death barely 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.960
 she crossed the boundary of the ancient forest in 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.570
 the darkness flashes the glowing gaze of something 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.270
 beautiful and deadly looking 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.850
 imagine prey secrete twilight silently 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.010
 she turned and left and took hold 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.810
 rage grabbing a rusty dagger she 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.270
 rushed after the beast in the hope 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.790
 return at least a piece of the past glory but 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.250
 mining all eluded her three times 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.040
 she cornered the beast and three times she 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.409
 attacked but saw only escaping in 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.689
 the forest the shadow illuminating everything around gone 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.229
 full moon and track the beast became 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.990
 easier 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.270

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.369
 the cat was no longer hiding in 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.829

 rushed at her seemed death at last 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.540
 overtook her but she calmly stopped 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.659
 after a moment the beast knocked the dagger out of her 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.450
 hands and disappeared into the forest the silence of the figure in 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.950
 hoods approached her 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.470

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.509
 led her and experienced or unwittingly she 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.270
 performed the sacred ritual of the dark moon 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.490
 warriors of silver forests and offered 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.509
 choice attached to this dark and the moon 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.519

 silver forest protector and to this 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.269
 description we have a few 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.940
 of questions 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.519
 where did the moon come from and what was its former glory 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.890
 it comes from where this mysterious beast 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.290
 and people in the hoods answers these questions 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.109
 can be found in the story of the moon in the miraculous 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.900

 showed extraordinary and aspiration in 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.489
 knowledge of the lunar forces seeing such an interest 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:55.010
 and devotion then the moon devoted the moon to 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.680
 a couple of magical time but so young and 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.450
 fragile girl 1 with no such strength 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.209
 cope and help her 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.120
 the moon called a creature from the forest of the moon 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.760
 the cat that also gave power 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.579
 moonlight becoming a warrior guard under 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.609
 a sign of agility and speed the moon never 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.829
 not sleeping and always ready to go into battle and and 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:18.440
 the same is applied in several goals 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.230
 and directing your lunar energy to the enemy 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.199
 she stuns him and inflicts great 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.840
 the amount of damage shining like lonely 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:29.900
 star among the cold sky moon munf he 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.000
 has an aura that enhances the attack of all 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.549
 nearby ranged heroes 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.010
 if lu is not in danger she 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.290
 addresses the starry sky and causes 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.780
 eclipse eclipse starts to close 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.359
 moonlight and the rays that go beyond 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.090
 the brink illuminates the earth in strong flashes 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:50.030
 and those enemies that will fall under the action 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.760
 these people will get severe burns 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.690
 no luck to those who come across elfs 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.879
 one on one 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.129
 causing an eclipse the rays will fall in 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.590
 random order but when on the battlefield 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.569
 only one goal then all the flashes will be 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.120
 turned on her 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.280
 despite its strength and skill worth 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.829
 assume that the moon is only a part 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.480
 greater brotherhood or rather sisterhood 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.430
 test 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.069
 that the moons and these figures are in the hoods 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.440
 night elf who already 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.600
 many millennia sing their songs and 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.419
 moon goddesses when night elves 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.210
 the sisters and moons fought side by side 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.790
 side by side with the soldiers singing a song and the moon and 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.490
 often moon goddess causes her strength 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.160
 responded by sending her anger at enemies 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.820
 night elves say that to the priests or 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.610
 even 9 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.370
 image of the moon in the midday sky lending 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.040
 part of the power of the moon to the night elves leading 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.260
 nocturnal after victory priests 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.330
 prayed over the wounded and healed them 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.030
 after the war the ancients and the great rift 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.820
 Tiranda High Priestess of the Moon Rule 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.460
 general cleansing changed society 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.039
 night elves part of these changes was 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.710
 the dissolution of the army much of which is not 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.870
 wanted further battle and organization 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.810
 custody so maybe our moon 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.120
 owned by that very guardian and terrible 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.810
 Warrior, however, I think it is worth 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.360
 perceive 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.550
 the story of the moon in dota 2 as an alternative 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.580
 and a separate moonlight from warcraft 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.200
 warrior , perhaps all thank you
