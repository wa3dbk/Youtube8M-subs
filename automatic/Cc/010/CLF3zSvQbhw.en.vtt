00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.119
 they are in dreams their faces on holy canvases 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:31.430
 and I saw in your eyes that you were alone 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:49.500
 one of them I am almost certain 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.930
 that you came down from high your walk so 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.930
 as easy as clouds can do 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.250
 an angel from heaven descended into a dream Maya turned 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:12.140
 and I like mad in love with her in my soul whose sins 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:34.859
 do not count but about you I dare 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.270
 then dream but if drunk sinner 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.369
 you will be touched a little then his life 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.560

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.719

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:46.719

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:47.719
 any flour just to 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:48.719
 take your hand know that thorny path 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:49.719

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:50.719

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.490
 and sacred and pure may my life begin 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.990
 from scratch at the cost of this life you need 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.139
 the past forget the pain back with 

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:01.349
 you in the sky to sail in your name saints forever 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:07.149
 do good and only you love you 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:19.320
 an angel from heaven descended into a dream Maya turned 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:42.000
 and I, like a mad angel, fell in love with her from heaven 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:03:07.830
 Maya turned into a dream and I was mad as in love with her
