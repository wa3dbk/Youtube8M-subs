00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.210
 ends up doing everything right but for the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.370
 technical and straight and in the last quarter beyond 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.489

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.620
 crouching, there's no way it's f matter 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.390

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.879
 for you to see exactly where I 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.539
 I come to have no doubt after 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.380
 huh 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.540
 sometimes can have is a mess due 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.560
 to so many things that we have to 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.439
 seek to go in search of collectibles 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.229

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.480

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:44.730
