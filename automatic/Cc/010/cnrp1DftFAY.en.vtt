might work in the deck well and through

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.050 
might work in the deck well and through
lots<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.850> playtesting<00:01:30.479> i<00:01:30.689> found<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:32.060> is

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
lots of playtesting i found that this is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.550 
lots of playtesting i found that this is
probably<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.509> best<00:01:33.689> setup<00:01:33.960> where<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.439> have

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
probably the best setup where you have

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.960 
probably the best setup where you have
monsters<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.100> could<00:01:35.250> disturb<00:01:35.460> my<00:01:35.579> battle<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
monsters I could disturb my battle to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.090 
monsters I could disturb my battle to
bring<00:01:36.119> out<00:01:36.240> two<00:01:36.420> tokens<00:01:36.710> plus<00:01:37.710> fires<00:01:37.979> a

bring out two tokens plus fires a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
doomsday plus scapegoat now the thing

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.580 
doomsday plus scapegoat now the thing
with<00:01:41.729> tokens<00:01:41.970> stampede<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.110> only<00:01:43.200> get<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
with tokens stampede is you only get the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.719 
with tokens stampede is you only get the
effect<00:01:44.040> if<00:01:44.479> they're<00:01:45.479> all<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.750> attack<00:01:46.049> mode<00:01:46.079> and

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
effect if they're all in attack mode and

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.389 
effect if they're all in attack mode and
the<00:01:47.729> reason<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.119> can't<00:01:48.450> use<00:01:49.049> black<00:01:49.560> garden<00:01:50.159> is

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
the reason you can't use black garden is

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.130 
the reason you can't use black garden is
because<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.909> affects<00:01:51.210> all<00:01:51.450> tokens<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:52.049> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
because it affects all tokens on the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.380 
because it affects all tokens on the
field<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:53.040> if<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.460> gave<00:01:53.700> your<00:01:53.909> opponent<00:01:54.299> a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
field so if you gave your opponent a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.660 
field so if you gave your opponent a
token<00:01:54.869> through<00:01:55.110> black<00:01:55.320> Gardens<00:01:55.740> effect<00:01:56.100> it

token through black Gardens effect it

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
would gain a thousand attack and be good

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.770 
would gain a thousand attack and be good
unbe<00:01:58.909> wouldn't<00:01:59.909> be<00:01:59.969> able<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.299> destroyed<00:02:00.600> by

unbe wouldn't be able to be destroyed by

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.679 
unbe wouldn't be able to be destroyed by
battle<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:02.130> we<00:02:02.280> would<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.549> 1800<00:02:03.149> attack<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
battle so we would have 1800 attack and

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.830 
battle so we would have 1800 attack and
probably<00:02:04.229> kill<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.770> way<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:06.149> sadly<00:02:06.630> you

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
probably kill you that way so sadly you

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.119 
probably kill you that way so sadly you
can't<00:02:06.869> use<00:02:07.110> black<00:02:07.320> guarding<00:02:07.680> excite<00:02:07.920> cards

really<00:02:14.420> bad<00:02:14.599> with<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.840> lot<00:02:14.959> of<00:02:15.079> these<00:02:15.140> names

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
really bad with a lot of these names

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.670 
really bad with a lot of these names
triple<00:02:17.209> Terra<00:02:17.510> forms<00:02:17.780> probably<00:02:18.230> overkill<00:02:18.620> for

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
triple Terra forms probably overkill for

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.550 
triple Terra forms probably overkill for
it<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:19.579> I<00:02:19.909> might<00:02:20.810> end<00:02:20.959> up<00:02:21.049> just<00:02:21.200> taking<00:02:21.349> these

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
it but I might end up just taking these

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.140 
it but I might end up just taking these
cards<00:02:21.859> out<00:02:21.920> all<00:02:22.099> together<00:02:22.250> but<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.879> seems<00:02:23.060> to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
cards out all together but it seems to

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.479 
cards out all together but it seems to
work<00:02:23.269> so<00:02:23.480> far<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:24.409> main<00:02:24.680> reason<00:02:24.829> I<00:02:25.040> use<00:02:25.069> it<00:02:25.400> is

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
work so far the main reason I use it is

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.979 
work so far the main reason I use it is
because<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.909> increases<00:02:26.150> all<00:02:26.450> their<00:02:26.599> attack<00:02:26.810> by

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
because it increases all their attack by

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.429 
because it increases all their attack by
500<00:02:28.359> that's<00:02:29.359> really<00:02:29.569> good<00:02:29.719> for<00:02:29.780> tag<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.379> the

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:30.439 
500 that's really good for tag of the

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.619 
500 that's really good for tag of the
corner<00:02:30.680> dragged<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.549> want<00:02:31.730> one<00:02:32.090> other<00:02:32.359> way

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
corner dragged you want one other way

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.559 
corner dragged you want one other way
besides<00:02:33.019> just<00:02:33.889> token<00:02:34.310> stampede<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:35.150> increase

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
besides just token stampede to increase

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.490 
besides just token stampede to increase
their<00:02:35.719> attack<00:02:35.930> as<00:02:35.959> I<00:02:36.200> all<00:02:36.349> have<00:02:36.530> zero<00:02:36.799> attack

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
their attack as I all have zero attack

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.750 
their attack as I all have zero attack
that<00:02:39.500> way<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.650> can<00:02:39.799> actually<00:02:40.099> use<00:02:40.219> attack<00:02:40.489> the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
that way you can actually use attack the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.089 
that way you can actually use attack the
cornered<00:02:41.090> rat<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.989> size<00:02:42.019> token<00:02:42.620> stampede<00:02:42.920> and

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
cornered rat the size token stampede and

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.490 
cornered rat the size token stampede and
I<00:02:43.189> had<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.549> one<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.939> might<00:02:44.599> just<00:02:44.840> replace<00:02:45.290> this

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
I had that one I might just replace this

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.140 
I had that one I might just replace this
though<00:02:45.709> with<00:02:45.919> a<00:02:45.950> banner<00:02:46.280> of<00:02:46.489> courage<00:02:46.790> since

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
though with a banner of courage since

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.089 
though with a banner of courage since
that<00:02:47.299> does<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:48.169> exact<00:02:48.470> same<00:02:48.500> thing<00:02:48.950> pretty

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
that does the exact same thing pretty

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.330 
that does the exact same thing pretty
much<00:02:49.250> increases<00:02:49.760> all<00:02:49.849> their<00:02:49.970> attack<00:02:50.150> by<00:02:50.299> 200

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
much increases all their attack by 200

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.830 
much increases all their attack by 200
i'm<00:02:52.340> testing<00:02:53.090> this<00:02:53.180> one<00:02:53.329> out<00:02:53.450> because<00:02:53.569> the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
i'm testing this one out because the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.479 
i'm testing this one out because the
second<00:02:54.260> effect<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.650> actually<00:02:54.950> really<00:02:55.069> good<00:02:55.189> is

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
second effect is actually really good is

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.800 
second effect is actually really good is
if<00:02:55.609> you<00:02:55.700> steal<00:02:55.909> monster<00:02:56.359> through<00:02:56.540> creature

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
if you steal monster through creature

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.440 
if you steal monster through creature
swamp<00:02:57.200> they<00:02:58.129> can<00:02:58.280> only<00:02:58.400> target<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:59.030> monster

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
swamp they can only target that monster

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.670 
swamp they can only target that monster
for<00:02:59.569> an<00:02:59.659> attack<00:02:59.870> since<00:03:00.079> they<00:03:00.230> can't<00:03:00.469> target

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
for an attack since they can't target

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.429 
for an attack since they can't target
all<00:03:00.889> your<00:03:01.010> low<00:03:01.159> attack<00:03:01.669> monster<00:03:02.150> tokens<00:03:02.480> since

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:03.439 
all your low attack monster tokens since

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:04.780 
all your low attack monster tokens since
your<00:03:03.530> opponent<00:03:03.859> can't<00:03:04.040> target<00:03:04.400> into<00:03:04.700> your

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
monsters for an attack with Louis tag

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.679 
monsters for an attack with Louis tag
and<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:07.519> second<00:03:07.849> effect<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.239> actually<00:03:08.510> saved

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
and that second effect is actually saved

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.690 
and that second effect is actually saved
me<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.840> couple<00:03:08.870> time<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.379> this<00:03:09.500> deck<00:03:09.709> so<00:03:09.980> it

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
me a couple time to this deck so it

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.159 
me a couple time to this deck so it
still<00:03:11.000> earned<00:03:11.180> this<00:03:11.269> place<00:03:11.510> but<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:12.019> don't

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:12.169 
still earned this place but you don't

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.199 
still earned this place but you don't
want<00:03:12.319> to<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:13.129> also<00:03:13.340> destroys<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.819> large<00:03:14.030> puzzle
