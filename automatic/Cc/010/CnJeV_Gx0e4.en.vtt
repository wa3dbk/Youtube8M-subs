00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:55.049 
looking at a basic piece of river it's

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:56.689 
looking at a basic piece of river it's
kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.379> hard<00:00:55.559> if<00:00:55.739> you've<00:00:55.859> never<00:00:56.010> studied<00:00:56.519> a

kind of hard if you've never studied a

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.969 
kind of hard if you've never studied a
river<00:00:56.850> before<00:00:57.210> what<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.989> know<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.499> all<00:00:58.709> kind

right now we're going to study this
little<00:01:10.350> piece<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.710> water<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.430> let<00:01:11.730> me<00:01:11.850> zoom<00:01:12.060> in

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
little piece of water so let me zoom in

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.520 
little piece of water so let me zoom in
here<00:01:12.420> for<00:01:12.660> you<00:01:12.750> guys<00:01:17.960> what<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:18.990> want<00:01:19.230> you<00:01:19.350> guys

to look at is the difference in the
water<00:01:24.920> there's<00:01:25.920> pieces<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.400> water<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.850> are

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
water there's pieces of water that are

water there's pieces of water that are
choppy<00:01:27.800> some<00:01:28.800> of<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.280> little<00:01:29.580> bit<00:01:29.820> darker

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
choppy some of it's a little bit darker

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.940 
choppy some of it's a little bit darker
color<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:34.470> movement<00:01:35.010> of<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.340> water<00:01:36.950> if

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
color and the movement of the water if

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.490 
color and the movement of the water if
you<00:01:38.190> look<00:01:38.400> back<00:01:40.250> right<00:01:41.250> here<00:01:41.430> below<00:01:41.760> me<00:01:42.320> if<00:01:43.320> you

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
you look back right here below me if you

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.220 
you look back right here below me if you
can<00:01:43.680> see<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.550> water<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:45.870> flowing

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
can see the water it's just flowing

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.139 
can see the water it's just flowing
straight<00:01:46.740> straight<00:01:47.670> back<00:01:49.250> okay

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
straight straight back okay

00:01:52.149 --> 00:02:03.719 
straight straight back okay
but<00:01:54.310> if<00:01:55.310> you<00:01:55.520> look<00:01:57.009> this<00:01:58.009> area<00:01:58.399> over<00:01:58.579> here

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.940 

right<00:02:04.729> about<00:02:07.989> there<00:02:08.989> you<00:02:09.170> can<00:02:09.349> see<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.619> waters

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
right about there you can see the waters

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.520 
right about there you can see the waters
blowing<00:02:10.369> sideways<00:02:10.930> it's<00:02:11.930> kind<00:02:12.140> of<00:02:12.230> cutting

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
blowing sideways it's kind of cutting

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.780 
blowing sideways it's kind of cutting
off<00:02:12.709> from<00:02:13.640> left<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.060> right<00:02:15.010> okay<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.220> is<00:02:16.489> very

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
off from left to right okay that is very

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.670 
off from left to right okay that is very
important<00:02:18.099> because<00:02:19.299> what<00:02:20.299> happens<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:21.019> that's

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
important because what happens is that's

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.059 
important because what happens is that's
your<00:02:22.160> channel<00:02:22.640> that's<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.720> current<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.799> main

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
your channel that's the current the main

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.750 
your channel that's the current the main
current<00:02:25.519> of<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.060> river<00:02:26.269> and<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.489> channel

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
current of the river and in the channel

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.650 
current of the river and in the channel
you'll<00:02:29.510> find<00:02:29.599> deepest<00:02:30.590> spots<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:32.090> this<00:02:32.269> bottle

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
you'll find deepest spots so this bottle

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.729 
you'll find deepest spots so this bottle
right<00:02:32.810> here<00:02:32.870> is<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.170> perfect<00:02:33.590> demonstration

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
right here is a perfect demonstration

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.970 
right here is a perfect demonstration
let's<00:02:34.310> follow<00:02:34.519> this<00:02:34.790> bottle<00:02:35.440> its<00:02:36.440> fault<00:02:36.769> its

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
let's follow this bottle its fault its

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.280 
let's follow this bottle its fault its
if<00:02:37.819> you<00:02:37.970> can<00:02:38.120> see<00:02:38.329> it<00:02:38.420> I'll<00:02:38.510> zoom<00:02:38.750> out<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:38.989> you

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
if you can see it I'll zoom out so you

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.229 
if you can see it I'll zoom out so you
can<00:02:39.500> see<00:02:39.620> where<00:02:39.799> it's<00:02:39.950> sitting<00:02:40.190> it's<00:02:40.879> cutting

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
can see where it's sitting it's cutting

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.600 
can see where it's sitting it's cutting
across<00:02:41.629> the<00:02:41.930> river<00:02:45.099> instead<00:02:46.099> of<00:02:46.400> going

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
across the river instead of going

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.770 
across the river instead of going
straight<00:02:46.640> down<00:02:46.940> it's<00:02:47.299> cutting<00:02:47.569> across

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
straight down it's cutting across

00:02:47.780 --> 00:03:01.960 
straight down it's cutting across
because<00:02:48.019> that's<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.470> main<00:02:48.680> channel<00:03:00.970> all

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
because that's the main channel all

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.370 
because that's the main channel all
right<00:03:02.120> there<00:03:02.269> we<00:03:02.359> go<00:03:03.190> okay<00:03:04.220> right<00:03:04.579> there<00:03:05.380> right

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
right there we go okay right there right

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.289 
right there we go okay right there right
there<00:03:06.680> where<00:03:06.829> that<00:03:06.859> choppy<00:03:07.220> water<00:03:07.549> is<00:03:07.790> where

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
there where that choppy water is where

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:15.720 
there where that choppy water is where
it's<00:03:08.420> hitting<00:03:08.630> right<00:03:08.750> now<00:03:11.709> that's<00:03:12.709> where<00:03:12.980> the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.059 

the<00:03:16.730> channel<00:03:17.150> hits<00:03:17.389> the<00:03:17.569> bank<00:03:17.870> see<00:03:18.859> where<00:03:19.010> the

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
the channel hits the bank see where the

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.460 
the channel hits the bank see where the
trees<00:03:19.310> are<00:03:19.340> at<00:03:19.609> and<00:03:20.209> right<00:03:20.780> where<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.139> bottles

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
trees are at and right where the bottles

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.449 
trees are at and right where the bottles
sitting<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.040> deepest<00:03:22.880> part<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:24.459> the

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
sitting is the deepest part of the

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.539 
sitting is the deepest part of the
channel<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:26.739> right<00:03:27.739> there<00:03:28.130> is<00:03:28.250> where<00:03:28.280> the

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
channel and right there is where the

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.460 
channel and right there is where the
fish<00:03:28.819> hold<00:03:29.090> up<00:03:30.579> now<00:03:31.579> that<00:03:31.819> channel<00:03:32.329> that<00:03:32.510> that

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
fish hold up now that channel that that

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.729 
fish hold up now that channel that that
hole<00:03:33.739> I<00:03:33.769> mean<00:03:34.150> it'll<00:03:35.150> it'll<00:03:35.750> run<00:03:36.049> along<00:03:36.590> the

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
hole I mean it'll it'll run along the

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.069 
hole I mean it'll it'll run along the
bank<00:03:37.010> a<00:03:37.190> little<00:03:37.220> ways<00:03:38.889> so<00:03:39.889> it'll<00:03:40.099> come<00:03:40.340> down

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
bank a little ways so it'll come down

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.710 
bank a little ways so it'll come down
probably<00:03:42.790> maybe<00:03:43.790> even<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.239> where<00:03:44.419> this<00:03:44.510> other

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
probably maybe even to where this other

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:52.270 
probably maybe even to where this other
little<00:03:47.620> white<00:03:48.620> thing<00:03:48.889> is<00:03:50.799> but<00:03:51.799> the<00:03:51.919> primary

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
little white thing is but the primary

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.750 
little white thing is but the primary
deepest<00:03:53.150> part<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.599> the<00:03:53.720> hole<00:03:54.250> will<00:03:55.250> be<00:03:55.280> right

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
deepest part of the hole will be right

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.020 
deepest part of the hole will be right
there<00:03:56.180> where<00:03:56.989> that<00:03:57.019> bottle<00:03:57.560> landed<00:03:57.950> for<00:03:58.849> that

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
there where that bottle landed for that

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.080 
there where that bottle landed for that
choppy<00:03:59.419> water<00:04:00.909> hits<00:04:01.909> right<00:04:02.299> there

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
choppy water hits right there

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.730 
choppy water hits right there
if<00:04:05.090> you<00:04:05.240> look<00:04:05.450> closely<00:04:05.810> you<00:04:06.110> see<00:04:06.290> that<00:04:06.470> choppy

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
if you look closely you see that choppy

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.500 
if you look closely you see that choppy
water<00:04:08.230> that's<00:04:09.230> shallow<00:04:10.180> it's<00:04:11.180> actually

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
water that's shallow it's actually

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.420 
water that's shallow it's actually
shallow<00:04:11.810> all<00:04:12.080> all<00:04:12.350> that<00:04:12.830> and<00:04:13.010> what's<00:04:13.220> behind

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
shallow all all that and what's behind

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.099 
shallow all all that and what's behind
it<00:04:13.700> shallow<00:04:14.000> but<00:04:14.180> then<00:04:14.360> right<00:04:16.690> right<00:04:17.690> after

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
it shallow but then right right after

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:28.030 
it shallow but then right right after
that<00:04:18.320> right<00:04:19.630> where<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:20.750> water<00:04:20.959> changes<00:04:27.040> right

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
that right where the water changes right

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.590 
that right where the water changes right
there<00:04:28.970> that's<00:04:29.360> where<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.780> deep<00:04:30.020> hole<00:04:30.200> is<00:04:31.600> so

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
there that's where the deep hole is so

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.880 
there that's where the deep hole is so
that's<00:04:32.840> where<00:04:33.200> your<00:04:33.320> fish<00:04:33.500> are<00:04:33.650> going<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:33.800> be

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
that's where your fish are going to be

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.370 
that's where your fish are going to be
holding<00:04:34.460> up

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
holding up

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.340 
holding up
now<00:04:36.380> what<00:04:36.620> catfish<00:04:37.070> do<00:04:37.340> is<00:04:38.140> they're<00:04:39.140> always

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
now what catfish do is they're always

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.880 
now what catfish do is they're always
busy<00:04:39.770> running<00:04:40.400> back<00:04:40.640> and<00:04:40.820> forth<00:04:41.590> so<00:04:42.590> they'll

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
busy running back and forth so they'll

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.510 
busy running back and forth so they'll
go<00:04:43.100> from<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.610> top<00:04:43.940> of<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.300> hole<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.220> very

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
go from the top of that hole to the very

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.380 
go from the top of that hole to the very
shallower<00:04:47.360> side<00:04:47.720> over<00:04:48.050> here<00:04:48.080> and<00:04:49.120> then<00:04:50.120> back

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
shallower side over here and then back

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.370 
shallower side over here and then back
up<00:04:50.419> again

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.350 

so<00:04:54.380> that's<00:04:54.650> one<00:04:55.040> hole<00:04:55.940> on<00:04:56.270> this<00:04:56.630> river<00:04:58.360> but

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
so that's one hole on this river but

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.400 
so that's one hole on this river but
there's<00:04:59.680> tons<00:05:00.680> of<00:05:00.980> holes<00:05:01.220> on<00:05:01.400> the<00:05:01.550> river<00:05:02.410> if

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
there's tons of holes on the river if

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.740 
there's tons of holes on the river if
you<00:05:03.620> look<00:05:03.830> and<00:05:04.100> follow<00:05:04.760> the<00:05:05.090> current<00:05:05.330> like<00:05:05.600> we

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
you look and follow the current like we

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.310 
you look and follow the current like we
did<00:05:05.960> just<00:05:06.230> a<00:05:06.440> little<00:05:06.470> while<00:05:06.830> ago<00:05:06.980> you<00:05:08.169> see<00:05:09.169> how

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
did just a little while ago you see how

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.340 
did just a little while ago you see how
it<00:05:09.440> comes<00:05:09.620> across<00:05:09.919> this<00:05:10.220> way<00:05:10.460> and<00:05:11.320> then<00:05:12.320> it

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
it comes across this way and then it

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:20.170 
it comes across this way and then it
goes<00:05:12.700> along<00:05:13.700> that<00:05:14.150> Bank<00:05:15.850> all<00:05:16.850> the<00:05:17.330> way<00:05:17.419> up<00:05:19.180> all

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
goes along that Bank all the way up all

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.200 
goes along that Bank all the way up all
the<00:05:20.450> way<00:05:20.510> up<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:22.370> then<00:05:22.610> you<00:05:22.729> can<00:05:22.880> see<00:05:23.090> the

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
the way up and then you can see the

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.300 
the way up and then you can see the
water<00:05:23.419> again<00:05:23.840> doing<00:05:24.229> the<00:05:24.320> same<00:05:24.560> thing<00:05:24.890> so<00:05:25.160> it's

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
water again doing the same thing so it's

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.780 
water again doing the same thing so it's
just<00:05:25.430> a<00:05:25.610> pattern<00:05:26.919> the<00:05:27.919> water<00:05:28.190> right<00:05:28.460> there<00:05:28.669> you

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
just a pattern the water right there you

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.900 
just a pattern the water right there you
see<00:05:29.060> it<00:05:29.950> so<00:05:30.950> where<00:05:31.160> that<00:05:31.780> where<00:05:32.780> that<00:05:32.960> water

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
see it so where that where that water

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.520 
see it so where that where that water
hits<00:05:34.910> against<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.600> bank<00:05:35.840> on<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.020> right<00:05:36.320> side

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
hits against the bank on the right side

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.920 
hits against the bank on the right side
is<00:05:36.680> that<00:05:36.830> it's<00:05:37.250> going<00:05:37.460> to<00:05:37.520> be<00:05:37.640> the<00:05:37.760> end<00:05:37.970> of<00:05:38.419> the

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
is that it's going to be the end of the

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.170 
is that it's going to be the end of the
other<00:05:39.110> hole<00:05:39.340> so<00:05:40.340> it's<00:05:40.460> going<00:05:40.580> to<00:05:40.640> have<00:05:40.790> another

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
other hole so it's going to have another

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.770 
other hole so it's going to have another
hole<00:05:41.419> ahead<00:05:41.720> of<00:05:41.840> that<00:05:43.240> where<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.419> catfish

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
hole ahead of that where the catfish

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.300 
hole ahead of that where the catfish
will<00:05:44.930> be<00:05:45.050> holding<00:05:47.470> so<00:05:48.470> whenever<00:05:48.950> you're

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
will be holding so whenever you're

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.590 
will be holding so whenever you're
fishing

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.590 

on<00:05:53.600> a<00:05:53.660> river<00:05:53.990> like<00:05:54.169> this<00:05:54.440> one<00:05:55.210> you<00:05:56.210> look<00:05:56.419> for

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
on a river like this one you look for

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.939 
on a river like this one you look for
those<00:05:56.720> s<00:05:56.870> patterns<00:05:59.530> throughout<00:06:00.530> the<00:06:00.740> river

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
those s patterns throughout the river
