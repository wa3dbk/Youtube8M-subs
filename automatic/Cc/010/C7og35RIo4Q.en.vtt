little<00:00:17.130> little<00:00:17.640> touches<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.060> some<00:00:18.650> flavor

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
little little touches and some flavor

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.130 
little little touches and some flavor
combinations<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.490> good<00:00:20.730> ideas<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.300> think<00:00:21.359> it

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
combinations and good ideas I think it

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.250 
combinations and good ideas I think it
works<00:00:22.350> hand<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.769> hand<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.310> think<00:00:24.109> how<00:00:25.109> I've

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
works hand in hand I think how I've

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.070 
works hand in hand I think how I've
developed<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.699> chef<00:00:27.420> more<00:00:27.630> importantly

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
developed is and a chef more importantly

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.009 
developed is and a chef more importantly
I<00:00:28.380> think<00:00:28.830> manager<00:00:29.369> kind<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.910> comes<00:00:30.119> second<00:00:30.900> to

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
I think manager kind of comes second to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.790 
I think manager kind of comes second to
that<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.920> think<00:00:32.160> I've<00:00:32.279> certainly<00:00:32.640> grown<00:00:33.030> up

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
that but I think I've certainly grown up

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.119 
that but I think I've certainly grown up
my<00:00:34.800> palates<00:00:35.219> developed<00:00:35.809> to<00:00:36.809> quote<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.739> good

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
my palates developed to quote a good

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.549 
my palates developed to quote a good
level<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:38.550> we've<00:00:38.940> tried<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> technical

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
level I think we've tried to a technical

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.209 
level I think we've tried to a technical
ability<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.460> think<00:00:42.180> that's<00:00:42.629> that's<00:00:43.160> kind<00:00:44.160> of

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
ability I think that's that's kind of

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.000 
ability I think that's that's kind of
always<00:00:44.520> developing<00:00:45.059> really<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.320> kind<00:00:46.950> of

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
always developing really but but kind of

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.799 
always developing really but but kind of
working<00:00:47.340> under<00:00:47.430> Allen<00:00:47.760> he's<00:00:47.969> allowed<00:00:48.270> me<00:00:48.300> or

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
working under Allen he's allowed me or

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.450 
working under Allen he's allowed me or
given<00:00:49.110> me<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> freedom<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.739> let<00:00:50.250> all<00:00:50.430> that

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
given me the freedom to let all that

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.450 
given me the freedom to let all that
happen<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.469> from<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.039> chip<00:00:53.190> point<00:00:53.370> of

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
happen so so as from a chip point of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.549 
happen so so as from a chip point of
view<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:54.149> that's<00:00:54.480> really<00:00:54.690> valuable<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.350> I

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
view that that's really valuable and I

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.110 
view that that's really valuable and I
think<00:00:55.770> from<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.039> managerial<00:00:56.610> point<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.000> view

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
think from a managerial point of view

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.209 
think from a managerial point of view
just<00:00:57.390> controlling<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.379> brigade<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:59.010> size

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
just controlling a brigade of this size

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.819

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.750 
definitely cooked in a thermodyne which
is<00:02:17.819> basically<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.359> slow<00:02:19.219> I'd<00:02:20.219> say<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.459> slow<00:02:20.730> oven

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
is basically a slow I'd say a slow oven

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.190 
is basically a slow I'd say a slow oven
but<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:21.269> not<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.540> almost<00:02:21.750> like<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.959> hot

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
but it's not it's almost like a hot

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.819 
but it's not it's almost like a hot
cabinet<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.890> kind<00:02:23.159> of<00:02:23.250> sets<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.579> protein

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
cabinet that kind of sets the protein

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.110 
cabinet that kind of sets the protein
and<00:02:25.829> then<00:02:25.980> we<00:02:26.069> just<00:02:26.250> roast<00:02:26.489> that<00:02:26.609> off<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:26.909> beef

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
and then we just roast that off in beef

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.119 
and then we just roast that off in beef
dripping<00:02:27.510> which<00:02:27.629> we<00:02:27.810> take<00:02:28.049> from<00:02:28.319> obviously

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
dripping which we take from obviously

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.280 
dripping which we take from obviously
eyo<00:02:29.310> rendering<00:02:29.760> down<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:30.209> fat<00:02:31.049> from<00:02:31.230> the
