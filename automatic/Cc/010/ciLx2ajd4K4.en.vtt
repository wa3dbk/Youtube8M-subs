00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:09.480
 I think flow 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:14.150
 the federal army of his team are 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.150
 the small things outside to be able to 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:22.259
 the situation want these last meters 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:29.100
 and there we saw very little 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:36.070
 and maybe the next course 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:41.110
 It's good and it's up to you 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.720
 and we have to go in before 21 years in 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.199
 the situation is on the way 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:51.100
 we were not not on the website 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.780
 smart enough and are on the other 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.540
 side that I know enough and then 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.229
 you also lose games and the sun 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.900
 not if we have the possibility to 1 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.040
 higher attention hits to the 2 1 these 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.229
 and we will work on that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.060
 we have a new game now 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.820
 delivered as exciting as I know 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.240
 it was the worst we did this 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.240
 happens 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.010
 if it is because of that a problem 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.200
 troop in the end, actually still 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.760
 he is on the road and is still ill 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.260
 that is very annoying but that helps 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.360
 not wild any more 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.510
 but still clear what they are from 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.270
 on Tuesday evening in cottbus with 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.040
 Germany must sweat and three 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.540
 days later now have to have them 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.880
 just then it was very experienced 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.890
 and also the team to perform and 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.570
 That's why people now their place 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.590
 yes I think we have a gripping 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.950
 seen partie 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.520
 you have to meet his 10th 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.420
 for the tenth time the start formation 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.610
 change that was hurt that was 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.920
 also the hydra moment of course for us 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.330
 finalize 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.160
 that was the big chance of course for 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.180
 our qualities troops and again 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.820
 to return 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.440
 we say to him also noted 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.450
 the game started well and fast 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.060
 has been led by a very 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.340
 beautiful combinations americans cold 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.550
 Of course I still have changed 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.640
 that we reload bridge and full of hagen 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.520
 the opponents knew that it was very 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.030
 it is very uncomfortable to stand 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:44.569
 does not postpone and stock situation 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.719
 before problems zoom 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.489
 the red cards have to do that, of course 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:52.810
 like to steer direction 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.069
 at the equalizer of the 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:03.859
 fortunately with the break 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:07.389
 have shown that it is the 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:10.969
 was not aware that 11 10 10 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:15.560
 balanced game was good 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:16.609
 Opportunities early in thoroughly 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.849
 leadership to go 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:23.269
 the offensive forces were very good 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.849
 set up, they took can and for city 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.489
 and annecy has all three times 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.790
 dangerous at standards again and again 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:35.599
 made and then of course have great 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:39.549
 chances are we very easily or how 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:42.799
 fits say our dear has put 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.079
 the result has been open and 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:49.340
 so maybe our audience 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:53.720
 just redeemed a total of at why I 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.790
 and deserves to appear and rejoice 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.389
 me that we won the third was that 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:03.250
 all follow not really done 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.250
 have in this way the 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.970
 right 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:18.760
 I would defend myself against it all at once 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:39.370
 certainly can 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:42.120
 it's just the next week 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.120
 initiate a change
