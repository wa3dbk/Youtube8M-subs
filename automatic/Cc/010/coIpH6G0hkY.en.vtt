technology<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> max<00:01:20.490> I'd<00:01:20.820> say<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
technology to the max I'd say this is a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.320 
technology to the max I'd say this is a
really<00:01:22.860> really<00:01:23.009> good<00:01:23.250> flashlight<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.000> I

and fifty feet it has a rechargeable ni
mAh<00:01:41.070> battery<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.180> also<00:01:42.840> when<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.259> charging

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
mAh battery and also when it's charging

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.300 
mAh battery and also when it's charging
there's<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.060> little<00:01:45.479> indicator<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.290> there<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
there's a little indicator in there that

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.300 
there's a little indicator in there that

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
shows up red and it glows so it tells

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.710 
shows up red and it glows so it tells
you<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.759> charging<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.540> not<00:01:51.659> just

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
you that it's charging so it's not just

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.429 
you that it's charging so it's not just
a<00:01:52.200> blank<00:01:53.119> device<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.509> don't<00:01:54.750> know<00:01:54.930> if

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
a blank device that you don't know if

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.020 
a blank device that you don't know if
it's<00:01:55.740> charging<00:01:56.189> or<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.369> you're<00:01:56.759> not<00:01:56.790> gonna

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
it's charging or not you're not gonna

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.090 
it's charging or not you're not gonna
have<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.329> kind<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.570> problem<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.229> it's

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
have that kind of problem with this it's

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.190 
have that kind of problem with this it's
also<00:01:59.219> water<00:01:59.670> resistant<00:02:00.390> or<00:02:00.509> submergible

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
also water resistant or submergible

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.560 
also water resistant or submergible
submersible<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.700> actually<00:02:03.030> dip<00:02:03.450> this

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
submersible so you can actually dip this

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.749 
submersible so you can actually dip this
in<00:02:03.750> water<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.560> probably<00:02:04.950> still<00:02:05.219> be<00:02:05.340> working

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
in water but probably still be working

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.109 
in water but probably still be working
so<00:02:06.719> that's<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.439> good<00:02:07.649> as<00:02:07.799> well<00:02:07.950> if<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.610> know

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
so that's really good as well if I know

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.059 
so that's really good as well if I know
I've<00:02:09.450> had<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> couple<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.110> flashlights<00:02:10.590> before

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
I've had a couple of flashlights before

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.710 
I've had a couple of flashlights before

laser engraved spotlight logo in there

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.670 
laser engraved spotlight logo in there
it<00:03:01.410> says<00:03:01.650> it's<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:02.130> high-power<00:03:02.840> 0.5<00:03:03.840> watt<00:03:04.110> LED

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680

bulb which is 35 Plus lumens in here so

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.940

that<00:03:08.690> basically<00:03:09.690> means<00:03:09.990> that<00:03:10.080> it's<00:03:10.320> very<00:03:10.650> very

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
that basically means that it's very very

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.480 
that basically means that it's very very
powerful<00:03:11.209> so<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.240> really<00:03:12.540> like<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.220> feel<00:03:14.220> and

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
I'm gonna give it a 8 out of 10

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.670 
I'm gonna give it a 8 out of 10
the<00:03:17.820> reason<00:03:18.209> I've<00:03:18.330> knocked<00:03:18.510> off<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.959> couple<00:03:19.440> of

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
the reason I've knocked off a couple of

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.449 
the reason I've knocked off a couple of
numbers<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.400> because<00:03:21.060> of<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:21.900> clip<00:03:22.290> now<00:03:23.070> this

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
numbers is because of this clip now this

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.490 
numbers is because of this clip now this
is<00:03:23.610> actually<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:24.060> clip<00:03:24.330> from<00:03:24.630> one<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.769> other

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
is actually a clip from one of the other

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.120 
is actually a clip from one of the other
the<00:03:28.500> other<00:03:28.680> ones<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.880> received<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:32.100> other

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
the other ones that I received the other

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.530 
the other ones that I received the other
flashlights<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:33.030> received<00:03:33.390> from

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
flashlights that I received from

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.840 
flashlights that I received from
spotlight<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.650> reason<00:03:35.010> for<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.190> being<00:03:35.310> is

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
spotlight the reason for that being is

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.540 
spotlight the reason for that being is
that<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:36.209> clip<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.780> only<00:03:37.260> plastic<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:38.070> it<00:03:38.190> is

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
that this clip is only plastic and it is

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.539 
that this clip is only plastic and it is
very<00:03:38.940> flimsy<00:03:39.590> it's<00:03:40.590> not<00:03:40.950> really<00:03:41.340> like

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
very flimsy it's not really like

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.050 
very flimsy it's not really like
breakable<00:03:42.420> in<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.950> in<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.250> sense<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:44.910> you

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
breakable in that in that sense that you

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.699 
breakable in that in that sense that you
can<00:03:45.269> just<00:03:45.480> basically<00:03:45.870> take<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.230> off<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.620> it

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
can just basically take it off and it

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.890 
can just basically take it off and it
will<00:03:46.830> snap<00:03:46.950> but<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:47.730> was<00:03:48.090> I've<00:03:48.299> been<00:03:48.480> using<00:03:48.660> this

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
will snap but I was I've been using this

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.740 
will snap but I was I've been using this
a<00:03:48.930> bit<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.260> when<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.280> plugged<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.150> into<00:03:51.269> my<00:03:51.420> car

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
a bit and when I plugged it into my car

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.710 
a bit and when I plugged it into my car
and<00:03:52.019> then<00:03:52.530> took<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.010> off<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:54.090> only<00:03:54.180> downside

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
and then took it off the only downside

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.750 
and then took it off the only downside
is<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.900> this<00:03:55.380> this<00:03:55.620> is<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.950> original<00:03:56.519> clip

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
is that this this is the original clip

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.830 
is that this this is the original clip
and<00:03:57.030> this<00:03:57.959> prong<00:03:58.320> has<00:03:58.709> come<00:03:59.010> off<00:03:59.160> on<00:03:59.910> there<00:04:00.239> so

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
and this prong has come off on there so

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.880 
and this prong has come off on there so
I<00:04:00.870> don't<00:04:01.110> know<00:04:01.200> if<00:04:01.290> that's<00:04:01.470> because<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.739> was

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
I don't know if that's because I was

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.090 
I don't know if that's because I was
forcing<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.430> off<00:04:02.519> too<00:04:02.790> much<00:04:02.940> or<00:04:03.560> what<00:04:04.560> but<00:04:04.920> that

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
forcing it off too much or what but that

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.240 
forcing it off too much or what but that
comes<00:04:06.060> off<00:04:06.330> for<00:04:06.810> some<00:04:07.019> reason<00:04:07.380> so<00:04:07.860> that's<00:04:08.010> the
