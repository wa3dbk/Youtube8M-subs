00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.670
 big comparative city on caradisiac 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.260
 olivier we opposed the brand new 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.920
 renault twingo to 8 of its competitors 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.959
 what are they 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.750
 then there is citroën holds the fiat 500 the 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.800
 seat nor the captain early the toyota aygo 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.950
 missed the lady 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.240
 the hyundai i10 and finally the Peugeot 208 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.680
 how did you go about 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.140
 decide seven years chose four 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.630
 most practical topmost themes 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:41.470
 most versatile tech we'll say and 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:42.850
 finally the most economical there - economic 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.020
 it's almost unsurprisingly the pen adam 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.090
 simply because she is very 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.110
 expensive and classy but she is expensive and 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.520
 also because she has an engine 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.450
 of old generation will say that they 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.280
 consume so much at the level 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.750
 low fuel budget that explodes in 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.450
 third position there are two cars 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.430
 two cars tie the seat mii and the 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.320
 peugeot 108 cars that consume 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.700
 both very few and who go 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.170
 know about relative haircuts 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.910
 moderate in first position still of 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.439
 car to the plates that has picanto and the 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.899
 citroën c1 who is the cousin of lapleau 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.280
 108 so she wins points all 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.409
 both in the chapter consumption because 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.940
 that they are quite sober and there that has 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.229
 on the other hand earned points because 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.240
 that it is guaranteed 7 years and because 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.400
 that it has excellent reliability and the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.320
 citroën c1 because these entrance fees 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.250
 of range by us are very reasonable 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.250
 ok thank you manu 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.470
 so olive tree that is the city most 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.810
 jeanne practice is behind you and 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.820
 it's a surprise it's the hyundai i10 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.680
 which has the minimum loading volume 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.340
 and the most important of this 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.350
 comparative 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.090
 it's also the most exciting case 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.380
 inside and she can carry 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.610
 it's a person what is not said 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.650
 that a detail the second 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.300
 the second is the renault twingo and 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.510
 his strong point is really his 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.910
 turning circle 8.66 record in the 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.470
 category and we will also note that it 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.610
 is well provided since it has a 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.650
 flat floor is one of the ranks of the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.690
 category the third and the third 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.570
 it's the captain rate that the little 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.040
 cousin let's say the i10 so good 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.330
 load volume good spaces 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.040
 habitable it is less in all 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.490
 the references we will say of his 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.200
 third place 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.940
 the opel already not badly classified all to 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.530
 the time is in the miss the lady for 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.360
 moan penalized by three ports already that 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.220
 not obvious enough legroom 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.630
 reduces a loading threshold high enough 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.630
 so inevitably she ends moreover 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.220
 a city is especially for the city 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.990
 but it can also be to leave in 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.580
 weekend and in this case what is the 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.380
 best alexander is opel adam 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.240
 this one is illustrated for its comfort 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.590
 both in terms of depreciation and 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.660
 its operating silence is 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.760
 also a car that is well equipped at 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.500
 level of active aids to driving the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.030
 second then the second is a 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.980
 surprise it's the seat mii that has 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.540
 seduced for its lightness agility 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.890
 especially its safe level it's 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.489
 the one that holds back the shortest of our 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.709
 comparative 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.170
 the third the third is a 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.340
 french cocorico it's the c1 it's 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.300
 the one that's pretty good everywhere 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.890
 at the level approval engine comfort box 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.540
 silent and also comfort of 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.470
 depreciation the last inventory 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.140
 euros which is unanimously against 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.520
 she fiat 500 exactly so what 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.420
 we particularly displeased it's the 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.830
 driving position 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.660
 after there is a little everything else 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.700
 the engine amenity box that is a bit 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.060
 below the competition is also the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.060
 road holding 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.750
 so the high tech stone why it's 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.340
 important for a city dweller 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.720
 it's in a city you 're going 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.040
 normally spend a lot of time 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.290
 in traffic jams so you have 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.610
 need to direct yourself to be entertained and 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.900
 to stay in touch with those close to you 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.950
 dampierre what is the best then 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.240
 it's a surprise because it's far 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.490
 to be the most recent is the seat mii 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.020
 why because it's the least expensive 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.670
 of our comparative even in his high 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.050
 of range style she is ten thousand and nine 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.350
 hundred and fifty euros and for that price and 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.700
 offer auto radio cd mp3 with 6 high 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.930
 speakers and if you add the modest 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.360
 sum of 335 euros 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.950
 you have gps bluetooth and 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.110
 services that normal pretty much not bad at the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.700
 Following behind is the Toyota 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.280
 aygo so why the ego is not there 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.530
 108 where the c1 because at the same level of 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.090
 finish the second bone x please she 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.440
 offers bluetooth and controls at 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.330
 flying what do not these little 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.300
 sisters then the third the third 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.300
 we have a tie between the renault twingo 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.489
 who has the control of the smartphone the 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.010
 loppet the lady who has the cd drive and 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.620
 the option of the multimedia touch screen 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.780
 and finally the kia picanto who to give it 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.400
 and 4 speakers and finally that he 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.720
 must avoid his very high tech nose then 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.790
 it is necessary to avoid it is fiat 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.290
 500 she the one opposite of the friend it is to 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.600
 to say that its entry-level costs more 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.220
 of 12000 euros is the finish is pop 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.510
 at this price you must add 300 euros 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.510
 just to have a usb port 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.449
 red lantern at the red internate it's 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.550
 the party together 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.020
 after we find the lady missing then we 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.120
 to the Peugeot 508 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.009
 the Renault Twingo then do it 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.270
 not a surprise the novelty then 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.039
 novelties yes but actually the 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.530
 penalize with previously won prizes 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:47.050
 the first comparative with the 90 engine 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.340
 but here it was 70 it's 70 and 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.810
 will penalize you there the direction 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.150
 which is not the same and therefore necessarily 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.050
 then play there is the toyota aygo 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.949
 the hyundai i10 suspense suspense olive 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.120
 we arrive at the podium 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.759
 so what is the third then the 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.139
 third i call the citroen c1 then 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.789
 the citroen c1 it's a surprise the 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.780
 see on the podium do not necessarily have 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.940
 but what we are surprised 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.650
 it is because the guts are self 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.550
 not together but why risk 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.259
 difference in policy 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.789
 tariff guarantees e.g. 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.560
 equipment and all that it plays then 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.819
 more than two and the second is at the 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.440
 second is where lives quintals 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:19.150
 so that's still a surprise 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.259
 we did not expect it there so we 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.639
 did not wait there but there is still 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.229
 things that plays in his favor 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.430
 the guarantee in the meantime appeared to us 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.900
 7 year warranty there is a tare a 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.610
 very aggressive tariff policy 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.500
 there are also sides of these 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.969
 practices that are not insignificant and 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.629
 the first black and there it is really 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:33.610
 it's a big surprise 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:36.639
 it must be admitted it is the 7th 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.779
 so good why do not I take 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.400
 inevitably my invasive notes and that's 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:41.469
 surprisingly enough months of the month it's 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.880
 a very homogeneous car and we see that 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:44.919
 it is the best placed at the ski level 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.779
 high tech technology l team also 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.000
 a good place on the road level 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:51.580
 quite versatile and the ecc m 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.840
 not ridiculous at pricing level but 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.400
 also practical side and this then he 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.050
 must remember language of this subject 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.029
 we only relied on 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.319
 the objective there is no subjective 

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:01.690
 exterior or interior aesthetics 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.430
 it's numbers of measures so there 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.610
 it is the sni who wins and no thanks 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.610
