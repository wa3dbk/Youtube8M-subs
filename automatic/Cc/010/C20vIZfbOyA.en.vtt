00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
that's going to be more therapeutic you

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.130 
that's going to be more therapeutic you
need<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.789> do<00:00:23.939> some<00:00:24.119> research<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.750> find<00:00:24.930> out

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
need to do some research to find out

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.839 
need to do some research to find out
what<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.680> science<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.310> evidence<00:00:26.430> is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
what the science and the evidence is

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.910 
what the science and the evidence is
behind<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.510> brain<00:00:27.720> games<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.619> would<00:00:28.769> also

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
behind the brain games and I would also

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.650 
behind the brain games and I would also
suggest<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.789> do<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.300> conjunction

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
suggest that you do that in conjunction

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.319 
suggest that you do that in conjunction
with<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.380> cognitive<00:00:32.009> rehabilitation

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
with a cognitive rehabilitation

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.990 
with a cognitive rehabilitation
specialist<00:00:33.329> because<00:00:34.130> the<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.640> particular

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
specialist because the the particular

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.760 
specialist because the the particular
skills<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.870> your<00:00:37.079> daughter<00:00:37.320> may<00:00:37.530> need<00:00:37.680> to

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
skills that your daughter may need to

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.350 
skills that your daughter may need to
work<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.160> are<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.550> very<00:00:38.760> specific

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
work on are going to be very specific

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.160 
work on are going to be very specific
and<00:00:40.399> obviously<00:00:41.540> games<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.840> out<00:00:42.870> there

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
and obviously games that are out there

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.720 
and obviously games that are out there
for<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> general<00:00:43.739> public<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> web<00:00:44.309> are

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
for the general public on the web are

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.959 
for the general public on the web are
fairly<00:00:45.360> general<00:00:45.899> they<00:00:46.050> improve<00:00:46.680> memory<00:00:46.969> but

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
fairly general they improve memory but

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.819 
fairly general they improve memory but
if<00:00:48.059> you're<00:00:48.180> not<00:00:48.300> sure<00:00:48.840> exactly<00:00:49.230> why<00:00:49.620> your

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
if you're not sure exactly why your

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.220 
if you're not sure exactly why your
daughter's<00:00:50.160> having<00:00:50.489> trouble<00:00:50.789> with<00:00:50.879> memory

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
daughter's having trouble with memory

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.959 
daughter's having trouble with memory
then<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.770> games<00:00:53.010> may<00:00:53.250> not<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.610> addressing

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
then the games may not be addressing

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.389 
then the games may not be addressing
specifically<00:00:54.930> what<00:00:55.110> her<00:00:55.230> issues<00:00:55.590> are<00:00:55.739> they<00:00:56.340> do

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
specifically what her issues are they do

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.930 
specifically what her issues are they do
have<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> role<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.809> purpose<00:00:58.579> because<00:00:59.579> as<00:00:59.850> I

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
said they do keep your brain moving they

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.799 
said they do keep your brain moving they
help<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.309> work<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.609> some<00:01:02.789> tasks<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.239> between<00:01:03.600> I

would<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:04.500> do<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.769> instead<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.760> cognitive

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
would not do it instead of cognitive

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.880 
would not do it instead of cognitive
rehabilitation<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.500> would<00:01:07.650> do<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.830> in

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
rehabilitation I would do it in

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.620 
rehabilitation I would do it in
conjunction<00:01:08.070> with<00:01:08.630> cognitive

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630

rehabilitation therapist and I would
also<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.850> very<00:01:11.970> careful<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:13.020> not<00:01:13.470> let<00:01:13.830> her<00:01:15.290> use

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
also be very careful to not let her use

it<00:01:26.939> becomes<00:01:27.150> very<00:01:27.299> easy<00:01:27.390> especially<00:01:28.020> for

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
it becomes very easy especially for

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.109 
it becomes very easy especially for
