hello YouTube Fredo buprenorphine will
configure<00:00:02.610> another<00:00:03.030> blender<00:00:03.510> tutorial<00:00:03.959> today

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
configure another blender tutorial today

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.460 
configure another blender tutorial today
we<00:00:04.770> will<00:00:04.920> be<00:00:05.130> talking<00:00:05.400> about<00:00:05.879> camera<00:00:06.470> mapping

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
we will be talking about camera mapping

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.790 
we will be talking about camera mapping
and<00:00:08.300> basically<00:00:09.300> setting<00:00:09.840> up<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.469> environment

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
and basically setting up the environment

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.700 
and basically setting up the environment
for<00:00:11.429> rendering<00:00:11.940> out<00:00:12.620> photorealistic<00:00:14.599> 3d

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
for rendering out photorealistic 3d

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.550 
for rendering out photorealistic 3d
objects<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.400> assets<00:00:17.900> so<00:00:18.900> let's<00:00:19.050> hop<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.380> over

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
objects and assets so let's hop on over

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.210 
objects and assets so let's hop on over
into<00:00:19.890> blender<00:00:20.960> alright<00:00:21.960> um<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:22.949> where

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
into blender alright um so this is where

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.210 
into blender alright um so this is where
we<00:00:23.310> left<00:00:23.460> off<00:00:23.670> last<00:00:24.029> week<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:25.170> have<00:00:25.350> our<00:00:25.650> scene

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
we left off last week we have our scene

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.040 
we left off last week we have our scene
geometry<00:00:27.410> roughly<00:00:28.410> modeled<00:00:28.949> here<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:30.210> our

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
geometry roughly modeled here and our

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.049 
geometry roughly modeled here and our
camera<00:00:31.410> over<00:00:31.679> here<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:32.489> happen<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
camera over here can happen to the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.350 
camera over here can happen to the
camera<00:00:33.450> view<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.820> ever<00:00:35.820> see<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.120> kind<00:00:36.300> of

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
camera view and ever see it kind of

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.590 
camera view and ever see it kind of
matches<00:00:36.540> up<00:00:36.719> now<00:00:37.200> um<00:00:37.820> we<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:38.910> go<00:00:39.059> ahead<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
matches up now um we can go ahead and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.010 
matches up now um we can go ahead and
add<00:00:40.050> our<00:00:40.110> balsan<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.460> get<00:00:41.850> us<00:00:42.059> get<00:00:42.660> an<00:00:42.750> idea

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
add our balsan to get us get an idea

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.310 
add our balsan to get us get an idea
about<00:00:43.079> what<00:00:44.120> we're<00:00:45.120> gonna<00:00:45.180> do<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.809> went

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
about what we're gonna do so I went

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.380 
about what we're gonna do so I went
ahead<00:00:46.440> cleared<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> rotation<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.489> location

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
ahead cleared the rotation of location

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.049 
ahead cleared the rotation of location
of<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:49.309> I'm<00:00:50.309> going<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.550> set<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.760> smooth

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
of that I'm going to set to smooth

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.350 
of that I'm going to set to smooth
shading<00:00:51.829> I'm<00:00:52.829> gonna<00:00:53.039> go<00:00:53.219> ahead<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.730> duplicate

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
shading I'm gonna go ahead and duplicate

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.439 
shading I'm gonna go ahead and duplicate
that<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.530> bring<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.129> out<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:58.489> x-axis<00:00:59.489> about

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
that and bring it out the x-axis about

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.920 
that and bring it out the x-axis about
30<00:01:00.719> mm<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.379> grab<00:01:01.590> them<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> little<00:01:02.340> over

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
30 mm just grab them a little over

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.850 
30 mm just grab them a little over
centered<00:01:03.930> all<00:01:04.710> right<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.540> let's<00:01:06.960> make<00:01:07.260> one<00:01:07.740> of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
centered all right so let's make one of

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.710 
centered all right so let's make one of
these<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:10.549> glossy<00:01:11.549> material<00:01:12.180> we're<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.570> over

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
these a glossy material we're going over

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.330 
these a glossy material we're going over
to<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> orange<00:01:13.799> or<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> item<00:01:14.729> sphere<00:01:15.479> and

gray background servants ran out of Sun

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.310 
gray background servants ran out of Sun
lamp<00:01:34.020> which<00:01:34.290> mimics<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.860> Sun<00:01:35.130> by<00:01:36.320> emitting

lamp which mimics the Sun by emitting
parallel<00:01:37.950> lines<00:01:38.540> kind<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.750> imitating<00:01:40.590> how<00:01:40.829> far

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
parallel lines kind of imitating how far

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.080

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
proper shadow cast we're gonna go put

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.240 
proper shadow cast we're gonna go put
this<00:01:49.460> about<00:01:52.369> we're<00:01:53.369> gonna<00:01:53.430> put<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.759> behind<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
this about we're gonna put it behind and

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.359 
this about we're gonna put it behind and
up<00:01:57.079> point<00:01:58.079> aid<00:01:59.810> rotating<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.020> 2.8<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> little

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
up point aid rotating it 2.8 a little

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.320 
up point aid rotating it 2.8 a little
bit

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.360 

-<00:02:06.330> towards<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> camera<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:08.030> that<00:02:09.030> should

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.370 
- towards the camera and that should

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.830 
- towards the camera and that should
should<00:02:11.370> probably<00:02:11.640> go<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.180> maybe<00:02:12.330> up<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.660> little

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
should probably go to maybe up a little

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.680 
should probably go to maybe up a little
bit<00:02:12.989> more<00:02:13.200> be<00:02:14.130> huffing<00:02:14.340> -<00:02:14.610> rendered<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.390> get<00:02:15.569> an

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
bit more be huffing - rendered to get an

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.300 
bit more be huffing - rendered to get an
idea<00:02:15.959> about<00:02:16.020> how<00:02:16.380> that's<00:02:16.530> cussing<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.040> shadow

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
idea about how that's cussing the shadow

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.449 
idea about how that's cussing the shadow
and<00:02:19.790> why<00:02:20.790> don't<00:02:20.850> we<00:02:21.350> just<00:02:22.350> grab<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.920> edges<00:02:23.100> of

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
and why don't we just grab the edges of

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.790 
and why don't we just grab the edges of
the<00:02:23.550> box<00:02:23.700> using<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.180> edge<00:02:24.480> down<00:02:25.020> here<00:02:25.080> her

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
the box using the edge down here her

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.840 
the box using the edge down here her
selecting<00:02:26.280> edge<00:02:26.430> selection<00:02:27.200> down<00:02:28.200> there<00:02:28.410> and

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
selecting edge selection down there and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.430 
selecting edge selection down there and
popping<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:29.970> back<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.150> little<00:02:30.300> bit<00:02:30.630> further<00:02:30.870> so

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
popping it back a little bit further so

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.690 
popping it back a little bit further so
we<00:02:31.500> get<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.739> better<00:02:33.860> idea<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.220> shadow<00:02:35.459> cast

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
we get a better idea of the shadow cast

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.259 
we get a better idea of the shadow cast
and<00:02:36.390> here<00:02:36.900> we<00:02:37.019> go<00:02:37.200> it's<00:02:37.680> casting<00:02:38.100> shadows<00:02:38.580> and

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
and here we go it's casting shadows and

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.440 
and here we go it's casting shadows and
I<00:02:39.569> think<00:02:39.780> that's<00:02:39.989> gonna<00:02:40.170> do<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:41.060> now<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.120> next

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
I think that's gonna do it now the next

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.490 
I think that's gonna do it now the next
step<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:43.049> get<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:44.610> background

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
step is to get the the background

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.890 
step is to get the the background
projected<00:02:46.500> onto<00:02:46.680> our<00:02:47.600> recreated<00:02:48.600> scene

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
projected onto our recreated scene

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.780 
projected onto our recreated scene
geometry<00:02:49.500> which<00:02:50.370> we<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:52.130> already<00:02:53.130> made<00:02:53.459> it

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
geometry which we have already made it

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.809 
geometry which we have already made it
so<00:02:53.970> first<00:02:54.180> off<00:02:55.160> what<00:02:56.160> we're<00:02:56.310> gonna<00:02:56.400> have<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.700> do

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
so first off what we're gonna have to do

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.160 
so first off what we're gonna have to do
is<00:02:56.970> we're<00:02:57.090> gonna<00:02:57.180> have<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.390> subdivide<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
is we're gonna have to subdivide the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.259 
is we're gonna have to subdivide the
background<00:02:58.709> or<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.069> knife<00:02:59.220> at<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.489> subdivision

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
background or a knife at a subdivision

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.229 
background or a knife at a subdivision
surface<00:03:01.190> go<00:03:02.190> ahead<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.430> clip<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.640> simple

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
surface go ahead and clip that simple

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.099 
surface go ahead and clip that simple
was<00:03:03.360> set<00:03:03.540> both<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.780> these<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.590> five<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:06.109> hit

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
was set both of these to five and hit

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.640 
was set both of these to five and hit
apply<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:08.120> this<00:03:09.120> is<00:03:09.269> going<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.840> subdivide<00:03:10.410> our

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
apply and this is going to subdivide our

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.740 
apply and this is going to subdivide our
ground<00:03:11.040> plane<00:03:11.400> which<00:03:12.000> gives<00:03:12.299> us<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.570> high

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
ground plane which gives us a high

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.580 
ground plane which gives us a high
resolution<00:03:14.030> kind<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.590> background<00:03:17.000> otherwise

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
resolution kind of background otherwise

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.220 
resolution kind of background otherwise
projecting<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.790> kind<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.510> lose<00:03:21.840> the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
projecting it kind of you lose the

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
projecting it kind of you lose the
detail<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.609> starts<00:03:24.090> getting<00:03:24.209> off<00:03:25.250> so

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
detail and it starts getting off so

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.800 
detail and it starts getting off so
we're<00:03:27.030> gonna<00:03:27.150> go<00:03:27.420> ahead<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:29.390> select<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.630> all

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
we're gonna go ahead and select it all

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.930 
we're gonna go ahead and select it all
by<00:03:31.820> double-clicking<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:33.299> in<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:35.370> edit<00:03:35.910> mode

and<00:04:17.450> go<00:04:17.959> ahead<00:04:18.139> and<00:04:18.350> open<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.650> background

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
and go ahead and open the background

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.710 
and go ahead and open the background
image<00:04:19.370> from<00:04:19.850> before<00:04:20.480> which<00:04:21.049> is<00:04:21.079> this<00:04:21.500> one<00:04:21.739> and

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
image from before which is this one and

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.350 
image from before which is this one and
connect<00:04:23.720> that<00:04:23.870> to<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.139> color<00:04:24.470> and<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:25.970> will

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
connect that to the color and that will

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.080 
connect that to the color and that will
if<00:04:27.290> you<00:04:27.669> tap<00:04:28.669> out<00:04:28.910> of<00:04:29.180> edit<00:04:29.540> mode<00:04:30.760> go<00:04:31.760> ahead<00:04:31.940> and

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
if you tap out of edit mode go ahead and

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.040 
if you tap out of edit mode go ahead and
apply<00:04:32.360> the<00:04:32.480> texture<00:04:33.080> to<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.380> background<00:04:33.550> and

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
apply the texture to the background and

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.310 
apply the texture to the background and
so<00:04:36.050> what's<00:04:37.120> you<00:04:38.120> kind<00:04:38.330> of<00:04:38.389> get<00:04:38.570> some<00:04:38.960> funky

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
so what's you kind of get some funky

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.490 
so what's you kind of get some funky
artifacting<00:04:40.160> going<00:04:40.460> around<00:04:40.700> where<00:04:41.500> the

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
artifacting going around where the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.310 
artifacting going around where the
camera<00:04:42.889> clips<00:04:43.370> it<00:04:44.030> will<00:04:44.240> go<00:04:44.750> over<00:04:45.080> into<00:04:45.200> the

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
camera clips it will go over into the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.440 
camera clips it will go over into the
other<00:04:45.500> workspace<00:04:45.979> for<00:04:46.130> a<00:04:46.220> bigger<00:04:46.430> view<00:04:46.639> you

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
other workspace for a bigger view you

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.690 
other workspace for a bigger view you
get<00:04:47.630> funky<00:04:48.200> artifacting<00:04:49.100> where<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.340> camera

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
get funky artifacting where the camera

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.690 
get funky artifacting where the camera
clips<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:52.550> view<00:04:52.880> and<00:04:53.210> it<00:04:53.990> starts<00:04:54.520> tiling<00:04:55.520> the

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
clips the view and it starts tiling the

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.080 
clips the view and it starts tiling the
image<00:04:56.000> but<00:04:56.560> that<00:04:57.970> isn't<00:04:58.970> a<00:04:59.090> huge<00:04:59.419> problem<00:05:01.090> now

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
image but that isn't a huge problem now

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.760 
image but that isn't a huge problem now
the<00:05:02.150> other<00:05:02.419> thing<00:05:02.690> you'll<00:05:02.840> notice<00:05:03.050> is<00:05:03.350> if<00:05:03.560> you

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
the other thing you'll notice is if you

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.520 
the other thing you'll notice is if you
pop<00:05:04.010> into<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:05.060> camera<00:05:05.360> view<00:05:05.540> that<00:05:05.810> it<00:05:06.380> will

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
pop into the camera view that it will

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.460 
pop into the camera view that it will
also<00:05:07.030> it<00:05:08.030> didn't<00:05:08.630> project<00:05:08.990> all<00:05:09.169> the<00:05:09.200> way<00:05:09.410> to

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
also it didn't project all the way to

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.420 
also it didn't project all the way to
the<00:05:09.680> edge<00:05:09.830> of<00:05:10.010> this<00:05:10.160> and<00:05:11.320> once<00:05:12.320> again<00:05:12.560> that<00:05:13.070> can

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
the edge of this and once again that can

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.510 
the edge of this and once again that can
be<00:05:13.930> fixed<00:05:14.930> by<00:05:15.169> just<00:05:15.200> adding<00:05:15.590> more

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
be fixed by just adding more

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.370 
be fixed by just adding more
subdivisions<00:05:17.270> to<00:05:17.330> the<00:05:17.539> surface<00:05:17.990> and<00:05:18.260> it

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
subdivisions to the surface and it

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.680 
subdivisions to the surface and it
projected<00:05:19.160> more<00:05:19.789> correctly<00:05:21.370> but<00:05:22.690> because

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
projected more correctly but because

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.270 
projected more correctly but because
we're<00:05:24.050> not<00:05:24.080> going<00:05:24.350> to<00:05:24.440> render<00:05:24.710> out<00:05:24.979> in<00:05:25.190> the

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
we're not going to render out in the

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.140 
we're not going to render out in the
final<00:05:25.900> the<00:05:26.900> background<00:05:27.470> from<00:05:28.039> this<00:05:28.400> all<00:05:28.789> we're

and see how that looks but besides that
 everything<00:05:53.030> should<00:05:53.180> pretty<00:05:53.570> much<00:05:53.690> be
