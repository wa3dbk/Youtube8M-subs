00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.800 

okay<00:00:00.630> so<00:00:00.690> I<00:00:01.230> pulled<00:00:01.589> my<00:00:01.740> exhaust<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:03.240> compare

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
okay so I pulled my exhaust to compare

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.519 
okay so I pulled my exhaust to compare
it<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:05.060> 750il<00:00:06.060> exhaust<00:00:06.569> from<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.870> e30<00:00:07.319> two

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
it to the 750il exhaust from the e30 two

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.280 
it to the 750il exhaust from the e30 two
parts<00:00:07.890> car<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.099> had<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.309> while<00:00:08.490> back<00:00:08.540> and<00:00:09.540> these

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
parts car I had a while back and these

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.299 
parts car I had a while back and these
are<00:00:10.469> my<00:00:10.620> findings

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
are my findings

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.460 
are my findings
basically<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.570> mufflers<00:00:12.960> are<00:00:13.790> identical<00:00:15.470> and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
basically the mufflers are identical and

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.240 
basically the mufflers are identical and
then<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:17.210> 750<00:00:18.210> has<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.690> much<00:00:19.260> larger<00:00:19.500> pipe

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
then the 750 has a much larger pipe

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.640 
then the 750 has a much larger pipe
diameter<00:00:20.820> from<00:00:20.970> there<00:00:22.460> both<00:00:23.460> go<00:00:23.670> into<00:00:23.939> pretty

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
diameter from there both go into pretty

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.970 
diameter from there both go into pretty
similarly<00:00:25.650> styled<00:00:25.910> resonators<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.650> new<00:00:28.650> 32

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
similarly styled resonators the new 32

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.980 
similarly styled resonators the new 32
Reznor<00:00:29.490> might<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> tiny<00:00:30.269> bit<00:00:30.420> bigger<00:00:30.750> but

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
Reznor might be a tiny bit bigger but

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.360 
Reznor might be a tiny bit bigger but
they<00:00:31.140> look<00:00:31.349> again<00:00:32.219> almost<00:00:32.700> identical<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:34.370> yeah

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
they look again almost identical so yeah

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.590 
they look again almost identical so yeah
that<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.880> interesting

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
that was interesting

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.780 
that was interesting
anyways<00:00:37.050> my<00:00:37.200> plan<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:38.190> turn<00:00:38.340> one<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.610> these

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
anyways my plan was to turn one of these

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.319 
anyways my plan was to turn one of these
mufflers<00:00:39.030> into<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> de<00:00:39.690> non<00:00:39.840> muffler<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:41.329> get

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
mufflers into a de non muffler and get

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.389 
mufflers into a de non muffler and get
it<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.899> inside<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.590> my<00:00:43.710> friend's<00:00:44.010> plasma

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
it the inside of it my friend's plasma

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.950 
it the inside of it my friend's plasma
cutter<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.360> I'll<00:00:45.450> let<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.629> know<00:00:45.719> how<00:00:45.899> that

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
cutter so I'll let you know how that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.270 
cutter so I'll let you know how that

anyone<00:00:53.219> was<00:00:53.399> wondering<00:00:53.520> what<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> sounded

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
anyone was wondering what it sounded

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.790 
anyone was wondering what it sounded
like

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
like

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.439 
like
hopefully<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.789> an<00:00:57.030> iphone<00:00:57.420> but

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
hopefully it's just an iphone but

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.000 
hopefully it's just an iphone but
hopefully<00:00:58.050> it'll<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.620> decent<00:00:59.309> quality<00:00:59.870> clip

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
hopefully it'll be a decent quality clip

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:19.210 
hopefully it'll be a decent quality clip
compared<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.190> what's<00:01:02.579> out<00:01:02.760> there<00:01:02.820> now

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.970 

there's<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.310> lot<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.610> bass<00:01:21.000> because<00:01:21.530> all<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
there's a lot of bass because all of the

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:34.280 
there's a lot of bass because all of the
gas<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.850> exiting<00:01:24.540> directly<00:01:24.990> under<00:01:25.140> my<00:01:25.260> seat

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.860 

I<00:01:34.380> was<00:01:34.980> like<00:01:35.100> 1800<00:01:35.730> rpm<00:01:36.120> so<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:38.330> drove<00:01:39.330> like<00:01:39.600> this

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
I was like 1800 rpm so I drove like this

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.770 
I was like 1800 rpm so I drove like this
for<00:01:40.140> about<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.620> day<00:01:41.360> because<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.480> wanted<00:01:42.690> to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
for about one day because I wanted to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.600 
for about one day because I wanted to
see<00:01:42.900> what<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.080> would<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:44.100> was<00:01:44.250> awful

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
see what it would be like it was awful

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.900 
see what it would be like it was awful
the<00:01:45.120> entire<00:01:45.510> cabin<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.550> vibrated<00:01:47.550> beyond

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
the entire cabin just vibrated beyond

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.080 
the entire cabin just vibrated beyond
belief<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:49.080> I<00:01:49.140> think<00:01:49.740> if<00:01:50.010> one<00:01:50.790> was<00:01:51.060> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
belief but I think if one was to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.240 
belief but I think if one was to
straight<00:01:51.660> piped<00:01:51.990> out<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.230> back<00:01:52.440> it<00:01:53.160> would

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
straight piped out the back it would

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.030 
straight piped out the back it would
sound<00:01:53.520> pretty<00:01:54.120> awesome<00:01:54.690> although<00:01:55.680> way<00:01:55.979> too
