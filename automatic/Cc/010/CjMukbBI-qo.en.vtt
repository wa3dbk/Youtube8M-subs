00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello to all and apple smells get 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.950
 puts him too at the watch connect with 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.210
 the apple i watch on it today 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.620
 little reminder for those who need 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.179
 of a good correction I pulled out a 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.710
 chronicle on the iphone 6 it is 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.179
 important to see it before this video 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.650
 let's go back to our sheep and this is the case 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.000
 to say it since apple follows every 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.859
 other brands by creating his own 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.820
 watch connected leaping that I 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.350
 joking it's just that 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.670
 personally connected watches 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.439
 I do not see the interest frankly 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.539
 I do not buy a piece of screen that me 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.830
 will have half a quarter of the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.480
 third of the features of my iphone 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.279
 300 euros I may be bad 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.720
 language but honestly it serves you to 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.099
 what apart from reading and sending 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.420
 messages on an interface all but one 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.130
 ergonomic full of people complain 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.469
 to have permanent notifications 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.850
 to be constantly connected and there they 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.200
 all want to ensure their wrist not 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.340
 yes it's better especially if I buy 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.450
 a watch is to read the time 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.910
 until then we agree 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.530
 no, do you ask the question in which 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.550
 circumstances you need most 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.260
 of the hour when you have a 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.420
 appointments he keller by the way 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.039
 8:30 am ok I have time to twitter you 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.600
 know the rest if you realize a 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.129
 movie and you're looking for a player or 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.230
 again when you have an exam it's 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.430
 good I have my watch the chronometer I 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.320
 can start I have to remove it 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.850
 start to note them the messages that's 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.270
 cheating and latham between mickey be 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.799
 racing 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.330
 you have it in the juice of course I do not 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.500
 not only about the apple product but about 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.070
 all the marks as far as the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.990
 peloo h 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.490
 I do not really know what to think about it 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.020
 firstly because it is a product that does not 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.790
 I'm not interested and secondly kerala 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.439
 been presented under circumstances not 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.580
 at all exciting where I was disappointed 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.780
 in front of the apple delivery 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.009
 as I explained it to you in my 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.479
 last chronicle but we do not 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.250
 return later we find ourselves so 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.080
 with a square watch I would have preferred 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.240
 round with a rather special design 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.829
 that you will understand I do not like 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.329
 really that is customizable to 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.740
 level of bracelets or not know since 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.119
 when apple does in the customizable 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.890
 but it's great but again I 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.060
 do not find it beautiful this is the second 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.380
 times that apple makes a product that me 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.880
 displeased and it was in there that notes 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.420
 at the interface level is enough 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.040
 surprising 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.899
 I 'm not sure it's very 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.500
 ergonomic all that but for that I am 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.970
 quite optimistic 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.860
 on the other hand the small wheel that allows 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.970
 to scroll through the items I'm 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.409
 in total misunderstanding 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.360
 of course it can not be used 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.790
 without iphone from the 5th 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.159
 so she needs the data of your 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.960
 package to be able to work then 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.250
 why sports apps 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.659
 I think people would have liked the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.399
 being able to leave the iphone at the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.850
 house for the sake of comfort 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.320
 convenient 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.909
 and be able to track only 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.680
 with the watch we return very quickly to 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.090
 the set of watches connect with a 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.959
 problem that had been opposing for two months 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.489
 you would not have the time please 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.540
 yeah well ah ben non battery life 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.130
 luckily apple is excellent 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.480
 when it comes to autonomy in terms 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.130
 of features we have the messages 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.080
 Syria and all that we find in 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.470
 competitors nothing interesting to remember 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.610
 here at 6.6 a tim cook moment drifts a 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.110
 little towards the fires of love 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.000
 and since I have nothing to say about this 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.650
 conference you will be able thanks to 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.790
 sensors send the beats of others 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.900
 hearts to your beloved it's amazing 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.280
 here you are if you are interested in 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.930
 a connected watch and that you 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.700
 have an iphone from the 5th 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.069
 you can have from spring 2015 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.550
 for 349 euros I should be shocked 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.560
 by the price 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.069
 but not even in reality what 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.450
 shock spring 2015 spring 2015 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.500
 apple you present us an iphone to 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.180
 the snatch after three minutes of 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.290
 conference to have time to 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.180
 present a watch that he 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.650
 complementary and that comes out seven months 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.180
 after the iphone has always been the product 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.950
 Apple's flagship lectures have him 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.530
 always been diÃ© it contained 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.630
 stress of the patience of the full aunt 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.829
 of emotions and the tulle abandons then 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.450
 that he will be released in the weeks that follow 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.890
 the apple conference is understandable more 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.819
 you even pay more attention to our son 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.819
 it works more between us 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.040
 what do you note was a revolution to 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.150
 himself 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.560
 I really feel like they 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.980
 bring freshness to our bones to 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.659
 apple 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.780
 and yet it is not very cool anymore 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:54.530
 team a moment ago you have to change 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.549
 of adam to bite the apple 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.870
 little parenthesis for the brave I 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:03.680
 well used the word innovation 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.680
 to your keyboards single heaven 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.200
 steve jobs was a genius a 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.510
 outstanding speaker a commercial at 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.990
 heal a visionary but for me he 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.990
 braked apple
