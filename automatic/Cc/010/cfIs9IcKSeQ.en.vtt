I<00:00:45.180> believe<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.870> down<00:00:46.200> below<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.340> I

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
I believe to that down below but as I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.920 
I believe to that down below but as I
say<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> iMac<00:00:47.940> does<00:00:48.149> perform<00:00:48.570> pretty<00:00:48.809> well

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
say the iMac does perform pretty well

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.720 
say the iMac does perform pretty well
even<00:00:49.320> though<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.590> does<00:00:49.710> not<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.920> an<00:00:50.160> SSD<00:00:50.520> or

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
even though it does not have an SSD or

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.420 
even though it does not have an SSD or
fusion<00:00:51.329> drive<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:52.469> still<00:00:52.649> pretty<00:00:52.800> reliable

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
fusion drive it's still pretty reliable

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.400 
fusion drive it's still pretty reliable
and<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.879> doesn't<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.329> unless<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and it doesn't like unless you have a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.740 
and it doesn't like unless you have a
lot<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.770> stuff<00:00:56.010> open<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.579> at<00:00:56.910> least<00:00:57.059> 20<00:00:57.510> tabs

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
whole bunch of other apps then you start

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.490 
whole bunch of other apps then you start
to<00:01:02.969> notice<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.300> lag<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.870> everyday<00:01:04.140> use

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
to notice a lag but with everyday use

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.730 
to notice a lag but with everyday use
you<00:01:05.189> don't<00:01:05.519> even<00:01:05.729> notice<00:01:05.880> anything<00:01:06.330> at<00:01:06.450> all

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
you don't even notice anything at all

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.500 
you don't even notice anything at all
for<00:01:07.740> memory<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.820> gigabytes<00:01:09.240> of

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
for memory you do get a gigabytes of

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.250 
for memory you do get a gigabytes of
ddr3<00:01:10.850> which<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.030> more<00:01:12.420> than<00:01:12.600> enough<00:01:12.689> for<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
ddr3 which is more than enough for the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.740 
ddr3 which is more than enough for the
everyday<00:01:13.590> user<00:01:14.030> but<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.060> wish<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.479> could

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
everyday user but I wish you could

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.719 
everyday user but I wish you could
upgrade<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.799> model<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.400> app

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729

cool down the machine and as I did

mention<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.819> boxing<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.450> first

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
mention in the boxing and the first

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.660 
mention in the boxing and the first
startup<00:02:09.989> videos<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> fan<00:02:11.190> was<00:02:11.340> very

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
startup videos that the fan was very

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.700 
startup videos that the fan was very
loud<00:02:11.879> on<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.150> high<00:02:12.300> Mac<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.260> figured

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
loud on a high Mac but I figured

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.770 
loud on a high Mac but I figured
I'm<00:02:13.830> used<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.430> really<00:02:15.120> haven't<00:02:15.330> noticed<00:02:15.660> the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
I'm used to I really haven't noticed the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.020 
I'm used to I really haven't noticed the
fan<00:02:16.020> within<00:02:16.680> two<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.190> three<00:02:17.310> months<00:02:17.490> of<00:02:17.820> using

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
fan within two to three months of using

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.060 
fan within two to three months of using
the<00:02:18.210> iMac<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:19.470> think<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.740> problem<00:02:19.980> has

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
the iMac and I think the problem has

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.190 
the iMac and I think the problem has
gone<00:02:20.310> away<00:02:20.490> now<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.630> power<00:02:21.840> button<00:02:22.140> is

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
gone away now the power button is

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.110 
gone away now the power button is
located<00:02:22.320> on<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.890> back<00:02:23.340> right<00:02:23.730> side<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:24.060> the

located on the back right side of the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.060 
located on the back right side of the
machine<00:02:24.240> with<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.230> new<00:02:25.440> design<00:02:25.770> of<00:02:25.800> the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
machine on summing those it looks is

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.020 
machine on summing those it looks is
very<00:02:27.900> very<00:02:28.230> slim<00:02:28.620> guitar<00:02:29.490> d<00:02:29.580> here<00:02:29.760> looks<00:02:29.970> like

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
very very slim guitar d here looks like

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.060 
very very slim guitar d here looks like
just<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.450> be<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.570> centimeter<00:02:31.200> thick<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:31.950> when

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
just to be a centimeter thick but when

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.230 
just to be a centimeter thick but when
you<00:02:32.160> get<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.370> certain<00:02:32.700> angle<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:33.000> tell<00:02:33.210> that

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
you get to a certain angle you tell that

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.240 
you get to a certain angle you tell that
there<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.630> some<00:02:33.840> bulge<00:02:34.050> on<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.320> back<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:35.070> it

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
there is some bulge on the back and it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.590 
there is some bulge on the back and it
really<00:02:35.430> does<00:02:35.610> not<00:02:35.730> look<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:35.940> much<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.480> a

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
really does not look that much of a

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.190 
really does not look that much of a
redesign<00:02:37.440> as<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.740> Apple<00:02:38.040> what<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:39.200> it

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
redesign as the Apple what it is it

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.350 
redesign as the Apple what it is it
doesn't<00:02:40.470> look<00:02:40.560> pretty<00:02:40.890> thick<00:02:44.030> one<00:02:45.030> thing<00:02:45.210> that

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
doesn't look pretty thick one thing that

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.700 
doesn't look pretty thick one thing that
you<00:02:45.450> will<00:02:45.570> notice<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.110> back<00:02:46.260> though<00:02:46.440> there

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
you will notice in the back though there

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.910 
you will notice in the back though there
is<00:02:46.830> no<00:02:46.980> hard<00:02:47.220> drive<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.520> put<00:02:47.640> any<00:02:47.850> CDs<00:02:48.740> but<00:02:49.740> for

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
is no hard drive to put any CDs but for

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.230 
is no hard drive to put any CDs but for
most<00:02:50.070> users<00:02:50.280> that's<00:02:50.640> not<00:02:50.790> gonna<00:02:50.880> be<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.030> problem

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
most users that's not gonna be a problem

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.720 
most users that's not gonna be a problem
like<00:02:51.600> myself<00:02:52.070> but<00:02:53.070> if<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.280> want<00:02:53.460> you<00:02:53.610> could
