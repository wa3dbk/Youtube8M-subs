now the card that I've been using and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.640 
now the card that I've been using and
this<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.400> my<00:01:05.519> first<00:01:05.729> question<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.420> what<00:01:07.140> card<00:01:07.470> I

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
this is my first question is what card I

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.990 
this is my first question is what card I
use<00:01:08.180> I've<00:01:09.180> been<00:01:09.450> using<00:01:10.369> I'd<00:01:11.369> say<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> little<00:01:11.850> bit

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
use I've been using I'd say a little bit

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.609 
use I've been using I'd say a little bit
thicker<00:01:12.299> than<00:01:14.060> cereal<00:01:15.060> boxes<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:16.380> about

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
thicker than cereal boxes it's about

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.890 
thicker than cereal boxes it's about
three<00:01:17.430> times<00:01:17.670> thicker<00:01:17.970> than<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.330> cereal<00:01:18.630> box

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
three times thicker than the cereal box

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.890 
three times thicker than the cereal box
this<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> section<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.390> it's<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.630> very

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
this is a section of it it's a very

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.840 
this is a section of it it's a very
tough<00:01:22.170> stuff<00:01:22.500> it's<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.830> probably<00:01:23.340> close<00:01:23.820> to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
tough stuff it's like probably close to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.380 
tough stuff it's like probably close to
very<00:01:24.540> thin<00:01:24.869> wood<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:26.460> I've<00:01:26.939> had<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.180> use

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
very thin wood and I've had to use

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.590 
very thin wood and I've had to use
surgical<00:01:27.720> scissors<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.920> cut<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.390> but<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
surgical scissors to cut this but the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.230 
surgical scissors to cut this but the
good<00:01:30.930> side<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.340> take<00:01:32.640> some<00:01:32.670> very

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
good side to this is you take some very

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.660 
good side to this is you take some very
very<00:01:33.540> little<00:01:33.689> resin<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.159> make<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.460> go

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
very little resin and to make this go

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.969 
very little resin and to make this go
rigid<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.659> I've<00:01:36.720> done<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:37.320> coat<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
rigid so I've done like one coat of

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.840 
rigid so I've done like one coat of
resin<00:01:38.520> underneath<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.509> layer<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.850> it's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
resin underneath this layer and it's

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.940 
resin underneath this layer and it's
already<00:01:42.180> done<00:01:42.810> hard<00:01:43.229> underneath

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
already done hard underneath

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.450 
already done hard underneath
I've<00:01:44.610> already<00:01:44.820> started<00:01:45.030> layering<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.460> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
I've already started layering on the the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.450 
I've already started layering on the the
body<00:01:47.880> filler<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:49.590> fix<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.009> parts<00:01:50.310> all

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
body filler to fix the parts all

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.330 
body filler to fix the parts all
together<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:51.090> used<00:01:51.450> hot<00:01:51.869> glue<00:01:52.070> pretty<00:01:53.070> much<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
together I used hot glue pretty much the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.810 
together I used hot glue pretty much the
same<00:01:53.520> as<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.790> would<00:01:53.970> with<00:01:54.770> with<00:01:55.770> bone<00:01:56.219> builds

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
same as you would with with bone builds

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.770 
same as you would with with bone builds
though<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.210> tend<00:01:57.600> not<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.750> use<00:01:57.899> foam<00:01:58.500> builds<00:01:59.780> so

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
though I tend not to use foam builds so

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.539 
though I tend not to use foam builds so
yeah<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.590> little<00:02:01.680> hot<00:02:01.920> glue<00:02:01.950> underneath

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
yeah it's a little hot glue underneath

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.560 
yeah it's a little hot glue underneath
there<00:02:02.790> then<00:02:03.360> I've<00:02:03.509> used<00:02:03.590> resin<00:02:04.969> fiberglass<00:02:05.969> to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
there then I've used resin fiberglass to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.330 
there then I've used resin fiberglass to
a<00:02:06.600> certain<00:02:06.899> extent<00:02:07.259> again<00:02:07.799> because<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.250> so

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
a certain extent again because it's so

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.760 
a certain extent again because it's so
tough<00:02:08.729> there's<00:02:09.720> very<00:02:09.929> little<00:02:10.110> fibreglass

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
tough there's very little fibreglass

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.380 
tough there's very little fibreglass
needed<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.340> this

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
needed on this

minute<00:04:09.480> ago<00:04:10.880> you<00:04:11.880> have<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.180> keep<00:04:12.330> adding<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.989> it

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
minute ago you have to keep adding to it

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.340 
minute ago you have to keep adding to it
to<00:04:13.739> build<00:04:14.010> these<00:04:14.250> sections<00:04:14.820> up<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:15.870> I<00:04:15.900> could

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
to build these sections up so I could

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.590 
to build these sections up so I could
put<00:04:16.650> let's<00:04:17.280> say<00:04:17.340> like<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.580> giant<00:04:18.060> table<00:04:18.419> or

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
put let's say like a giant table or

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.969 
put let's say like a giant table or
toothpaste<00:04:19.140> size<00:04:19.500> bits<00:04:19.919> on<00:04:20.130> this<00:04:21.770> very<00:04:22.770> nice

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
toothpaste size bits on this very nice

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.040 
toothpaste size bits on this very nice
but<00:04:23.400> I<00:04:23.430> can<00:04:23.700> get<00:04:23.940> rid<00:04:24.090> of<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.300> by<00:04:24.450> sanding

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
but I can get rid of it by sanding

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.589 
but I can get rid of it by sanding
away<00:04:25.289> I<00:04:25.620> can<00:04:26.430> get<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:26.789> so<00:04:26.909> nice<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.300> smooth

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
away I can get it so nice and smooth

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.890 
away I can get it so nice and smooth
with<00:04:27.930> a<00:04:28.620> real<00:04:28.919> fine<00:04:29.280> stuff<00:04:29.699> so<00:04:30.419> if<00:04:30.539> we<00:04:30.690> come

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
with a real fine stuff so if we come

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.339 
with a real fine stuff so if we come
round<00:04:31.139> to<00:04:31.699> let's<00:04:32.699> see<00:04:32.909> the<00:04:33.659> bottom<00:04:34.110> section

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
round to let's see the bottom section

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.760 
round to let's see the bottom section
here<00:04:35.300> where<00:04:36.300> it's<00:04:36.479> it's<00:04:36.840> got<00:04:37.050> like<00:04:37.199> this<00:04:37.379> step

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
here where it's it's got like this step

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.070 
here where it's it's got like this step
section<00:04:38.250> here<00:04:38.490> I<00:04:38.669> don't<00:04:39.569> want<00:04:39.690> to<00:04:39.750> lose<00:04:39.900> this

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
section here I don't want to lose this

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.230 
section here I don't want to lose this
detail<00:04:40.620> so<00:04:40.770> I've<00:04:40.860> used<00:04:41.129> it<00:04:41.250> very<00:04:41.430> very<00:04:41.639> thin<00:04:41.729> as

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
detail so I've used it very very thin as

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.219 
detail so I've used it very very thin as
I<00:04:42.300> said<00:04:42.509> before<00:04:42.740> but<00:04:43.740> I<00:04:44.009> use<00:04:46.340> on<00:04:47.340> my<00:04:48.229> detailer

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
I said before but I use on my detailer

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.210 
I said before but I use on my detailer
I'm<00:04:50.069> gonna<00:04:50.280> be<00:04:50.550> cutting<00:04:51.539> away<00:04:51.870> sections<00:04:52.800> like

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
I'm gonna be cutting away sections like

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.640 
I'm gonna be cutting away sections like
this<00:04:53.490> and<00:04:54.330> getting<00:04:54.569> angles<00:04:55.080> like<00:04:55.259> this

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
this and getting angles like this

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.399 
this and getting angles like this
I<00:04:55.680> changed<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.550> head<00:04:56.759> of<00:04:56.909> coupons<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:57.690> I

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
I changed the head of coupons and I

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.550 
I changed the head of coupons and I
might<00:04:58.680> use<00:04:58.919> a<00:04:58.949> round<00:04:59.879> one<00:05:00.120> like<00:05:00.360> this<00:05:00.599> to<00:05:01.379> try

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
might use a round one like this to try

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.430 
might use a round one like this to try
and<00:05:01.650> get<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:02.069> shapes<00:05:02.909> back<00:05:03.300> like<00:05:03.569> this<00:05:03.750> one

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
and get the shapes back like this one

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.200 
and get the shapes back like this one
basically<00:05:04.979> trying<00:05:05.250> to<00:05:05.310> do<00:05:05.460> is<00:05:05.580> get<00:05:05.969> it<00:05:06.060> all

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
basically trying to do is get it all

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.439 
basically trying to do is get it all
leveled<00:05:07.219> and<00:05:08.219> it<00:05:08.340> will<00:05:08.490> work<00:05:08.729> and<00:05:09.030> when<00:05:09.300> it's

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
leveled and it will work and when it's

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.450 
leveled and it will work and when it's
done<00:05:09.690> hopefully<00:05:11.539> look<00:05:12.539> like<00:05:12.719> this<00:05:13.219> which<00:05:14.219> does

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
done hopefully look like this which does

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.659 
done hopefully look like this which does
still<00:05:14.699> need<00:05:14.849> some<00:05:15.030> work<00:05:16.009> or<00:05:17.009> maybe<00:05:17.310> like<00:05:17.520> this

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
still need some work or maybe like this

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.029 
still need some work or maybe like this
when<00:05:17.909> it's<00:05:18.030> finished

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:26.149 

but<00:05:23.039> yeah<00:05:23.810> also<00:05:24.810> on<00:05:24.900> a<00:05:24.930> quick<00:05:25.199> note<00:05:25.349> and<00:05:26.099> a

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
but yeah also on a quick note and a

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.249 
but yeah also on a quick note and a
health<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.520> safety<00:05:26.580> side<00:05:27.120> do<00:05:27.690> use<00:05:27.960> a<00:05:27.990> well

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
health and safety side do use a well

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.110 
health and safety side do use a well
ventilated<00:05:28.409> area<00:05:28.919> because<00:05:29.610> this<00:05:29.759> stuff<00:05:29.969> is

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
ventilated area because this stuff is

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.930 
ventilated area because this stuff is
pretty<00:05:30.330> toxic<00:05:30.599> and<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.889> fumes<00:05:32.219> from<00:05:32.400> this<00:05:32.610> can

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
pretty toxic and the fumes from this can

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:41.240 
pretty toxic and the fumes from this can
kind<00:05:33.180> of<00:05:33.389> get<00:05:33.630> to<00:05:33.750> you<00:05:33.840> sometimes

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.450 

and<00:05:42.570> believe<00:05:43.570> me<00:05:43.600> you<00:05:44.200> do<00:05:44.380> end<00:05:44.560> up<00:05:44.710> tasting<00:05:45.070> the

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
and believe me you do end up tasting the

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.160 
and believe me you do end up tasting the
colors<00:05:45.820> rather<00:05:46.060> than<00:05:46.330> seeing<00:05:46.600> them<00:05:46.810> after<00:05:47.140> a

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
colors rather than seeing them after a

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.700 
colors rather than seeing them after a
while<00:05:47.200> so<00:05:48.450> yeah<00:05:49.450> that's<00:05:49.690> about<00:05:49.870> it<00:05:50.050> on<00:05:50.440> those

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
while so yeah that's about it on those

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.860 
while so yeah that's about it on those
questions<00:05:51.040> that<00:05:51.340> I've<00:05:51.460> been<00:05:51.490> asked<00:05:51.760> so<00:05:51.880> far<00:05:51.910> do

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
questions that I've been asked so far do

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.570 
questions that I've been asked so far do
keep<00:05:53.110> the<00:05:53.230> questions<00:05:53.650> coming<00:05:53.770> because<00:05:54.430> I<00:05:54.520> do

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
keep the questions coming because I do

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.670 
keep the questions coming because I do
enjoy<00:05:54.790> those<00:05:55.120> and<00:05:55.360> if<00:05:56.140> I<00:05:56.200> can<00:05:56.350> answer<00:05:56.500> some

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
enjoy those and if I can answer some

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.230 
enjoy those and if I can answer some
straightway<00:05:56.950> that's<00:05:57.340> cool<00:05:57.610> or<00:05:57.820> I<00:05:57.850> could<00:05:57.970> turn

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
straightway that's cool or I could turn

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.810 
straightway that's cool or I could turn
them<00:05:58.390> into<00:05:58.510> a<00:05:58.600> video<00:05:59.370> it's<00:06:00.370> I'm<00:06:00.430> a<00:06:00.460> quick<00:06:00.670> look

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
them into a video it's I'm a quick look

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.180 
them into a video it's I'm a quick look
at<00:06:00.970> the<00:06:01.120> the<00:06:01.570> angles<00:06:01.960> on<00:06:02.080> this<00:06:02.230> we<00:06:02.860> have<00:06:02.980> turn

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
at the the angles on this we have turn

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.090 
at the the angles on this we have turn
the<00:06:03.900> put<00:06:04.900> the<00:06:04.990> light<00:06:05.170> in<00:06:05.200> there<00:06:05.560> soon

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
the put the light in there soon

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.880 
the put the light in there soon
so<00:06:06.430> get<00:06:06.610> the<00:06:06.700> arc<00:06:06.880> reactor<00:06:07.320> and<00:06:08.320> now<00:06:08.500> almost

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
so get the arc reactor and now almost

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:15.090 
so get the arc reactor and now almost
carry<00:06:09.310> it<00:06:09.430> there's<00:06:09.640> the<00:06:11.820> hinges<00:06:13.860> we're<00:06:14.860> done

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
carry it there's the hinges we're done

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.630 
carry it there's the hinges we're done
I'm<00:06:15.430> going<00:06:15.580> to<00:06:15.670> stick<00:06:16.090> probably<00:06:17.610> put<00:06:18.610> a

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
I'm going to stick probably put a

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.950 
I'm going to stick probably put a
Bluetooth<00:06:19.150> module<00:06:19.390> in<00:06:19.690> there<00:06:19.870> as<00:06:19.960> well<00:06:21.960> and

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
Bluetooth module in there as well and

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.350 
Bluetooth module in there as well and
also<00:06:23.110> it's<00:06:23.470> going<00:06:23.620> to<00:06:23.680> be<00:06:23.830> in<00:06:24.060> take<00:06:25.060> it<00:06:25.090> to<00:06:25.270> the
