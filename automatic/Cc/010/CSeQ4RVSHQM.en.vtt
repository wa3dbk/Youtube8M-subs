guessed<00:01:11.430> proton<00:01:11.969> but<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:13.079> I<00:01:13.350> believed<00:01:14.009> one

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
guessed proton but then I believed one

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.639 
guessed proton but then I believed one
time<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> was<00:01:15.030> thinking<00:01:15.329> of<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.539> mailbox<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.409> it

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
time I was thinking of a mailbox and it

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.380 
time I was thinking of a mailbox and it
couldn't<00:01:16.859> get<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.039> simple<00:01:17.430> mailbox<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.270> got

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
couldn't get a simple mailbox but it got

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.709 
couldn't get a simple mailbox but it got
proton<00:01:18.929> for<00:01:19.229> some<00:01:19.380> weird<00:01:19.560> reason<00:01:20.420> but<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.570> is

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
proton for some weird reason but this is

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.200
