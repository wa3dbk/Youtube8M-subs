00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
just use the dot zip version to keep it

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.690 
just use the dot zip version to keep it
simple<00:02:29.300> plus<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.450> works<00:02:30.599> on<00:02:30.780> both<00:02:30.810> systems

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
simple plus it works on both systems

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.410 
simple plus it works on both systems
windows<00:02:32.700> or<00:02:33.260> linux<00:02:34.260> really<00:02:34.680> easily<00:02:35.150> ok<00:02:36.150> so

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420
