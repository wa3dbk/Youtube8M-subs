00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
touch the paintwork either so I'm going

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.560 
touch the paintwork either so I'm going
to<00:01:40.680> sit<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> tripod<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.670> those<00:01:41.939> bits<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.329> tape

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
to sit the tripod on those bits of tape

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.469 
to sit the tripod on those bits of tape
like<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.409> I've<00:01:43.560> already<00:01:43.740> kind<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.479> got

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
like that and I've already kind of got

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.690 
like that and I've already kind of got
it<00:01:45.600> ready<00:01:45.840> there<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.229> go

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
it ready there we go

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.179 
it ready there we go
and<00:01:48.020> you'll<00:01:49.020> also<00:01:49.170> know<00:01:49.380> I've<00:01:49.680> got<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> cable

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
and you'll also know I've got a cable

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.100 
and you'll also know I've got a cable
release<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.090> here<00:01:51.299> too<00:01:51.479> because<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
release going on here too because the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.109 
release going on here too because the
last<00:01:52.350> thing<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.710> want<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.950> do<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.549> vibrate

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
last thing I want to do is to vibrate

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.800 
last thing I want to do is to vibrate
the<00:01:54.299> camera<00:01:54.810> during<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.710> exposure<00:01:56.810> movement

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the camera during the exposure movement

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.749 
the camera during the exposure movement
is<00:01:57.899> all<00:01:58.049> about<00:01:58.079> shutter<00:01:58.590> speed<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.219> need<00:01:59.729> a

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
is all about shutter speed you need a

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.609 
is all about shutter speed you need a
slow<00:02:00.180> shutter<00:02:00.479> speed<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:00.960> order<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.290> create

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
slow shutter speed in order to create

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.249 
slow shutter speed in order to create
movement<00:02:02.340> or<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.670> fast<00:02:03.149> shutter<00:02:03.420> speed<00:02:03.780> in

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
movement or a fast shutter speed in

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.469 
movement or a fast shutter speed in
order<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.770> freeze<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.520> stop<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.119> get<00:02:06.270> rid

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
order to freeze it to stop it to get rid

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.109 
order to freeze it to stop it to get rid
of<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.719> now<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.649> ultimate<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.580> speed<00:02:08.789> for<00:02:09.030> this

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
of it now the ultimate of speed for this

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.570 
of it now the ultimate of speed for this
shot<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.569> reckon<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.200> about<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> half<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.099> second

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
shot I reckon is about a half a second

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.220 
shot I reckon is about a half a second
so<00:02:12.120> that's<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.480> first<00:02:12.690> thing<00:02:12.900> I'm<00:02:13.050> going<00:02:13.170> to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
so that's the first thing I'm going to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.880 
so that's the first thing I'm going to
do<00:02:13.379> you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
do you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.920 
do you
to<00:02:13.980> shoot<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.400> manual<00:02:14.640> mode<00:02:14.850> for<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.480> really

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
to shoot in manual mode for this really

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.470 
to shoot in manual mode for this really
so<00:02:16.410> you've<00:02:16.560> got<00:02:16.770> full<00:02:17.040> control<00:02:17.250> I'm<00:02:18.240> going

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
so you've got full control I'm going

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.330 
so you've got full control I'm going
into<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.750> camera<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.650> I'm<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.160> going<00:02:20.310> to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
into the camera and I'm just going to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.870 
into the camera and I'm just going to
set<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:21.410> half<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.680> second<00:02:23.160> actually<00:02:23.610> I'm<00:02:23.790> not

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
set a half a second actually I'm not

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.480 
set a half a second actually I'm not
going<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.090> go<00:02:24.150> for<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.330> one<00:02:24.630> second<00:02:25.230> exposure

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
going to go for a one second exposure

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.820 
going to go for a one second exposure
okay<00:02:26.490> one<00:02:27.300> second<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.990> shutter<00:02:28.230> will<00:02:28.410> open

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
okay one second the shutter will open

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.860 
okay one second the shutter will open
stuff<00:02:29.430> will<00:02:29.670> move<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.150> then<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.630> shutter

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
stuff will move and then the shutter

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.590 
stuff will move and then the shutter
will<00:02:31.110> close<00:02:31.700> now<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.730> can't<00:02:33.030> tell<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.450> what

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
will close now I can't tell you what

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.180 
will close now I can't tell you what
aperture<00:02:34.110> you're<00:02:34.290> going<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.560> need<00:02:34.709> because<00:02:34.860> I

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
aperture you're going to need because I

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.010 
aperture you're going to need because I
don't<00:02:35.430> know<00:02:35.610> what<00:02:35.820> light<00:02:36.090> you're<00:02:36.360> shooting<00:02:36.870> in

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
don't know what light you're shooting in

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.780 
don't know what light you're shooting in
and<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.709> is<00:02:37.770> crucial<00:02:38.100> you've<00:02:38.400> obviously<00:02:38.520> got

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
and this is crucial you've obviously got

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.850 
and this is crucial you've obviously got
to<00:02:38.820> get<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.120> exposure<00:02:39.570> correct<00:02:40.140> we're

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
to get the exposure correct we're

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.860 
to get the exposure correct we're
shooting<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.430> evening<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.090> it's<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.750> bit

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
shooting in the evening and it's a bit

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.600 
shooting in the evening and it's a bit
of<00:02:42.959> an<00:02:43.050> overcast<00:02:43.530> kind<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.040> an<00:02:44.100> evening<00:02:44.250> we're

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
of an overcast kind of an evening we're

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.520 
of an overcast kind of an evening we're
under<00:02:44.850> trees<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.450> tunnel<00:02:45.989> here<00:02:46.260> is

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
under trees this tunnel here is

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.380 
under trees this tunnel here is
brilliant<00:02:47.220> because<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.520> blocks<00:02:47.880> some<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.300> the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
brilliant because it blocks some of the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.690 
brilliant because it blocks some of the
sky<00:02:48.690> reflections<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.830> makes<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.340> little<00:02:50.459> bit

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
sky reflections it makes it a little bit

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.340 
sky reflections it makes it a little bit
darker<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:51.420> we<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:51.660> use<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.019> slow<00:02:52.320> shutter

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
darker so we can use the slow shutter

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.800 
darker so we can use the slow shutter
speed<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.459> it<00:02:53.700> gives<00:02:53.880> us<00:02:54.000> plenty<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.510> things

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
speed and it gives us plenty of things

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.110 
speed and it gives us plenty of things
to<00:02:54.989> blur<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.709> picture<00:02:56.190> if<00:02:56.519> you<00:02:56.670> try<00:02:57.060> this

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
to blur in the picture if you try this

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.180 
to blur in the picture if you try this
out<00:02:57.450> on<00:02:57.570> an<00:02:57.660> open<00:02:58.019> prairie<00:02:58.410> somewhere<00:02:59.010> or

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
out on an open prairie somewhere or

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.740 
out on an open prairie somewhere or
something<00:02:59.550> like<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.730> without<00:03:00.090> stuff<00:03:00.540> either

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
something like that without stuff either

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.570 
something like that without stuff either
side<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.230> road<00:03:01.380> there's<00:03:01.890> nothing<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.340> blur

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
side of the road there's nothing to blur

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.550 
side of the road there's nothing to blur
is<00:03:02.820> there<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.360> won't<00:03:03.600> get<00:03:03.780> much<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.110> an<00:03:04.200> effect

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
is there you won't get much of an effect

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.710 
is there you won't get much of an effect
try<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.340> do<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.519> somewhere<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.880> bit<00:03:06.030> quiet<00:03:06.420> so

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
try and do it somewhere a bit quiet so

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.420 
try and do it somewhere a bit quiet so
you<00:03:06.780> don't<00:03:07.110> get<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:07.440> everyone's<00:03:07.739> way<00:03:08.100> there's

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
you don't get in everyone's way there's

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.610 
you don't get in everyone's way there's
a<00:03:08.489> few<00:03:08.700> cars<00:03:08.970> coming<00:03:09.330> through<00:03:09.360> here<00:03:09.810> but<00:03:10.500> the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
a few cars coming through here but the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.410 
a few cars coming through here but the
crucial<00:03:11.040> thing<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.370> stuff<00:03:11.820> either<00:03:12.180> side<00:03:12.390> of

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
crucial thing is stuff either side of

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.949 
crucial thing is stuff either side of
the<00:03:12.660> road<00:03:13.580> so<00:03:14.580> we've<00:03:14.790> set<00:03:15.030> our<00:03:15.150> 1<00:03:15.420> second

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
the road so we've set our 1 second

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.250 
the road so we've set our 1 second
exposure<00:03:16.380> now<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.220> need<00:03:17.550> to<00:03:17.730> set<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.720> aperture

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
exposure now I need to set the aperture

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.789 
exposure now I need to set the aperture
in<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:20.250> will<00:03:20.400> work<00:03:20.610> with<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.120> exposure<00:03:21.799> so

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
in that will work with that exposure so

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.470 
in that will work with that exposure so
if<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.190> go<00:03:23.430> into<00:03:24.350> my<00:03:25.519> spring<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.610> infobar<00:03:27.120> info

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
if I go into my spring the infobar info

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.030 
if I go into my spring the infobar info
button<00:03:27.780> up<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.019> we<00:03:28.140> can<00:03:28.290> see<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.590> light<00:03:28.769> meter

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
button up so we can see the light meter

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.949 
button up so we can see the light meter
as<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.700> can<00:03:29.820> see<00:03:29.970> I've<00:03:30.120> set<00:03:30.269> one<00:03:30.510> second

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
as you can see I've set one second

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.770 
as you can see I've set one second
exposure<00:03:31.400> at<00:03:32.400> f10<00:03:32.880> it's<00:03:33.269> saying<00:03:33.600> it's

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
exposure at f10 it's saying it's

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.789 
exposure at f10 it's saying it's
overexposed<00:03:34.730> so<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.760> need<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.390> change<00:03:37.170> this<00:03:37.560> the

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
overexposed so I need to change this the

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.979 
overexposed so I need to change this the
wrong<00:03:37.980> one<00:03:38.220> here<00:03:38.489> we<00:03:38.610> go<00:03:38.760> my<00:03:39.030> aperture<00:03:39.420> until

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
wrong one here we go my aperture until

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.979 
wrong one here we go my aperture until
the<00:03:40.079> light<00:03:40.290> meter<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.650> about<00:03:41.040> in<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.310> middle

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
the light meter is about in the middle

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.810 
the light meter is about in the middle
this<00:03:42.989> is<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.230> very<00:03:43.500> dark<00:03:43.799> green<00:03:44.160> car<00:03:44.549> and

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
this is a very dark green car and

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.509 
this is a very dark green car and
cameras<00:03:45.239> think<00:03:45.510> everything<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.110> mid<00:03:46.320> gray<00:03:46.650> so

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
cameras think everything is mid gray so

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.190 
cameras think everything is mid gray so
actually<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:47.940> want<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:48.360> to<00:03:48.450> be<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.570> little<00:03:48.810> tiny

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
actually I want it to be a little tiny

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.990 
actually I want it to be a little tiny
bit<00:03:49.440> darker<00:03:50.010> than<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.400> cameras<00:03:50.760> light<00:03:50.970> meter

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
bit darker than the cameras light meter

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.449 
bit darker than the cameras light meter
thinks<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.840> do<00:03:52.110> if<00:03:52.799> you<00:03:52.950> don't<00:03:53.100> know<00:03:53.220> what<00:03:53.370> I'm

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
thinks I do if you don't know what I'm

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.650 
thinks I do if you don't know what I'm
talking<00:03:53.790> about<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:54.060> need<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.299> go<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.450> look<00:03:54.540> at

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
talking about you need to go and look at

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.660 
talking about you need to go and look at
the<00:03:54.810> exposure<00:03:55.260> films<00:03:55.709> so<00:03:56.190> I'm<00:03:56.310> just<00:03:56.459> going<00:03:56.640> to

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
the exposure films so I'm just going to

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.340 
the exposure films so I'm just going to
change<00:03:57.000> my<00:03:57.269> I've<00:03:57.510> done<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.780> again<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.200> wrong

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
change my I've done it again the wrong

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.890 
change my I've done it again the wrong
one<00:03:58.530> there<00:03:59.340> we<00:03:59.430> go<00:03:59.519> I'm<00:03:59.640> going<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.880> f20<00:04:00.660> which

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
one there we go I'm going to f20 which

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.420 
one there we go I'm going to f20 which
is<00:04:01.049> just<00:04:01.350> underexposed

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
is just underexposed

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.940 
is just underexposed
very<00:04:03.000> very<00:04:03.269> very<00:04:03.570> slightly<00:04:03.959> because<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.739> want

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
very very very slightly because I want

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.069 
very very very slightly because I want
to<00:04:05.010> get<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.160> exposure<00:04:05.489> right<00:04:05.840> now<00:04:06.840> in<00:04:06.900> these

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
to get the exposure right now in these

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.970 
to get the exposure right now in these
lighting<00:04:07.320> conditions<00:04:07.920> I'm<00:04:08.100> using<00:04:08.459> an<00:04:08.760> ISO<00:04:09.299> of

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
lighting conditions I'm using an ISO of

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.319 
lighting conditions I'm using an ISO of
200<00:04:10.980> which<00:04:11.130> is<00:04:11.280> pretty<00:04:11.519> low<00:04:11.790> so<00:04:12.030> we've<00:04:12.150> got

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
200 which is pretty low so we've got

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.170 
200 which is pretty low so we've got
nice<00:04:12.600> fine<00:04:12.959> quality<00:04:13.440> in<00:04:13.560> good<00:04:13.829> colors<00:04:14.250> as<00:04:14.910> I

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
nice fine quality in good colors as I

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.029 
nice fine quality in good colors as I
say<00:04:15.420> if<00:04:15.600> you<00:04:15.720> had<00:04:15.900> more<00:04:16.079> light<00:04:16.350> going<00:04:16.590> on<00:04:16.799> here

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
say if you had more light going on here

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.159 
say if you had more light going on here
you<00:04:17.459> might<00:04:17.760> not<00:04:17.970> be<00:04:18.090> able<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.390> get<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.780> one

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
you might not be able to get a one

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.430 
you might not be able to get a one
second<00:04:19.709> exposure<00:04:20.090> f20<00:04:21.090> with<00:04:21.299> 200<00:04:21.870> ISO<00:04:22.229> you

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
second exposure f20 with 200 ISO you

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.950 
second exposure f20 with 200 ISO you
might<00:04:22.830> need<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.070> go<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.250> 100<00:04:24.120> ISO<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.539> make<00:04:24.840> the

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
might need to go to 100 ISO to make the

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.140 
might need to go to 100 ISO to make the
camera<00:04:25.289> less<00:04:25.500> sensitive<00:04:26.099> II

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
camera less sensitive II

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.030 
camera less sensitive II
and<00:04:27.240> then<00:04:27.479> it<00:04:27.810> might<00:04:28.020> not<00:04:28.169> be<00:04:28.320> enough<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:28.919> you

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
and then it might not be enough and you

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.610 
and then it might not be enough and you
might<00:04:29.280> need<00:04:29.490> to<00:04:29.729> use<00:04:30.110> something<00:04:31.110> like<00:04:31.290> a

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
might need to use something like a

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.260 
might need to use something like a
neutral<00:04:32.100> density<00:04:32.160> filter<00:04:33.120> I've<00:04:33.900> got<00:04:34.080> one<00:04:34.229> here

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
neutral density filter I've got one here

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.969 
neutral density filter I've got one here
this<00:04:36.270> is<00:04:36.330> like<00:04:36.570> a<00:04:36.630> pair<00:04:36.960> of<00:04:36.990> sunglasses<00:04:37.289> it's

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
this is like a pair of sunglasses it's

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.409 
this is like a pair of sunglasses it's
kind<00:04:38.160> of<00:04:38.220> you<00:04:38.310> put<00:04:38.490> it<00:04:38.580> over<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:38.850> lens<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.330> it

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
kind of you put it over the lens and it

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.300 
kind of you put it over the lens and it
just<00:04:39.600> cuts<00:04:39.810> light<00:04:40.139> out<00:04:40.380> that's<00:04:40.680> all<00:04:40.949> it<00:04:41.130> does

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
just cuts light out that's all it does

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.670 
just cuts light out that's all it does
there's<00:04:41.610> no<00:04:41.729> color<00:04:42.030> in<00:04:42.210> it<00:04:42.360> this<00:04:42.960> is<00:04:43.110> a<00:04:43.139> coke<00:04:43.410> in

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
there's no color in it this is a coke in

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.050 
there's no color in it this is a coke in
you<00:04:43.830> can<00:04:43.949> get<00:04:44.130> Lee<00:04:44.370> which<00:04:44.639> are<00:04:44.759> absolutely

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
you can get Lee which are absolutely

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.909 
you can get Lee which are absolutely
brilliant<00:04:45.389> I<00:04:45.660> have<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:46.020> say<00:04:46.199> and<00:04:46.410> it<00:04:46.770> has<00:04:46.889> a

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
brilliant I have to say and it has a

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.230 
brilliant I have to say and it has a
little<00:04:47.160> bracket<00:04:47.550> that<00:04:47.639> slots<00:04:47.970> on<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.150> front

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
little bracket that slots on the front

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.939 
little bracket that slots on the front
you<00:04:48.570> slide<00:04:48.870> it<00:04:49.020> in<00:04:49.139> and<00:04:49.289> it<00:04:49.380> will<00:04:49.500> cut<00:04:49.710> out

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
you slide it in and it will cut out

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.640 
you slide it in and it will cut out
light<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:50.910> will<00:04:51.000> allow<00:04:51.300> you<00:04:51.360> to<00:04:51.690> set<00:04:51.990> slow

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
light and it will allow you to set slow

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.279 
light and it will allow you to set slow
exposures<00:04:53.340> if<00:04:53.699> you<00:04:54.449> don't<00:04:54.690> need<00:04:54.780> to<00:04:54.900> cut<00:04:55.080> out<00:04:55.259> a

that<00:06:57.830> sort<00:06:58.100> of<00:06:58.160> speed<00:06:58.460> and<00:06:58.880> even<00:06:59.090> if<00:06:59.180> it<00:06:59.300> did

00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.450 
that sort of speed and even if it did

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.510 
that sort of speed and even if it did
you'll<00:06:59.660> hear<00:06:59.930> just<00:07:00.320> catch<00:07:00.560> it<00:07:00.590> just<00:07:01.130> grab<00:07:01.310> hold
