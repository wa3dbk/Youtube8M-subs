00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.649 
get this game on PC or should I get it
on<00:01:49.829> console<00:01:50.369> here's<00:01:51.000> one<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> rare<00:01:51.630> times

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
on console here's one of the rare times

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.270 
on console here's one of the rare times
where<00:01:52.259> I'm<00:01:52.350> going<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.590> tell<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.950> don't

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
where I'm going to tell you I don't

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.429 
where I'm going to tell you I don't
think<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.549> really<00:01:53.579> matters<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.450> doesn't<00:01:55.170> seem

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
think it really matters it doesn't seem

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.980 
think it really matters it doesn't seem
like<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.770> was<00:01:55.860> optimized<00:01:56.460> well<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:57.030> PC<00:01:57.509> it

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
like it was optimized well for PC it

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.590 
like it was optimized well for PC it
doesn't<00:01:58.530> seem<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.770> they<00:01:59.310> took<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.729> time<00:01:59.969> to

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
doesn't seem like they took the time to

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.690 
doesn't seem like they took the time to
really<00:02:00.810> make<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.290> game<00:02:01.469> shine<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.040> PC<00:02:02.490> like

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
really make this game shine on PC like

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.789 
really make this game shine on PC like
they<00:02:02.880> could<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.299> when<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.020> fired<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.530> up<00:02:04.619> and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
they could have when I fired it up and

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.530 
they could have when I fired it up and
maxed<00:02:05.159> everything<00:02:05.579> out<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.119> includes

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
maxed everything out and that includes

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.900 
maxed everything out and that includes
going<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.020> ultra<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.590> then<00:02:07.829> are<00:02:08.099> still

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
going to ultra and then are still

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.210 
going to ultra and then are still
turning<00:02:09.420> some<00:02:09.780> things<00:02:10.020> up<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.530> was<00:02:10.950> getting

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
turning some things up I was getting

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.650 
turning some things up I was getting
framerate<00:02:11.459> drops<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.150> game<00:02:12.300> isn't<00:02:12.480> even

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
framerate drops in this game isn't even

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.690 
framerate drops in this game isn't even
that<00:02:12.840> graph

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
that graph

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.240 
that graph
impressive<00:02:14.700> out<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.600> ultra<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.860> was<00:02:17.010> still

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
impressive out on ultra and I was still

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.580 
impressive out on ultra and I was still
getting<00:02:17.430> framerate<00:02:17.760> drops<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.720> obviously<00:02:19.350> has

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
getting framerate drops so obviously has

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.560 
getting framerate drops so obviously has
nothing<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.160> do<00:02:20.280> with<00:02:20.430> my<00:02:20.580> hardware<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.270> lot

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
nothing to do with my hardware and a lot

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.780 
nothing to do with my hardware and a lot
more<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.080> do<00:02:22.260> with<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.220> fact<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.610> they

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
more to do with the fact that they

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.810 
more to do with the fact that they
didn't<00:02:24.150> really<00:02:24.470> optimize<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.680> game<00:02:25.890> well<00:02:26.250> I'm

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
didn't really optimize the game well I'm

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.970 
didn't really optimize the game well I'm
one<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.210> people<00:02:27.360> who<00:02:27.510> need<00:02:27.810> solid<00:02:28.590> 60

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
one of the people who need solid 60

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.070 
one of the people who need solid 60
frames<00:02:29.190> per<00:02:29.310> second<00:02:29.880> not<00:02:30.030> dropping<00:02:30.720> down<00:02:31.020> into

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
frames per second not dropping down into

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.980 
frames per second not dropping down into
the<00:02:31.410> 50s<00:02:31.860> or<00:02:32.040> anything<00:02:32.370> like<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.990> absolutely

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
the 50s or anything like that absolutely

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.380 
the 50s or anything like that absolutely
rock-solid<00:02:34.680> 60<00:02:35.370> frames<00:02:35.610> per<00:02:35.730> second<00:02:36.270> at<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
rock-solid 60 frames per second at the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.210 
rock-solid 60 frames per second at the
very<00:02:36.720> least<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.890> was<00:02:38.010> really

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
very least so it was really

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.130 
very least so it was really
disappointing<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:39.030> see<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.510> even<00:02:39.660> with<00:02:39.960> the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
disappointing to see that even with the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.720 
disappointing to see that even with the
graphics<00:02:40.560> turned<00:02:40.770> up<00:02:40.950> obviously<00:02:41.520> there's

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
graphics turned up obviously there's

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.870 
graphics turned up obviously there's
texture<00:02:42.570> differences<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.500> god<00:02:44.010> raised<00:02:44.430> and

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
texture differences and god raised and

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.610 
texture differences and god raised and
things<00:02:45.210> like<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.990> you<00:02:46.140> don't<00:02:46.410> get<00:02:46.560> on

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
things like that that you don't get on

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.220 
things like that that you don't get on
consoles<00:02:47.250> but<00:02:47.880> honestly<00:02:48.150> there<00:02:48.690> wasn't<00:02:49.080> much

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
consoles but honestly there wasn't much

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.900 
consoles but honestly there wasn't much
of<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.470> difference<00:02:49.770> there<00:02:49.830> wasn't<00:02:50.250> as<00:02:50.400> big<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.700> a

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
of a difference there wasn't as big of a

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.290 
of a difference there wasn't as big of a
leap<00:02:51.210> as<00:02:51.420> there<00:02:51.990> should<00:02:52.020> be<00:02:52.350> from<00:02:53.160> console<00:02:53.700> to

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
leap as there should be from console to

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.390 
leap as there should be from console to
pc<00:02:54.840> now<00:02:54.990> obviously<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.620> haven't<00:02:55.890> played<00:02:56.100> old

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
pc now obviously I haven't played old

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.250 
pc now obviously I haven't played old
blood<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:56.910> console<00:02:57.480> but<00:02:57.630> I<00:02:57.660> have<00:02:57.870> played<00:02:58.110> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
blood on console but I have played the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.050 
blood on console but I have played the
new<00:02:58.380> order<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.770> console<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.460> they<00:02:59.820> look

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
new order on console and they look

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.050 
new order on console and they look
pretty<00:03:00.270> damn<00:03:00.540> similar<00:03:00.930> on<00:03:01.260> my<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.560> know<00:03:01.980> uh

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
pretty damn similar on my you know uh

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.780 
pretty damn similar on my you know uh
expensive<00:03:03.060> ass<00:03:03.420> pc<00:03:04.020> so<00:03:04.380> if<00:03:04.890> you're<00:03:05.610> debating

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
expensive ass pc so if you're debating

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.060 
expensive ass pc so if you're debating
console<00:03:06.690> or<00:03:06.840> PC<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:07.350> don't<00:03:07.710> think<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.040> really

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
console or PC I don't think it really

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.370 
console or PC I don't think it really
matters<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.820> think<00:03:09.060> actually<00:03:09.300> if<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:10.200> have

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
matters and I think actually if you have

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.400 
matters and I think actually if you have
a<00:03:10.410> week<00:03:10.800> or<00:03:11.040> GPU<00:03:11.550> I<00:03:12.090> would<00:03:12.660> say<00:03:12.870> get<00:03:13.050> it<00:03:13.200> on<00:03:13.320> the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
a week or GPU I would say get it on the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.620 
a week or GPU I would say get it on the
console<00:03:13.890> but<00:03:14.430> otherwise<00:03:14.700> this<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.150> more<00:03:15.480> the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
console but otherwise this is more the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.440 
console but otherwise this is more the
same<00:03:15.810> guys<00:03:16.050> great<00:03:16.560> gunplay<00:03:17.130> amazing<00:03:18.060> gunplay

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
same guys great gunplay amazing gunplay

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.210 
same guys great gunplay amazing gunplay
I<00:03:18.480> think<00:03:18.750> that's<00:03:18.930> why<00:03:19.110> pretty<00:03:19.709> much<00:03:19.890> everybody

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
I think that's why pretty much everybody

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.600 
I think that's why pretty much everybody
loved<00:03:20.900> Wolfenstein<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.080> new<00:03:22.200> order<00:03:22.560> its<00:03:23.220> gory

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
loved Wolfenstein the new order its gory

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
video games I've heard people say that

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.070 
video games I've heard people say that
they<00:03:35.370> didn't<00:03:35.730> like<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.060> new<00:03:36.180> order<00:03:36.540> but<00:03:37.050> I

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
they didn't like the new order but I

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.470 
they didn't like the new order but I
think<00:03:37.230> they're<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.770> the<00:03:37.860> minority<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.550> gave<00:03:39.120> the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
think they're in the minority I gave the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.690 
think they're in the minority I gave the
new<00:03:39.600> order<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> 9<00:03:40.320> out<00:03:40.530> of<00:03:40.560> 10<00:03:40.830> it<00:03:41.070> was<00:03:41.220> probably

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
new order a 9 out of 10 it was probably

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.060 
new order a 9 out of 10 it was probably
one<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.030> my<00:03:42.120> favorite<00:03:42.900> games<00:03:42.930> last<00:03:43.500> year<00:03:43.709> and

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
one of my favorite games last year and

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.190 
one of my favorite games last year and
that's<00:03:44.580> just<00:03:44.790> because<00:03:45.000> it's<00:03:45.330> such<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.750> solid

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
that's just because it's such a solid

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.290 
that's just because it's such a solid
first<00:03:46.709> person<00:03:47.100> shooter<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.550> mechanics<00:03:48.180> are

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
first person shooter the mechanics are

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.530 
first person shooter the mechanics are
great<00:03:48.630> other<00:03:48.959> story<00:03:49.800> is<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:51.090> story<00:03:51.150> wasn't

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
great other story is the story wasn't

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.960 
great other story is the story wasn't
absolutely<00:03:51.980> mind-blowing<00:03:52.980> but<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.820> was<00:03:53.940> a

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
absolutely mind-blowing but it was a

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.990 
absolutely mind-blowing but it was a
badass<00:03:54.330> story<00:03:55.080> so<00:03:55.709> uh<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.550> you're<00:03:56.850> getting

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
badass story so uh and you're getting

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.900 
badass story so uh and you're getting
more<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.840> same<00:03:58.080> with<00:03:58.730> Wolfenstein<00:03:59.730> the

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
more of the same with Wolfenstein the

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.910 
more of the same with Wolfenstein the
old<00:04:00.120> blood<00:04:00.450> so<00:04:01.080> now<00:04:01.230> we'll<00:04:01.410> move<00:04:01.530> on<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.739> the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
old blood so now we'll move on to the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.440 
old blood so now we'll move on to the
second<00:04:02.310> thing<00:04:02.459> that<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.640> quickly<00:04:03.000> want<00:04:03.300> to

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
second thing that I quickly want to

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.449 
second thing that I quickly want to
mention<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:03.989> that's<00:04:04.410> that<00:04:04.650> killing<00:04:04.980> floor<00:04:05.190> 2

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
mention and that's that killing floor 2

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.600 
mention and that's that killing floor 2
is<00:04:05.700> more<00:04:06.300> than<00:04:06.450> likely<00:04:06.690> coming<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.739> Xbox<00:04:08.220> one

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610

his words he said an xbox one version is
highly<00:04:17.190> probable<00:04:17.340> now<00:04:18.239> he<00:04:18.299> did<00:04:18.600> say<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:19.019> the

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
exclusivity so obviously it will be a

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.550
