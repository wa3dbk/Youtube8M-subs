00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hi this video is part 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.730
 video review of communication with the new policy 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.769
 I'm recording the games separately, that is 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.710
 review review and games 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.260
 games so now i want to show 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.810
 you literally have a few games like them 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.439
 go on this tablet by the way I want 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.650
 say that there is such a nuance that the sound 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.630
 i need to regulate 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.449
 directly the software does not have such 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.530
 functions so that the sound is adjustable but 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.200
 buttons, that is, there are no buttons anywhere 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.480
 so please take this into account when running games 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.370
 Immediately put a smaller sound because 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.500
 you can't but him 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.140
 get the sound of course to switch 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.140
 here I am at least not right now 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.470
 I just want to note that the graphics here are not 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.680
 especially good that is felt that 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:16.880
 graphics are weaker but not bad in principle 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:19.890
 itself goes tolerably the game goes demand but 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.990
 I definitely feel that this tablet 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.690
 would not be a game in general, well, the game 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.900
 went just ok let's go now 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.820
 look more at real risen but i'm on 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.610
 queues just by run faith for 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.990
 so that you can see 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.630
 so but after a very long 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.830
 download this game I still got to 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:48.860
 run race stages and now here 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:53.220
 I am waiting to start the race 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.110
 real racing 3 is quite a popular game 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.410
 often and and run to 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.380
 check how interesting the tablets are and 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:08.250
 how does he behave in games 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.899
 the graphics are going well but still at 1024 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.910
 at 768 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:19.590
 the game is practically adapted in principle 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:24.330
 There are no bugs here at all glitches yes I 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.160
 under the lag they don't see at all maybe 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.730
 Here on the corners a little bit like that 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.200
 small jams and all attacks on 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.990
 surprise despite the fact that the game 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.069
 loaded long enough that is here 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:44.910
 need patience to wait 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:48.530
 the download of the game itself now everything is on 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.530
 very good 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.810
 also such a blend game is also going 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:09.020
 not bad, that is 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:14.590
 I can say that for such games 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:18.040
 small quite adequate and decent 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.040
 super all 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.560
 next injustice 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.930
 it is immediately clear that the graphics are here at all 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:39.040
 terrible and given that I 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.040
 periodically I love to play injustice 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:46.730
 I at least know what should be 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:56.860
 be the graphics and here she is just gently 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:04:03.040
 saying terrible but the most interesting thing is that 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.040
 the game goes without brakes and now we 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.970
 in general, yes, it was all four 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.790
 games not to do enough 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.919
 a lot of time just want to say something 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.169
 tablet I felt that it was hot 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.220
 despite the fact that he is now in 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.949
 the camera I feel warm right as if 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.979
 color spreads it around 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.380
 tablet and here in this area 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:39.810
 almost all felt 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.139
 warm yes it was track your model it 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.090
 ercy 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:48.490
 70 80 4f if you are interested in a tablet 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.669

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.650

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.870
