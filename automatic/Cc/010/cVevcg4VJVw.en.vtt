 so friends do not have the taste and color of a friend 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.870
 steve jobs when developing his 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:09.290
 products, he is exactly what he sought 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:13.410
 to have a complete iron integration 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.870
 of its operating system 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.780
 Acos on which he works 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.750
 so that there are no non-soft 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.240
 interventions are not 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.190
 third-party file interventions from 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.520
 third-party developers to these devices 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:38.910
 so here he is 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:42.900
 in my opinion this is in this is in 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.660
 big pluses and that's it 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.640
 Integration Now let's take a quick look. 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.420
 here it is the desktop 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.930
 I have firmware ios 702 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.110
 He asks for 703 to upgrade until 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.450
 hurry there is no special meaning 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.300
 what is the standard phone function here 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.800
 with m Safari 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.670
 This browser is standard and flat mail. 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:17.239
 post office 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:18.739
 music calendar weather camera photo 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.080
 video 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.600
 that is, seeing that you are shooting this 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.910
 not seen but everything is a photo 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.390
 by the way about the photo it's very simple on 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.330
 shot hooked up 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.580
 decided to drive all the pictures there you 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.630
 You can safely throw them on the computer 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.780
 but from the computer add photos there 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.670
 in the hope that they will appear in your 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:52.170
 your device, yes they will appear but 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:55.560

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:59.920

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:07.050

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.030
 working my applications which 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:18.400
 necessary in the work of such 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:23.260

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:27.700

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.040
 the phone its flat its all the more he 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.320
 the device doesn't work for anything 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:38.410
 sees but does not transfer any files 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.200
 you can not accept the standard 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.280

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.190
 special format 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.780
 you should also be able to add it 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.350
 for this you need to be able to use the field 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:42.460
 this program on the computer to your 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:46.480

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:50.620
 Start buying this device from 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:54.850
 what to start and start my such here 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:57.400
 You need to start the view with settings like it 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.780
 properly configure one of the functions when 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.090
 the setting is important which 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:06.500
 it can be necessary to pass the phone 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:12.260
 ignore of course the best is 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:14.900

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.380
 sticking though the devil is not so bad 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.620
