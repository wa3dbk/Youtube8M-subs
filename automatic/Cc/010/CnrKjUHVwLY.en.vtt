 so here we go you press finally I 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.639
 will introduce you how to disassemble a 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:16.519
 drive you remove the motor frame 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.519
 you eat the candle with a crisis 21 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:27.029
 after you get off the the piston 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.009
 to fully embed the blue for 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.320
 the blog pistons and after you the 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.030
 back up like that we're going you have 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.629
 as you have also written and 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.879
 mounted and after very first time you 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.940
 have forced my opposite sense of a 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.699
 clockwise and to me I 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.370
 already unscrewed my respect we go there after 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.770
 twisted you extend expected fruit between 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.829
 approved continues by hand with you 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.820
 remove the holes so if you do not know if 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.480
 this is the first time you 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:10.880
 do you put all the little ones 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:10.880
 pieces together like that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.869
 this thing 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:21.890
 the oath you know in what sense it 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:23.270
 so go there you have the app here it does not 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.710
 must not lose must lose no 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:34.220
 piece 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:37.219
 here you are going to remove the cross is 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.390
 normally it's true fake tickets here 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:45.289
 you have a small piece his list at 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:51.549
 beyond you put here that you lose it 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:55.959
 not there so you had the strap for 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:02:01.989
 block it like that so now 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:05.810
 i buy rcnm has nothing behind 

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:08.750
 you take you makes the bed it's like 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.060
 So here you have the drive 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:22.040
 complete so that's a dimmer 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:25.190
 Original lyall cannon cut if I 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.290
 remove it so do the same except them on 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.590
 this piece you have three t-bag to no 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.590
 not lose 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:47.170
 I demonstrate check and legal n and that's it 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.170
 here's a guy there are pretty good again 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.090
 we see there so there you cicada and 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.330
 from there 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.569
 Both here and here why I would 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.780
 could show you how to disassemble 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.430
 the clutch 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.170
 except that I do not really have time 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.560
 and that would make a video is too much 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.799
 long 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.930
 I could not have the m so you have it the same 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:23.180
 but the creek key 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:32.200
 you take a mouthpiece from me it's 24 and 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:34.519
 after we were like that weather has receded 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.569
 like that and after you turn in the 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.650
 by and in the opposite direction of a 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.340
 needle of me and you see that which 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.530
 moves 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.480
 what is normal and healthy between that 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.379
 drives the transmission and the wheel to 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:52.810
 the back so you have to either be with 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:55.010
 a friend or whatever may have on will do 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.560
 otherwise you find a system for 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.190
 block the wheel and you turn and 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.920
 parents who pay attention to voters 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.620
 when you remove the bell 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.930
 will have to be careful because fabien 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.620
 hold the clutch of the hit corrector 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.890
 because by wanting the real the spring 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.400
 and you will skip the figure so here you go 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.620
 so now 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:26.060
 so it's a bit like that to you 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.970
 after so now you know how 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.450
 disassemble to dimmer this so that 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:37.100
 plays and it's exactly the same so the 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:42.860
 mineral sweat y horizontal ar crano 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.820
 metals and global and the box do 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.760
 understand you ride your drive 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:52.970
 with the barrel the small our tray 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.980
 the pulley all the little ones 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:59.390
 pieces you put the fangs back and you 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:03.260
 tighten fair but that at the crown has 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:07.970
 ran you put her on the canoe passed 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:13.400
 like that after the fact comes back pretty much 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:17.120
 like that fable years she will get down to little 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.150
 close like that my steering wheel and the like 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.860
 when you put your if he had a 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.789
 attached you give your join must 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.979
 tactical is higher and tighter 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.810
 all lives what's needed extra and 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:33.970
 then of course to restart it after 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:36.729
 did not put put back the 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.580
 candle because if he too started 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.830
 with the pistons block in the Sinai finally 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.009
 in the breech does not give dear to 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.810
 your track we see people this is a 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.169
 little tutorial how to disassemble a 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.169
 dimmer
