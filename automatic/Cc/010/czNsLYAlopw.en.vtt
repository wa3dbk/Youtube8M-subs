00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.210
 Day 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.610
 Esse on the guitar 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.780
 Minister goes in 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.780
 Sub adjustment 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.970
 So the fact that the adjusting That is also the adjustment of string height 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.970
 Hey a 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.910
 Because your own guitar 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.970
 Though it is how to take the party steel 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.280
 This has had the current 10 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.540
 To-month 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:55.250
 I'd want to buy 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.250
 How the policy of the next saddle omitted in here as I of 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.210
 Then I say how to cut the saddle 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.740
 For the National Assembly work 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.670
 Tokyu Hands walking and variously 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.950
 Although I tried looking for 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.590
 I found something like this 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:20.180
 Small way Gar but I know each issue of aluminum 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.970
 One 15 mm 15 person pen 150 95 cm long 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.570
 The basis of this case 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.170
 There is a size 30 mm 30 mm long the same 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.200
 150 days 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.159
 Why do you think this is good? 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.159
 Over the plane of 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.470
 Right angle even if it is accurate 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.970
 I care about that 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:49.820
 You can work with personality by working with this 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.820
 Here to the aluminum rod bought next 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.140
 Four sides and attach the tape 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.170
 When the crawl 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.430
 It is called cotton tape 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.200
 Even this width 15 mm 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.200
 The perfect width day for this 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:13.620
 When cutting the thickness direction of the saddle, there are a number of subrow settings here 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.250
 Because this double-sided tape is still very strong 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.470
 It is okay to make the spring set strong here 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.770
 This noodle 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.960
 of 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.850
 I have done 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:28.300
 It is necessary to remove the adhesive power as it is often done by peeling or peeling off 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.110
 Follow 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.110
 I wore help 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.310
 You weaken adhesion considerably 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.760
 Put on 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.469
 For those who now 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.469
 Though 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:52.150
 I am married 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.150
 Though it becomes perfect by arranging two from just 30 meters 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:00.200
 &amp; Paper, but put two rows of this on the side of the sandpaper 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.200
 Glue 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:08.110
 Let's try to find the next sub thickness 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.350
 This is a new saddle material 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:17.400
 It's a sub that white has been up to now 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.400
 As it entered exactly, I cut the bottleneck according to the thickness of this sub 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.250
 If you understand 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.250
 It is good with sour taste 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.690
 It becomes thinner, but it is around 4 mm of brother store 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.680
 I am one person now 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.680
 Well there is 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.730
 Hmm 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.790
 Do not go down 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.120
 Stop sliding 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.890
 As much as possible 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.890
 As you can see from 1 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.489
 too 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.190
 I understand you collect 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.840
 This is already 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:25.010
 I can read 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.010
 If you set up for the missing part 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:34.279
 Oh 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.640
 Repeat the thing and you're getting close 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.160
 Ooh 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.639
 To actually explore the return 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.449
 Dolphin 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.980
 Bought a little more 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:00.420
 Or stuck mind if a little 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.230
 If it is great and you become one, there 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.270
 The 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.270
 Because this brother will be really rusty 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:13.500
 People who Eu 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.560
 Next time 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.500
 Eye corresponding to there 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.960
 Bring out horizontal and right angle 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.870
 Next is this 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.540
 People can not use this slip stop 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.540
 Do not smoke by the hundreds plane 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.220
 Yes also 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.220
 but 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:45.970
 The aluminum rod of this time is small high 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.970
 In the drawings are a little squeeze-out form 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.000
 This is fine 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.750
 I went to hearing firmly and steady 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.750
 This is 100 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.940
 This time wow 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.590
 Sandpaper 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.000
 You can press the car mask 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.380
 Hold firm 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.130
 you 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.130
 I am 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.470
 If you 

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:33.380
 If you have a watermark to light 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.990
 You go 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.470
 It seems if there is a chance 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.160
 Because it is an estimate 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.160
 Cut a little 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:51.110
 Together 

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:46.430
 Part entering 

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.430
 Both waves 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.169
 Then of the part that will be there 

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.560
 Movable light 

00:07:56.169 --> 00:08:01.840
 I have painted 

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.840
 This is a is also okay with the family at home
