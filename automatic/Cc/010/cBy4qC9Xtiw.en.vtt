00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.460
 I'm going to teach how to be an otaku kawaii 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.800
 are very simple steps to do so 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.740
 Do not lose your attention and have fun 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.600
 I feel ridiculous first step if you have 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.310
 any account in any social network and 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.779
 be facebook or twitter you have to 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.730
 change the name with the last name of 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.530
 a favorite anime character I 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.620
 I think but my real name is Hyacinth 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.929
 your real name is hyacinth there is no 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.609
 problem to do kawaii first you go to 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:43.549
 put the first three letters of your 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:45.620
 name in this case hack and you will go 

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:47.449
 complete with some small vehicle 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.609
 Japanese or some animal like 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.409
 originated some things like that the 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.199
 next step and this is very essential 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.179
 you have to learn very basic Japanese 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.760
 when it says the basic you mean 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:01.369
 non- webon phrases you just have to learn 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.040
 basic words like sayonara yander is 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:05.360
 a right origin such kawaii neko and 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.300

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.220
 I can be kawaii not now you have to 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.840
 write between asterisks every thing that 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.840
 you do as for example 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.330

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.220

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.700
 essential enough all your fucking life 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.990
 watching animes and running out of friends and 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.460
 alone to the connections where are you going to 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.659
 find fat guys like you changos 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.040
 disguised and women who nothing else 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.479
 they want to look like you think it's enough 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.680

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.450
 online girlfriend with which you can 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.430
 play role-playing games and write every mom 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.540
 between asterisks and scripts but that 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.340
 it's not everything you also have to 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.600
 learn for each offensive drawing that 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.310
 pulse to the best that a fucking drawing 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.950
 time is more than your own life if 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.140
