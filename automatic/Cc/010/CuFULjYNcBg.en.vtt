00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.119
 hello everyone in this stéphane egéa and the teachers of the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.539
 network with their dogs so we saw last time what 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.779
 is she the four right-handed tightens and a left-handed how the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.169
 work at the base 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.759
 now let's see what we can do with this Sunday by 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.940
 example by driving an accent we will accent the cushions plane 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.370
 what seems to be the most logical for whites 1 the simple one to 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.699
 do not mean that we can not accentuate the price the emphasis on 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:41.760
 streams 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.920
 bernard it sounds more complicated is less natural a priori and the fact that 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.920
 we have four plates can not shifted as we want 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.730
 we can circumvent this difficulty of 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.720
 secondly 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.510
 in the third twenty 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.190
 Enjoy your meal 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.860
 now let's see how we can transform the accentuation man who 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.230
 paseo mainly on the snare drum 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.310
 while on others are spoken like for example 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.890
 all the moussa symbols aballa the shelled to this earth so we 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.390
 let's develop several types of exercise 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.890
 which will allow you to use this one its colors on your battery the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.590
 integrate into your camp 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.529
 so the first exercise not concerned 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:14.739
 the accentuation on all the simple tastes in the bar-tobacco while waiting 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:15.589
 that time 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:19.239
 and then we'll see how we can go down melodically you go back 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.759
 before the descent of the treble to the grave is raised from low to high for example 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.150
 to see how we can build 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.849
 sometimes it's more playful 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.849
 so let's go 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:50.749
 this is the same with the other branches it just misses the second for 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:53.749
 laugh 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:07.499
 braun swamp so now that we made the accents October 6 we're going 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.939
 choose to put the right hand for example on the club at this avalanche 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.959
 on tobacco back 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.959
 foreground 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:28.749
 now we can choose once you have laid the stage or there as 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:31.439
 that of course we can choose 2 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.209
 choose a melodic side for example by methodically lowering ap 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:37.429
 philippe 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:40.819
 north nor by a problem or white clay mls for the hour away 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:02.009
 replacing bach so to say the shift the emphasis on two tables 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.829
 different 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.889
 as just now his fight kept the same meaning for example of 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:06.949
 gasoline 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.949
 the atmosphere the center 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.579
 for example with the first job 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:25.699
 now we will go back for example with the second steering wheel 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.210
 and finally for fun mix a little bit the combinations you 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.370
 already know 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.550
 For example 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.090
 improvising we will try to find a skate by mixing the 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.400
 accents 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.840
 the centers 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.840
 and for fingerings 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.600
 so here's for the focus exercises so do not forget started slowly 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.289
 everything was going to progressively do it faster and then to look for 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.080
 patterns of accentuation on pattern passlines 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.870
 accentuation of your own remember also that you can 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.949
 mix the different colors 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:31.659
 so in order to find the combinations that suit you that are suitable for 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.599
 the music to accompany you 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.629
 here's next week work well
