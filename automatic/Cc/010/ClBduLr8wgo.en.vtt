00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.199
 so 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.360
 hello to all today we will present you a fishing situation a 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.710
 unusual because it is a question of going fishing relative to antenna 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:12.619
 about meters 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.989
 and on a substrate after a collection of about a good twenty 

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:17.460
 base centimeters 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.099
 to these words in which traditional montages in France so we try 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.929
 to find adobe solutions falls to editing we want to show his retirement 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:25.970
 more in detail 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.970
 the complexification when we can on the muddy bottom 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.710
 with about twenty centimeters of very moving substrates and that we do not 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.699
 drink long distance fishing when you often want to fish 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:36.570
 distance 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.570
 we are tempted to justify using a little magic 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.360
 or in australia how are we going to show you 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.420
 and for his mutism standard mount with a 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.930
 rather classic glass stapling 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.590
 throwing and impact 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.620
 the plane will fall back into the substrate 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.950
 this creates a year the king end up with them 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.010
 the line that has exceeded by 10% just a centimeter that will be laid a 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.970
 little 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.650
 a bit no matter how it was not very very lucky present 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.740
 not very well 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.560
 so because we're good here it's a variation of the chancellor the chanvrier time 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.680
 the base made to fight against the ied 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.850
 the allies at the front but here it's a little the same principle except that his voice 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.430
 for you 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.560
 a golden kid 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.070
 I was simply taken away 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.729
 the links of the end we put a little bit eclipsed to hang a plan 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:20.580
 Baucus 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.180
 there we take a picture of its classic standards 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.540
 here is the penguin that is going on all that 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.910
 on the permit to spill a little damaged with the same meeting on 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.370
 the action he expresses 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.370
 the relatively short line we made with the monster in paris 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.240
 the new rebounding we're claiming very rigid 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.210
 of how many 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.210
 in snowman balanced mounting a course very important for this 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.550
 spot gently 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.850
 and very short to avoid all in German 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.340
 throwing 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.580
 so we put our survival on the roof of their classics 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.680
 the future 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.110
 helsinki reminder the helicopter assembly 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.620
 a little pearl 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.050
 Above 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.420
 who will serve us 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.490
 to actually adjust to the height at which the web of power 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.440
 traced back 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.580
 this is the 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.619
 but on the first a certain that this topic of the candidate 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.869
 so we have a montage 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.549
 classic helicopter mount 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.959
 so it seems to me absolutely not it can launch very very far 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.059
 whoever the plan needs to touch the impact 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:20.509
 he will come to build 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.349
 m two co-princes depth 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.799
 on the other hand we do not kids back from here 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.599
 it will always be well presented 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.599
 he will ask himself a bit of quotation 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:33.869
 with the classic snowman so here is editing that will be very very 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:36.519
 hot and very efficient to fish on a substrate mounts 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.629
 slender 1,100 meters and more 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.659
 if we need it 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.839
 5 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:45.839
 even for 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.529
 no 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:09.809
