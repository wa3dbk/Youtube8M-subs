perspective<00:01:56.689> I<00:01:57.229> think<00:01:57.649> it's<00:01:57.770> far<00:01:57.979> more<00:01:58.009> the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
perspective I think it's far more the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.429 
perspective I think it's far more the
fact<00:01:58.460> that<00:01:58.609> I<00:01:58.640> was<00:01:58.939> I<00:01:59.180> was<00:01:59.570> closest<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.259> guy

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
fact that I was I was closest to the guy

fact that I was I was closest to the guy
who<00:02:01.100> unfortunately<00:02:01.430> was<00:02:01.789> was<00:02:02.509> hit<00:02:02.780> and

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
therefore reacted as I'm sure any other

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.779 
therefore reacted as I'm sure any other
