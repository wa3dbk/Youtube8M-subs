00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 after 3 matches to get over that kind 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.410
 things to talk so just way too 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.310
 asked 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.379
 we also have seven games here 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.550
 played then that is completely still 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.950
 not important 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.110
 watch your chili and if you like it while he 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.730
 within the holy conquer and arena 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.190
 then you can still speak 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.930
 championship finish two six or seven 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.580
 times 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.010
 yes it is still 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.010
 recovery from season then still very long 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.960
 pp done with assembly not preferably 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.399

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.440
 just stay with our objective you 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.760
 so any you don't say why not 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.440
 we have nothing to do with me 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.640
 I want to mean everything that goes 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.239
 not for you you do not determine what I am going to do 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.610

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.989

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.210

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.789
 Don't own even more business upstairs 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.570
 say because steps take over the caboort 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.860
 it 's just that good 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.860
 nice shot a bit hotter 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.420

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.000
 boys his purpose for them 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.229
 view good match after match at 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.390
 the constitution already states the competition 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.390
 I slowly steal 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.710
 collapses the new leader in the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.300
 premier league by it 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.410
 507 on FC Groningen like this 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.790
 anyway you can to not gemert 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.500
 more if everyone around you as well wind 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.670
 on and what 's really wondering what the by the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.950
 world of it and yes that's all 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.420
 great that they hope the nonsense stories 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.450
 not want busy and we stay began 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.800
 both legs are on the floor to the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.590
 look at those rankings that goes to us 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.430
 we have to watch all game as 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.470
 we totally got to the fridge 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.330
 yes us to us it was not an option 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.590
 So yes perhaps some benefit 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.690
 this competition that you also silent 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.820
 the subtitle that took Jan not in the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.110
 mouth but certainly not here in 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.220
 yes I think we now have the title 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.220
 need to talk what do you think yourself 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.820

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.020

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.520

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.080
 yes from me it can be back again 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.340
 different problem you may have 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.390
 keep calling if you already make during 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.890
 The interview said you got the title 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.190
 being a candidate or not I don't remember 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.290

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.360
