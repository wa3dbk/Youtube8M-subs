 for you to earn real money with 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.189
 your youtube channel in case you have one 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.220
 youtube channel there is not there 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.590
 getting enough followers 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.060
 subscribers and their views do not 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.970
 more than 500 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.590
 the advice now you stay connected 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.649
 in this video because here you go 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.110
 learn the three fundamental tips with 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.500
 the youtube channel really grows 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.329
 The first tip is a logo 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.920
 differentiate between different names and 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.920
 background on the channel 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.379
 if you follow these three steps of 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.079
 first tip ie is ahead of 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.199
 many channels because you can see by 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.770
 there are many channels in the background with names 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.500
 very difficult to memorize and even 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.890
 same logo with kids that ends 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.100
 eliminating the channel from some 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.140
 google and even making it difficult 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.720
 sometimes the channel may have a 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.119
 very interesting content and the user 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.600
 does not remember the channel name channel 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.689
 The second tip is to create social networks 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.970
 and the social networks indicated for you 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.000
 what you want when you start a channel on 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.290
 youtube or have a channel on youtube is 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.990
 twitter facebook and twitter on twitter you 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.290
 will be able to publicize his work in 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.229
 facebook you will promote promotions 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.180
 How do I promote it if you go there on my own? 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.970
 facebook link page is on 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.659
 description you will find that all 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.549
 week I publish a background 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.979
 customized for game channels 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.439
 if you do not have a background or a 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.079
 intro I advise you to access my 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.149
 channel and you will be receiving all 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.159
 week 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.950
 during a week each week a theme 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.000
 and you will be getting a 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.099
 notification that a new 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.140
 background on facebook 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.830
 Now the blog I 'm going to have 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.350
 blog to post the news do not need 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.069
 necessarily be the news of your 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.410
 channel 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.830
 You can if you have a game channel . 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.280
 for example of which two only speaks of 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.290
 What are you interesting about? 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.950
 talking is news for example next 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.520
 four daycare centers will be free 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.209
 something like that is betting and putting 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.030
 sometimes until the link of the video the review of 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.760
 which x click here to see the video it 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.670
 directs the blog to function as a 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.459
 blog driver for youtube that 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.690
 you are also relating to the 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.720
 your users on the channel after 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.269
 invest in these three tools that are 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.950
 the social networks we will invest a little 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.130
 real money 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.530
 if you really want to promote your 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.320
 channel I advise investing in 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.510
 google search tools 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.269
 Nothing is more than the sky is nobody's 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.769
 time leaving the search tools 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:25.380
 like google and yahoo is no one when 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.380
 you type an after effects tutorial 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.750
 will appear first in the 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.700
 you search for your youtube channel 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.549
 It is also interesting that it will increase 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.910
 quite the search level on your channel 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:42.750
 The Third Tip Monetize Your Videos 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.930
 then join his decency and 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.930
 then go into a network and 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.209
 earn real money because 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.510
 many people think that the moment they 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.150
 she is daughter to decency to monetize 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.670
 Your Videos State Engineer Wrong 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.430
 when you monetize your videos you 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.980
 is not making money starts to 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.590
 earn money even as you were referring 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.410
 to a teenage years but to join 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.380
 you have to be accepted and to be 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.640
 I accept you have to produce content 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:20.640
 of 100 copyrights in quotation marks 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.520
 self-created content 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.099
 following these steps there yes you 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.850
 get into a network more 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.100
 remembering 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.000
 a network is not as simple as that 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.560
 log in 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.050
 first you have to fill out the 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.840
 form and then wait for the 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:40.110
 to be accepted or not 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.120
 so if you followed these three steps 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.050
 the board also wait a little 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:51.270
 until you reach a minimum level of 300 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:54.300
 subscribers or about 200 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.750
 or it is reaching up to 50 thousand 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.990
 views over a period of 45 days 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.860
 or even in a period of four 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.630
 months 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.530
 because then you will have to have a 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:10.560
 average daily reading of 500 to 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.650
 600 views per day 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.920
 then your level your chances of being 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.420
 made by a network will be much more 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.510
