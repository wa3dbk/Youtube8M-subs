00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.160
 ah 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello friends this time let's see 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.540
 the technique of quilting or world 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.450
 This technique is mainly used 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.670
 for two reasons to avoid 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.609
 proliferation of weeds in 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.150
 our banking terracing culture 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.110
 are going to be the ones that compete with our 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.090
 culture 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.120
 in regard to humidity and 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.140
 nutrients that is to say it makes your 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:34.720
 development the development of the crop and 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.610
 also another other fundamental factor u 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.000
 fundamental objective of this technique of 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.580
 padding is to keep the humidity of the 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.420
 soil prevent evaporation that 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.700
 moisture is lost and therefore stop 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.370
 be taken advantage of by our crop 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.770
 he is very boy padded can you 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.590
 perform with several with different 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.810
 materials on this occasion what are you 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.020
 watching is with straw 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.850
 I myself removed from weeds 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.450
 I have in me 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:11.930
 in my land and took it as I go 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:15.950
 to make the quilting of the garden 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.940
 otherwise they are well known 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.430
 sure that if you come to mind 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.260
 report that you have seen or some 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.979
 news regarding the strawberry of huelva 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.070
 for example there you see the forehead on 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.420
 black plastic black plastic too 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.430
 It is one of the most used materials 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.100
 to access the mattress also plastic 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.009
 white although it has its drawbacks 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.860
 and you could also use bark 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.229
 pine for example many materials 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.680
 this time as he said I do it with 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.990
 low and so I take advantage of a by-product that 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.979
 otherwise I would have to burn or 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.930
 eliminate and that are the weeds of 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.080
 my plot 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.080
 you can see 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.189
 I do not know if it will come out 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.210
 if I lift the straw 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.299
 you see the difference between dry land 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.200
 and in addition to the humidity that this 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:29.510
 land that has not yet been irrigated is not 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.450
 have put the foundations close in a 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.150
 occasion 10 days ago has not yet 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.299
 lost soil moisture 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.799
 and also has a temperature that does not 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.629
 has nothing to do with this land that 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.900
 is hot right now because of the heat 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:48.200
 what it does and is cool and with a lot of 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.549
 humidity that will come perfect to our 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.500
 cultivation in this case of onions that 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.820
 we have here 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.820
 to develop 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.680
 and basically in the town that consists 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.240
 the technique of quilting or much 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.840
 you can also find in some book 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.760
 of Nadal 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.760
 good friends until still
