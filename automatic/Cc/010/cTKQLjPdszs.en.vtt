00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
analogous goals is a little bit

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.169 
analogous goals is a little bit
different<00:00:09.990> than<00:00:10.139> your<00:00:10.320> typical<00:00:10.469> MMO<00:00:11.179> let's

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
different than your typical MMO let's

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.209 
different than your typical MMO let's
use<00:00:12.389> world<00:00:12.630> Warcraft<00:00:13.139> for<00:00:13.320> example<00:00:13.740> where<00:00:13.920> it

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
use world Warcraft for example where it

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.730

I<00:04:37.970> can<00:04:38.330> understand<00:04:38.750> where<00:04:39.050> they're<00:04:39.199> coming

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:39.379 
I can understand where they're coming

I can understand where they're coming
from<00:04:39.500> I<00:04:39.740> mean<00:04:39.770> it<00:04:40.039> does<00:04:40.220> make<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.580> little<00:04:40.789> bit<00:04:41.030> of

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
from I mean it does make a little bit of

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.140 
from I mean it does make a little bit of
sense<00:04:42.280> but<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.370> also<00:04:43.490> got<00:04:43.699> to<00:04:43.789> think<00:04:43.819> about

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
sense but you also got to think about

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.100 
sense but you also got to think about
well<00:04:44.590> what's<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.860> fairest<00:04:46.310> option<00:04:46.759> I<00:04:47.110> think

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
well what's the fairest option I think

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.899 
well what's the fairest option I think
the<00:04:48.259> fairest<00:04:48.560> option<00:04:48.979> is<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.430> Elder<00:04:49.669> Scroll

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909 
the fairest option is the Elder Scroll

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:53.050 
the fairest option is the Elder Scroll
system<00:04:50.440> so<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.740> way<00:04:51.830> it<00:04:51.979> works<00:04:52.159> in<00:04:52.340> a<00:04:52.430> raid<00:04:52.699> is

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.430

is a random item that can be completely

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.520 
is a random item that can be completely
crap<00:05:15.620> for<00:05:15.919> you<00:05:16.069> but<00:05:16.940> that<00:05:17.599> also<00:05:18.080> means<00:05:18.440> that

someone else got completely crap but

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.200 
someone else got completely crap but
it's<00:05:20.690> good<00:05:20.870> for<00:05:21.080> you<00:05:21.370> so<00:05:22.370> they're<00:05:22.669> taking<00:05:22.789> the

it you had the option of hopefully
getting<00:05:41.840> it<00:05:42.110> it<00:05:42.830> was<00:05:43.009> never<00:05:43.190> really<00:05:43.460> in<00:05:43.699> your

getting it it was never really in your

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:45.070 
getting it it was never really in your
hands<00:05:44.090> if<00:05:44.270> you<00:05:44.360> were<00:05:44.479> gonna<00:05:44.630> get<00:05:44.810> it<00:05:44.870> unless

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
hands if you were gonna get it unless

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.839 
hands if you were gonna get it unless
you<00:05:45.229> were<00:05:45.349> the<00:05:45.440> master<00:05:45.800> looter<00:05:46.069> and<00:05:46.550> your

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 
you were the master looter and your

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:48.519 
you were the master looter and your
ninja<00:05:47.120> then<00:05:47.389> you're<00:05:47.539> guaranteed<00:05:48.080> to<00:05:48.110> get<00:05:48.409> it

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:48.529 
ninja then you're guaranteed to get it

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:53.339 
ninja then you're guaranteed to get it
and<00:05:48.740> guaranteed<00:05:49.729> to<00:05:49.880> ruin<00:05:50.120> your<00:05:50.240> reputation

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.320 

but<00:05:54.349> I<00:05:54.380> think<00:05:54.680> the<00:05:54.919> tying<00:05:55.340> in<00:05:55.759> the<00:05:55.789> finesse

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
but I think the tying in the finesse

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.999 
but I think the tying in the finesse
system<00:05:56.750> and<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:56.930> soft<00:05:57.139> synergy<00:05:57.560> I<00:05:57.590> think<00:05:57.889> is

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
system and the soft synergy I think is

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.159 
system and the soft synergy I think is
probably<00:05:58.219> one<00:05:58.340> of<00:05:58.460> the<00:05:58.610> best<00:05:58.789> mechanics<00:05:59.389> that

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
probably one of the best mechanics that

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.110 
probably one of the best mechanics that
they<00:06:00.289> can<00:06:00.469> do<00:06:00.620> with<00:06:00.800> the<00:06:00.919> loot<00:06:01.069> system<00:06:01.120> it

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
they can do with the loot system it

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.120 
they can do with the loot system it
promotes<00:06:02.479> people<00:06:02.870> playing<00:06:03.800> socially<00:06:04.789> and

things on fire

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.080 
things on fire
but<00:06:54.620> I<00:06:54.650> also<00:06:54.830> get<00:06:55.040> loot<00:06:55.250> for<00:06:55.610> lighting<00:06:55.760> things
