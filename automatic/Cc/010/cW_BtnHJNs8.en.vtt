00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.730
 yes what should I say yes in the picture 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:13.049
 seen 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:15.809
 I have bock people but I have to 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.080
 confess that I would have them and 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.670
 maybe not at all know 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.689
 i was that figure of appearance team 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.400
 not cool and she has me too 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.810
 intrigued on skis and black 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:36.690
 that's why I have now for the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.700
 second april I have nothing for me 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.809
 the new three dsv sets as it does 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.809
 preorder Amazon 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:52.410
 but it is said yes remains chronicle 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.059
 Sex is a remake of the wii play 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.440
 what I never played what theirs 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:04.190
 but only release exclusively on the new 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.190
 Do not play 3ds like this even at 1pm 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 and the animo figure also turns in 3d 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.840
 play any things free me 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.799
 believe in vienna which pictures i believe 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.009
 I would like to rattle I do not know 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.630
 but exactly it unlocks but that 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.520
 what you can unlock first you too 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.640
 times you play the character you need 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.899
 not to get everything in the game 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.810
 at least not so read if I 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.070
 I'm mistaken then to be fit and the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.229
 you can write the comments 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.649
 to correct me I have nothing 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:52.789
 against so I must confess that I 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:57.929
 also on my super twelve languages 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:59.459
 is played is not even but for 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.020
 he is lucky 0 1 and I think so 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.429
 will win the first fight but me 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.939
 Fiebere looks damned good 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.020
 really cool did the act but 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.729
 The figure looks damn good 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.019
 So everyone who is interested in it 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.090
 Do not buy the character she damn 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:16.560
 good off link to the game for the us and 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.060
 but I did not pack it 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.850
 Amazon does not exist at the moment 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.130
 by totally rare and first line 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.480
 but also keep the eyes open, we 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.380
 are determined and how to find 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.940
 someday he will somehow too 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.069
 should actually be buying 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.299
 I was lucky that was still 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:39.480
 once buy do not buy taken yes 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.420
 I would put it on games under 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.069
 federal Minister of 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:50.910
 yes there we are already and we ask 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:54.709
 Schalk times just on it yes I would like the 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.709
 owns the mischief 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:04.010
 and I have to confess I am not 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:09.450
 sensible pointed hammer collapsed 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:12.170
 That's why I 'm going to take this over without it 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.170
 costume times 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.579
 playboy 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:35.439
 nothing is really nothing to me 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.439
 and that just came to me 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.069
 to read that camera like it really does 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.379
 nothing came to mind and I know that 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.459
 do not play then I will stay 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.040
 I am ashamed a bit for that but what 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.470
 will change at the beginning of april then have 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.780
 me yes for new 3ds 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:58.510
 So we have nice techniques monado 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.430
 I read that is that 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.180
 sword means that's hard or 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.180
 not read correctly though 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.900
 I'm assuming the long-term have nothing 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.850
 at the other and there we have 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.850
 not good 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:38.200
 then I'll try my luck in the 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:41.710
 fight maybe two times I have 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.620
 only a short time with Schalke plays otherwise 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:49.110
 not at all 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:55.930
 I have all set on a few 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:59.080
 innocence we shut up the chopsticks like that and 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:03.550
 I've set another three lives 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.680
 all items on some because I'm on 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.090
 wilders learns so if I have one 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.270
 aufhebeln which is also items 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.490
 to lift and throw and use 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.710
 at least learning is faster then 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.710
 we have already very noblesse level 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:30.619
 so I think I will win 

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:32.869
 At least now embarrassing if not me 

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:35.379
 do I not serial we 

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:35.379
 are too much for me 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:49.819
 I have no idea what it brings but 

00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:53.179
 I know it was great I did not have it 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:55.389
 I completely overlooked what to do 

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:55.389
 hell 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:10.339
 how are you now on it I realize 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:17.739
 So first opponents very sport on one 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:26.469
 You can only start series with jobs 

00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:26.469
 I feel a little bit sorry for what 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:30.369
 Come on 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.540
 kill like that 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.560
 bull 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.060
 Okay , I killed you now 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:09.440
 and think it was my god he is 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.490
 his coat or this capsule 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.390
 bring this simple kassel to her 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:21.810
 I'm just sorry for my body 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:24.900
 okay what a level is good 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.070
 yes the amigos are not clear 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.540
 challenge but I am now 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.640
 show more uses 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.140
 so I hope now I liked it 

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.230
 and I hold the rhine to the next 

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.230
 times
