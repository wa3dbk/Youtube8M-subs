00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hi to all in this video i'm going 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.540
 introduce you to the folding knife of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.670
 chebel grids i will firstly go 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.500
 give its different characteristics 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.389
 these negative and positive points 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.059
 then I will eventually realize some 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.830
 cutting tests 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.250
 the knife with the blade unfold measure 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.820
 21 26 cm and when folded it makes 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.550
 12 points 4 cm the knife ps 122 grams 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.320
 without a case and 150 g with it is so 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.649
 relatively light for a knife to 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.200
 multiple uses now let's talk about 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.710
 the case is light about 30 g 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.420
 Moisture-proof nylon effect 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.190
 can the task and stature so 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.350
 horizontal and vertical 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.360
 however a negative point of the task 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.040
 and that you need a really fine stature 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.200
 so that she can go inside 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.490
 so all military belts 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.310
 will not be compatible with this 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.930
 study that said the knife that has very 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.190
 well in his wallet and I even 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.079
 sometimes hard to get him out 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.140
 so I guarantee you that it does not risk 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.850
 not to fall at random 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.229
 let's talk about the sleeve now it's done 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.780
 from plastic and rubber 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.780
 to maximize comfort and reduce 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.520
 maximum sliding the knife 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.530
 has of course a security system 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.649
 that I find very ingenious 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.999
 and that I have never seen anywhere else for 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.700
 fold the blade you have to press the 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:23.170
 bar at the back of the knife I find 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.179
 personally that the handle is the 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.909
 best asset of the knife they argue 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.139
 comfortable resistant onomic and that's 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.100
 true that he never slid his hands 

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:34.530
 same under heavy rain 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.689
 the handle also has 3 straps 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.009
 we only realized for the thong 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.990
 is explained in another of my 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.820
 videos where I will put the link in the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.970
 description as usual if you 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.360
 are interested now let's talk about the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.780
 blade 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.630
 it measures 9 1 cm and is made of steel 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.670
 stainless half of the blade is in 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.310
 sawtooth and the other half is a 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.810
 fixed line 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.280
 I do not particularly like this design 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.990
 when it comes to an expensive left 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.319
 kraft that can not be made 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.690
 precise cuts with saw teeth 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.269
 but the design half in half the soul 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.440
 is very appropriate and effective 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.690
 when it comes to a survival knife 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.489
 because it is effective to cut 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.630
 strings and performs more actions 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.549
 violent as the boat swims 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.959
 so let's start the test series so 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.100
 you could see the knife did not have 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.410
 hard to cut the rope 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.390
 you can now see that it's 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.400
 hard to get a precise cut and 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.250
 regular because the length of the blade 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.690
 fine is weak though 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.690
 be low she is beautiful church is 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.190
 question now the real abilities 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.590
 many early it is sold as being a 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.269
 knife survives sturdy so I'm going 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.269
 sticks and see if he resists shock 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.470
 when you can see the test the 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.180
 baton is positive now let's see 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.910
 if the knife is able to cut 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.650
 little wood to prepare tinder so 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.980
 can start in case of fire 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.980
 need 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.739
 the design of the half sawtooth 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.090
 half flynn is really effective because 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.579
 it allows to perform tasks 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.620
 violent as the boat swims as well 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.359
 that more meticulous tasks like 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.359
 prepare small wood and tinder 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.200
 before you forget you can find this 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.240
 knife on many websites 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:36.020
 and in many shops to 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:37.280
 around 40 euros to conclude I 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.290
 find that the foldable knife bear 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.510
 grylls is a really knife report 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.950
 quality price 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.940
 I especially like the handle and the 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.980
 blade design 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.320
 but on the other hand I was disappointed by the 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.360
 robustness of the knife which after a 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.430
 intensive use week 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.620
 I noticed that the blade was no longer 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.450
 very well attached to the problem sleeves 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.610
 we find very frequently in 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.620
 folding knife 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.540
 I recommend this knife to people 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.580
 who wish to possess to solid kout 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.990
 but light and easy to carry 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.100
 thank you for watching the video and 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.180
 Do not hesitate to comment 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.180
 if you have questions
