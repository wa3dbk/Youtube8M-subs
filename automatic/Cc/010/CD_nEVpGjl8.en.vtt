actually<00:01:24.750> that's<00:01:25.710> another<00:01:26.010> whopper<00:01:26.370> I<00:01:26.730> just

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
actually that's another whopper I just

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.300 
actually that's another whopper I just
think<00:01:27.870> it's<00:01:28.020> fabulous

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
think it's fabulous

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.280 
think it's fabulous
I<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:30.330> thought<00:01:30.480> it<00:01:30.630> was<00:01:30.720> really<00:01:30.900> kind<00:01:31.230> of

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
I just thought it was really kind of

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.920 
I just thought it was really kind of
cool<00:01:31.800> it<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:33.770> has<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.070> appeal<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.550> my<00:01:36.360> senses

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
cool it just has to appeal to my senses

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.030 
cool it just has to appeal to my senses
I<00:01:37.110> guess<00:01:40.880> this<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.090> Carl<00:01:42.390> Andre<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.260> you<00:01:43.830> can

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
I guess this is Carl Andre and you can

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.130 
I guess this is Carl Andre and you can
walk<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.580> everyone<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.270> afraid<00:01:45.510> to<00:01:45.720> walk<00:01:45.870> on

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
walk on it everyone is afraid to walk on

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.110 
walk on it everyone is afraid to walk on
it<00:01:46.260> because<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:46.890> an<00:01:47.010> art<00:01:47.160> piece<00:01:47.400> but<00:01:47.880> that's

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
it because it's an art piece but that's

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.760 
it because it's an art piece but that's
his<00:01:48.480> intention<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:50.120> really<00:01:51.530> love<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
his intention I really love the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.030 
his intention I really love the
simplicity<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.900> neat<00:01:55.680> and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
simplicity of it it's just neat and

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.220 
simplicity of it it's just neat and
organized<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.000> I'm<00:01:57.240> miss<00:01:57.480> efficient<00:01:58.050> and

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
organized and I'm miss efficient and

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.370 
organized and I'm miss efficient and
organized<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.550> appeals<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.120> me<00:02:00.330> but<00:02:01.200> then

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
organized so that appeals to me but then

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.800 
organized so that appeals to me but then
we<00:02:01.590> look<00:02:01.800> at<00:02:02.040> Marc<00:02:02.790> Bradford's

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
we look at Marc Bradford's

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:12.230 
we look at Marc Bradford's
soccer<00:02:04.590> balls<00:02:05.390> from<00:02:06.710> 2004<00:02:10.550> are<00:02:11.550> they<00:02:11.760> neat<00:02:12.000> and

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
soccer balls from 2004 are they neat and

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.100 
soccer balls from 2004 are they neat and
organized<00:02:12.780> No<00:02:13.490> so<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.850> am<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.270> contradiction

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
organized No so I am a contradiction

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.130 
organized No so I am a contradiction
with<00:02:16.709> my<00:02:16.920> art<00:02:17.310> collecting<00:02:17.850> what<00:02:18.720> he's<00:02:18.870> done

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
with my art collecting what he's done

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.260 
with my art collecting what he's done
here<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:20.000> out<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.360> norm<00:02:21.630> for<00:02:21.959> his<00:02:22.410> work

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
here is out of the norm for his work

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.120 
here is out of the norm for his work
essentially<00:02:24.270> he<00:02:24.420> paints<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.680> think<00:02:25.950> that's

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
essentially he paints and I think that's

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.920 
essentially he paints and I think that's
why<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.400> appealed<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.120> me<00:02:27.330> because<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.900> was

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
why this appealed to me because it was

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.510 
why this appealed to me because it was
out<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.560> his<00:02:29.000> mainstream<00:02:31.010> behind<00:02:32.010> me<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.489> a

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
out of his mainstream behind me is a

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.110 
out of his mainstream behind me is a
