00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
so I just kind of looped that through

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.100 
so I just kind of looped that through
like<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> slipknot<00:01:11.970> through<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.570> then<00:01:12.630> i<00:01:12.689> will

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
like a slipknot through and then i will

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.950 
like a slipknot through and then i will
take<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.790> claw<00:01:14.790> clip<00:01:15.060> or<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.240> lobster<00:01:15.750> clip

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960
