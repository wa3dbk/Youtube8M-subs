00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.420 
hi this is just a quick video about

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.940 
hi this is just a quick video about
using<00:00:07.930> the<00:00:08.050> Ultimaker

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:08.950 
using the Ultimaker

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.879 
using the Ultimaker
classic<00:00:09.400> with<00:00:09.639> a<00:00:09.670> glass<00:00:10.150> build<00:00:10.570> plate<00:00:10.889> you'll

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889 
classic with a glass build plate you'll

classic with a glass build plate you'll
see<00:00:12.010> from<00:00:12.190> the<00:00:12.250> video<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:13.809> the<00:00:14.019> information

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139

below<00:00:14.469> the<00:00:15.280> Peter<00:00:15.550> introduced<00:00:16.259> me<00:00:17.259> to<00:00:17.290> using

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
below the Peter introduced me to using

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.880 
below the Peter introduced me to using
glass<00:00:18.310> build<00:00:18.610> plate<00:00:18.849> just<00:00:19.720> with<00:00:19.930> PVA<00:00:20.470> so

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
glass build plate just with PVA so

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.749 
glass build plate just with PVA so
that's<00:00:21.070> a<00:00:21.220> water-based<00:00:21.759> glue<00:00:23.220> diluted<00:00:24.220> down

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
that's a water-based glue diluted down

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.159 
that's a water-based glue diluted down
paint<00:00:25.149> it<00:00:25.329> onto<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:25.750> plate<00:00:26.560> to<00:00:26.739> the<00:00:26.860> drive<00:00:27.130> I

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
paint it onto the plate to the drive I

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.560 
paint it onto the plate to the drive I
put<00:00:29.169> this<00:00:29.259> on<00:00:29.410> my<00:00:29.489> standard<00:00:30.489> build<00:00:30.640> plate<00:00:30.820> on

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
put this on my standard build plate on

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.740 
put this on my standard build plate on
the<00:00:31.720> off<00:00:31.809> America<00:00:32.259> I<00:00:33.329> just<00:00:34.329> hold<00:00:34.420> it<00:00:34.540> on<00:00:34.600> with

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
the off America I just hold it on with

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.200 
the off America I just hold it on with
some<00:00:34.899> clips<00:00:35.140> and<00:00:35.440> then<00:00:36.130> I<00:00:36.219> fill<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.610> end

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
some clips and then I fill the end

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.230 
some clips and then I fill the end
switch<00:00:37.540> with<00:00:37.990> just<00:00:38.320> a<00:00:38.410> little<00:00:38.970> unit<00:00:39.970> like<00:00:40.090> that

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.240 
switch with just a little unit like that

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.000 
switch with just a little unit like that
that's<00:00:40.480> exactly<00:00:40.900> the<00:00:41.110> thickness<00:00:41.830> of<00:00:41.950> the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
that's exactly the thickness of the

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.980 
that's exactly the thickness of the
glass<00:00:42.100> so<00:00:42.490> there's<00:00:42.760> no<00:00:42.850> need<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.060> to

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
glass so there's no need to to

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.320 
glass so there's no need to to
recalibrate<00:00:44.310> so<00:00:45.310> the<00:00:45.430> glass<00:00:45.580> build<00:00:45.940> plate<00:00:46.150> is

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
recalibrate so the glass build plate is

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:53.040 
recalibrate so the glass build plate is
just<00:00:47.520> fitted<00:00:48.520> on<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:51.160> put<00:00:51.310> two<00:00:51.490> clips<00:00:52.050> one

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
just fitted on I just put two clips one

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.700 
just fitted on I just put two clips one
clip<00:00:53.350> on<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.590> right<00:00:54.450> and<00:00:55.450> one<00:00:55.630> clip<00:00:55.900> on<00:00:56.170> the

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
clip on the right and one clip on the

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.610 
clip on the right and one clip on the
front<00:00:56.980> just<00:00:57.970> in<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:58.780> position<00:00:59.020> so<00:00:59.350> that<00:00:59.380> they

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
front just in a position so that they

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.139 
front just in a position so that they
don't<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:01.510> in<00:01:01.630> the<00:01:01.660> way<00:01:01.840> of<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:03.149> traveling

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
don't get in the way of the traveling

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:10.980 
don't get in the way of the traveling
head<00:01:04.329> and<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:06.280> the

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.380 

the<00:01:11.530> limit<00:01:11.800> switch<00:01:12.660> device<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:15.880> pops<00:01:16.150> onto

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
the limit switch device just pops onto

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.820 
the limit switch device just pops onto
the<00:01:16.660> back<00:01:16.990> of<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.170> alternator<00:01:17.410> where<00:01:17.770> the

limit switches and that means that it

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.730 
limit switches and that means that it
exactly<00:01:22.030> replicates<00:01:22.480> the<00:01:22.630> 3<00:01:22.870> mil<00:01:23.050> depth<00:01:23.590> of
