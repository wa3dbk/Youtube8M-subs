hydro-mechanical automatic transmission

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.900

an<00:00:54.530> automatic<00:00:55.530> transmission<00:00:55.920> or<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.460> can

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
an automatic transmission or you can

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.250 
an automatic transmission or you can
switch<00:00:56.969> into<00:00:57.210> what<00:00:57.420> they're<00:00:57.539> calling<00:00:57.719> manual

which<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.440> really<00:00:58.770> semi-automatic<00:00:59.670> what<00:01:00.629> that

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
which is really semi-automatic what that

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.660 
which is really semi-automatic what that
means<00:01:00.930> from<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> user<00:01:01.530> perspective<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.489> that

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
means from the user perspective is that

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.950 
means from the user perspective is that
