00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello it's me again mira and we 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.870
 make today super delicious and rainbow 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.090
 cupcakes with rainbow frosting goes 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.110
 relatively fast and relatively easy and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.130
 say catch 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.480
 First we take the flour and 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.930
 mix this with the times 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:28.380
 baking powder and contracts are then 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.929
 Let's take the butter and the sugar 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.280
 and mix the two in the big one 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.690
 bowl and then we beat the whole 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.899
 look at me for about three to five 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.899
 minutes 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.860
 if you lure that then you do and after 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.879
 after the eggs in and not 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.879
 stop stirring 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.850
 if you have that then you take it 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.890
 your mail mix and the milk and me 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:09.580
 dissolve again that vanilla extract in the 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:11.590
 milk on now we always give 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.360
 alternately half of him mail and 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.410
 a little milk again half of e-mail 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.410
 and some milk pure 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.409
 so the tank is ready and now it starts 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.960
 the right fun now we do not share 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.719
 the dough also cater to 134 56 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.549
 different bowls will be less too 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.240
 Take as you want with it all 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.920
 fair is i always go around 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.110
 and give each cup a blob and 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.020
 then I do the whole thing so often is the 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.780
 day everything so the day is ready 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.289
 split and now begins the funny 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.469
 part 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.060
 Now we start with the colors 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:04.509
 I have decided I take here 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:10.759
 yellow orange orange red and yellow mixed 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:13.640
 red blue purple mixed off and blue and 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.560
 green yes not quite that 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.019
 rainbow colors it does not matter to me now 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.019
 Of course you can do it very strictly 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.409
 yes the come are ready so 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.969
 a little bit different than you 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.489
 but have presented that is fine 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.480
 so examples as well as two out and now 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.319
 they come into the ramekins 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.730
 I always do that for a night 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.730
 and every color a blob 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.750
 so when baking the colors then run 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.540
 and then make that layer by itself 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.800
 which is quite straight but I think so 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.510
 not so bad if you like it all 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.130
 you just want to have that too 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.040
 make that as well as of course a whole 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.010
 land he strokes in there 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.800
 the whole fun is now at 180 degrees 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.580
 15 to 20 minutes to you 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.350
 To be sure, made chopsticks 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.880
 our cupcakes are ready and too 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.080
 Cooled down and now we take care of it 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.540
 us gorgeous 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.420
 for that we take the butter and the 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.940
 powdered sugar and mix that 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.540
 Together this is a whole plate of 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.540
 very smooth mass 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.840
 the whole thing is still a bit 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.290
 dry, that's why our milk is coming 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.290
 to that and wonderful exactly 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.660
 the frosting is still very firm now 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.709
 But that brush because we're doing 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.720
 yes still a lot of food 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.110
 ready to drive and thus not the whole thing 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.490
 it grows a bit dry 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.930
 our plastic is finished now 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.490
 show what I at our church addition 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.440
 I split it exactly the full 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.979
 with the dough so three around it 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.090
 exactly equal distributed now 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:59.840
 my colors 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:05:02.810
 i'll pick red yellow blue so i am 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.240
 finished the green pastel become so 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:14.240
 was me too now I take me 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:18.160
 my school denied me so much 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.160
 come almost at the very end 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.650
 so now you have to fill those and 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:34.660
 I write that so hard is the first one 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:39.940
 color not to go that he so am 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:44.190
 swivel chairs scrape off the edge a bit 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.190
 power is long should have been second 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.670
 pay attention that the spoon 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.350
 Do not turn to another color 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:59.650
 so that I do not care too much 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:06:02.190
 mixed then pushes the whole 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.190
 a bit higher 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.800
 my door is ready filled the first one 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.870
 swing you probably have to do away 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.630
 until then sugar would start 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.630
 mix and everything has to arise 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:40.270
 It worked and can be too heavy 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.330
 It looks like it was just football too 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.910
 play and refine it properly 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.530
 I'm going to try one if 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.150
 you liked then subscribed to the 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.310
 channel looks at the other videos 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:57.940
 and comments diligently what your wishes 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:07:09.120
 and suggestions and now the hour of 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:12.000
 truth to the ok looks for some 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:16.560
 damaged from the things to drive but 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.560
 tastes really right on the shit
