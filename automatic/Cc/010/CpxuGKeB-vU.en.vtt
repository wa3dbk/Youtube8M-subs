00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.450
 who is this 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.930
 One day a question will come 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.930
 to change a life forever 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:15.129
 We have no idea 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.359
 but I did not dare 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.529
 am 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.519
 just like him six weeks ago 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.519
 when are then sustainable 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.649
 we see here quite presented 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.600
 not sure what that means only a few people in the world have 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.060
 this ability 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.910
 and you increased 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.100
 it's crazy 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.100
 it was said 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.100
 the special Mendelssohn people 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.380
 Siblings have to 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.440
 Kristiansand 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.440
 we are a brotherhood of warriors 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.870
 it appears to be so 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.369
 The Brotherhood formed thousands of years 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.100
 Nicholas 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.130
 later we would have everything we need 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.410
 and if it went wrong 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.410
 that the intended to do something different and be 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.210
 always free 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.210
 back then 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.440
 he is not the only one 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.550
 his failure 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.550
 and you 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.450
 Children like 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.499
 I test that
