00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
can't remember like I say I put a little

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.420 
can't remember like I say I put a little
link<00:03:27.560> here<00:03:28.330> for<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.800> video<00:03:30.800> I<00:03:30.860> kind<00:03:31.190> of<00:03:31.250> shade

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
link here for the video I kind of shade

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.390 
link here for the video I kind of shade
the<00:03:31.580> whole<00:03:31.880> skeleton<00:03:32.239> and<00:03:32.750> kind<00:03:33.110> of<00:03:33.170> how<00:03:33.410> how

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
the whole skeleton and kind of how how

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.830 
the whole skeleton and kind of how how
it<00:03:34.550> works<00:03:34.760> because<00:03:35.060> you've<00:03:35.330> got<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.540> shot

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
it works because you've got the shot

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.420 
it works because you've got the shot
shoulder<00:03:36.500> up<00:03:36.560> here<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:36.950> then<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.130> kind<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.370> a

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
shoulder up here and then the kind of a

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.990 
shoulder up here and then the kind of a
blade<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.810> then<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.380> got<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:40.550> shoulder

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
blade and then you got that the shoulder

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.810 
blade and then you got that the shoulder
is<00:03:41.090> about<00:03:41.330> there<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:41.959> then<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.680> elbow<00:03:43.640> is

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
is about there and then the elbow is

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.180 
is about there and then the elbow is
here<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.330> then<00:03:44.420> this<00:03:44.600> is<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.900> wrist<00:03:45.260> that's

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
here and then this is the wrist that's

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.770 
here and then this is the wrist that's
right<00:03:46.519> this<00:03:46.640> is<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.880> wrist<00:03:47.150> and<00:03:47.390> then<00:03:47.510> that's

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
right this is the wrist and then that's

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.870 
right this is the wrist and then that's
the<00:03:47.959> kind<00:03:48.110> of<00:03:48.230> finger<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:49.340> then<00:03:49.459> this<00:03:49.580> is<00:03:49.730> the

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
the kind of finger and then this is the

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.880 
the kind of finger and then this is the
fingernail<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:51.290> hole<00:03:51.470> is<00:03:51.650> like<00:03:51.799> the

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
fingernail that the hole is like the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.100 
fingernail that the hole is like the
fingernails<00:03:52.600> it's<00:03:53.600> completely

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
fingernails it's completely

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.600 
fingernails it's completely
counterintuitive<00:03:56.890> now<00:03:57.890> I'm<00:03:58.190> thinking<00:03:58.579> that

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
counterintuitive now I'm thinking that

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:06.270 
counterintuitive now I'm thinking that
should<00:03:59.060> go<00:04:00.670> mmm

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.640 

and<00:04:07.280> I'm<00:04:07.519> hiding<00:04:07.760> that<00:04:08.120> I'm<00:04:08.780> hiding<00:04:09.079> that<00:04:09.440> hope

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
and I'm hiding that I'm hiding that hope

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:20.469 
and I'm hiding that I'm hiding that hope
behind<00:04:10.579> there<00:04:18.850> don't<00:04:19.850> need<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.120> be<00:04:20.239> putting

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
behind there don't need to be putting

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:30.310 
behind there don't need to be putting
shading<00:04:21.019> in<00:04:21.140> yeah<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:22.270> then<00:04:27.700> again<00:04:29.200> I'm<00:04:30.200> using

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
shading in yeah and then again I'm using

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.900 
shading in yeah and then again I'm using
this<00:04:30.650> kind<00:04:30.919> of<00:04:31.870> fluffy<00:04:32.870> fairy<00:04:33.789> fetlocks<00:04:34.789> or

you<00:05:27.300> start<00:05:27.570> putting<00:05:27.690> lots<00:05:27.930> of<00:05:28.080> shading<00:05:28.410> in<00:05:28.500> it

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
you start putting lots of shading in it

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.930 
you start putting lots of shading in it
goes<00:05:29.360> dark<00:05:30.360> a<00:05:32.030> little<00:05:33.030> bit<00:05:33.120> of<00:05:33.210> shading

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
goes dark a little bit of shading

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:43.219 
goes dark a little bit of shading
shading<00:05:35.940> under<00:05:41.419> quite<00:05:42.419> a<00:05:42.479> bit<00:05:42.720> of<00:05:42.870> shading

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
shading under quite a bit of shading

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:51.830 
shading under quite a bit of shading
underneath<00:05:43.800> there<00:05:49.310> and<00:05:50.310> just<00:05:50.910> a<00:05:51.000> bit<00:05:51.150> around<00:05:51.510> I

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
underneath there and just a bit around I

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.900 
underneath there and just a bit around I
don't<00:05:52.500> think<00:05:52.770> we<00:05:52.950> need<00:05:53.220> a<00:05:53.750> lot<00:05:54.750> more

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
don't think we need a lot more

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.210 
don't think we need a lot more
so<00:05:56.910> we'll<00:05:57.240> put<00:05:57.389> up<00:05:58.430> have<00:05:59.430> it<00:05:59.550> sort<00:05:59.760> of<00:05:59.789> standing

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
so we'll put up have it sort of standing

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:08.170 
so we'll put up have it sort of standing
on<00:06:02.220> a<00:06:02.330> rocky<00:06:03.330> precipice<00:06:04.260> or<00:06:04.440> something

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.960 

looking<00:06:09.180> out<00:06:09.330> across<00:06:09.570> the<00:06:10.220> fairy<00:06:11.220> Mountains

looking out across the fairy Mountains
of<00:06:12.630> course<00:06:13.380> I<00:06:13.680> think<00:06:14.370> it<00:06:14.550> was<00:06:14.639> actually<00:06:14.880> the

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
of course I think it was actually the

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.320 
of course I think it was actually the
favorite<00:06:15.330> wood<00:06:15.479> in<00:06:15.660> the<00:06:15.780> story<00:06:16.099> with<00:06:17.099> a<00:06:17.330> Glade
