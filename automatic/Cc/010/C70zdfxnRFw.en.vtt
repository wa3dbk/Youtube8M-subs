go in and kind of blend that over the
purple<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:28.849> just<00:03:29.060> kind<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:29.269> sweep<00:03:29.599> it<00:03:29.780> and

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
very very lightly all right so I think

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.039 
very very lightly all right so I think
that<00:03:37.099> looks<00:03:37.400> pretty<00:03:37.639> good<00:03:37.939> so<00:03:38.659> next<00:03:38.900> we're

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049
