00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:03.300
 he also thought that stopping would be so much fun 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.120
 at least not him 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.210
 only missing after Assist was in Chur after he had these together 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.780
 He made his way to the annoyance of Mertens, finally he had to 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.749
 yet another training i will worry about 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:17.749
 because endured at definitely outgrown 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:20.519
 maybe he would need another hard-on 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.609
 it could not hurt 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.099
 since the contact lenses had already worried had only a new one 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.820
 Haircut because his hair was just too long over the last year 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.819
 become 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.819
 when heroine Haselon left again was visibly satisfied 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.260
 It had been quite exhausting because the Junior Priest races were about it 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.120
 had his hair done and then a little sweet 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.979
 Brunette could prevail she was in the end but rather desperate 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.320
 she never said she had seen such unruly hair as she had 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.080
 Apart from the fact that she had not marginalized the team and all the time 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.360
 camped because she was really nice 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.360
 Nevertheless, we had a little worry how it would end in the end 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.600
 but when she gave a little bit of hair at the end 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.680
 he has the end result class 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.560
 she is still selling a cure 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.270
 what to understand is not exactly 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.500
 his hair is not supposed to be so stormy anymore 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.240
 she assured him that one would not understand such things but is 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.630
 nonetheless important as a supplement to the Hardter would be 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.650
 the gel Nama also with total he consider for all the fun 8 since Lyon and three 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.620
 bags 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.690
 Now Florian Fritsch STAS will tackle each one individually and get one 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.640
 get a nice big ice cream parlor 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.570
 As he just sat down to do his order 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.380
 he was approached by a young man 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.100
 sorry that the disturbers but best 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.810
 There he was not from Hamilton for the first few weeks 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.520
 yes I am Hammad partner and autographs Tick too late Chur 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.950
 actually I wanted to know if the squat Marty Landes 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.509
 "I'm sorry I did not want to bother you, said the boy pulped 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.250
 and just wanted to turn around 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.869
 Head of the village 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.140
 I'm a bit stressed right now 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.650
 why do not you sit down and tell us why we wanted to know if I'm going to go 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.700
 than go 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.589
 by the way, what am I doing tour 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:11.009
 the man sat down opposite Perry 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.739
 he had brown hair which she did not shine 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.219
 and matching it wore a brown eyes 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.509
 his skin had a nice natural tan 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:23.199
 I'm going to switch Hoppert students this decade so I've got it so far 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:24.769
 get private lessons 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.190
 my parents moved to Europe when the war started 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.470
 because they did not want the child to live under such conditions 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.889
 and now that Dirk Red Bull is over 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.319
 Every year we came back as you see 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.310
 But I have heard that the students are not 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.740
 have noticed so much of the war that 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.189
 At least my parents said 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.730
 how was that with you 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.730
 Got something of the war or not at all 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:53.839
 Henri did not believe his ears that could not be serious 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:56.770
 I 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.829
 first heard of «war» 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.169
 we have around 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:03.569
 hardly on 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.540
 So yes, I've already heard a lot about the war 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.540
 I was almost Bernanke in the middle of it 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.229
 then you would certainly have been terrified 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:14.939
 Of course I was scared 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.229
 but again outside is in tennis 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.769
 until the whole body catches so much adrenaline that they are not afraid at all 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:21.679
 play 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:25.119
 it comes later when we know who could not save the number one 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.909
 Hoarau 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.969
 that has avenged Christan 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:30.849
 how do you actually have 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.819
 By the way, Harry Potter and I are entering the sixth year in which country 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.229
 Did you stay up to now? 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:38.029
 so 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:42.079
 Hall b i hold mister so will not have lived in Germany so far 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.259
 to be precise, a village 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:47.739
 my parents were always very careful not to care too much 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.130
 had gained more compact 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.230
 so we never had a computer or anything like that if you know 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.490
 I grew up with the fashion sister my mother and shed something 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.849
 Computer is 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.710
 Henry decided that he would rather change the subject 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.840
 that was fine though dry maybe a bit too personal 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.169
 Yesterday I already met two signs of the Hauptort school 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.329
 With her I can now already 3 he winks at the Hericium 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:14.419
 where that and contractions 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.760
 Our house is quite far out and there is one nearby 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.440
 Pub Na and I will be there in the evening 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.690
 and then I was addressed by such a typical black-haired and me up 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.319
 invited my team 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:29.270
 a short time later his friend came over 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.879
 and the two have told her just that they go beautiful to the main place 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.020
 Unfortunately, I have sat down there shipping as well 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.770
 he laughed 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.499
 Gorgeous does not agree because his laugh 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.479
 I wanted them to discuss and talk with an open mind 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:44.650
 not like the motto 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.390
 1 theory are ideas and the house 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.690
 and the house is good 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.309
 and the opposite sex 

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:53.259
 I simply did not feel like it 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.259
 you say a black Igor and a blond one 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.849
 Jagdfeld Combe longest CD 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.839
 Henri grimaced 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:05.219
 and from me the connoisseurs laugh the Hellenes 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:08.050
 what are you looking at so I found really nice 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.050
 But the Bernese are a little bit conceited, but it's nothing 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:12.870
 she is 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.469
 well you have to know yourself I will not talk again 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:18.520
 imagine your own opinion 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.189
 I've been taken there before 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:24.580
 and while Harry Potter and Henry complements were doing better 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.799
 Sabine is currently doing the tekom success of his embarrassing paper 

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:31.379
 To tell the end of his board 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:32.949
 you bastard 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.520
 the companion book percent 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.270
 now it could not believe it 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.960
 Becker usually had a problem with it in public too 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.629
 smile 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:44.829
 and now the jetpack cheeky on his bed and group laughing 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:49.509
 performed 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:53.979
 Lech sent him a bitter look Becker tried convulsively to laugh 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.289
 to suppress 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.669
 you can always do that 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.560
 worse, his laugh could not hold back 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.560
 the face from the track was just too stark light 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.120
 also human plans now 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.229
 once is not a time 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:11.159
 he taps his shoulder 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.240
 he certainly did not want to mess with his best friend 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.479
 I just hope that I think he'll never again see this test for me 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.550
 eaten 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.830
 that's going somewhere tonight 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.080
 celebrate the holidays properly 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.160
 do you have the concrete plan where to go 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.610
 or according to the motto 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.969
 where the wind blows to us 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:36.929
 Well, let's just have to watch out that the wind is not coming back 

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:38.589
 in the next embarrassment wh 

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:41.860

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.529

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:48.789
 also in the stomach 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:52.560
 Born Everest because with the new that gold opened in Diagon Alley 

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:53.270

 You mean that too 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.830
 yes why not listen to the Lagenser totally good for a 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:03.819
 a where you heard that, then I do not want to know 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:08.010
 as if you were not able to cope with the start of the day
