the<00:01:05.390> crack<00:01:05.660> resistance<00:01:06.350> I'll<00:01:07.190> tell<00:01:07.460> that

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
the crack resistance I'll tell that

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.450 
the crack resistance I'll tell that
helps<00:01:08.149> us<00:01:08.300> in<00:01:08.509> case<00:01:08.990> your<00:01:09.229> model<00:01:09.500> breaks<00:01:09.800> it
