it<00:01:31.479> in<00:01:31.570> physical<00:01:31.990> format<00:01:32.440> Peter<00:01:32.920> what<00:01:33.100> do<00:01:33.159> you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
it in physical format Peter what do you

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.190 
it in physical format Peter what do you
think<00:01:33.460> is<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.610> strategy<00:01:34.299> behind<00:01:34.330> these<00:01:34.960> two

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
think is the strategy behind these two

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.140 
think is the strategy behind these two
programs<00:01:35.500> is<00:01:36.040> it<00:01:36.220> a<00:01:36.280> coincidence<00:01:36.520> they're

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
programs is it a coincidence they're

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.420 
programs is it a coincidence they're
both<00:01:37.420> happening<00:01:38.049> in<00:01:38.140> Asia<00:01:38.260> no<00:01:39.070> I<00:01:39.100> don't<00:01:39.369> think

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
both happening in Asia no I don't think

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.050 
both happening in Asia no I don't think
so<00:01:39.610> i<00:01:39.760> think<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:40.570> primary<00:01:40.810> physical<00:01:41.260> demand

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
so i think the primary physical demand

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.969 
so i think the primary physical demand
global<00:01:43.060> demand<00:01:43.299> especially<00:01:43.990> for<00:01:44.590> gold<00:01:44.770> is

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
global demand especially for gold is

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.300 
global demand especially for gold is
coming<00:01:45.310> out<00:01:45.430> of<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.610> Far<00:01:45.850> East<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.950> US

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
coming out of the Far East the the US

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.130 
coming out of the Far East the the US
demand<00:01:48.640> believe<00:01:49.000> it<00:01:49.119> or<00:01:49.210> not<00:01:49.299> is<00:01:49.510> primarily

you<00:05:00.000> go<00:05:00.150> back<00:05:00.389> to<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:00.630> argument<00:05:00.930> well<00:05:01.289> the<00:05:01.440> Fed

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
you go back to the argument well the Fed

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.120 
you go back to the argument well the Fed
will<00:05:01.800> then<00:05:02.009> not<00:05:03.000> ease<00:05:03.330> monetary<00:05:03.840> policy<00:05:04.500> you

asian trade and you know i did i did a
quick<00:06:05.009> mathematical<00:06:05.789> calculation<00:06:06.509> on<00:06:06.630> how

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
quick mathematical calculation on how

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.600 
quick mathematical calculation on how
far<00:06:07.289> silver<00:06:07.650> had<00:06:07.830> dropped<00:06:08.099> last<00:06:08.280> week

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
far silver had dropped last week

far silver had dropped last week
relative<00:06:09.090> gold<00:06:09.389> in<00:06:09.599> it<00:06:09.690> on<00:06:09.900> a<00:06:09.960> percentage

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 
relative gold in it on a percentage

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.110 
relative gold in it on a percentage
basis<00:06:10.860> that<00:06:11.009> are<00:06:11.130> almost<00:06:11.340> robbed<00:06:11.610> double<00:06:12.030> the

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
basis that are almost robbed double the

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.420 
basis that are almost robbed double the
percentage<00:06:12.440> so<00:06:13.440> i<00:06:13.469> looked<00:06:13.770> at<00:06:13.919> silver<00:06:14.280> and<00:06:14.310> I

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
percentage so i looked at silver and I

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.499 
percentage so i looked at silver and I
said<00:06:14.610> you<00:06:14.699> know<00:06:14.819> it<00:06:14.880> might<00:06:15.030> be<00:06:15.060> worth<00:06:15.300> a<00:06:15.479> shot

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
said you know it might be worth a shot

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.510 
said you know it might be worth a shot
here<00:06:16.020> and<00:06:16.199> you<00:06:16.560> know<00:06:16.590> we<00:06:16.860> picked<00:06:17.280> up<00:06:17.460> some

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
here and you know we picked up some

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.950 
here and you know we picked up some
silver<00:06:18.060> in<00:06:18.840> the<00:06:19.319> 21<00:06:20.280> 57<00:06:20.669> July<00:06:21.270> area<00:06:21.690> which

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.570 
silver in the 21 57 July area which
looks<00:06:22.229> like<00:06:22.289> a<00:06:22.409> great<00:06:22.680> trade<00:06:22.979> this<00:06:23.159> morning

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
looks like a great trade this morning

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.570 
looks like a great trade this morning
and<00:06:24.569> again<00:06:25.110> yeah<00:06:25.349> sometimes<00:06:25.800> it's<00:06:26.009> it's<00:06:26.250> a<00:06:26.370> gut

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
and again yeah sometimes it's it's a gut

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.300 
and again yeah sometimes it's it's a gut
feeling<00:06:26.909> and<00:06:27.180> that<00:06:27.449> its<00:06:27.870> sound<00:06:28.440> silly<00:06:28.800> to<00:06:28.949> say

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
feeling and that its sound silly to say

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.719 
feeling and that its sound silly to say
but<00:06:29.810> and<00:06:30.810> it<00:06:30.990> must<00:06:31.139> be<00:06:31.229> sort<00:06:31.740> of<00:06:31.800> latent<00:06:32.280> memory

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
but and it must be sort of latent memory

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:34.490 
but and it must be sort of latent memory
from<00:06:33.000> 30<00:06:33.300> years<00:06:33.569> in<00:06:33.750> this<00:06:33.870> business<00:06:33.930> but

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
sometimes you just get a feel and it

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.059 
sometimes you just get a feel and it
just<00:06:36.330> felt<00:06:36.690> like<00:06:36.810> this<00:06:37.110> market<00:06:37.530> was<00:06:37.650> not<00:06:37.860> going
