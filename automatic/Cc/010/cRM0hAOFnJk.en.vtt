key to this which I believe is just the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.449 
key to this which I believe is just the
fact<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.530> it's<00:03:06.770> really<00:03:07.010> moisturizing<00:03:07.400> um

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
I mean 0 no slip whatsoever um so it has

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
moisturized um so I don't know it's kind

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.399 
moisturized um so I don't know it's kind
of<00:05:38.190> like<00:05:38.340> a<00:05:38.370> given<00:05:38.820> same<00:05:39.120> thing<00:05:39.630> I<00:05:39.810> would<00:05:39.870> use

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
of like a given same thing I would use

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.990 
of like a given same thing I would use
this<00:05:41.389> all<00:05:42.389> the<00:05:42.449> time<00:05:43.320> I<00:05:43.830> think<00:05:44.310> every<00:05:44.729> blue

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
this all the time I think every blue

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.300 
this all the time I think every blue
moon<00:05:45.030> I<00:05:45.690> would<00:05:45.840> probably<00:05:46.050> use<00:05:46.260> it<00:05:46.650> and<00:05:46.919> give<00:05:47.099> my

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
moon I would probably use it and give my

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.189 
moon I would probably use it and give my
hair<00:05:47.550> that<00:05:47.760> extra<00:05:48.240> moisture<00:05:48.479> that<00:05:49.020> it<00:05:49.169> needs

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
hair that extra moisture that it needs

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:52.399 
hair that extra moisture that it needs
because<00:05:49.620> that's<00:05:49.770> exactly<00:05:49.979> what<00:05:50.580> I<00:05:50.639> do<00:05:51.139> it<00:05:52.139> just

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:52.409 
because that's exactly what I do it just

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.040 
because that's exactly what I do it just
takes<00:05:52.650> too<00:05:52.889> long<00:05:52.919> because<00:05:53.310> my<00:05:53.870> hair<00:05:54.870> needs

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
takes too long because my hair needs

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.279 
takes too long because my hair needs
slip<00:05:55.909> and<00:05:56.909> I<00:05:56.940> know<00:05:57.240> when<00:05:57.479> I<00:05:57.510> put<00:05:57.720> it<00:05:57.840> on<00:05:57.930> my<00:05:58.080> hair

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
slip and I know when I put it on my hair

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:01.790 
slip and I know when I put it on my hair
my<00:05:58.620> hair<00:05:58.650> was<00:05:58.919> probably<00:05:59.039> like<00:05:59.370> girl<00:06:00.139> what<00:06:01.139> are

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
this is abusive I would purchase the

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.760 
this is abusive I would purchase the
product<00:06:08.190> again<00:06:08.610> but<00:06:09.120> it<00:06:09.270> wouldn't<00:06:09.960> be<00:06:10.080> one<00:06:10.650> of

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
product again but it wouldn't be one of

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.100 
product again but it wouldn't be one of
my<00:06:10.860> staple<00:06:11.430> products<00:06:11.909> because<00:06:12.419> it<00:06:12.599> takes<00:06:12.870> so

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
my staple products because it takes so

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.890 
my staple products because it takes so
long<00:06:13.139> and<00:06:13.979> I<00:06:14.520> don't<00:06:14.580> like<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.270> way<00:06:15.389> my<00:06:15.419> hair

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
long and I don't like the way my hair

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.459 
long and I don't like the way my hair
feels<00:06:16.289> when<00:06:16.830> I'm<00:06:17.039> trying<00:06:17.580> to<00:06:17.700> detangle

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:19.469 
feels when I'm trying to detangle

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:22.549 
feels when I'm trying to detangle
because<00:06:20.279> as<00:06:21.089> you<00:06:21.599> probably<00:06:21.719> know<00:06:22.110> I'm<00:06:22.379> not

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:22.559 
because as you probably know I'm not

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:26.209 
because as you probably know I'm not
sure<00:06:22.889> I<00:06:23.219> finger<00:06:23.669> detangle<00:06:24.149> so<00:06:24.899> I<00:06:25.319> could<00:06:25.769> feel

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:26.219 
sure I finger detangle so I could feel

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.889 
sure I finger detangle so I could feel
the<00:06:26.610> difference<00:06:27.029> in<00:06:27.209> my<00:06:27.360> hair<00:06:27.629> when<00:06:27.779> I'm

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:27.899 
the difference in my hair when I'm

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:29.899 
the difference in my hair when I'm
detangling<00:06:28.349> when<00:06:28.469> it<00:06:28.559> has<00:06:28.679> slip<00:06:29.069> it's<00:06:29.339> so<00:06:29.699> much

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909 
detangling when it has slip it's so much

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:33.079 
detangling when it has slip it's so much
easier<00:06:30.119> to<00:06:30.659> get<00:06:30.749> through<00:06:31.129> you<00:06:32.129> can<00:06:32.309> feel<00:06:32.729> the

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:33.089 
easier to get through you can feel the

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:37.009 
easier to get through you can feel the
knots<00:06:33.419> and<00:06:34.729> the<00:06:35.729> tangles<00:06:36.209> easier<00:06:36.629> when<00:06:36.929> you

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:37.019 
knots and the tangles easier when you

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:38.959 
knots and the tangles easier when you
have<00:06:37.169> more<00:06:37.499> slip<00:06:37.979> because<00:06:38.489> you're<00:06:38.759> going

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:38.969 
have more slip because you're going

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:40.429 
have more slip because you're going
through<00:06:39.209> it<00:06:39.330> really<00:06:39.509> fast<00:06:39.659> you<00:06:40.169> can<00:06:40.319> feel

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:40.439 
through it really fast you can feel

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:41.779 
through it really fast you can feel
everything<00:06:40.860> as<00:06:41.189> you're<00:06:41.309> going<00:06:41.459> through<00:06:41.759> it

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:41.789 
everything as you're going through it

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:44.299 
everything as you're going through it
with<00:06:42.569> this<00:06:42.869> you<00:06:43.229> really<00:06:43.649> have<00:06:43.860> to<00:06:44.039> I<00:06:44.279> mean

00:06:44.299 --> 00:06:44.309 
with this you really have to I mean

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:47.329 
with this you really have to I mean
break<00:06:44.939> it<00:06:45.209> in<00:06:45.419> your<00:06:45.719> hair<00:06:46.050> and<00:06:46.409> go<00:06:46.889> through<00:06:47.309> it

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:47.339 
break it in your hair and go through it

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:51.139 
break it in your hair and go through it
and<00:06:48.089> it's<00:06:48.989> just<00:06:49.679> it's<00:06:50.519> a<00:06:50.610> little<00:06:50.729> difficult

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:51.149 
and it's just it's a little difficult

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:54.379 
and it's just it's a little difficult
but<00:06:51.719> like<00:06:52.469> I<00:06:52.589> said<00:06:52.649> the<00:06:53.009> moisture<00:06:53.550> payoff<00:06:53.999> is

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:54.389 
but like I said the moisture payoff is

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:56.419 
but like I said the moisture payoff is
definitely<00:06:55.259> worth<00:06:55.469> it<00:06:55.649> if<00:06:55.769> you<00:06:55.889> have<00:06:56.069> the<00:06:56.219> time

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:56.429
