 a groups of these areas like a minired action basted had the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.960
 lucky to do an internship in the sports section and stay there 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.850
 There is a year and Alava whose audience will understand the relationship between 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.189
 sportsman journalists 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.389
 I would like to ask you right and also in the relationship of journalists 

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:23.670
 and press officer 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.670
 there is 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.510
 comes out from the beginning what there is 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.440
 then to end the corporal you depend on them not 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.860
 i wolf is to find very fluid relationships birds they are for you 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.480
 anything you need to ask questions about it training time subject 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.480
 accreditation 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.620
 difficult for us because we know that protect yourself in a filter at the time of 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.620
 the interviews do not feel the most difficult to get 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.970
 today the students of 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.750
 everis bad like in that as soon as this ibrahimovic interview has come out 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.660
 in the pages of the country in in recent days but the evacuation the 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.870
 interview more difficult to get before you have spoken in de ronaldinho that 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.460
 He has been behind the counter for two years, but he has been 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.460
 on track they do more to fight for it with a sports player 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.139
 Well, look, I think it was the 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:27.269
 the buffoon n that this song is the magazine we wanted world palestra 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.560

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:38.049
 I can not think of it today in a Viennese hotel of my past and state and that is the other and 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.150
 When you give up, you're lost because I think I was three weeks 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:46.299

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.599

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.319
 medium then interview buffon
