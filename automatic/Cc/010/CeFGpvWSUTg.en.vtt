from rhythms and I would let you hear
the<00:01:08.920> difference<00:01:09.400> in<00:01:09.550> see<00:01:09.880> if<00:01:10.300> you<00:01:10.420> can<00:01:10.540> pick

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
the difference in see if you can pick

the difference in see if you can pick
this<00:01:10.869> up<00:01:11.080> sixteen<00:01:11.950> mill<00:01:12.160> rhythm<00:01:20.280> 16<00:01:21.280> note

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520

this up sixteen mill rhythm 16 note
rhythm<00:01:21.729> nothing<00:01:22.360> wrong<00:01:22.479> with<00:01:22.660> that<00:01:22.810> now<00:01:23.350> and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
rhythm nothing wrong with that now and

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.080 
rhythm nothing wrong with that now and
play<00:01:23.770> it<00:01:23.860> again<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.190> see<00:01:24.610> if<00:01:24.640> you<00:01:24.789> can<00:01:24.940> hit<00:01:25.030> a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
play it again and see if you can hit a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.730 
play it again and see if you can hit a
difference<00:01:25.570> in<00:01:25.720> what<00:01:25.960> I<00:01:25.990> just<00:01:26.080> did<00:01:26.500> there

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
difference in what I just did there

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.830 
difference in what I just did there
broken<00:01:27.160> me<00:01:27.280> 16<00:01:27.700> no<00:01:27.880> rhythm<00:01:28.240> so<00:01:28.360> this<00:01:28.509> rhythm<00:01:28.780> is

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
broken me 16 no rhythm so this rhythm is

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:42.529 
broken me 16 no rhythm so this rhythm is
going<00:01:28.899> to<00:01:29.050> be<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.170> little<00:01:29.320> bit<00:01:29.470> different

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.820 

making<00:01:43.539> his<00:01:43.690> a<00:01:43.720> difference<00:01:44.170> right<00:01:44.320> away

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
making his a difference right away

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.710 
making his a difference right away
the<00:01:45.009> first<00:01:45.310> one<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.729> sixteenth<00:01:46.180> notes<00:01:46.420> with<00:01:46.600> an

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
the first one is sixteenth notes with an

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.749 
the first one is sixteenth notes with an
ox<00:01:46.899> along<00:01:47.229> their<00:01:47.770> strength<00:01:53.430> nothing<00:01:54.430> wrong

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
ox along their strength nothing wrong

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.179 
ox along their strength nothing wrong
with<00:01:54.939> that<00:01:55.090> but<00:01:55.509> in<00:01:55.900> certain<00:01:56.560> situations<00:01:57.130> you

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
with that but in certain situations you

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:58.859 
with that but in certain situations you
want<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.520> swing<00:01:57.790> them<00:01:57.939> so<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.150> just<00:01:58.299> depends<00:01:58.810> on

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
want to swing them so it just depends on

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.270 
want to swing them so it just depends on
what<00:01:59.049> you're<00:01:59.170> doing<00:01:59.200> but<00:01:59.590> you<00:01:59.710> need<00:01:59.860> to<00:01:59.979> learn

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
what you're doing but you need to learn

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.920 
what you're doing but you need to learn
how<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.580> do<00:02:00.790> both<00:02:01.030> because<00:02:01.240> usually<00:02:01.630> that's

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
how to do both because usually that's

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.499 
how to do both because usually that's
what's<00:02:02.140> missing<00:02:02.439> and<00:02:02.920> most<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:04.329> the<00:02:04.450> things

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
what's missing and most of the things

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.390 
what's missing and most of the things
that<00:02:04.810> people<00:02:04.930> teach<00:02:05.200> about<00:02:05.409> funk<00:02:05.770> playing<00:02:06.130> is

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
that people teach about funk playing is

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.160 
that people teach about funk playing is
that<00:02:06.970> a<00:02:07.000> lot<00:02:07.240> of<00:02:07.329> times<00:02:07.570> you<00:02:07.689> need<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.840> swing

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
that a lot of times you need to swing

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.139 
that a lot of times you need to swing
those<00:02:08.380> eight<00:02:08.649> those<00:02:09.280> sixteenth<00:02:09.759> notes<00:02:10.000> so

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
those eight those sixteenth notes so

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.280 
those eight those sixteenth notes so
they<00:02:10.269> bounce<00:02:10.479> more<00:02:11.130> if<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.310> listen<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.850> a<00:02:13.299> lot

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
they bounce more if you listen to a lot

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.280 
they bounce more if you listen to a lot
of<00:02:14.650> guys<00:02:14.829> that<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.220> like<00:02:15.519> you'll<00:02:15.790> hear<00:02:16.000> both<00:02:16.360> but

those sixteenth notes and then get away
from<00:03:42.210> the<00:03:42.450> metronome<00:03:42.900> when<00:03:43.050> you<00:03:43.140> want<00:03:43.320> to

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380
