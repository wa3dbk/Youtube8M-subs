will have a link in the description

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.109 
will have a link in the description
below<00:00:15.619> or<00:00:16.619> you<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:16.859> get<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.130> overclocking

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
below or you can get the overclocking

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.510 
below or you can get the overclocking
kernel<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.840> all<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.560> instructions<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.400> get

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
kernel and all the instructions to get

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.519 
kernel and all the instructions to get
that<00:00:20.670> flashed<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.240> your<00:00:21.390> infuse<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.289> let's<00:00:22.439> go

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
that flashed on your infuse so let's go

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.230 
that flashed on your infuse so let's go
ahead<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.800> started<00:00:23.130> here<00:00:26.060> right<00:00:27.060> now<00:00:27.210> I

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
ahead and it started here right now I

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.810 
ahead and it started here right now I
have<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:27.980> default<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.099> don't<00:00:29.279> have<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.490> maxed

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
have it on default I don't have it maxed

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.299 
have it on default I don't have it maxed
out<00:00:29.939> yet<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.439> it<00:00:31.439> can't<00:00:31.710> go<00:00:31.830> all<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.070> way<00:00:32.099> up<00:00:32.279> to

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
out yet so it can't go all the way up to

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.450 
out yet so it can't go all the way up to
as<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.120> see<00:00:33.620> one<00:00:34.620> point<00:00:34.920> six<00:00:35.160> megahertz

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
as you can see one point six megahertz

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.479 
as you can see one point six megahertz
so<00:00:36.329> let's<00:00:36.450> go<00:00:36.570> ahead<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.950> max<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.129> all<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> way

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
so let's go ahead and max it all the way

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.740 
so let's go ahead and max it all the way
out<00:00:38.520> here<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.510> back<00:00:39.540> here<00:00:41.510> start<00:00:42.510> from<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
out here and go back here start from the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.310 
out here and go back here start from the
beginning<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:44.059> you're<00:00:45.059> going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> notice<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
beginning so you're going to notice the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.799 
beginning so you're going to notice the
lag<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.950> was<00:00:47.039> talking<00:00:47.399> about<00:00:47.489> my<00:00:47.670> last<00:00:48.030> video<00:00:48.480> is

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
lag I was talking about my last video is

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.040 
lag I was talking about my last video is
completely<00:00:49.620> gone<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:50.539> mean<00:00:51.539> let's<00:00:51.780> do<00:00:51.960> that

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
completely gone I mean let's do that

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.850 
completely gone I mean let's do that
again<00:00:52.199> here<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:53.070> grab<00:00:53.940> pull<00:00:54.530> really<00:00:55.530> fast

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
again here just grab pull really fast

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.540 
again here just grab pull really fast
strike<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.640> more<00:00:56.789> time<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:58.070> mean<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> pretty

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
strike one more time I mean it pretty

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.970 
strike one more time I mean it pretty
much<00:00:59.699> eliminates<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.510> lag<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:01.109> course<00:01:01.859> you're

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
much eliminates the lag of course you're

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.920 
much eliminates the lag of course you're
going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.280> more<00:01:02.489> battery<00:01:02.940> drainage<00:01:03.420> with

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
going to have more battery drainage with

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.770 
going to have more battery drainage with
the<00:01:04.320> overclock<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.360> far<00:01:06.570> has<00:01:06.720> been

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the overclock but so far has been

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.719 
the overclock but so far has been
minimal<00:01:07.260> for<00:01:07.500> me<00:01:07.650> hasn't<00:01:08.250> been<00:01:08.340> too

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
minimal for me hasn't been too

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.880 
minimal for me hasn't been too
noticeable<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.420> still<00:01:10.020> get<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.170> whole<00:01:10.409> day<00:01:10.619> use

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
noticeable I still get a whole day use

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.320 
noticeable I still get a whole day use
out<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.430> that's<00:01:11.520> connected<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.060> Wi-Fi

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
out of it and that's connected to Wi-Fi

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.850 
out of it and that's connected to Wi-Fi

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
quick quadrant score let's first go

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.609 
quick quadrant score let's first go
ahead<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.590> here<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:24.320> clear<00:01:25.320> out<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
ahead and get in here and clear out the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.230 
ahead and get in here and clear out the
running<00:01:25.950> applications<00:01:28.640> I'll<00:01:29.640> get<00:01:29.880> back<00:01:30.060> into

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
running applications I'll get back into

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.950

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
this thing now so that's good yes

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.899 
this thing now so that's good yes
alright<00:02:38.200> let's<00:02:38.890> see<00:02:39.010> if<00:02:39.099> I<00:02:39.159> could<00:02:39.219> get<00:02:39.400> in<00:02:39.549> here

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
alright let's see if I could get in here

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.250 
alright let's see if I could get in here
with<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.329> clear<00:02:41.129> there<00:02:42.129> you<00:02:42.250> have<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:43.109> it's<00:02:44.109> got

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
with it clear there you have it it's got

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.190 
with it clear there you have it it's got
a<00:02:46.650> 2296<00:02:47.650> quadrant<00:02:48.280> score<00:02:48.579> so<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.180> mean<00:02:49.450> that's

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
a 2296 quadrant score so I mean that's

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.500 
a 2296 quadrant score so I mean that's
right<00:02:50.680> up<00:02:50.859> there<00:02:50.890> with<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:52.000> dual<00:02:52.209> core

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
right up there with the dual core

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.599 
right up there with the dual core
devices<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:54.250> just<00:02:54.780> kind<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.810> get<00:02:55.959> another<00:02:56.609> take

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
devices so just kind of get another take

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:58.920 
devices so just kind of get another take
at<00:02:57.819> it<00:02:57.970> let's<00:02:58.150> go<00:02:58.269> ahead<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:58.420> run<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.659> one<00:02:58.810> more

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
at it let's go ahead and run it one more

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.460 
at it let's go ahead and run it one more
time<00:03:02.790> should<00:03:03.790> be<00:03:03.939> about<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.420> same<00:03:04.720> as<00:03:05.230> last

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
time should be about the same as last

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.199 
time should be about the same as last
time<00:03:05.950> this<00:03:06.370> kind<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:06.760> just<00:03:06.879> gives<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.180> a

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
time this kind of just gives you a

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.809 
time this kind of just gives you a
better<00:03:07.389> idea<00:03:08.129> that<00:03:09.129> way<00:03:09.250> I'm<00:03:09.370> not<00:03:09.400> just

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
better idea that way I'm not just

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.670 
better idea that way I'm not just
running<00:03:10.150> one<00:03:10.329> quadrant<00:03:10.780> score<00:03:11.169> and<00:03:11.379> leaving

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
running one quadrant score and leaving

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.449 
running one quadrant score and leaving
it<00:03:11.769> at<00:03:11.889> that<00:03:11.919> I<00:03:13.049> have<00:03:14.049> run<00:03:14.319> about<00:03:14.620> four<00:03:15.250> or<00:03:15.280> five

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
it at that I have run about four or five

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.369 
it at that I have run about four or five
of<00:03:15.790> these<00:03:15.879> so<00:03:16.180> far<00:03:16.450> it's<00:03:16.720> been<00:03:16.959> about<00:03:17.169> the<00:03:17.349> same

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
of these so far it's been about the same

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.849 
of these so far it's been about the same
so<00:03:18.299> we<00:03:19.299> should<00:03:19.480> see<00:03:19.689> similar<00:03:20.139> results<00:03:20.680> yet

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
so we should see similar results yet

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:41.570 
so we should see similar results yet
again

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:50.449 

alright

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.650 

alright<00:03:51.459> so<00:03:52.120> we<00:03:52.300> got<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.569> second<00:03:52.930> go-around

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
alright so we got the second go-around

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.110 
alright so we got the second go-around
so<00:03:55.660> i<00:03:57.599> zoom<00:03:58.599> in<00:03:58.810> here<00:03:58.840> there<00:03:59.620> we<00:03:59.739> go<00:03:59.920> so<00:04:00.730> yeah<00:04:00.910> a

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
so i zoom in here there we go so yeah a

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.210 
so i zoom in here there we go so yeah a
little<00:04:01.360> bit<00:04:01.450> higher<00:04:01.630> this<00:04:01.900> time<00:04:01.959> so<00:04:02.500> it's<00:04:03.040> been

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
little bit higher this time so it's been

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.770 
little bit higher this time so it's been
averaging<00:04:03.640> right<00:04:03.849> around<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.209> same<00:04:04.450> and

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
averaging right around the same and

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.920 
averaging right around the same and
that's<00:04:04.959> fully<00:04:05.500> maxed<00:04:05.950> out<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.280> CPU<00:04:06.819> of<00:04:07.060> course

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
that's fully maxed out the CPU of course

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.190 
that's fully maxed out the CPU of course
I<00:04:08.550> don't<00:04:09.550> run<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:09.850> like<00:04:09.970> that<00:04:10.180> all<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.480> time<00:04:10.630> I

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
I don't run it like that all the time I

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.420 
I don't run it like that all the time I
do<00:04:12.040> on<00:04:12.370> demand<00:04:12.790> so<00:04:13.239> I<00:04:13.300> way<00:04:13.480> I'm<00:04:13.600> not<00:04:14.430> straining
