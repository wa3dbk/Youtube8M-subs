drying them under I'm not brushing them
not<00:04:31.420> brushing<00:04:31.660> them<00:04:31.930> flat

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.210 

it<00:04:42.120> is<00:04:42.210> more<00:04:42.390> difficult<00:04:42.420> to<00:04:43.080> grab<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.920> one<00:04:44.070> to

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
it is more difficult to grab the one to

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.610 
it is more difficult to grab the one to
the<00:04:44.310> back<00:04:44.460> but<00:04:44.850> it's<00:04:45.360> not<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:45.660> neat<00:04:45.990> neat<00:04:46.230> style

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
the back but it's not a neat neat style

00:04:46.620 --> 00:05:00.330 
the back but it's not a neat neat style
so<00:04:46.980> you<00:04:47.430> just<00:04:47.460> pick<00:04:48.360> away<00:04:48.600> in<00:04:48.810> there

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.590 

the<00:05:01.340> phone<00:05:01.550> sections<00:05:02.090> you<00:05:02.210> want<00:05:02.360> to<00:05:02.450> get

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
the phone sections you want to get

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.590 
the phone sections you want to get
smoother<00:05:03.320> and<00:05:03.560> flatter<00:05:03.860> so<00:05:04.370> after<00:05:04.610> you<00:05:05.180> have

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
smoother and flatter so after you have

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.350 
smoother and flatter so after you have
curled<00:05:05.960> it<00:05:06.230> with<00:05:06.440> a<00:05:06.470> hot<00:05:06.830> brush<00:05:07.280> then<00:05:07.880> my<00:05:08.060> hair

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
curled it with a hot brush then my hair

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.410 
curled it with a hot brush then my hair
dryer<00:05:08.630> has<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.380> cool<00:05:10.070> button<00:05:10.640> and<00:05:10.880> I<00:05:11.240> actually

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
dryer has a cool button and I actually

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.530 
dryer has a cool button and I actually
blast<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.350> front<00:05:12.650> want<00:05:12.890> it<00:05:13.460> home<00:05:13.730> to<00:05:14.240> smooth

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
blast the front want it home to smooth

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:22.300 
blast the front want it home to smooth
down<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.870> cuticle<00:05:15.410> as<00:05:15.620> well<00:05:19.240> mm-hmm<00:05:21.310> again

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
down the cuticle as well mm-hmm again

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.430 
down the cuticle as well mm-hmm again
the<00:05:22.430> important<00:05:22.910> thing<00:05:23.090> is<00:05:23.330> until<00:05:24.020> they're<00:05:24.230> all

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
the important thing is until they're all

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.810 
the important thing is until they're all
done<00:05:24.710> is<00:05:25.010> actually<00:05:25.760> not<00:05:27.370> flattening<00:05:28.370> any<00:05:28.670> of

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
done is actually not flattening any of

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.980 
done is actually not flattening any of
it<00:05:28.940> down<00:05:29.180> yet<00:05:29.420> so<00:05:29.810> looks<00:05:30.560> a<00:05:30.620> bit<00:05:30.680> scary<00:05:31.040> but

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
it down yet so looks a bit scary but

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.450 
it down yet so looks a bit scary but
we'll<00:05:32.990> see<00:05:34.750> don't<00:05:35.750> over<00:05:36.350> dry<00:05:36.530> your<00:05:36.770> hair<00:05:37.010> once

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
we'll see don't over dry your hair once

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.990 
we'll see don't over dry your hair once
it's<00:05:37.670> dry<00:05:38.110> we<00:05:39.110> stop<00:05:39.950> using<00:05:40.220> the<00:05:40.520> hair<00:05:40.730> dryer

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
it's dry we stop using the hair dryer

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.180 
it's dry we stop using the hair dryer
because<00:05:41.990> you're<00:05:42.140> not<00:05:42.290> actually<00:05:42.470> going<00:05:42.860> to<00:05:43.010> get

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
because you're not actually going to get

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.160 
because you're not actually going to get
anywhere<00:05:43.640> if<00:05:44.270> you<00:05:44.420> need<00:05:44.630> any<00:05:44.840> additional

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
anywhere if you need any additional

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.800 
anywhere if you need any additional
styling<00:05:46.130> that's<00:05:46.340> when<00:05:46.550> you<00:05:46.670> need<00:05:46.820> tongs<00:05:47.510> or

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
styling that's when you need tongs or

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.020 
styling that's when you need tongs or
straighteners<00:05:48.380> but<00:05:48.890> you<00:05:49.190> want<00:05:49.460> to<00:05:49.550> leave<00:05:49.850> it

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
straighteners but you want to leave it

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.720 
straighteners but you want to leave it
ever<00:05:50.270> so<00:05:50.750> slightly<00:05:51.110> down<00:05:51.500> rather<00:05:52.220> than<00:05:52.400> making

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
ever so slightly down rather than making

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.590 
ever so slightly down rather than making
it<00:05:52.970> over<00:05:53.150> dry<00:05:53.510> right<00:05:54.470> so<00:05:54.920> there's<00:05:55.550> pretty<00:05:56.510> much

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
it over dry right so there's pretty much

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:07.830 
it over dry right so there's pretty much
dry<00:05:57.080> now<00:05:57.320> and<00:05:57.680> now

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.570 

now<00:06:08.470> all<00:06:08.889> I<00:06:08.919> need<00:06:09.070> to<00:06:09.220> do<00:06:09.520> is<00:06:09.880> to<00:06:10.210> start<00:06:11.580> running

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
now all I need to do is to start running

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.460 
now all I need to do is to start running
my<00:06:12.790> fingers<00:06:13.240> through<00:06:13.270> it<00:06:13.600> and<00:06:13.900> letting<00:06:14.169> those

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
my fingers through it and letting those

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:20.159 
my fingers through it and letting those
layers<00:06:14.940> settle<00:06:15.940> down<00:06:15.970> a<00:06:16.210> little<00:06:16.389> bit<00:06:19.169> it's

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
layers settle down a little bit it's

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.250 
layers settle down a little bit it's
basically<00:06:20.590> just<00:06:20.710> then<00:06:21.750> playing<00:06:22.750> around<00:06:23.050> with

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
basically just then playing around with

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.640 
basically just then playing around with
it<00:06:23.440> until<00:06:23.590> you<00:06:24.190> get<00:06:24.340> the<00:06:24.520> look<00:06:24.699> that<00:06:24.910> you<00:06:25.030> want

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
it until you get the look that you want

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.830 
it until you get the look that you want
and<00:06:26.650> then<00:06:26.680> once<00:06:27.100> you've<00:06:27.280> done<00:06:27.430> that<00:06:27.490> I'm<00:06:27.880> pop<00:06:28.810> a

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
and then once you've done that I'm pop a

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.530 
and then once you've done that I'm pop a
little<00:06:29.050> bit<00:06:29.260> of<00:06:29.290> a<00:06:29.620> shine<00:06:30.610> spray<00:06:31.000> on<00:06:31.150> it<00:06:31.180> to

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.540 
little bit of a shine spray on it to

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.480 
little bit of a shine spray on it to
give<00:06:31.720> it<00:06:31.750> a<00:06:31.960> little<00:06:32.080> bit<00:06:32.380> of<00:06:32.410> a<00:06:32.650> a<00:06:32.860> little<00:06:33.280> bit

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
give it a little bit of a a little bit

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.189 
give it a little bit of a a little bit
of<00:06:33.610> a<00:06:33.669> shimmer<00:06:33.880> and<00:06:35.310> that's<00:06:36.310> how<00:06:36.460> I<00:06:36.490> get<00:06:36.639> my

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 
of a shimmer and that's how I get my

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:39.870 
of a shimmer and that's how I get my
messed-up<00:06:38.199> looking<00:06:38.560> hair<00:06:38.979> that<00:06:39.430> I<00:06:39.460> do<00:06:39.580> with<00:06:39.820> a

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
messed-up looking hair that I do with a

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:48.959 
messed-up looking hair that I do with a
smoky<00:06:40.240> eye<00:06:40.270> makeup
