00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the bowler 20 generations later you can

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.139 
the bowler 20 generations later you can
see<00:00:40.530> now<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.710> behavior<00:00:40.860> has<00:00:41.190> improved<00:00:41.340> but

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
see now the behavior has improved but

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.220 
see now the behavior has improved but
still<00:00:42.210> they<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.629> not<00:00:42.870> show<00:00:43.050> good<00:00:43.320> soccer<00:00:43.500> play

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
still they do not show good soccer play

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:55.319 
still they do not show good soccer play
we<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.379> wait<00:00:46.620> some<00:00:46.860> more

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.500 

now<00:00:55.840> we<00:00:55.899> are<00:00:56.110> at<00:00:56.230> generation<00:00:56.739> hundred<00:00:57.129> so<00:00:58.030> here

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
now we are at generation hundred so here

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.869 
now we are at generation hundred so here
the<00:00:59.379> behavior<00:00:59.829> of<00:00:59.860> the<00:01:00.010> place<00:01:00.220> is<00:01:00.430> still<00:01:00.520> very

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
the behavior of the place is still very

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.970 
the behavior of the place is still very
successful<00:01:01.149> or<00:01:01.570> scoring<00:01:02.230> goals<00:01:02.379> or<00:01:02.620> something

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
successful or scoring goals or something

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.700 
successful or scoring goals or something
but<00:01:03.879> interesting<00:01:04.629> emergent<00:01:05.080> patterns<00:01:05.229> appear

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
but interesting emergent patterns appear

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.800 
but interesting emergent patterns appear
in<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:05.860> formation<00:01:06.280> of<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.460> players<00:01:06.729> you<00:01:07.600> see

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
in the formation of the players you see

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.350 
in the formation of the players you see
here<00:01:08.050> the<00:01:08.590> blue<00:01:08.800> are<00:01:09.100> forming<00:01:09.820> some<00:01:10.000> kind<00:01:10.030> of

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
here the blue are forming some kind of

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.510 
here the blue are forming some kind of
of<00:01:10.540> chain<00:01:10.990> now<00:01:11.170> they<00:01:11.320> move<00:01:11.470> to<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.680> border<00:01:11.979> but

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
of chain now they move to the border but

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.270 
of chain now they move to the border but
more<00:01:13.119> interestingly<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:14.140> formation<00:01:15.040> of<00:01:15.130> the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
more interestingly the formation of the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.700 
more interestingly the formation of the
red<00:01:15.460> players<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:16.509> form<00:01:16.780> some<00:01:16.960> kind<00:01:17.140> of<00:01:17.350> defense

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
red players to form some kind of defense

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.370 
red players to form some kind of defense
chain<00:01:18.040> or<00:01:18.220> whatever<00:01:18.310> it<00:01:18.700> is<00:01:18.880> also<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:20.140> tunic

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
chain or whatever it is also the tunic

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.149 
chain or whatever it is also the tunic
of<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.590> ball<00:01:21.479> now<00:01:22.479> we<00:01:22.540> are<00:01:22.750> generation<00:01:23.470> 500

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
of the ball now we are generation 500

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.100 
of the ball now we are generation 500
now<00:01:24.850> this<00:01:25.000> is<00:01:25.119> much<00:01:25.300> better<00:01:25.479> this<00:01:25.780> looks<00:01:25.990> like

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
now this is much better this looks like

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.710 
now this is much better this looks like
football<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:27.310> both<00:01:27.670> teams<00:01:27.850> seem<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.479> have<00:01:28.600> an

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
football so both teams seem to have an

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.810 
football so both teams seem to have an
idea<00:01:28.990> of<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.170> game<00:01:29.380> some<00:01:30.070> players<00:01:30.369> run<00:01:30.610> for

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
idea of the game some players run for

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.910 
idea of the game some players run for
the<00:01:30.880> ball<00:01:31.090> other<00:01:31.720> covers<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.259> it<00:01:32.380> under<00:01:32.590> other

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
the ball other covers to it under other

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.779 
the ball other covers to it under other
cover<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.369> area<00:01:33.640> so<00:01:34.560> what's<00:01:35.560> up<00:01:35.679> now<00:01:35.860> so<00:01:36.460> the

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
cover the area so what's up now so the

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.550 
cover the area so what's up now so the
ball<00:01:37.090> is<00:01:37.240> going<00:01:37.390> back<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:37.750> forth<00:01:37.960> now<00:01:38.080> red<00:01:38.350> has

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
ball is going back and forth now red has

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.450 
ball is going back and forth now red has
the<00:01:38.679> ball<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:40.210> looks<00:01:40.450> very<00:01:40.539> good<00:01:41.340> red<00:01:42.340> is

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
the ball this looks very good red is

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.919 
the ball this looks very good red is
going<00:01:42.640> on<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:44.610> go<00:01:46.890> they<00:01:47.890> did<00:01:48.039> it<00:01:48.899> thanks<00:01:49.899> for

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:51.930 
going on and go they did it thanks for
