00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.480
 after a lot of speed on the tracks 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.759
 Formula 1 was the turn now gives 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.940
 accelerate on the blonde television 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.560
 barrichello is the new host of sbt 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.070
 on Sundays in a program that involves 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.269
 lots of excitement and motor racing 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.269
 debut this week 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.030
 but the challenge is the pilot lives on 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.190
 challenges and I think this is one more is 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.710
 very cool working with tv 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.600
 open with the sbt that is opening the house 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.510
 so that we have a program of 45 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.450
 minutes and that we help the public 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.540
 choose your car that it will 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.670
 have fun with us, we have also 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.010
 the public within the accelerated 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.900
 I can take people for a ride 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.010
 you know how much it goes from 0 to 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.720
 100 how much does it make of fuel and such 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.640
 But you do not know when he turns 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.950
 quick turn around so it's one of the things 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.020
 that if you do not go ahead in this 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.680
 site the steering wheel so turned the car there 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.680
 in this afternoon 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:29.369
 Come on, let's go now and confess to us. 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.270
 has been giving a lot of laughter with the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.670
 our accelerants let's say so 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.200
 celebrities and I think to tell you the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.090
 It's true that I had more fun. 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.580
 adriane galisteu because she was not 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.880
 enjoying nothing gave him speed up the car and 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.690
 she screamed a lot and went 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.690
 extremely fun 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:01.540
 there at that time the project accelerated 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.150
 appeared on youtube on the internet for 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.310
 television was a step in fact this is a 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.950
 trend in Brazilian television 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.210
 we found on youtube nephu shaq that 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.100
 Someone was on youtube. 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.900
 could he bring this 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.090
 YouTube content for us 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.190
 Can we make it viable? 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.920
 Of course it's different things he has 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.200
 45 minutes each Sunday to fill out 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.460
 There are seven minutes. 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.230
 So all this we have to be 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.030
 equated and conversed 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.040
 we started with three programs but I think 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.730
 which has everything to extend to the 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.150
 infinite 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.980
 my hair helps aerodynamics right? 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.750
 I'm easy going and never stay 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.310
 No, I feel comfortable when she 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.550
 I lower the visor and go to the competition 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.080
 but it's this camera thing I'm 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.110
 being well trained to feel at 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.110
 will
