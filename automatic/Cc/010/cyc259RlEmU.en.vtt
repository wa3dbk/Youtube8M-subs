what<00:00:05.670> I've<00:00:05.819> got<00:00:06.000> for<00:00:06.240> you<00:00:06.270> today<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:06.779> the

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
what I've got for you today is the

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.430 
what I've got for you today is the
boiling<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.560> 40<00:00:07.980> millimeter<00:00:08.340> f/2<00:00:09.000> lens<00:00:09.440> this

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
boiling of 40 millimeter f/2 lens this

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.700 
boiling of 40 millimeter f/2 lens this
is<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:11.099> solid<00:00:11.730> metal<00:00:11.910> pancake<00:00:12.690> lens<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.440> feels

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
is a solid metal pancake lens that feels

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.070 
is a solid metal pancake lens that feels
pretty<00:00:14.070> substantial<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:14.849> my<00:00:15.000> hand<00:00:15.299> compare

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
pretty substantial in my hand compare

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.890 
pretty substantial in my hand compare
that<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.710> Canon<00:00:17.039> 40<00:00:17.369> millimeter<00:00:17.699> F<00:00:17.910> 2.8

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
that to the Canon 40 millimeter F 2.8

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.960 
that to the Canon 40 millimeter F 2.8
lens<00:00:19.050> which<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.529> pretty<00:00:20.010> plastic<00:00:20.609> key<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.850> has

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
lens which is pretty plastic key it has

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.410 
lens which is pretty plastic key it has
a<00:00:21.000> fly-by-wire<00:00:21.630> focus<00:00:22.380> ring<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.460> kind<00:00:24.210> of

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
a fly-by-wire focus ring this is kind of

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.170 
a fly-by-wire focus ring this is kind of
a<00:00:24.600> manual<00:00:25.140> lens<00:00:25.680> when<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.220> say<00:00:26.400> kind<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.910> it's

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
a manual lens when I say kind of it's

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.300 
a manual lens when I say kind of it's
because<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.960> aperture<00:00:28.500> ring<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.859> controlled

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
because the aperture ring is controlled

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.609 
because the aperture ring is controlled
to<00:00:29.400> by<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.670> electronics<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.599> camera<00:00:31.140> but

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
to by the electronics of the camera but

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.520 
to by the electronics of the camera but
it's<00:00:31.859> still<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.340> manual<00:00:32.910> focus<00:00:33.360> lens<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.200> focus

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
it's still a manual focus lens the focus

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.700 
it's still a manual focus lens the focus
ring<00:00:34.680> moves<00:00:34.950> very<00:00:35.489> smoothly<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:37.380> feels

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
ring moves very smoothly and it feels

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.369 
ring moves very smoothly and it feels
very<00:00:38.040> solid<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.670> my<00:00:38.760> hand<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.629> let's<00:00:39.660> take<00:00:40.200> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
very solid in my hand so let's take a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.979 
very solid in my hand so let's take a
closer<00:00:40.800> look<00:00:41.219> at<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:42.030> voightlander<00:00:42.540> 40

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
closer look at the voightlander 40

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.410 
closer look at the voightlander 40
millimeter<00:00:43.320> f/2<00:00:44.040> lens<00:00:44.300> setting<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
millimeter f/2 lens setting the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.389 
millimeter f/2 lens setting the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
Voigtlander 40 millimeter f/2 lens and

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.340 
Voigtlander 40 millimeter f/2 lens and
next<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.670> Canon<00:00:48.000> 40<00:00:48.300> millimeter<00:00:48.629> f28

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
next to the Canon 40 millimeter f28

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
next to the Canon 40 millimeter f28
you'll<00:00:49.860> see<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.160> they're<00:00:50.309> roughly<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.149> same

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
you'll see that they're roughly the same

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.360 
you'll see that they're roughly the same
height<00:00:51.899> both<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.590> these<00:00:52.649> lenses<00:00:52.860> fall<00:00:53.219> into

height both of these lenses fall into

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.069 
height both of these lenses fall into
the<00:00:53.460> pancake<00:00:53.940> category<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.690> they're<00:00:54.870> both

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the pancake category and they're both

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.799 
the pancake category and they're both
nice<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.680> petite<00:00:56.120> Voigtlander<00:00:57.149> weighs<00:00:57.420> quite

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
nice and petite Voigtlander weighs quite

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.689 
nice and petite Voigtlander weighs quite
a<00:00:57.840> bit<00:00:58.079> more<00:00:58.289> than<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.800> Canon<00:00:59.129> 40<00:00:59.370> millimeter

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
a bit more than the Canon 40 millimeter

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.840 
a bit more than the Canon 40 millimeter
F<00:00:59.910> 2.8<00:01:00.840> that's<00:01:01.440> because<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:02.280> made<00:01:02.550> out<00:01:02.699> of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
F 2.8 that's because it's made out of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.210 
F 2.8 that's because it's made out of
metal<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.660> nice<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.110> solid<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.040> has<00:01:05.189> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
metal it's nice and solid and it has a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.000 
metal it's nice and solid and it has a
nice<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.790> solid<00:01:06.150> focus<00:01:06.750> ring<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.560> focus<00:01:07.860> ring

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
nice and solid focus ring the focus ring

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.140 
nice and solid focus ring the focus ring
travels<00:01:08.490> 180<00:01:09.479> degrees<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:11.220> lens<00:01:11.580> extends

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
travels 180 degrees and the lens extends

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.630 
travels 180 degrees and the lens extends
just<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> Canon<00:01:13.320> about<00:01:13.710> half<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.460> an

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
just like on the Canon about half of an

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.490 
just like on the Canon about half of an
inch<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.390> canons<00:01:15.780> focus<00:01:16.080> ring<00:01:16.290> is

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
inch the canons focus ring is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.880 
inch the canons focus ring is
fly-by-wire<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.060> don't<00:01:18.509> get<00:01:18.630> any<00:01:18.900> kind<00:01:19.710> of

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
fly-by-wire so you don't get any kind of

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.100 
fly-by-wire so you don't get any kind of
turning<00:01:20.369> your<00:01:20.430> motion<00:01:20.970> unless<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.840> plugged

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
turning your motion unless it's plugged

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.690 
turning your motion unless it's plugged
into<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.409> camera<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.400> lot<00:01:23.549> less

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
into the camera it's a lot less

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
into the camera it's a lot less
satisfying<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.630> then<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.930> nice<00:01:25.110> smooth

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
satisfying and then the nice smooth

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.399 
satisfying and then the nice smooth
action<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.970> boil<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.420> ER<00:01:27.540> lens<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
action of the boil and ER lens the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.870 
action of the boil and ER lens the
voigtländer<00:01:28.890> does<00:01:29.070> feel<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> lot<00:01:29.700> more

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
voigtländer does feel a lot more

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
voigtländer does feel a lot more
substantial<00:01:30.180> than<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.750> Canon<00:01:31.170> 40<00:01:31.530> millimeter

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
substantial than the Canon 40 millimeter

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.600 
substantial than the Canon 40 millimeter
but<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.700> also<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.090> $500<00:01:33.840> lens<00:01:34.170> versus<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.890> $200

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
but it's also a $500 lens versus a $200

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.780 
but it's also a $500 lens versus a $200
lens<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.479> that's<00:01:36.869> kind<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.590> expected<00:01:37.790> it

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
lens so that's kind of to be expected it

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.090 
lens so that's kind of to be expected it
is<00:01:38.850> weird<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.500> fully

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
is weird that this is not a fully

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.010 
is weird that this is not a fully
automatic<00:01:41.610> lens<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.420> instead<00:01:42.780> it's

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
automatic lens and instead it's

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.190 
automatic lens and instead it's
partially<00:01:43.740> automatic<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> very

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
partially automatic but it is a very

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.380 
partially automatic but it is a very
nice<00:01:46.439> feeling<00:01:46.860> piece<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.399> kit<00:01:47.640> compared<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
nice feeling piece of kit compared to

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.830 
nice feeling piece of kit compared to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
that's a pretty handy feature and it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.660 
that's a pretty handy feature and it
makes<00:02:11.760> using<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.330> manual<00:02:12.660> focus<00:02:12.989> lens

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670

makes using the manual focus lens
more<00:02:13.819> convenient<00:02:14.540> on<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:15.200> full<00:02:15.470> frame<00:02:15.620> body<00:02:15.860> I

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
more convenient on a full frame body I

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.430 
more convenient on a full frame body I
found<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.520> f2<00:02:17.030> was<00:02:17.240> fine<00:02:17.569> I<00:02:17.900> was<00:02:18.050> able<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.319> get

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
found that f2 was fine I was able to get

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.900 
found that f2 was fine I was able to get
things<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.800> focused<00:02:19.190> most<00:02:19.459> of<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.700> time

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
things and focused most of the time

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.670 
things and focused most of the time
although<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.569> did<00:02:20.690> slow<00:02:20.870> me<00:02:21.140> down<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.349> little

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
although it did slow me down a little

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.070 
although it did slow me down a little
bit<00:02:21.890> on<00:02:22.069> a<00:02:22.160> crop<00:02:22.849> sensor<00:02:22.880> body<00:02:23.420> it's<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.840> little

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
bit on a crop sensor body it's a little

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.479 
bit on a crop sensor body it's a little
bit<00:02:24.170> trickier<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.530> get<00:02:24.709> things<00:02:24.950> into<00:02:25.220> focus

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
bit trickier to get things into focus

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.850 
bit trickier to get things into focus
and<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.599> found<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:26.959> more<00:02:27.110> convenient<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.650> shoot

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
and I found it more convenient to shoot

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.820 
and I found it more convenient to shoot
at<00:02:27.950> f28<00:02:28.670> or<00:02:28.940> f4<00:02:29.569> when<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:29.870> was<00:02:30.080> outside<00:02:30.260> trying

t really get stuff into focus fast

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.690

here this is a little focusing element

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.149 
here this is a little focusing element
that<00:04:29.759> basically<00:04:30.479> goes<00:04:30.749> on<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.319> the<00:04:31.469> top<00:04:31.499> of<00:04:32.009> the
