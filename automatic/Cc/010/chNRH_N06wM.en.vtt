00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.480
 would like to 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.700
 the big brown ones 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.619
 already fly out of cdc bind for it 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:25.810
 i have a size 12 and kasan b 175 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:28.240
 our utc 70 binds even in russet we 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.250
 start with a reason winding up 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:37.450
 to approach the hook cut the rest 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.320
 From then we tie a driver from 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:45.340
 our mfd flash in pearl 1 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.920
 We double them and bind them 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:53.050
 behind the hook with two 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:57.900
 winds a brown squirrel 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:02.050
 dublin or hare for the body 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.140
 we press on the thread as usual 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.140
 on 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:24.900
 and make us a beautiful one 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:28.020
 peace body caddisflies have 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.940
 relatively thick and big body accordingly 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.160
 can also fly the body of our fly 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.790
 a little thicker and more voluminous 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.790
 fail 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.660
 now I want me thinks the Federal Council 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.320
 real and contracts both strands in the 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.320
 hand with each other 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.970
 and 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.310
 after only one guide 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:14.370
 from frank I fold this again 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:23.280
 you can find them backwards 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:26.910
 Something will be gone now gives brushed fly 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:33.420
 so that from exercise the fine hairs 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:37.500
 and dummies fibers come out now 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:45.900
 we put 3 cdc springs for this size 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:49.100
 make sure that all over each other 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.100
 tips are the same 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.420
 Strip them together now 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:21.700
 integrate it up with 23 coils 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:29.530
 firm developments on the fly 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.530
 now draw our way a bit 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:43.180
 234 firm as we come now we fold the 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:47.620
 cdc fever up with a sharp 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:52.480
 scissors we cut them diagonally from the 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:56.460
 Binde thread is now the supernatant 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.460
 fevers involved 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:06.760
 Now we speak our thread 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:11.310
 by making them appear flat 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.310
 you can feed him great 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:33.189
 and we put in the loop now 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:38.310
 Close a little extra doping unit 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:42.610
 these and above all our thread 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:48.279
 This creates a beam of the 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:52.029
 the band and fibers of the dopings are beautiful 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:59.849
 holds and spreads remove one 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:05:04.479
 little face flat and now 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:06.250
 we wrap around the head this 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:11.129
 darwineum and stripes after everyone 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.129
 winding that backwards away 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:27.430
 arrived at the front we cut these 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:30.939
 a driver who bothers us and with us 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:35.370
 make our less like a beautiful one 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:35.370
 head once 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:46.430
 two times cut off this course and 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.720
 now comes a little one 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:55.010
 Beauty correction the stripes that 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.340
 Doping head backwards away this 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.340
 Out 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:12.730
 something over standing fibers too long 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:17.290
 Let us support a little and finish 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:19.450
 our cdc caddies are easy to fly 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:22.870
 bind the pattern but very effective 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:26.700
 very common as groups pattern for the 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:29.200
 brown caddis fly a super model 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.930
 I wish you much fun after 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.930
 bind as he petri healing new market
