focusing<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.409> contraction<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.650> just

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
focusing on the contraction and just

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.120 
focusing on the contraction and just
lengthening<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.060> shortening<00:01:15.720> his<00:01:16.140> PEC<00:01:16.409> every

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
lengthening and shortening his PEC every

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.950 
lengthening and shortening his PEC every
single<00:01:17.460> time<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.119> he<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> lot<00:01:18.689> stronger

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
single time but he is a lot stronger

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.510

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.640 
than me I got to give him credit where
credit<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.030> due<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.720> always<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.320> working

credit is due but I always like working

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.380 
credit is due but I always like working
out<00:01:22.770> with<00:01:23.040> other<00:01:23.340> people<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.729> are<00:01:23.790> stronger

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
out with other people that are stronger

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.179 
out with other people that are stronger
than<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.720> because<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.140> kind<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.320> forces<00:01:26.040> you

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
than you because it kind of forces you

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.890 
than you because it kind of forces you
to<00:01:26.340> get<00:01:26.790> into<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.030> different<00:01:27.330> mindset<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.750> just

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
to get into a different mindset and just

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.410 
to get into a different mindset and just
do<00:01:28.229> better<00:01:28.470> than<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.950> normally<00:01:29.640> do<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.119> then

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
do better than you normally do and then

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.630 
do better than you normally do and then
after<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.320> did<00:01:31.590> some<00:01:31.619> platinum<00:01:32.159> low<00:01:32.340> bench<00:01:32.520> we

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
after we did some platinum low bench we

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.450 
after we did some platinum low bench we
went<00:01:32.850> over<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.299> did<00:01:33.329> three<00:01:34.049> sets<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.650> incline

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
went over and did three sets of incline

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.039 
went over and did three sets of incline
bench<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.909> since<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.270> started<00:01:36.570> filming<00:01:36.810> these

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
bench and since I started filming these

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.260 
bench and since I started filming these
what<00:01:37.650> I've<00:01:37.770> been<00:01:37.920> trying<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.220> do<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.640> keep<00:01:38.970> my

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
what I've been trying to do is keep my

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.140 
what I've been trying to do is keep my
cut<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.259> my<00:01:40.409> upper<00:01:40.740> form<00:01:41.159> more<00:01:41.700> perpendicular

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
cut of my upper form more perpendicular

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.609 
cut of my upper form more perpendicular
to<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.630> ground<00:01:42.840> because<00:01:42.990> last<00:01:43.259> time<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.560> filmed

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
to the ground because last time I filmed

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.260 
to the ground because last time I filmed
it<00:01:43.979> my<00:01:44.250> hands<00:01:44.430> looked<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.729> little<00:01:44.939> bit<00:01:45.060> too

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
it my hands looked a little bit too

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.910 
it my hands looked a little bit too
close<00:01:45.630> together<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.229> since<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.530> moved<00:01:46.740> them

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
close together and since I moved them

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.830 
close together and since I moved them
out<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.520> little<00:01:47.549> bit<00:01:47.850> I've<00:01:48.479> been<00:01:48.659> getting

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
out just a little bit I've been getting

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.050 
out just a little bit I've been getting
a<00:01:48.899> lot<00:01:49.020> better<00:01:49.170> contraction<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.130> my<00:01:50.490> chest<00:01:50.820> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
a lot better contraction in my chest and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.960 
a lot better contraction in my chest and
then<00:01:51.750> after<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.070> went<00:01:53.189> over<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.700> did<00:01:53.850> an

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
then after that we went over and did an

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.330 
then after that we went over and did an
exercise<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.630> don't<00:01:54.990> normally<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.740> but

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
exercise that I don't normally do but

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.770 
exercise that I don't normally do but
one<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.610> don't<00:01:56.790> even<00:01:56.880> really<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.299> but<00:01:57.570> if

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
one that I don't even really like but if

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.999 
one that I don't even really like but if
I'm<00:01:57.930> working<00:01:58.079> out<00:01:58.259> with<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> buddy<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.829> got<00:01:58.979> to

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
I'm working out with a buddy you got to

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.920 
I'm working out with a buddy you got to
kind<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.610> work<00:01:59.790> in<00:02:00.030> each<00:02:00.360> other's<00:02:00.689> favorite

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
kind of work in each other's favorite

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.780 
kind of work in each other's favorite
exercises<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.369> wanted<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.670> do

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
exercises and you really wanted to do

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.999 
exercises and you really wanted to do
some<00:02:03.060> dumbbell<00:02:03.450> pullovers<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.590> pretty<00:02:04.860> good

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
some dumbbell pullovers it's pretty good

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.560 
some dumbbell pullovers it's pretty good
for<00:02:05.250> your<00:02:05.399> chest<00:02:05.640> but<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.880> personally<00:02:06.420> would

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
for your chest but I personally would

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.139 
for your chest but I personally would
probably<00:02:07.049> usually<00:02:07.469> do<00:02:07.680> incline<00:02:08.489> flyes<00:02:08.849> here

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
probably usually do incline flyes here

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.390 
probably usually do incline flyes here
with<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.629> dumbbell<00:02:09.959> but<00:02:10.530> that's<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:10.950> me<00:02:11.190> you

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
with a dumbbell but that's just me you

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.380 
with a dumbbell but that's just me you
got<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> give<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.819> take<00:02:11.879> when<00:02:12.090> you're<00:02:12.150> working

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
got a give and take when you're working

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.510 
got a give and take when you're working
out<00:02:12.450> with<00:02:12.569> someone<00:02:12.720> else

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
out with someone else

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.070 
out with someone else
and<00:02:13.610> then<00:02:13.730> for<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.090> delt<00:02:14.300> portion<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:14.960> the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
and then for the delt portion of the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.410 
and then for the delt portion of the
workout<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.560> just<00:02:15.830> did<00:02:16.040> some<00:02:16.420> dumbbell

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
workout I just did some dumbbell

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.440 
workout I just did some dumbbell
shoulder<00:02:17.750> press<00:02:17.960> with<00:02:18.290> no<00:02:18.980> back<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:20.150> it's

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
shoulder press with no back so it's

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.640 
shoulder press with no back so it's
basically<00:02:20.780> just<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.110> bench<00:02:21.350> that<00:02:21.440> I'm

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
basically just the bench that I'm

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.140 
basically just the bench that I'm
sitting<00:02:21.920> on<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.490> that<00:02:22.580> really<00:02:22.610> makes<00:02:22.970> it

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
sitting on and that really makes it

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.360 
sitting on and that really makes it
actually<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.570> lot<00:02:23.630> harder<00:02:24.170> than<00:02:24.500> having<00:02:24.650> back

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
actually a lot harder than having back

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.620 
actually a lot harder than having back
behind<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.850> because<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.120> think<00:02:26.180> sometimes

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
behind you because I think sometimes

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.120 
behind you because I think sometimes
it's<00:02:26.810> really<00:02:26.960> easy<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.440> just<00:02:27.620> pin<00:02:27.830> your<00:02:27.980> back

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
it's really easy to just pin your back

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.250 
it's really easy to just pin your back
up<00:02:28.490> against<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.570> can<00:02:29.720> do<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.870> lot<00:02:30.230> more

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
up against it you can do a lot more

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.530 
up against it you can do a lot more
weight<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:30.950> with<00:02:31.130> these<00:02:31.340> just<00:02:32.090> lowered<00:02:32.390> our

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
weight so with these just lowered our

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.900 
weight so with these just lowered our
ego<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.680> little<00:02:33.860> bit<00:02:34.040> lighter<00:02:34.580> weight

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
ego and it a little bit lighter weight

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.810 
ego and it a little bit lighter weight
and<00:02:35.360> yeah<00:02:35.780> with<00:02:36.080> Daniel<00:02:36.920> right<00:02:37.130> here<00:02:37.340> or<00:02:37.520> Thor

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
and yeah with Daniel right here or Thor

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.610 
and yeah with Daniel right here or Thor
some<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.240> you<00:02:38.330> guys<00:02:38.420> called<00:02:38.660> him<00:02:38.720> Thor<00:02:39.080> back

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
some of you guys called him Thor back

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.740 
some of you guys called him Thor back
when<00:02:39.890> he<00:02:40.160> was<00:02:40.370> in<00:02:40.730> some<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.030> my<00:02:41.090> earlier<00:02:41.120> videos

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
when he was in some of my earlier videos

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.990 
when he was in some of my earlier videos
he's<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.080> focusing<00:02:42.590> on<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:43.220> contraction

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
he's just focusing on the contraction

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.910 
he's just focusing on the contraction
every<00:02:44.450> single<00:02:44.780> time<00:02:44.960> it<00:02:45.230> was<00:02:45.320> kind<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.680> mess

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
every single time it was kind of a mess

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.320 
every single time it was kind of a mess
when<00:02:46.160> we<00:02:46.250> were<00:02:46.340> filming<00:02:46.670> this<00:02:46.820> video<00:02:46.970> because

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
when we were filming this video because

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.240 
when we were filming this video because
the<00:02:47.630> gym<00:02:47.870> was<00:02:48.080> super<00:02:48.380> crowded<00:02:48.590> we<00:02:48.890> filmed<00:02:49.160> this

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
the gym was super crowded we filmed this

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.190 
the gym was super crowded we filmed this
on<00:02:49.430> Black<00:02:49.640> Friday<00:02:49.670> in<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.570> morning<00:02:50.990> and<00:02:51.140> I

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
on Black Friday in the morning and I

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.450 
on Black Friday in the morning and I
didn't<00:02:51.440> think<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.620> would<00:02:51.710> be<00:02:51.830> very<00:02:51.950> crowded<00:02:52.340> at

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
didn't think it would be very crowded at

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.980 
didn't think it would be very crowded at
all<00:02:52.610> but<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.150> guess<00:02:53.270> a<00:02:53.300> lot<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.600> people<00:02:53.810> felt

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
all but I guess a lot of people felt

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.440 
all but I guess a lot of people felt
guilty<00:02:54.440> about<00:02:54.680> having<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.490> whole<00:02:55.760> cheat<00:02:56.030> day<00:02:56.210> or

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
guilty about having a whole cheat day or

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.850 
guilty about having a whole cheat day or
whatever<00:02:56.660> wanted<00:02:57.020> to<00:02:57.080> work<00:02:57.260> off<00:02:57.470> some<00:02:57.710> of<00:02:57.740> the
