00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hi girls today i would like to talk to you all 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.400
 my favorite low cost products 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.710
 so I would like to tag 10 products 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.240
 under 10 euros and I find it a cut 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.980
 very very nice to talk about 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.200
 our favorite products that therefore 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.599
 we believe to be very very valid e 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.949
 which at the same time are not expensive 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.840
 so they are cheap also because 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.760
 saving a little something is always good 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.160
 in so many languages they had asked me 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.080
 under the video prince plate that this 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.599
 spikes exact opposite of this video i 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.400
 so my favorite expensive products 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.410
 it seems nice to do both 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.540
 versions because on the one hand it is nice to be able to 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.040
 to save and in any case for and of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.649
 maybe valid products from above 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.570
 antonello fassari get some gifts 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.210
 every now and then to what continues to fall 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.489
 criticized him in this video is 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.140
 however I said 10 photos of 10 euros the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.550
 most products or here are 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.379
 much below 10 euros 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.300
 so they are almost all on the three o 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.710
 four euros more or less the first 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.840
 product in which I would like to speak e 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.059
 this brush and say tris 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.859
 this is a very soft brush that I 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.140
 I should have taken a long time ago 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.730
 and I like it because it's so small 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.920
 you can also put it in a purse 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.140
 travel beauty and not much 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.090
 cumbersome and then I like it because it is 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.189
 nice wide so you can use it 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.140
 both for the cpa and for the blush for 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.909
 illuminating the browser then with a 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.799
 brush you can do all the makeup 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.299
 face so much economic product that I love 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.350
 and so this is the famous one 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.150
 matitone gio eye pencil of mix ny ex 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.729
 how to pronounce it 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.320
 and this is the number 604 milk I will have the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.720
 green the most famous color of the whole 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.880
 gamma and I love it is really beautiful 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.079
 you can use it as a primer you can 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.100
 use it also in food 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.930
 eye 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.640
 I find it a very very valid product 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.130
 and I really like using it as 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.869
 primer because then the eyeshadow fit for 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.939
 throughout the day or evening 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.560
 always talking about pencils one of the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.259
 absolute favorite products one of the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.960
 absolute black favorite pencils is 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.640
 this to which beings and if you follow me 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.439
 since moles the channel still three 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.090
 years ago surely you remember 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.119
 this pencil because I show it 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.250
 always always only she is 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.079
 this ds here and no longer seen in 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.659
 kingdom and why you are deleted anyway 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.409
 the word silver and I know they don't 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.600
 more 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.160
 but I know that they resume 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.110
 the other which is practically identical only 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.850
 who changed the name and find it 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.710
 very good indeed 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.440
 pigmented also writes in the rhyme 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.360
 internal and lasts a long time and as you see him 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.160
 loved it because it has become 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.200
 very small over time but 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.600
 dated in the essence products preferred by 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.210
 this is always illuminating here and this 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.240
 is what I wear today I love it 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.470
 a really good coconut scent 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.090
 paradisiac 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.860
 in addition I really like it because it is one 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.280
 good age pigmentation beautiful 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.870
 face brightness 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.310
 illuminating and more or less all these 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.480
 different colors in these colors 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.670
 can also be used as 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.350
 eye shadows so I find a product 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.360
 very very versatile as I said before 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.280
 at a great price so definitely 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.230
 recommended my money and with friends 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.150
 the thirty parts of debora are preferred 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.770
 images that by now you already know everything 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.900
 very well because Veneto spoke in 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.550
 past I like a lot because they have 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.100
 a beautiful full color even with only one 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.350
 passed and last a long time in color that 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.200
 I 'm wearing this beautiful red here today 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.450
 it's really a beautiful color I love it 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.640
 another product that I love and find 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.610
 very practical this kit is very useful 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.380
 for eyebrows and these two colors e 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.700
 then there is also a small brush who or 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.250
 contact that you don't use though 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.010
 obviously if you want you can use it 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.540
 and I find these two very comfortable 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.940
 eye shadows I really like pigmentation 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.950
 who have the duration because I will have all the 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.130
 day and I really like the color too 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.750
 these two are also used for mine 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.130
 Today's eyebrows let's say you for 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.080
 every day I like to use the 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.150
 lighter color is instead for the evening a 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.280
 the darker one or mix the two 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.930
 together a display case where another product 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.180
 which I used today is this blush 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.920
 knicks and adores blush knicks because they are 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.810
 all very very pigmented at least 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.730
 those that I have been able to lead to since 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.770
 I live in the store are all were very 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.240
 more oriented I took this color 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.730
 because he really found a color 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.940
 gorgeous a beautiful deep pink load 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.080
 turned on that I really love 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.970
 especially beautiful on the dies 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.260
 so if you are more this color is 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.420
 really beautiful 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.430
 obviously among my cheap products 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.040
 favorite could not fail to include 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.380
 the coconut oil you know I love oil 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.830
 coconut and I like to use it both on 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.410
 hair 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.870
 there than on the skin than as a makeup remover a 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.600
 lots of uses and a barattoloni like that 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.120
 costs about 4 euros 4 and something seems to me 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.220
 and they are 200 grams and I assure you that 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.440
 I will use a life measure 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.630
 from lysis and as you see they are not even the 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.430
 half are more or less than a quarter then 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.050
 really lasts a lot is more 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.880
 very very practical product you can 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.160
 using it for so many things is a 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.500
 natural product and has a great honor 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.240
 coconut of course if you love for coconut 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.560
 because he has so many that he doesn't like it 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.600
 if you like coconut, take a look 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.860

 and very soft and in addition it also lasts a 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.560
 long extra you know that snow products 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.390

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.100
