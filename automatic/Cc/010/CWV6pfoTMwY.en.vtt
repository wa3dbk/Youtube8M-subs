00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.359
 good afternoon everybody here we bought this 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.720
 surrounded by deep for far 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.910
 casts but he turned out to be defective here 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.890
 here as you can see it is written 4 grams 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.350
 there is a forest that we need it 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.600
 load it to work correctly but he 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.190
 sinking at all without loading here, look 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.190
 here we are not exposing him at all but he is already 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.899
 drowned if still download something 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.670
 Respectively Tony and Zubcha deep and in 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.390
 in this video we will show how this situation 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.519
 can be fixed in order to float 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.429
 did not sink accordingly need to be reduced 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:03.160
 the weight of his load and for this we need 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:06.729
 get this load from the float take 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.670
 pliers we clamp over the edge of an ogruzka and 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.429
 gently try to hand float if 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.850
 the float rotates a little more 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:18.100
 we twist and ogruzka gets if 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.789
 the float doesn't even move that is 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.270
 Russian sits dead in it then you need 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:27.850
 take a cigarette lighter and here is the edge of the load 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.670
 here you just need to warm up and to 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.390
 melt the glue that holds the load 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.630
 we got as we see the loadout enough 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.159
 long it is made of brass and now 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.159
 we need to try our best and 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.180
 shorten to reduce weight but 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.820
 this must be left 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.939
 length to fix its floats 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.329
 we made a decision to shorten 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.780
 it is exactly in half now approximately 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.229
 we pretend and where we have here the middle and 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.689
 mark the marker 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.719
 it will be the place where we will need 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.300
 cut off 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.540
 after which we clamp our load 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.540
 discs 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.630
 and now on the line we cut off the excess part 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.850
 I will do this boring machine 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.390
 but it can also be done normally 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.390
 hacksaw 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.530
 all now the necessary part is clamped in a vice 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.530
 to remove burrs and make 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:03:15.760
 small notches for better grip 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:03:18.540
 glue from metal to gold was removed now 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.540
 notch 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:48.319
 all now unwind vise get 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:52.549
 our load and now we will be it 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:04:01.670
 stick in the float take super glue 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:04:04.720
 and gently apply the load now 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.720
 insert into the float 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.260
 We insert so that we do not have much 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:21.900
 left 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:24.810
 ogruzka top and sticking loops that 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.790
 Now we are waiting for literally 5 minutes to glue 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:32.010
 completely froze all glue froze 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.260
 we ogruzili float pellets fireplace 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.990
 a small piece of fishing line and now how 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.240
 see he fully works thanks for 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.340
 attention subscribe to our channel 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.640
 watch a lot of interesting video before 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.640
 new meetings
