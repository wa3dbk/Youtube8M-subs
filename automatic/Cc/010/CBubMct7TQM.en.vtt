00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.310
 called tachyon 2 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.789
 those. this feeling there means 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.820

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.570

 have started all new models 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.110
 Well, all all models are turned off 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.180
 tanks of some year I think that with 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:00.109
 the end of last year began here in such 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.109
 here are the pouches deliver inside there here 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.479
 here it is the model it is still 2 somewhere years 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.369
 10 back 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.290
 o May the picture was a model tachyon and 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.670
 famous online store play. 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.869
 take off spent working with maycroft about 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:28.619
 to release another version of this 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:31.439
 knife name tachyon 2 and this knife 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.210
 This is now an exclusive apple store. 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.030
 that is, they bought it, I think that they 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.860
 last 8 somewhere I know November may 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.850
 be got them here it is they have 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.850
 Availability 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.680
 but the first thing 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.220
 the latch is very tight opens 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:55.350
 I just damaged diset fingers 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.560
 This moment here opened such 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.729
 the knife is tanto 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:07.460
 Satin processing in my opinion you are the most 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:10.550
 profitable finish type for macro 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.410
 because all facets are very well manifested 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.160
 which they so masterfully do 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.140
 here is how subtle it is 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:30.769
 danny fake blade is just thinning 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:40.090
 such a detail here is number 12:55 154 7 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:43.910
 blade released the sixth month of the 13th year 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:51.709
 that is, in other words, well, a half can 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:57.530
 carry a sword titanium titanium handle with 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:03:01.150
 such figured cuts here here 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.150
 such as backspacer 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.489
 put on here tanto model model 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.470
 Bowie, that is, but you can rivet it 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.130
 to name 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.350
 there are such curly jars 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:20.390
 instead of backspacer 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:22.090
 I do not know why there can be such as well, not 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.489
 I know maybe 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.650
 banks failed with this form 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.959
 blade 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.959
 could not put there 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:46.340
 here is such a knife from mikro so 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:46.340
