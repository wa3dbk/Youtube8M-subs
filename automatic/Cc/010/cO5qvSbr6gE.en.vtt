think<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.430> total<00:00:35.820> actually<00:00:36.180> has<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> lot<00:00:36.600> more

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780

several reasons but one of the main

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.440

games in this series been at six and a
half<00:00:48.690> points<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.320> think<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:49.950> spread<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.340> just

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
half points I think this spread is just

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.639 
half points I think this spread is just
a<00:00:50.910> little<00:00:51.180> too<00:00:51.300> sharp<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.690> my<00:00:51.989> liking<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
a little too sharp for my liking but the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.680 
a little too sharp for my liking but the
total<00:00:52.920> ha<00:00:53.219> we've<00:00:53.370> heard<00:00:53.550> 198<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> half<00:00:54.539> has

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
total ha we've heard 198 and a half has

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.229

easily<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.070> now<00:01:02.340> four<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> last<00:01:03.180> five

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390

meetings<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.409> series<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.890> also<00:01:05.309> gone

meetings in this series have also gone
over<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> total<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.540> think<00:01:06.780> that's

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
over the total and I think that's

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.050 
over the total and I think that's
exactly<00:01:07.500> where<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.280> need<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.549> go<00:01:08.580> with<00:01:08.880> your

half court with it however it just as a
fitness<00:01:32.369> as<00:01:32.729> efficient<00:01:33.299> as<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.570> Spurs<00:01:33.810> are<00:01:33.960> in

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
fitness as efficient as the Spurs are in

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.630 
fitness as efficient as the Spurs are in
their<00:01:34.290> half<00:01:34.409> for<00:01:34.650> dolphins<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.130> don't<00:01:35.520> think

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
their half for dolphins I don't think

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.859 
their half for dolphins I don't think
it's<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.939> hurt<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> total<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.720> this

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
it's going to hurt the total in this

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.109 
it's going to hurt the total in this
game<00:01:37.079> whatsoever<00:01:37.500> 198<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.579> half<00:01:38.729> was<00:01:38.909> too

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
game whatsoever 198 and a half was too

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.090 
game whatsoever 198 and a half was too
low<00:01:39.299> for<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.570> last<00:01:39.750> two<00:01:39.960> games<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.710> still

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
low for the last two games it's still

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.710 
low for the last two games it's still
too<00:01:41.310> low<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.850> game<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.329> think<00:01:42.600> even

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
too low for this game and I think even

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.300 
too low for this game and I think even
though<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> game<00:01:43.350> seven<00:01:43.770> even<00:01:44.220> though

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
though it's a game seven even though

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.969 
though it's a game seven even though
defense<00:01:44.700> could<00:01:44.909> be<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> little<00:01:45.360> bit<00:01:45.600> more

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
defense could be a little bit more

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.050 
defense could be a little bit more
abundant<00:01:46.979> than<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.670> last<00:01:47.790> two

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
abundant than it was in the last two

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.969 
abundant than it was in the last two
games<00:01:48.299> over<00:01:48.509> one<00:01:49.200> hundred<00:01:49.320> ninety<00:01:49.740> eight<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
games over one hundred ninety eight and

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.429 
games over one hundred ninety eight and
a<00:01:50.040> half<00:01:50.070> point<00:01:50.430> i<00:01:50.549> think<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.060> still<00:01:51.420> once<00:01:52.079> again

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
a half point i think is still once again

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.980 
a half point i think is still once again
the<00:01:52.590> play<00:01:53.119> one<00:01:54.119> day<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.270> think<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.659> said<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the play one day I think like said the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.539 
the play one day I think like said the
