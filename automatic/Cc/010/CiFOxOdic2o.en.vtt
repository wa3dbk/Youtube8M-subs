00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.190

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.370

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.600
 today I bring you a tutorial for the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.789
 version 1.8 in which we will need 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.310
 the jump of the desline block to exit 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.680
 from here and good is a combination of 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.480
 OK buttons are three buttons and now 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.429
 you are going to see how the thing would be but 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.689
 get me out of here and well the only thing 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.369
 we have to do is go up here 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.440
 the stairs are worth it that we have them 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.270
 left hand just start the map 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.770
 and well you will see that they are full of 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.170
 buttons of which we are going to 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.579
 need to press 3 to be able to exit 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.980
 here is worth the map what are you going to have in the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.980
 description and good this map or is 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.590
 let's say machinery comes in handy for 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.570
 create adventure maps and it's good 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.730
 good fun it first thing 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.399
 I'm going to do is throw myself to the block of 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.320
 line we're going to bounce and I'm going to put 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.539
 I'll hold him with torches so you can see him 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.090
 the buttons where after we must 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.020
 click, it's worth, I'm going to see 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.630
 good one would be there another would be here and 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.640
 another one would be ok and there you have the three 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.500
 buttons if we press the three buttons on 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.350
 the right will open here the entrance 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.090
 to leave if you are not worth 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.010
 let's go up again and we're going to press 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.780

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.130
 with which I can not break it 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.840
 worth this on an adventure map not 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.729

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.979
 to catch the jump from the spline block 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.600
