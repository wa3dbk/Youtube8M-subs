 our 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.030
 because I really 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:05.290

 after we added a third cup 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.430
 of butter at room temperature 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.650
 so you can stir here in my 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.130
 mind a little work should be more 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.000
 or less as well as wet sand and 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.730
 we add an egg 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.590
 and we mix another little bit until it is 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:41.080
 uniform as it is smarter after 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.300
 we add a trickle of extract of 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.300
 vanilla and we keep mixing 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.390

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.590
 and if we continue mixing as they knew 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.970

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.350
 about 10 minutes from 10 to 15 minutes 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.660

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.980
 of colors but if you bother them 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.620
 they do not want the colors to be colorful 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:14.370
 cookies in using normal chocolate 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.370
