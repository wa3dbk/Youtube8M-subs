00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.260
A number of universities and communities
are competing to get...

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.180
...new university, satellite campuses.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.480
And I need your help to
convince the province of Ontario...

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.420
...that Markham and York Region
is the best place for York University.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.720
Say Yes to York!

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.800
Say Yes to York!

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.340
York Region, especially Markham
will be able to provide...

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.420
...opportunities for part-time work.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.720
Upon graduation, these same business
can offer full-time employment...

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.760
...for these students.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.120
Say Yes to York!

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.380
I think having a university in Markham...

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.620
is definitely something that
will be great for the community.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.620
It'll provide people with
more job opportunities...

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.620
...and it'll also provide
students with the option of...

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.560
...going to a school
that's closer to home.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.440
Something as a former college student
that went to York University...

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.120
...it was such a haul to
get there every day...

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.640
...that having a York University
campus here would be a great thing.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.100
From all the Firefighters
at Station 97 in Markham...

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.000
Say Yes to York!

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.460
Say Yes to York!

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.700
We are delighted to have
the ideal opportunity...

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.620
...to continue the legacy of innovation...

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.020
...and to realize our aspiration and
identification as York Region's university.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.140
A York University campus in York Region...

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.120
...it means jobs, it means economy,
it means great things for our students.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.200
We've given $25 million
to make this happen.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.520
Say Yes to York!

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.900
Say Yes to York!

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.420
I'm Eric Jolliffe, the chief of
York Regional Police...

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.740
...and as a graduate of York University,
I say, Yes to York!

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.940
Say Yes to York!

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.280
Say Yes to York!

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.900
Say Yes to York!

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.940
There is no area that has a
faster growing population...

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.020
...than the 905...

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.940
...and Markham in particular.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.580
I am delighted to have the opportunity
to say Yes to York!

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.200
I need you to show your support
for York University.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.420
And it's very easy.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.020
It's just the click away.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.800
Go to YestoYork.ca
and tell your political leaders...

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.700
...to say Yes to York!
