00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.229 

interesting<00:02:15.220> sequence<00:02:15.489> here<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:16.000> try<00:02:16.209> and

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
interesting sequence here to try and

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.390 
interesting sequence here to try and
sort<00:02:16.599> out<00:02:16.720> all<00:02:17.050> right<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.800> call<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.280> ice

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
sort out all right so the call the ice

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.690 
sort out all right so the call the ice
is<00:02:18.670> no<00:02:18.849> goal<00:02:19.349> watch<00:02:20.349> it<00:02:20.530> handle<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:20.890> let's<00:02:21.519> see

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
is no goal watch it handle it let's see

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.690 
is no goal watch it handle it let's see
if<00:02:21.760> we<00:02:21.849> have<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.000> different<00:02:22.390> angle<00:02:22.720> here

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
if we have a different angle here

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.130 
if we have a different angle here
the<00:02:24.209> show<00:02:24.450> up<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:24.750> hits<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.020> netting<00:02:25.440> or<00:02:25.530> not

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
the show up and hits the netting or not

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.920 
the show up and hits the netting or not
cross<00:02:27.740> front<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.310> then<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.819> thought<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.840> hit

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
cross front and then I thought it hit

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.630 
cross front and then I thought it hit
off<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.230> netting<00:02:30.500> as<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.770> skipped<00:02:31.190> up<00:02:31.370> at<00:02:31.520> the

referee blew the play dead because he

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.110 
referee blew the play dead because he
did<00:03:13.870> not<00:03:14.010> shoot<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.160> in<00:03:15.250> full<00:03:15.430> doesn't<00:03:15.940> matter

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
it is if you lose sight of the puffing

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.059 
it is if you lose sight of the puffing
you<00:03:19.330> don't<00:03:19.540> know<00:03:19.660> where<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:19.989> is<00:03:20.170> that's<00:03:20.770> the

exactly the referee loses sight of the

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.780 
exactly the referee loses sight of the
puck<00:03:28.780> he<00:03:29.200> doesn't<00:03:29.620> know<00:03:29.739> where<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.069> is<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:30.610> he

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
puck he doesn't know where it is so he

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.820 
puck he doesn't know where it is so he
thinks<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.239> plans<00:03:31.510> love<00:03:31.870> death<00:03:32.140> when<00:03:32.800> they

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
thinks the plans love death when they

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.740 
thinks the plans love death when they
have<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.400> judge<00:03:33.700> now<00:03:33.970> here<00:03:34.239> is<00:03:34.420> whether<00:03:34.599> the

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
have the judge now here is whether the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.780 
have the judge now here is whether the
puck<00:03:34.959> was<00:03:35.140> in<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.410> net<00:03:35.620> before<00:03:36.099> he<00:03:36.550> blew<00:03:36.760> up

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
puck was in the net before he blew up

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.910 
puck was in the net before he blew up
dead<00:03:37.120> or<00:03:37.150> not<00:03:37.360> maybe<00:03:37.630> one<00:03:37.900> more<00:03:38.019> time<00:03:38.319> we<00:03:38.799> can

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
dead or not maybe one more time we can

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.300 
dead or not maybe one more time we can
run<00:03:39.100> it<00:03:39.190> with<00:03:39.340> full<00:03:39.580> sounds<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.950> see<00:03:41.950> exactly

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
run it with full sounds and see exactly

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.759 
run it with full sounds and see exactly
when<00:03:43.120> r<00:03:43.269> is<00:03:43.299> closed<00:03:43.660> exactly<00:03:44.290> when<00:03:44.410> the

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
when r is closed exactly when the

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.170 
when r is closed exactly when the
broads<00:03:44.980> is<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.310> line<00:03:45.489> before<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:46.060> whistle

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
broads is the line before the whistle

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.930 
broads is the line before the whistle
and<00:03:46.480> I<00:03:46.690> think<00:03:47.380> intent<00:03:47.860> lose<00:03:48.250> this<00:03:48.430> plate<00:03:48.700> that

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
and I think intent lose this plate that

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:58.120 
and I think intent lose this plate that
let's<00:03:49.120> listen<00:03:49.480> again<00:03:49.569> as<00:03:50.110> we<00:03:50.290> wrote<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:50.500> pearl

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.100 

I<00:03:58.190> think<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.850> whistle<00:03:59.210> blowing<00:03:59.480> before<00:03:59.960> the

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
I think the whistle blowing before the

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.260 
I think the whistle blowing before the
puck<00:04:00.290> goes<00:04:00.500> into<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:00.890> neck<00:04:01.070> and<00:04:01.580> I<00:04:01.910> think<00:04:02.180> the

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
puck goes into the neck and I think the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.090 
puck goes into the neck and I think the
play<00:04:02.510> they<00:04:02.690> intended<00:04:03.320> to<00:04:03.380> meet<00:04:03.560> alone<00:04:03.770> dead

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:36.210 
but it's the right call one more time
let's<00:05:24.410> listen

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.820 

so<00:05:36.820> it<00:05:37.030> goes<00:05:37.300> up<00:05:37.600> it<00:05:37.780> doesn't<00:05:38.200> matter<00:05:38.320> what<00:05:38.500> it

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
so it goes up it doesn't matter what it

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.920 
so it goes up it doesn't matter what it
is<00:05:38.950> or<00:05:39.190> what<00:05:39.370> it<00:05:39.400> doesn't<00:05:39.880> think<00:05:40.420> about<00:05:40.540> this

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
is or what it doesn't think about this

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.840 
is or what it doesn't think about this
think<00:05:41.170> about<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:42.040> this<00:05:42.340> is<00:05:42.460> an<00:05:42.550> example

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
think about the this is an example

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.390 
think about the this is an example
whether<00:05:43.600> to<00:05:43.810> scramble<00:05:44.260> around<00:05:44.320> the<00:05:44.650> net<00:05:44.830> the

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
whether to scramble around the net the

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.850 
whether to scramble around the net the
puck<00:05:45.700> is<00:05:45.880> laying<00:05:46.180> free<00:05:46.630> in<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:47.170> crease<00:05:47.470> but

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
puck is laying free in the crease but

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.380 
puck is laying free in the crease but
yet<00:05:48.010> the<00:05:48.160> referee<00:05:48.490> blows<00:05:48.700> the<00:05:48.850> play<00:05:49.060> that<00:05:49.240> goes

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
yet the referee blows the play that goes

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.240 
yet the referee blows the play that goes
on<00:05:49.570> the<00:05:49.720> other<00:05:49.840> side<00:05:50.110> they<00:05:50.230> can't<00:05:50.470> see<00:05:50.740> it<00:05:50.830> why

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
on the other side they can't see it why

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.950 
on the other side they can't see it why
did<00:05:51.460> he<00:05:51.550> do<00:05:51.730> it<00:05:51.760> because<00:05:52.270> he<00:05:52.360> can't<00:05:52.630> see<00:05:52.840> the

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
did he do it because he can't see the

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.450 
did he do it because he can't see the
button<00:05:53.110> that's<00:05:53.500> his<00:05:53.740> job<00:05:54.010> when<00:05:54.190> he<00:05:54.220> loses

button that's his job when he loses

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.310 
button that's his job when he loses
sight<00:05:54.910> of<00:05:54.970> it<00:05:55.210> to<00:05:55.510> blow<00:05:55.720> on<00:05:55.780> the<00:05:55.900> play<00:05:56.080> dead

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
sight of it to blow on the play dead
