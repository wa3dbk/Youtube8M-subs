00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.740 

these<00:00:16.990> are<00:00:17.340> diddles<00:00:18.340> okay<00:00:19.300> I<00:00:19.330> have<00:00:19.660> an

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
these are diddles okay I have an

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.630 
these are diddles okay I have an
exercise<00:00:20.080> here<00:00:20.529> that<00:00:20.949> we're<00:00:21.130> about<00:00:21.310> to<00:00:21.460> work

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
exercise here that we're about to work

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.300 
exercise here that we're about to work
on<00:00:21.820> is<00:00:22.060> called<00:00:22.680> isolated<00:00:23.680> diddles<00:00:23.980> because

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
on is called isolated diddles because

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.890 
on is called isolated diddles because
essentially<00:00:24.789> what<00:00:25.090> we're<00:00:25.240> doing<00:00:25.539> is<00:00:25.660> taking

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
essentially what we're doing is taking

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.790 
essentially what we're doing is taking
roles<00:00:27.480> where<00:00:28.480> you<00:00:28.630> have<00:00:28.840> diddles<00:00:29.410> throughout

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
roles where you have diddles throughout

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.960 
roles where you have diddles throughout
the<00:00:29.949> role<00:00:30.189> in<00:00:30.509> isolating<00:00:31.509> those<00:00:31.720> on<00:00:32.519> maybe<00:00:33.519> one

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
the role in isolating those on maybe one

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.750 
the role in isolating those on maybe one
hand<00:00:34.720> or<00:00:34.989> all<00:00:35.350> all<00:00:35.949> the<00:00:36.129> right<00:00:36.309> hands<00:00:36.670> or

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
hand or all all the right hands or

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.060 
hand or all all the right hands or
whatever<00:00:37.059> so<00:00:37.660> if<00:00:37.989> we<00:00:38.050> look<00:00:38.260> at<00:00:38.470> this<00:00:38.620> exercise

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
whatever so if we look at this exercise

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.619 
whatever so if we look at this exercise
basically<00:00:39.760> what<00:00:39.910> you're<00:00:40.000> going<00:00:40.059> to<00:00:40.210> see<00:00:40.360> is<00:00:40.480> in

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
basically what you're going to see is in

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.470 
basically what you're going to see is in
the<00:00:40.720> first<00:00:40.960> measure<00:00:41.290> there's<00:00:42.250> a<00:00:42.699> check

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
the first measure there's a check

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.740 
the first measure there's a check
pattern<00:00:43.720> of<00:00:44.050> for<00:00:44.530> eighth<00:00:44.829> notes<00:00:45.190> okay<00:00:46.150> then<00:00:46.629> we

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
pattern of for eighth notes okay then we

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.510 
pattern of for eighth notes okay then we
do<00:00:46.870> that<00:00:47.019> again<00:00:47.050> so<00:00:47.770> I'm<00:00:47.980> going<00:00:48.010> to<00:00:48.160> take<00:00:48.280> those

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
do that again so I'm going to take those

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.040 
do that again so I'm going to take those
for<00:00:48.789> eighth<00:00:49.000> notes<00:00:49.239> and<00:00:49.390> I'm<00:00:49.480> going<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.660> put<00:00:49.870> a

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
for eighth notes and I'm going to put a

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.830 
for eighth notes and I'm going to put a
diddle<00:00:50.829> on<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.160> first<00:00:51.430> right<00:00:51.730> hand<00:00:52.000> so<00:00:52.510> in<00:00:52.750> the

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
diddle on the first right hand so in the

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.639 
diddle on the first right hand so in the
first<00:00:52.989> measure<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:56.020> I'm<00:00:56.140> going<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:56.320> put<00:00:56.500> a

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
first measure then I'm going to put a

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.959 
first measure then I'm going to put a
diddle<00:00:57.070> on<00:00:57.190> that<00:00:57.340> very<00:00:57.489> first<00:00:57.789> one<00:00:59.460> now<00:01:00.460> again

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
diddle on that very first one now again

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.930 
diddle on that very first one now again
we<00:01:01.480> can<00:01:01.690> do<00:01:01.870> this<00:01:02.079> in<00:01:02.350> two<00:01:02.500> ways<00:01:02.649> same<00:01:03.609> way<00:01:03.760> we

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
we can do this in two ways same way we

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.029 
we can do this in two ways same way we
did<00:01:04.119> with<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.390> exercises<00:01:05.259> we<00:01:05.440> can<00:01:05.619> do<00:01:05.830> a

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:06.039 
did with the exercises we can do a

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:12.389 
did with the exercises we can do a
double<00:01:06.820> stroke<00:01:09.570> or<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:11.740> can<00:01:11.890> do<00:01:12.009> a<00:01:12.039> double

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
double stroke or we can do a double

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.370 
double stroke or we can do a double
bounce<00:01:15.720> now<00:01:16.720> depending<00:01:16.899> on<00:01:17.229> what<00:01:17.350> level

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
bounce now depending on what level

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.490 
bounce now depending on what level
you're<00:01:17.800> at<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:19.360> can<00:01:19.539> work<00:01:19.720> on<00:01:19.869> them<00:01:19.929> as<00:01:20.170> either

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
you're at you can work on them as either

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.740 
you're at you can work on them as either
double<00:01:20.890> strokes<00:01:21.190> are<00:01:21.399> double<00:01:22.149> bounces<00:01:22.539> I

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
double strokes are double bounces I

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.719 
double strokes are double bounces I
really<00:01:23.259> encourage<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.800> beginners<00:01:24.280> out<00:01:24.520> there

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
really encourage the beginners out there

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.580 
really encourage the beginners out there
the<00:01:25.000> people<00:01:25.270> who<00:01:25.509> are<00:01:25.599> first<00:01:25.780> doing<00:01:26.170> this<00:01:26.319> for

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
the people who are first doing this for

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.800 
the people who are first doing this for
the<00:01:26.649> first<00:01:26.679> time<00:01:27.039> to<00:01:27.340> do<00:01:27.490> it<00:01:27.580> as<00:01:27.729> a<00:01:27.759> bounce<00:01:28.149> so

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
the first time to do it as a bounce so

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.589 
the first time to do it as a bounce so
that<00:01:29.020> you<00:01:29.140> get<00:01:29.259> used<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.860> placing<00:01:30.849> a<00:01:30.970> bounce<00:01:31.330> in

00:01:31.589 --> 00:01:31.599 
that you get used to placing a bounce in

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:33.630 
that you get used to placing a bounce in
a<00:01:31.750> specific<00:01:31.989> place<00:01:32.500> within<00:01:33.220> an<00:01:33.489> eighth<00:01:33.610> note

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
a specific place within an eighth note

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.900 
a specific place within an eighth note
pattern<00:01:34.000> so<00:01:34.899> first<00:01:35.470> line<00:01:35.739> it's<00:01:36.399> all<00:01:36.670> on<00:01:36.880> the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
pattern so first line it's all on the

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.150 
pattern so first line it's all on the
right<00:01:37.149> hand<00:01:37.440> check<00:01:38.440> pattern<00:01:38.649> for<00:01:38.979> measure

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
right hand check pattern for measure

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.100 
right hand check pattern for measure
then<00:01:39.550> we<00:01:39.640> put<00:01:39.789> the<00:01:39.849> diddle<00:01:40.270> on<00:01:40.479> the<00:01:40.810> downbeat

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
then we put the diddle on the downbeat

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.190 
then we put the diddle on the downbeat
one<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.250> three<00:01:42.729> then<00:01:43.390> another<00:01:43.660> check<00:01:43.959> pattern

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
one and three then another check pattern

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.839 
one and three then another check pattern
and<00:01:44.590> then<00:01:44.679> in<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.130> last<00:01:45.280> measure<00:01:45.610> of<00:01:45.759> the

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:45.849 
and then in the last measure of the

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:48.240 
and then in the last measure of the
first<00:01:46.030> line<00:01:46.270> diddle<00:01:47.020> on<00:01:47.200> every<00:01:47.619> right<00:01:47.830> hand<00:01:48.069> so

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
first line diddle on every right hand so

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.010 
first line diddle on every right hand so
check<00:01:48.459> it<00:01:48.489> out<00:01:48.670> first<00:01:49.060> line<00:01:49.390> I'm<00:01:49.690> going<00:01:49.720> to<00:01:49.869> put

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
check it out first line I'm going to put

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.229 
check it out first line I'm going to put
my<00:01:50.050> metronome<00:01:50.470> here<00:01:50.800> 70<00:01:51.280> beats<00:01:51.459> a<00:01:51.610> minute<00:01:51.729> play

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:52.239 
my metronome here 70 beats a minute play

00:01:52.239 --> 00:02:03.720 
my metronome here 70 beats a minute play
that<00:01:52.270> first<00:01:52.599> line<00:01:52.750> for<00:01:52.989> you

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.540 

okay<00:02:04.730> pretty<00:02:05.270> simple<00:02:05.660> I<00:02:06.320> had<00:02:07.160> some<00:02:07.340> initial

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
okay pretty simple I had some initial

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.450 
okay pretty simple I had some initial
problems<00:02:08.119> there<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.479> notice<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:09.399> may<00:02:10.399> be

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
problems there you notice I may be

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.040 
problems there you notice I may be
squeezed<00:02:10.850> a<00:02:11.000> little<00:02:11.090> bit<00:02:11.270> too<00:02:11.420> tight<00:02:11.450> for<00:02:11.720> that

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
squeezed a little bit too tight for that

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.320 
squeezed a little bit too tight for that
first<00:02:12.260> diddle<00:02:12.680> okay<00:02:13.130> I<00:02:13.340> can<00:02:13.730> play<00:02:13.880> those<00:02:14.120> as

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
first diddle okay I can play those as

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:25.949 
first diddle okay I can play those as
double<00:02:14.630> strokes<00:02:18.910> or<00:02:19.910> i<00:02:19.970> can<00:02:20.180> plan<00:02:20.480> as<00:02:20.690> bounces

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.410 

okay<00:02:26.959> try-try<00:02:27.950> on<00:02:28.400> both<00:02:28.610> ways<00:02:28.850> just<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.209> kind

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
okay try-try on both ways just to kind

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.420 
okay try-try on both ways just to kind
of<00:02:29.450> get<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.630> hang<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.170> what<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:30.980> like<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.340> do

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
of get the hang of it what I like to do

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.010 
of get the hang of it what I like to do
with<00:02:31.580> my<00:02:31.700> students<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.300> rather<00:02:32.660> than<00:02:32.840> go<00:02:32.990> to

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
with my students is rather than go to

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.260 
with my students is rather than go to
the<00:02:33.320> second<00:02:33.740> line<00:02:33.920> if<00:02:34.250> you're<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.459> beginner<00:02:34.670> I

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
the second line if you're a beginner I

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.990 
the second line if you're a beginner I
haven't<00:02:36.050> played<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.530> first<00:02:36.830> line<00:02:37.100> again<00:02:37.610> this

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
haven't played the first line again this

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.440 
haven't played the first line again this
time<00:02:38.300> starting<00:02:39.110> on<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.320> left<00:02:39.350> hand<00:02:39.709> so<00:02:40.450> play

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
time starting on the left hand so play

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.090 
time starting on the left hand so play
all<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.690> way<00:02:41.720> through<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.080> first<00:02:42.230> line<00:02:42.590> with

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
all the way through the first line with

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:56.320 
all the way through the first line with
the<00:02:43.220> left<00:02:43.250> hand<00:02:43.610> lead<00:02:43.910> check<00:02:44.420> that<00:02:44.600> out<00:02:55.330> okay

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
the left hand lead check that out okay

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.040 
the left hand lead check that out okay
what<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.020> will<00:02:57.170> do<00:02:57.320> is<00:02:57.350> get<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.400> used<00:02:58.670> to

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
what that will do is get you used to

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.240 
what that will do is get you used to
isolating<00:03:00.050> those<00:03:00.170> doodles<00:03:00.560> on<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.800> left<00:03:00.980> hand

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
isolating those doodles on the left hand

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.220 
isolating those doodles on the left hand
first<00:03:01.550> on<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.970> strong<00:03:02.270> beat<00:03:02.570> before<00:03:02.959> we<00:03:03.110> get

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
first on the strong beat before we get

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.390 
first on the strong beat before we get
to<00:03:03.380> something<00:03:03.709> that's<00:03:03.799> a<00:03:03.950> little<00:03:04.040> bit<00:03:04.190> more

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
to something that's a little bit more

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.759 
to something that's a little bit more
difficult<00:03:04.580> so<00:03:05.570> as<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:05.840> work<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.320> up<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.680> you

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
difficult so as you work it up and you

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.009 
difficult so as you work it up and you
kind<00:03:07.220> of<00:03:07.250> got<00:03:07.400> control<00:03:07.549> of<00:03:07.940> that<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.450> speed

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
kind of got control of that and I speed

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.800 
kind of got control of that and I speed
the<00:03:09.140> tempo<00:03:09.440> up<00:03:09.590> here<00:03:09.799> to<00:03:09.920> maybe<00:03:10.420> 110<00:03:11.420> beats<00:03:11.660> a

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
the tempo up here to maybe 110 beats a

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.570 
the tempo up here to maybe 110 beats a
minute<00:03:13.239> work<00:03:14.239> on<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:15.019> quality<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.769> sound<00:03:16.370> that

just did to work on those those double

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.780 
just did to work on those those double
strokes<00:03:50.570> or<00:03:50.780> or<00:03:51.170> you<00:03:51.680> can<00:03:51.799> play<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.040> on<00:03:52.280> a<00:03:52.340> pad

strokes or or you can play it on a pad

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.810 
strokes or or you can play it on a pad
and<00:03:53.060> actually<00:03:53.690> bounce<00:03:53.930> those<00:03:54.140> strokes<00:03:54.380> so<00:03:54.950> I'm

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
and actually bounce those strokes so I'm

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.610 
and actually bounce those strokes so I'm
going<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.030> play<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.180> at<00:03:56.420> 110<00:03:56.930> here<00:03:57.200> I<00:03:57.230> kind<00:03:57.590> of

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
going to play it at 110 here I kind of

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.110 
going to play it at 110 here I kind of
use<00:03:57.799> something<00:03:58.160> a<00:03:58.190> little<00:03:58.310> bit<00:03:58.519> in<00:03:58.670> between<00:03:58.850> I

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
use something a little bit in between I

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.150 
use something a little bit in between I
don't

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
don't

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.589 
don't
stroke<00:04:02.160> every<00:04:02.370> single<00:04:02.790> one<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:02.970> them<00:04:03.180> but<00:04:03.510> i'm

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
stroke every single one of them but i'm

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.960 
stroke every single one of them but i'm
using<00:04:03.900> my<00:04:03.930> back<00:04:04.260> fingers<00:04:04.680> here<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.459> add<00:04:05.940> a

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
using my back fingers here to add a

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.760 
using my back fingers here to add a
little<00:04:06.150> bit<00:04:06.300> of<00:04:06.360> quality<00:04:06.870> behind<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.410> second

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
little bit of quality behind that second

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.570 
little bit of quality behind that second
bounce<00:04:07.950> so<00:04:08.610> here's<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.300> whole<00:04:09.480> exercise<00:04:10.580> at

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
bounce so here's the whole exercise at

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:35.150 
bounce so here's the whole exercise at
110<00:04:32.240> okay<00:04:33.240> so<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:34.320> takes<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.770> little<00:04:34.889> bit<00:04:35.040> of

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
110 okay so it takes a little bit of

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.040 
110 okay so it takes a little bit of
time<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.580> get<00:04:35.700> used<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.360> play<00:04:36.540> that<00:04:36.780> right

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
time to get used to to play that right

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.690 
time to get used to to play that right
in<00:04:37.169> tempo<00:04:37.560> you<00:04:37.979> might<00:04:38.130> have<00:04:38.220> noticed<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:38.580> I

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
in tempo you might have noticed that I

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.550 
in tempo you might have noticed that I
fell<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.270> little<00:04:39.419> bit<00:04:39.600> behind<00:04:39.750> tempo<00:04:41.780> on<00:04:42.780> that

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
fell a little bit behind tempo on that

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.180 
fell a little bit behind tempo on that
left-hand<00:04:44.210> diddle<00:04:45.210> pattern<00:04:45.600> it<00:04:46.470> takes<00:04:47.130> a

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
left-hand diddle pattern it takes a

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.980 
left-hand diddle pattern it takes a
little<00:04:47.310> time<00:04:47.580> so<00:04:47.639> isolate<00:04:48.240> each<00:04:48.479> one<00:04:48.780> of<00:04:48.810> those

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
little time so isolate each one of those

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.900 
little time so isolate each one of those
those<00:04:49.560> drag<00:04:49.919> measures<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:52.220> play<00:04:53.220> just<00:04:53.669> that

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
those drag measures and play just that

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.670 
those drag measures and play just that
for<00:04:54.210> a<00:04:54.240> while<00:04:54.389> with<00:04:54.540> your<00:04:54.720> metronome<00:04:55.020> if<00:04:55.290> you

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
for a while with your metronome if you

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.740 
for a while with your metronome if you
have<00:04:55.800> problems<00:04:56.220> keeping<00:04:56.580> up<00:04:56.729> every<00:04:57.360> single

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
have problems keeping up every single

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
those measures with the metronome then

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.790 
those measures with the metronome then
back<00:05:03.060> it<00:05:03.270> down<00:05:03.450> a<00:05:03.510> little<00:05:03.840> bit<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.229> know<00:05:04.260> take

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
back it down a little bit you know take

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:20.210 
back it down a little bit you know take
it<00:05:04.830> at<00:05:05.190> 90<00:05:05.729> beats<00:05:05.940> a<00:05:06.120> minute<00:05:06.240> or<00:05:18.830> okay<00:05:19.830> there's
