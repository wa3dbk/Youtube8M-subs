00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 next we will observe a series of tests to compare the normal water 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.420
 against the micro water 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.120
 for which we will use a series of conventional tools that 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.879
 will allow you to easily observe the properties of these different waters 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:19.099
 to start we will submerge three water flowers in three different types 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:23.779
 normal water mineral water and alkaline water 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.779
 the flora in normal water withers rapidly 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.239
 while the flower in the mineral water stays a little more compared 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.680
 against a flower theme that is alkaline water 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.000
 that maintains all its properties 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.250
 and it has stayed much cooler 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.840
 up close we observe how the flower in the normal water has dried 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.380
 while the flower in the mineral water 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.090
 try to stay a little longer 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.810
 but there is no comparison against the flower that has been submerged in the 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.280
 alkaline water 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.440
 we can easily give their characteristics and we realize that 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 this water without any problem preserves life 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.000
 to observe and measure the molecular size of this water 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.690
 we submerged two tea bags 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.480
 the bag in the micro water dissolves rapidly due to the small 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.670
 molecular clusters that this water contains compared to the normal water that 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.200
 it takes more time 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.290
 we can boil two glasses of water one of micro water and the other of water 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.260
 normal 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.050
 we can easily see how the passage containing the micro-water starts to boil 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.750
 accelerated 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.280
 if we freeze them the same thing happens at the center we can observe a thermometer 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.190
 that clearly marks the temperature 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.430
 the glass with normal water remains relatively stable 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.850
 as the molecular clusters and the molecular space of the micro water is 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.730
 less 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.080
 we watch with the minutes 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.040
 as the step that contains the micro water explodes immediately 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.970
 so preserving the flowers experiment 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.740
 later that of the tea bags 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.560
 later the derby of the water and finally that of the freezing we give ourselves 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.060
 realize that this water is completely different
