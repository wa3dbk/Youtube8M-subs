00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.440
 if he said you from giuseppe agozzino 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.560
 we are here with lg optimus cipro we talk 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.320
 of the tablet at home lg concerning the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.290
 series of focus we have made on 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.970
 this product we realized 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.410
 which we did not realize as the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.899
 our tradition 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.290
 the focus where we show how it is 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:33.899
 insert the sim the microsd the battery 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.520
 how to mount all the ambaradan and therefore 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.800
 as our tradition we do 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.930
 see the phone separated in yours 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.600
 essential parts back cover 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.510
 of course you can also use 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.699
 a protective outer cover this 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.969
 ready and the battery cover from 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.739
 3,140 milan per hour microsim i micro sd 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.559
 we have two specimens we have a 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.749
 ultra fast 32gb ultra specimen 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.100
 we look at everything specifically we talk about 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.379
 a suitable product that we must already have 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.159
 reviewed and we also have a manufacturer 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.960
 64gb from kingston in this case 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.090
 each specimen belonging precisely to the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.880
 sdxc family 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.210
 so the upper segment will be ours 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.520
 try to test how they work indeed 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.280
 let's see directly how it is 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.690
 insert into our 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.680
 little laugh at this point of 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.600
 make some space 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.970
 you must essentially concentrate them in the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.920
 bottom of the phone I would say it is 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.880
 also in focus 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.950
 so us with a single hand not 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.310
 because we are children in aprÃ¬ so we do 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.010
 see that it is as easy as inserting them 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.120
 let's just see how it all 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.120
 manages to act 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.840
 the angle must be facing the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.190
 bass 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.050
 we come to let you appreciate it on 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.850
 I see the preview screen of the room 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.470
 therefore I deduce it is easily visible 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:22.890
 for you once you reach 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:26.610
 inserting the product with note 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.070
 your micro sd your micro sim e 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.140
 go then to insert the package 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.620
 battery and proceed precisely 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.620
 all'accezione 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.690
 in this case it will not be the first 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.500
 ignition simply because precisely 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:55.260
 we have already put it into operation and point 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.120
 by mistake we did not carry out the 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.670
 clip as our habit at the beginning 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.590
 precisely of our focus in this case 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.050
 read sk telecom 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.090
 however the initial animation starts 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:11.610
 just this case dyed pink 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.050
 come in practice to ascension 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:23.700
 of your terminal then succeed 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:27.030
 quietly manage yours 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.739
 device easily remembers 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.720
 precisely this is the Korean variant for 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.640
 regarding the first ignition the 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.680
 very traditional first ignition that 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.709
 it is always realized with android then 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.020
 asks him what you want to connect to 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.840
 essentially ask for inclusion 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.340
 of the google account as such precisely 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.709
 how was the place synchronized to 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.470
 contact the rest of the aradam 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.900
 so it is absolutely traditional in 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.690
 this case we are not going to talk about it and 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.830
 let's go to turn it on from 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.959
 let's say from scratch why we think the 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.730
 customer could buy himself a 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.320
 the first such product 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.080
 switch on to enter credentials 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.120
 access to your google account not 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.650
 that maybe connect to your wifi 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.940
 according to us it is quietly able 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.410
 to do it 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.989
 having said that anyway we did it to you 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.440
 see how it fits as it works 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.060
 precisely the initial start as you see is 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.019
 even quick phone boot 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.090
 same 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.040
 at this point your 5 inches e 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.350
 half for cats quietly egypt 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.450
 usable already while we are in this 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.450
 position we show you anyway 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.390
 that within the settings yes 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:44.620
 can then safely proceed to 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:47.500
 selection of what interests you most 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.940
 you see everything flows in a manner 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.610
 quiet regarding 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.670
 the storage we have already entered 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.610
 the 64 gigabyte baby we make you 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:01.810
 see that the sd card is bottom space 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:04.810
 total 59 0 1 gigabyte available 59 0 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.800
 1 gigabyte in this case you have anyway 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.480
 already twenty plentiful of space and 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.090
 your documents your sources 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.340
 video all the traditional tracking 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.840
 of documents that you could bring 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.960
 transocean in this case for example 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.120
 total space 23.3 gigabytes as you see 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.250
 they are more or less divided between 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.490
 applications pictures half a jig of 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.100
 imagine something as audio something 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.470
 how varied and ultimately available 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.590
 in the phone's integrated memory there 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.930
 there are still 20 2 gb of material that 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.020
 then it is just the movie or file 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.580
 word on the phone makes no difference to 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.620
 regarding the functionality of the 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.330
 64 GB sd card 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.580
 as you can see, it works 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.460
 so absolutely fluid this of a 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.490
 black can guarantee you unused of 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.870
 micro sdxc then the new generation 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.110
 what is now the current one 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.310
 generation of high microsd cards 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.410
 capacity 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.470
 the demo on the first start and the insertion 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.810
 it was initial so it ends the 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.670
 your mobile phone is absolutely 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.360
 usable bono was good navigation 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.320
 good use of our excellent ride 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.330
 in total freedom 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.440
 the demo ends I thank you 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.150
 attention 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.980
 follow us on pigs oven on the verge 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.090
 info and everyone is sure my motivated 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.220
 for us we are on all the main ones 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.510
 platforms so we can stay 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.070
 easily in contact and you 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.050
 promptly updated on what 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.040
 we publish a greeting for you there 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.580
 sees a rest lineup from giuseppe 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.580
 little boy
