on<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.590> Suunto<00:00:38.280> core<00:00:39.050> in<00:00:40.520> this<00:00:41.520> off<00:00:41.790> with<00:00:42.149> this

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
on the Suunto core in this off with this

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.880 
on the Suunto core in this off with this
50<00:00:42.930> orange<00:00:43.260> strap<00:00:44.180> this<00:00:45.180> version<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.620> core

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
50 orange strap this version of the core

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.420 
50 orange strap this version of the core
is<00:00:47.210> basically<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.480> same<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:49.559> what<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.920> get<00:00:50.190> if

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
is basically the same as what you get if

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.689 
is basically the same as what you get if
you<00:00:50.579> were<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.850> order<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.559> all-black<00:00:52.699> military

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.970 
you were to order the all-black military
version<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.840> only<00:00:54.960> difference<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.680> that

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
version so the only difference is that

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.099 
version so the only difference is that
that<00:00:56.309> all-black<00:00:57.030> version<00:00:57.090> would<00:00:57.719> come<00:00:57.960> with

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
that all-black version would come with

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.000 
that all-black version would come with
the<00:00:58.260> exact<00:00:58.590> same<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:01.980> exact<00:01:02.340> same<00:01:02.579> case<00:01:04.010> same

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the exact same the exact same case same

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.969 
the exact same the exact same case same
the<00:01:05.369> same<00:01:05.519> style<00:01:05.909> casing<00:01:06.380> but<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.590> would<00:01:07.799> have

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the same style casing but it would have

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.850 
the same style casing but it would have
the<00:01:08.340> black<00:01:08.760> straps<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:10.200> everything<00:01:10.740> with

so with this black face

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.539 
so with this black face
unlike<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.890> Suunto<00:01:23.780> ambit<00:01:24.780> which<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.549> synthos

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
unlike the Suunto ambit which is synthos

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.899 
unlike the Suunto ambit which is synthos
new<00:01:26.880> model<00:01:28.070> this<00:01:29.070> face<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.729> not

up<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:33.800> scuffed<00:02:34.250> up<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:35.240> really<00:02:35.960> didn't

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
up and scuffed up and I really didn't

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.170 
up and scuffed up and I really didn't
want<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:36.920> know<00:02:37.070> have<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.610> deal<00:02:37.760> with<00:02:37.940> that

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
want to you know have to deal with that

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.530 
want to you know have to deal with that
so<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:38.510> decided<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.230> get<00:02:39.440> myself<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:40.940> screen

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
so I decided to get myself a screen

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.330 
so I decided to get myself a screen
protector<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.410> can<00:02:42.650> actually<00:02:42.770> see<00:02:43.070> this

protector so you can actually see this

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.360 
protector so you can actually see this
like<00:02:43.490> a<00:02:43.610> plastic<00:02:44.030> film<00:02:45.190> around<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:48.370> watch

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
like a plastic film around the watch

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.550 
like a plastic film around the watch
face<00:02:49.670> yeah<00:02:50.260> sorry<00:02:51.260> about<00:02:51.290> that<00:02:51.880> now<00:02:53.320> it<00:02:54.320> has<00:02:54.530> a

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
face yeah sorry about that now it has a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.670 
face yeah sorry about that now it has a
couple<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.450> different<00:02:56.450> modes<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.320> first

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
couple of different modes so this first

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.450 
couple of different modes so this first
screen<00:02:58.070> is<00:02:58.100> shows<00:02:58.700> time<00:02:59.770> the<00:03:00.770> next<00:03:01.190> screen

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
screen is shows time the next screen

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.270 
screen is shows time the next screen
shows<00:03:03.550> see<00:03:04.550> if<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:04.760> can<00:03:04.940> get<00:03:05.120> focus<00:03:06.040> but<00:03:07.040> the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
shows see if I can get focus but the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.140 
shows see if I can get focus but the
next<00:03:07.550> queen<00:03:08.050> basically<00:03:09.050> shows<00:03:10.150> your

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
next queen basically shows your

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.970 
next queen basically shows your
altimeter<00:03:11.810> of<00:03:12.260> barometer

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
altimeter of barometer

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.870 
altimeter of barometer
right<00:03:13.550> now<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:13.790> have<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.510> set<00:03:14.900> as<00:03:15.740> a<00:03:15.880> four

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
right now I have it to set as a four

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.630 
right now I have it to set as a four
barometer<00:03:17.390> function<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.620> if<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.040> see<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.400> says

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
barometer function so if you see it says

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.080 
barometer function so if you see it says
the<00:03:19.880> temperature<00:03:20.210> is<00:03:20.450> 26<00:03:20.870> degrees<00:03:22.090> Celsius

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
the temperature is 26 degrees Celsius

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:34.420 
the temperature is 26 degrees Celsius
and<00:03:23.330> the<00:03:24.700> air<00:03:25.700> pressure<00:03:26.030> is<00:03:27.520> 1010<00:03:28.520> HPA<00:03:32.830> and<00:03:33.830> you

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
and the air pressure is 1010 HPA and you

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.580 
and the air pressure is 1010 HPA and you
can<00:03:34.610> see<00:03:34.850> that<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.390> air<00:03:35.930> pressure<00:03:35.990> has<00:03:36.500> been

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
can see that the air pressure has been

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.010 
can see that the air pressure has been
pretty<00:03:36.890> constant<00:03:37.490> over<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.910> last<00:03:39.610> few<00:03:40.610> hours

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
pretty constant over the last few hours

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.450 
pretty constant over the last few hours
now<00:03:42.020> the<00:03:42.080> last<00:03:44.080> menu<00:03:45.080> setting<00:03:45.470> is<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.980> compost

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
now the last menu setting is the compost

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.540 
now the last menu setting is the compost
mode<00:03:47.800> now<00:03:49.390> that<00:03:50.390> number<00:03:50.870> had<00:03:51.170> is<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:52.100> your

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
mode now that number had is the your

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.640 
mode now that number had is the your
bearing<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:53.860> going<00:03:54.860> 300<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:55.940> say<00:03:56.690> 10<00:03:57.230> degrees

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
bearing so going 300 and say 10 degrees

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:04.210 
bearing so going 300 and say 10 degrees
too<00:03:58.640> many<00:03:58.820> degrees<00:04:02.050> Northwest<00:04:03.070> right<00:04:04.070> now

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
too many degrees Northwest right now

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.540 
too many degrees Northwest right now
that's<00:04:04.550> what<00:04:04.760> we're<00:04:04.910> pointing<00:04:05.270> yeah<00:04:06.400> you<00:04:07.400> can

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
also there's also an indicator on the

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.930 
also there's also an indicator on the
watch

that<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:17.079> can<00:04:17.290> use<00:04:17.640> to<00:04:18.640> line<00:04:18.910> up<00:04:19.150> your<00:04:19.180> bezel

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
that you can use to line up your bezel

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.990 
that you can use to line up your bezel
with<00:04:20.049> so<00:04:20.410> trying<00:04:21.190> to<00:04:21.220> get<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.549> camera<00:04:21.970> to

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
with so trying to get the camera to

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.200 
with so trying to get the camera to
focus<00:04:22.260> it's<00:04:23.260> not<00:04:23.440> doing<00:04:23.740> too<00:04:23.950> good<00:04:23.980> job<00:04:24.340> but<00:04:25.090> if

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
focus it's not doing too good job but if

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.660 
focus it's not doing too good job but if
you<00:04:25.330> see<00:04:25.630> this<00:04:26.290> an<00:04:26.650> indicator<00:04:27.160> that<00:04:27.250> moves

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
you see this an indicator that moves

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.330 
you see this an indicator that moves
around<00:04:27.850> right<00:04:28.210> here<00:04:28.560> see<00:04:29.560> if<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:29.890> move<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.310> here

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
around right here see if I move it here

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.580 
around right here see if I move it here
you<00:04:31.200> there<00:04:32.200> you<00:04:32.260> go

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
you there you go

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.040 
you there you go
you<00:04:33.040> see<00:04:33.220> that<00:04:33.370> little<00:04:33.610> indicator<00:04:33.910> now<00:04:34.780> if<00:04:34.930> you

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
you see that little indicator now if you

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.070 
you see that little indicator now if you
line<00:04:35.320> that<00:04:35.620> up<00:04:35.680> with<00:04:36.130> this<00:04:36.730> indicator<00:04:37.210> that's

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
line that up with this indicator that's

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.060 
line that up with this indicator that's
where<00:04:38.380> North<00:04:38.740> is<00:04:38.980> so<00:04:39.700> that's<00:04:40.240> this<00:04:41.070> rotating

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
where North is so that's this rotating

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.250 
where North is so that's this rotating
bezel<00:04:42.280> that's<00:04:42.850> that's<00:04:43.180> what<00:04:43.390> it's<00:04:43.540> for<00:04:43.630> so<00:04:44.020> you

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
bezel that's that's what it's for so you

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.120 
bezel that's that's what it's for so you
would<00:04:44.650> rotate<00:04:44.890> it<00:04:45.310> and<00:04:45.490> line<00:04:46.330> up<00:04:47.130> that

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
would rotate it and line up that

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.060 
would rotate it and line up that
indicator<00:04:48.700> with<00:04:49.540> north<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:50.650> that<00:04:50.800> you<00:04:50.919> know

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
indicator with north so that you know

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.750 
indicator with north so that you know
where<00:04:51.310> North<00:04:51.550> is<00:04:52.650> now<00:04:53.650> if<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:53.950> go<00:04:54.100> back<00:04:54.310> to<00:04:54.340> the

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
where North is now if I go back to the

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.890 
where North is now if I go back to the
first<00:04:55.570> mode<00:04:56.669> you<00:04:57.669> have<00:05:00.120> your<00:05:01.120> clock<00:05:01.419> I<00:05:01.630> have

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
first mode you have your clock I have

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.940 
first mode you have your clock I have
date<00:05:02.230> date<00:05:03.100> date<00:05:03.250> right<00:05:03.880> there<00:05:04.120> I<00:05:04.390> have<00:05:05.290> the

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
date date date right there I have the

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.020 
date date date right there I have the
seconds<00:05:06.430> right<00:05:06.580> there

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
seconds right there

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.130 
seconds right there
I<00:05:07.060> have<00:05:09.270> belief<00:05:10.270> this<00:05:10.720> is<00:05:11.070> second<00:05:12.070> time<00:05:12.250> zone

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
I have belief this is second time zone

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:19.460 
I have belief this is second time zone
this<00:05:14.140> is<00:05:14.350> Sun<00:05:14.669> sunrise<00:05:15.669> sunset<00:05:18.030> stopwatch

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
this is Sun sunrise sunset stopwatch

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.640 
this is Sun sunrise sunset stopwatch
timer<00:05:20.470> and<00:05:21.060> nothing<00:05:22.060> so<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:23.110> only<00:05:23.229> complaint

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
timer and nothing so the only complaint

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.130 
timer and nothing so the only complaint
I<00:05:23.740> have<00:05:23.950> is<00:05:23.979> that<00:05:24.250> for<00:05:25.240> watch<00:05:25.479> is<00:05:25.690> such<00:05:25.870> a<00:05:25.900> big

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
I have is that for watch is such a big

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.520 
I have is that for watch is such a big
face<00:05:26.410> I<00:05:26.680> wished<00:05:27.010> it<00:05:27.280> used<00:05:27.790> more<00:05:28.690> real<00:05:29.140> estate

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
face I wished it used more real estate
