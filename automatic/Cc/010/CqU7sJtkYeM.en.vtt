shaped<00:00:13.049> pans<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:14.210> why<00:00:15.210> don't<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.420> tell<00:00:15.660> us

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
shaped pans and why don't you tell us

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.630 
shaped pans and why don't you tell us
how<00:00:15.960> they<00:00:16.139> all<00:00:16.260> come<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.650> be<00:00:16.680> sure<00:00:17.190> it's<00:00:17.490> a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
how they all come to be sure it's a

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.849 
how they all come to be sure it's a
really<00:00:17.940> interesting<00:00:18.240> process<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.710> all

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
really interesting process and it all

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.950 
really interesting process and it all
starts<00:00:20.189> out<00:00:20.340> with<00:00:20.490> an<00:00:20.640> artist<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.720> clay

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
starts out with an artist and a clay

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.099 
starts out with an artist and a clay
sculpture<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:23.430> get<00:00:23.730> from<00:00:24.449> an<00:00:24.570> artist<00:00:24.960> a

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
sculpture so we get from an artist a

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.750 
sculpture so we get from an artist a
clay<00:00:25.410> sculpt<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:26.099> we<00:00:26.189> think<00:00:26.400> our<00:00:26.519> pan

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
clay sculpt of what we think our pan

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.910 
clay sculpt of what we think our pan
will<00:00:26.939> look<00:00:27.119> like<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.630> when<00:00:27.960> we<00:00:28.080> get<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.470> it's

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
will look like and when we get this it's

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.589 
will look like and when we get this it's
on<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> plywood<00:00:29.670> board<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.269> actually

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
on a plywood board and it's actually

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.620 
on a plywood board and it's actually
usually<00:00:31.019> still<00:00:31.320> wet<00:00:31.560> clay<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.790> what<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.300> is

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
usually still wet clay so what we do is

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.630 
usually still wet clay so what we do is
we<00:00:33.840> cover<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.440> layer<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.770> plastic<00:00:35.130> wrap

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
we cover it with a layer of plastic wrap

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.260 
we cover it with a layer of plastic wrap
and<00:00:35.910> then<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.630> form<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.380> foil<00:00:37.950> pan<00:00:38.340> out<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and then we form a foil pan out of the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.670 
and then we form a foil pan out of the
sculpt<00:00:39.780> because<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.170> don't<00:00:40.320> want<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.530> damage

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
sculpt because you don't want to damage

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.190 
sculpt because you don't want to damage
this<00:00:40.980> exactly<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.180> cover<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.079> that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
this exactly so so we cover it so that

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.080 
this exactly so so we cover it so that
we<00:00:43.290> don't<00:00:43.410> ding<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.890> up<00:00:44.010> because<00:00:44.430> if<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.910> is

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
we don't ding it up because if this is

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.110 
we don't ding it up because if this is
okay<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.780> move<00:00:45.989> forward<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:46.950> make<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> very

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
okay we move forward so we make a very

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.720 
okay we move forward so we make a very
sturdy<00:00:48.510> foil<00:00:49.320> pan<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.950> four<00:00:50.190> or<00:00:50.280> five<00:00:50.460> layers

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
sturdy foil pan with four or five layers

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.000 
sturdy foil pan with four or five layers
of<00:00:50.969> heavy-duty<00:00:51.239> aluminum<00:00:51.539> foil<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.620> we

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
of heavy-duty aluminum foil and we

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.220 
of heavy-duty aluminum foil and we
actually<00:00:53.190> bake<00:00:53.579> right<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.149> pan<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:55.079> that

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
actually bake right in that pan so that

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.959 
actually bake right in that pan so that
we<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.469> see<00:00:55.649> what<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> shape<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.760> to

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
we can see what the shape is going to

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.119 
we can see what the shape is going to
look<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.500> see<00:00:58.829> if<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
look like and so that we can see if the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.310 
look like and so that we can see if the
capacity<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.820> going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.359> correct<00:01:00.660> because

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
capacity is going to be correct because

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.280 
capacity is going to be correct because
all<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.890> Welton's<00:01:02.399> shaped<00:01:02.699> pans<00:01:03.180> are<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
all of Welton's shaped pans are the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.160 
all of Welton's shaped pans are the
correct<00:01:04.619> capacity<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> single<00:01:06.170> double

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
correct capacity for a single double

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.460 
correct capacity for a single double
layer<00:01:07.350> box<00:01:07.740> cake<00:01:08.100> mix<00:01:08.130> okay<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:10.200> first

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
layer box cake mix okay so this first

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.440 
layer box cake mix okay so this first
bake<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> really<00:01:11.369> good<00:01:11.520> indication<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.270> if

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
bake is a really good indication of if

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.960 
bake is a really good indication of if
we're<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> right<00:01:13.110> track<00:01:13.530> now<00:01:14.400> if<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.820> is

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
we're on the right track now if this is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.609

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
cake it then moves to this is called a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.710 
cake it then moves to this is called a
vac<00:01:22.950> form<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.210> piece<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.420> plastic

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
vac form and it's a piece of plastic

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.200 
vac form and it's a piece of plastic
that<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.070> welded<00:01:26.340> basically<00:01:27.000> from

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
that is that is welded basically from

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.450 
that is that is welded basically from
this<00:01:27.450> clay<00:01:27.750> sculpt<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.979> repeat<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
this clay sculpt and we repeat the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.660 
this clay sculpt and we repeat the
process<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:30.180> make<00:01:30.390> another<00:01:30.689> foil<00:01:31.500> pan<00:01:31.860> from

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
process we make another foil pan from

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.450 
process we make another foil pan from
the<00:01:33.180> back<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.860> bake<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.250> can

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the back of this and we bake as you can

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.429 
the back of this and we bake as you can
certainly<00:01:36.150> couldn't<00:01:36.570> bake<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.900> there<00:01:37.200> no<00:01:37.320> no

certainly couldn't bake in there no no

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.170 
certainly couldn't bake in there no no
your<00:01:37.680> kitchen<00:01:38.040> would<00:01:38.189> stink<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.820> would<00:01:38.970> melt

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
your kitchen would stink it would melt

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.990 
your kitchen would stink it would melt

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
so yeah so we do a foil pan but this is

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.280 
so yeah so we do a foil pan but this is
good<00:01:42.180> because<00:01:42.360> we're<00:01:42.689> able<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.110> actually

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
good because we're able to actually

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.399 
good because we're able to actually
measure<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.070> capacity<00:01:44.729> inside<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.899> VAT<00:01:46.079> form

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
measure the capacity inside the VAT form

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.660 
measure the capacity inside the VAT form
and<00:01:46.649> make<00:01:46.829> sure<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.579> to

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and make sure that it's going to

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.240 
and make sure that it's going to
perfectly<00:01:48.149> fit<00:01:48.270> your<00:01:48.810> double<00:01:49.140> layer<00:01:49.320> cake<00:01:49.950> mix

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
perfectly fit your double layer cake mix

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.330 
perfectly fit your double layer cake mix
okay<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.630> from<00:01:51.869> here<00:01:51.960> if<00:01:52.590> everything

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
okay and then from here if everything

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.429 
okay and then from here if everything
again<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.939> lining<00:01:54.360> up<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.720> correct<00:01:55.079> size

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
again is lining up it's the correct size

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.700 
again is lining up it's the correct size
good<00:01:56.219> even<00:01:56.670> browning<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.390> cake<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.619> know

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
good even browning on the cake you know

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.069 
good even browning on the cake you know
everything's<00:01:59.159> baked<00:01:59.399> evenly<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.630> move<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.049> a

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
everything's baked evenly we move to a

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.550 
everything's baked evenly we move to a
short<00:02:01.439> run<00:02:01.700> which<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.909> very<00:02:03.509> small<00:02:04.079> number

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
short run which is a very small number

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.800 
short run which is a very small number
of<00:02:04.590> pans<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.280> our<00:02:05.399> tool<00:02:05.610> din<00:02:05.820> metal<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.360> from

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
of pans that our tool din metal and from

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.779 
of pans that our tool din metal and from
here<00:02:06.990> we<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.320> actually<00:02:07.500> bake<00:02:07.950> directly<00:02:08.700> in

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
here we can actually bake directly in

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.639 
here we can actually bake directly in
the<00:02:08.879> pan<00:02:09.060> which<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.360> finally<00:02:09.899> much<00:02:10.379> better

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
the pan which is finally much better

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.050 
the pan which is finally much better
than<00:02:10.860> much<00:02:11.099> better<00:02:11.340> than<00:02:11.520> aluminum<00:02:11.940> foil

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
than much better than aluminum foil

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.570 
than much better than aluminum foil
now<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.770> said<00:02:14.800> it's<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.160> short<00:02:15.400> run

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
now this like I said it's a short run

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.220 
now this like I said it's a short run
just<00:02:15.820> so<00:02:15.970> that<00:02:16.150> if<00:02:16.360> there<00:02:16.570> if<00:02:16.690> we<00:02:16.840> do<00:02:16.960> encounter

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
just so that if there if we do encounter

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.100 
just so that if there if we do encounter
a<00:02:17.410> difficulty<00:02:18.100> we<00:02:18.640> haven't<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.540> know<00:02:19.660> broken

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
a difficulty we haven't you know broken

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.500 
a difficulty we haven't you know broken
the<00:02:20.350> bank<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.010> speak<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.670> we<00:02:22.180> can<00:02:22.360> make

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
the bank so to speak and we can make

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.530 
the bank so to speak and we can make
changes<00:02:22.990> again<00:02:23.470> now<00:02:24.460> in<00:02:24.580> this<00:02:24.700> particular<00:02:24.940> pan

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
changes again now in this particular pan

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.740 
changes again now in this particular pan
which<00:02:25.750> is<00:02:25.900> one<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.170> our<00:02:26.350> it's<00:02:26.890> an<00:02:26.980> older<00:02:27.220> pan

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
which is one of our it's an older pan

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.930 
which is one of our it's an older pan
the<00:02:28.750> first<00:02:29.020> time<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.440> was<00:02:29.560> told<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.370> did<00:02:30.820> not

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
the first time it was told it did not

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.390 
the first time it was told it did not
have<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.300> foot<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:31.960> for<00:02:32.680> some<00:02:32.860> reason<00:02:33.250> we

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
have this foot and for some reason we

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.280 
have this foot and for some reason we
didn't<00:02:33.670> realize<00:02:34.030> until<00:02:34.330> we<00:02:34.660> got<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.870> this

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
didn't realize until we got to this

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.740 
didn't realize until we got to this
point<00:02:35.770> that<00:02:36.580> when<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:36.820> put<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.180> on<00:02:37.330> your<00:02:37.570> oven

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
point that when you put it on your oven

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.620 
point that when you put it on your oven
shelf<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.740> was<00:02:38.980> not<00:02:39.220> laying<00:02:39.490> flat<00:02:39.910> so<00:02:40.240> the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
shelf it was not laying flat so the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.170 
shelf it was not laying flat so the
batter<00:02:40.900> wasn't<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:42.010> know<00:02:42.100> flowing<00:02:42.700> evenly

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
batter wasn't you know flowing evenly

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.720 
batter wasn't you know flowing evenly
and<00:02:43.800> there's<00:02:44.800> always<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.100> chance<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.640> it

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
and there's always a chance that it

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.910 
and there's always a chance that it
could<00:02:45.910> have<00:02:46.000> tipped<00:02:46.300> out<00:02:46.959> oops

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
could have tipped out oops

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.940 
could have tipped out oops
okay<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:48.910> before<00:02:49.420> anything<00:02:49.900> else<00:02:50.170> was<00:02:50.410> done<00:02:50.620> we

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
okay so before anything else was done we

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.630 
okay so before anything else was done we
retooled<00:02:51.520> with<00:02:52.330> this<00:02:52.630> foot<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.400> when<00:02:54.550> you

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
retooled with this foot so that when you

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.730 
retooled with this foot so that when you
put<00:02:54.850> it<00:02:54.940> on<00:02:55.030> your<00:02:55.180> oven<00:02:55.420> rack<00:02:55.630> that's<00:02:56.170> nice<00:02:56.440> and
