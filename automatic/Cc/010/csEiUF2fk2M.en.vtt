so<00:02:20.750> they're<00:02:21.750> able<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.140> spend<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.760> way

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
so they're able to spend that in the way

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.790 
so they're able to spend that in the way
that<00:02:24.180> they<00:02:24.300> need<00:02:24.330> rather<00:02:24.930> than<00:02:25.230> giving<00:02:25.530> food

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
that they need rather than giving food

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.640 
that they need rather than giving food
directly<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:27.209> gives<00:02:27.450> much<00:02:27.660> more<00:02:27.720> longevity<00:02:28.050> so

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
directly it gives much more longevity so

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.640 
directly it gives much more longevity so
