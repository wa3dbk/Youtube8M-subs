00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.130
 well after being as we are already 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.160
 since Saturday trying to rescue the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.509
 part that is not burning the biggest 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.059
 possible because this morning there has been 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.289
 a sudden deflagration that has caused 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:34.409
 someone 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.930
 all this is in here behind and that is 

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:39.149
 let's say the situation better than we are 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.620
 can pose is to say at the end I was 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.589
 doing everything below for now 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.949
 several days and it was a continuous risk the 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:48.750
 that the one that was submitting people 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.930
 so right now what we have is 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.540
 an already broad declared game and what 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.290
 we are doing is to protect everything that 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.489
 there is around that is still 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.939
 and that is slowly consuming 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.939
 and layers of would still stop the situation 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.170
 if not, it is not impossible, it is impossible 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.480
 we have there a gigantic volume there is no 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.430
 possibility to remove in case of 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.430
 remove we would make it much bigger from the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.480
 problem then do not proceed one in 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.160
 direct sciences 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.580
 we have to be controlling that that 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.990
 fire is not going around 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.910
 cook it there the time you leave 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.770
 consuming that is what we have to 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.060
 do now and that's where we are now 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.060
 same teaching all the efforts 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.460
 because on average there has been a 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.300
 a number of people between 8 and 15 as 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.350
 there is now at night there is something less 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.940
 for tonight we have foreseen that 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.060
 have two endowments working now 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.610
 same we have three and I think it's 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.240
 enough to keep controlled this 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.240
 game that we have 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.050
 who else maybe the bother is saying 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.180
 here we do not have a set of tires 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.160
 that are generating sector here if everything 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.830
 nor anything in wood of more dry wood 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.200
 that burns with little smoke as it can 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.590
 observe then the principle can be 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.400
 that then at night the wind meat and 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.400
 So, maybe you think maybe a 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.640
 a greater spread of smoke flush with 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.709
 ground or maybe not that it's a bit annoying 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.739
 but really in terms of toxicity 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.810
 none because in dry wood in which 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.700
 there is no problem of toxicity is 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.409
 plus the annoyance that may occur 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.019
 what but right now for example that is 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.879
 blowing a more or less constant wind 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.920
 it is doing that not that in 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.920
 principle in the sewer that the most 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.030
 nearby smoke is not even appreciated 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.030
 there is hardly any
