00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.120 
so this is the micro studio camera 4k so
you<00:00:16.390> can<00:00:16.510> do<00:00:16.600> live<00:00:16.810> productions<00:00:17.470> and<00:00:17.800> really

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130

what<00:00:18.279> we<00:00:18.369> wanted<00:00:18.580> to<00:00:18.640> make<00:00:18.789> is<00:00:18.910> a<00:00:18.939> very<00:00:19.270> small

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
what we wanted to make is a very small

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.779 
what we wanted to make is a very small
intimate<00:00:20.289> camera<00:00:20.800> that<00:00:20.980> wasn't<00:00:21.310> necessarily

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
intimate camera that wasn't necessarily

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.250 
intimate camera that wasn't necessarily
like<00:00:21.970> a<00:00:22.000> big<00:00:22.270> rig<00:00:22.570> that's<00:00:22.810> going<00:00:22.990> to<00:00:23.050> come<00:00:23.170> up

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
like a big rig that's going to come up

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.859 
like a big rig that's going to come up
in<00:00:23.380> your<00:00:23.410> face<00:00:23.680> so<00:00:23.980> if<00:00:24.040> you<00:00:24.189> doing<00:00:25.000> a<00:00:25.150> intimate

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
in your face so if you doing a intimate

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.810 
in your face so if you doing a intimate
shot<00:00:26.230> and<00:00:26.470> you<00:00:26.529> want<00:00:26.650> to<00:00:26.740> put<00:00:26.919> a<00:00:27.160> camera<00:00:27.579> on<00:00:27.730> a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
shot and you want to put a camera on a

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.460 
shot and you want to put a camera on a
bookshelf<00:00:28.029> kind<00:00:28.630> of<00:00:28.689> hitting<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:28.990> way<00:00:29.140> you

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
bookshelf kind of hitting the way you

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.140 
bookshelf kind of hitting the way you
can<00:00:29.619> do<00:00:29.740> that<00:00:29.890> you<00:00:30.099> can<00:00:30.130> have<00:00:30.400> it<00:00:30.520> rigged<00:00:30.759> up<00:00:30.939> in

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
can do that you can have it rigged up in

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.840 
can do that you can have it rigged up in
the<00:00:31.270> top<00:00:31.779> of<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:32.019> studio<00:00:32.439> and<00:00:32.769> have<00:00:33.460> them<00:00:33.730> you

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
the top of the studio and have them you

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.430 
the top of the studio and have them you
can<00:00:33.970> see<00:00:34.120> here<00:00:34.300> we<00:00:34.390> have<00:00:34.420> an<00:00:34.600> expansion<00:00:35.170> port

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
can see here we have an expansion port

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.740 
can see here we have an expansion port
so<00:00:35.650> you<00:00:35.680> can<00:00:35.860> actually<00:00:36.010> have<00:00:36.370> this<00:00:36.750> protocol

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
so you can actually have this protocol

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.509 
so you can actually have this protocol
put<00:00:37.989> out<00:00:38.110> so<00:00:38.350> that<00:00:38.470> you<00:00:38.530> can<00:00:38.710> do<00:00:38.830> it<00:00:39.010> wirelessly

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
put out so that you can do it wirelessly

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.850 
put out so that you can do it wirelessly
and<00:00:40.300> you<00:00:40.449> can<00:00:40.570> send<00:00:40.809> up<00:00:40.960> whether<00:00:41.650> you're<00:00:41.769> going

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
and you can send up whether you're going

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.910 
and you can send up whether you're going
to<00:00:41.980> do<00:00:42.040> a<00:00:42.070> pan-tilt-zoom<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.559> on<00:00:44.800> this

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
to do a pan-tilt-zoom and on this

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.500 
to do a pan-tilt-zoom and on this
expansion<00:00:45.309> port<00:00:45.670> you<00:00:45.730> can<00:00:45.850> actually<00:00:46.000> hook<00:00:46.300> on

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
expansion port you can actually hook on

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.350 
expansion port you can actually hook on
the<00:00:46.629> b4<00:00:47.110> lens<00:00:47.650> as<00:00:48.399> you<00:00:48.550> can<00:00:48.670> see<00:00:48.910> it<00:00:49.000> does<00:00:49.149> not

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
the b4 lens as you can see it does not

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.510 
the b4 lens as you can see it does not
have<00:00:49.539> a<00:00:49.570> monitor<00:00:50.050> on<00:00:50.200> it<00:00:50.410> but<00:00:50.980> what<00:00:51.129> we<00:00:51.280> come<00:00:51.489> up

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
have a monitor on it but what we come up

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.209 
have a monitor on it but what we come up
with<00:00:51.700> here<00:00:52.030> now<00:00:52.270> is<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:52.660> video<00:00:53.559> assist<00:00:53.710> so

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
with here now is the video assist so

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.590 
with here now is the video assist so
this<00:00:54.370> is<00:00:54.489> a<00:00:54.520> 5<00:00:54.850> inch<00:00:55.260> 1920<00:00:56.260> x<00:00:57.100> 1080<00:00:57.309> HD<00:00:57.910> screen

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
this is a 5 inch 1920 x 1080 HD screen

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.319 
this is a 5 inch 1920 x 1080 HD screen
it's<00:00:59.530> all<00:00:59.680> touch<00:00:59.920> screen<00:00:59.980> and<00:01:00.609> then<00:01:01.239> you

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
it's all touch screen and then you

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.580 
it's all touch screen and then you
actually<00:01:01.510> would<00:01:01.780> have<00:01:01.840> a<00:01:01.989> monitor<00:01:02.410> if<00:01:02.500> you

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
actually would have a monitor if you

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.810 
actually would have a monitor if you
want<00:01:02.770> to<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.010> you<00:01:03.039> can<00:01:03.190> do<00:01:03.280> all<00:01:03.309> your<00:01:03.579> settings

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
want to and you can do all your settings

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.719 
want to and you can do all your settings
in<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.210> monitor<00:01:04.570> here<00:01:04.600> I<00:01:05.110> think<00:01:06.100> primarily<00:01:06.280> a

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
in the monitor here I think primarily a

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.760 
in the monitor here I think primarily a
black<00:01:07.180> magic<00:01:07.600> what<00:01:07.750> we<00:01:07.840> try<00:01:08.050> to<00:01:08.080> do<00:01:08.320> is<00:01:08.470> get<00:01:08.619> the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
black magic what we try to do is get the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.790 
black magic what we try to do is get the
products<00:01:09.399> out<00:01:09.580> inexpensive<00:01:10.360> as<00:01:10.479> we<00:01:10.660> can<00:01:10.899> to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
products out inexpensive as we can to

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.680 
products out inexpensive as we can to
the<00:01:11.890> mass<00:01:12.070> public<00:01:12.580> so<00:01:13.060> whether<00:01:13.270> you're<00:01:13.509> in
