00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.799 
first I want to point out that on these
two<00:00:08.370> spots<00:00:08.580> right<00:00:08.849> here<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.510> where<00:00:09.690> the

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
two spots right here this is where the

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.930 
two spots right here this is where the
hidden<00:00:10.050> Tesla's<00:00:10.440> goes<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.950> can't<00:00:11.580> see<00:00:11.820> it

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
hidden Tesla's goes I can't see it

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.780 
hidden Tesla's goes I can't see it
because<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.480> not<00:00:12.630> my<00:00:12.809> base<00:00:13.019> none<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.559> my

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
because it is not my base none of my

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.070 
because it is not my base none of my
accounts<00:00:14.790> are<00:00:14.880> townhall<00:00:15.330> 7<00:00:15.360> right<00:00:15.750> now<00:00:15.870> but

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.170 
accounts are townhall 7 right now but
this<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.350> Teresa's<00:00:16.830> base<00:00:17.039> umm<00:00:17.340> she's<00:00:18.000> why<00:00:18.119> it

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
this is Teresa's base umm she's why it

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.849 
this is Teresa's base umm she's why it
has<00:00:18.330> one<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.660> highest<00:00:19.020> rated<00:00:19.320> bases<00:00:19.710> on

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
has one of the highest rated bases on

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.439

the<00:00:19.890> clash<00:00:20.189> tactics<00:00:20.699> app<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.090> wanted<00:00:21.330> to

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
the clash tactics app so I wanted to

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.269 
the clash tactics app so I wanted to
show<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.630> guys<00:00:21.720> as<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.800> can<00:00:22.949> see<00:00:23.100> it's

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
show you guys as you can see it's

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.950 
show you guys as you can see it's
definitely<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.760> really<00:00:24.330> formidable<00:00:24.600> base

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
definitely a really formidable base

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.810 
definitely a really formidable base
there's<00:00:25.680> not<00:00:25.830> really<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.160> sure<00:00:26.400> way<00:00:26.550> you're

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
there's not really a sure way you're

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.419 
there's not really a sure way you're
going<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.000> attack<00:00:27.390> maybe<00:00:27.900> through<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.980> cannon

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
going to attack maybe through the cannon

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.769 
going to attack maybe through the cannon
spot<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.240> don't<00:00:30.390> want<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.599> attack

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
spot but you don't want to attack

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.179 
spot but you don't want to attack
through<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> straight<00:00:31.320> top<00:00:31.710> or<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.949> straight

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
through the straight top or the straight

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.030 
through the straight top or the straight
bottom<00:00:32.369> or<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.910> might<00:00:33.090> get<00:00:33.210> destroyed<00:00:33.950> so<00:00:34.950> as

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
bottom or you might get destroyed so as

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.280 
bottom or you might get destroyed so as
you<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.250> see<00:00:35.309> if<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.239> had<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.570> make<00:00:36.750> any<00:00:36.870> changes

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
you can see if I had to make any changes

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.080 
you can see if I had to make any changes
to<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> base<00:00:37.680> overall<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.520> an<00:00:38.610> awesome<00:00:38.760> base

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
to the base overall it's an awesome base

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.220 
to the base overall it's an awesome base
it's<00:00:39.329> gonna<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.690> hard<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.050> steal

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
it's gonna be really hard to steal

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.560 
it's gonna be really hard to steal
golden<00:00:40.590> elixir<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:41.160> might<00:00:41.820> change<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.360> fact

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
golden elixir I might change the fact

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.350 
golden elixir I might change the fact
that<00:00:42.690> she<00:00:42.989> has<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.760> build<00:00:44.760> her<00:00:44.879> SATs<00:00:45.149> walled

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
that she has to build her SATs walled

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.970 
that she has to build her SATs walled
off<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.079> don't<00:00:46.230> think<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.559> big<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
off but I don't think it's that big of a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.500 
off but I don't think it's that big of a
deal<00:00:47.160> she<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.730> think<00:00:48.000> she's<00:00:48.149> doing<00:00:48.360> that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
deal she I think she's doing that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.930 
deal she I think she's doing that
because<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:49.440> guides<00:00:49.710> units<00:00:50.250> away<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.850> they

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
because it guides units away and they

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.010 
because it guides units away and they
might<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> break<00:00:51.510> through<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.840> wall

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
might have to break through that wall

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.360 
might have to break through that wall
get<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> Builder<00:00:52.710> Hut<00:00:52.860> then<00:00:53.039> break<00:00:53.190> through

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
get the Builder Hut then break through

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.400 
get the Builder Hut then break through
another<00:00:53.579> wall<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> bad<00:00:54.870> idea<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
another wall so it's not a bad idea to

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.110 
another wall so it's not a bad idea to
have<00:00:55.710> them<00:00:55.890> walled<00:00:56.100> off<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.670> again<00:00:56.940> they're

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
have them walled off but again they're

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.340 
have them walled off but again they're
not<00:00:57.149> something<00:00:57.719> you're<00:00:57.840> really<00:00:58.079> trying<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
not something you're really trying to

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.830 
not something you're really trying to
protect<00:00:58.710> all<00:00:59.550> right<00:00:59.670> besides<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.239> it's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
protect all right besides that it's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.360 
protect all right besides that it's
definitely<00:01:01.109> an<00:01:01.379> awesome<00:01:01.469> base<00:01:01.859> again<00:01:02.190> you're

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
definitely an awesome base again you're

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.740 
definitely an awesome base again you're
only<00:01:02.520> doing<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.910> if<00:01:03.090> you're<00:01:03.180> farming<00:01:03.600> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
only doing this if you're farming and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.880 
only doing this if you're farming and
you<00:01:03.870> don't<00:01:04.049> care<00:01:04.260> about<00:01:04.350> trophies<00:01:04.619> because

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you don't care about trophies because

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.560 
you don't care about trophies because
the<00:01:05.189> Town<00:01:05.339> Hall<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.700> unprotected<00:01:06.540> on

the Town Hall is unprotected on

the Town Hall is unprotected on
unprotected<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> bottom<00:01:07.950> sorry<00:01:08.479> and<00:01:09.479> I

unprotected on the bottom sorry and I

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.120 
unprotected on the bottom sorry and I
might<00:01:09.780> take<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.080> builder<00:01:10.380> Hut<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> very

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
might take that builder Hut on the very

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.100 
might take that builder Hut on the very
bottom<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.700> scoot<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.299> very<00:01:12.600> top

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.950 
bottom and scoot it to the very top
just<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.830> case<00:01:14.689> someone's<00:01:15.689> trying<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
just in case someone's trying to

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.240 
just in case someone's trying to
three-star<00:01:16.380> her<00:01:16.500> base<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.920> they<00:01:16.979> forget

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
three-star her base and they forget

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.410 
three-star her base and they forget
about<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> top<00:01:17.939> but<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.210> not

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
about it on the top but that's not

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.820 
about it on the top but that's not
really<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> big<00:01:18.840> deal<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.200> base<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.590> nearly

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
really a big deal this base is nearly

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.649 
really a big deal this base is nearly
perfect<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.820> definitely<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> best

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659
