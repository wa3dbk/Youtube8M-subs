problem<00:00:39.250> it's<00:00:40.250> with<00:00:40.430> continuity<00:00:40.760> in<00:00:41.090> the

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
problem it's with continuity in the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.840 
problem it's with continuity in the
first<00:00:42.050> original<00:00:42.680> Star<00:00:42.890> Wars<00:00:42.920> trilogy<00:00:43.160> which<00:00:43.700> I

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
first original Star Wars trilogy which I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.610 
first original Star Wars trilogy which I
still<00:00:44.060> contend<00:00:44.270> is<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.630> only<00:00:44.780> true<00:00:45.200> original

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
still contend is the only true original

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.700 
still contend is the only true original
Star<00:00:45.830> Wars<00:00:45.860> trilogy<00:00:46.900> we<00:00:47.900> already<00:00:48.230> see<00:00:48.680> the

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
Star Wars trilogy we already see the

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.030 
Star Wars trilogy we already see the
force<00:00:49.220> ghost<00:00:49.490> of<00:00:49.790> obi-wan<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:50.870> it<00:00:51.440> isn't<00:00:51.800> Ewan

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
force ghost of obi-wan and it isn't Ewan

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.230 
force ghost of obi-wan and it isn't Ewan
McGregor<00:00:52.390> it's<00:00:53.390> Sir<00:00:53.780> Alec<00:00:54.080> Guinness<00:00:54.760> so<00:00:55.760> there

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
McGregor it's Sir Alec Guinness so there

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.200 
McGregor it's Sir Alec Guinness so there
would<00:00:56.420> be<00:00:56.450> a<00:00:56.810> continuity<00:00:57.620> problem<00:00:58.520> I<00:00:58.700> believe

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
would be a continuity problem I believe

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.920 
would be a continuity problem I believe
granted<00:01:00.020> I'm<00:01:00.260> nitpicking<00:01:00.920> yes<00:01:01.550> yes<00:01:01.850> but<00:01:02.630> to<00:01:02.780> go

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
granted I'm nitpicking yes yes but to go

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.890 
granted I'm nitpicking yes yes but to go
into<00:01:03.110> Star<00:01:03.620> Wars<00:01:03.770> Episode<00:01:03.860> 7<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:04.580> say<00:01:05.030> now<00:01:05.420> be

into Star Wars Episode 7 and say now be
wants<00:01:06.170> force<00:01:06.440> ghost<00:01:06.740> got<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.490> little<00:01:07.700> bit<00:01:07.880> of

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
wants force ghost got a little bit of

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.090 
wants force ghost got a little bit of
nip/tuck<00:01:08.150> done<00:01:08.660> got<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.050> face<00:01:09.380> pulled<00:01:09.740> up<00:01:09.920> and

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
nip/tuck done got the face pulled up and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.220 
nip/tuck done got the face pulled up and
lifted<00:01:10.400> a<00:01:10.490> bit<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:10.940> now<00:01:11.120> he<00:01:11.570> looks<00:01:11.720> like<00:01:11.900> human

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
lifted a bit and now he looks like human

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.990 
lifted a bit and now he looks like human
reger<00:01:12.410> again<00:01:12.680> I<00:01:12.860> think<00:01:13.340> that's<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.670> little<00:01:13.820> bit

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
reger again I think that's a little bit

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.080 
reger again I think that's a little bit
of<00:01:14.030> an<00:01:14.150> inconsistency<00:01:14.720> so<00:01:15.260> I<00:01:15.700> well<00:01:16.700> part<00:01:16.970> of<00:01:17.030> me

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
of an inconsistency so I well part of me

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.150 
of an inconsistency so I well part of me
would<00:01:17.240> geek<00:01:17.480> out<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.870> say<00:01:17.990> yay<00:01:18.170> obi-wan<00:01:18.980> is

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
would geek out to say yay obi-wan is

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.210 
would geek out to say yay obi-wan is
there<00:01:19.660> it's<00:01:20.660> really<00:01:20.960> not<00:01:21.050> that<00:01:21.110> important<00:01:21.830> he

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
there it's really not that important he

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.280 
there it's really not that important he
played<00:01:22.460> his<00:01:22.640> role<00:01:22.670> in<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.120> saga<00:01:23.360> there<00:01:24.170> would

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
played his role in the saga there would

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.890 
played his role in the saga there would
be<00:01:24.320> continuity<00:01:24.680> problems<00:01:25.040> I<00:01:25.510> hope<00:01:26.510> we<00:01:26.690> don't

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
be continuity problems I hope we don't

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.899 
be continuity problems I hope we don't
and<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:27.200> don't<00:01:27.530> think<00:01:27.680> we<00:01:27.860> will<00:01:28.040> Sonya<00:01:28.700> that's

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
and I don't think we will Sonya that's

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.370 
and I don't think we will Sonya that's
just<00:01:29.060> me<00:01:29.120> and<00:01:29.240> yours<00:01:29.420> do<00:01:29.480> you<00:01:29.540> think<00:01:29.720> I'm<00:01:30.080> so

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
just me and yours do you think I'm so

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.899 
just me and yours do you think I'm so
torn<00:01:30.650> on<00:01:30.830> this<00:01:30.860> issue<00:01:31.130> because<00:01:31.550> on<00:01:31.670> one<00:01:31.700> hand

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
torn on this issue because on one hand

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.000 
torn on this issue because on one hand
sure<00:01:32.420> continuity<00:01:33.050> is<00:01:33.200> important<00:01:33.620> to<00:01:33.710> me<00:01:33.830> but

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
sure continuity is important to me but

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.830 
sure continuity is important to me but
on<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.400> other<00:01:34.520> hand<00:01:34.610> obi-wan<00:01:35.300> is<00:01:35.600> one<00:01:35.720> of<00:01:35.780> the

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
on the other hand obi-wan is one of the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.050 
on the other hand obi-wan is one of the
best<00:01:35.990> characters<00:01:36.380> ever<00:01:36.650> so<00:01:37.220> I'm<00:01:37.490> really<00:01:37.820> torn

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
best characters ever so I'm really torn

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.060 
best characters ever so I'm really torn
I<00:01:38.330> think<00:01:38.780> that<00:01:38.930> I<00:01:38.960> would<00:01:39.140> probably<00:01:39.320> forgive

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
I think that I would probably forgive

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.160 
I think that I would probably forgive
the<00:01:40.370> certain<00:01:40.670> liberties<00:01:40.820> they<00:01:41.240> took<00:01:41.510> if<00:01:41.720> they

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
the certain liberties they took if they

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.230 
the certain liberties they took if they
brought<00:01:42.409> him<00:01:42.560> back<00:01:42.590> because<00:01:43.070> you<00:01:43.790> know<00:01:43.909> many

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
brought him back because you know many

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.480 
brought him back because you know many
of<00:01:44.360> us<00:01:44.510> don't<00:01:45.260> really<00:01:45.560> credit<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.040> prequels

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
of us don't really credit the prequels

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.000 
of us don't really credit the prequels
as<00:01:46.880> being<00:01:47.360> a<00:01:47.479> part<00:01:47.720> of<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:48.170> saga<00:01:48.350> we<00:01:48.620> love<00:01:48.800> so

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
as being a part of the saga we love so

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.610 
as being a part of the saga we love so
much<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:49.820> I'm<00:01:50.330> kind<00:01:50.659> of<00:01:50.720> split<00:01:51.020> if<00:01:51.229> he<00:01:51.320> wasn't
