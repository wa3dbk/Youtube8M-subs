there on the driveshaft to the engine we

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.420 
there on the driveshaft to the engine we
had<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.960> take<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> side<00:01:40.380> cover<00:01:40.680> off<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
now we had to take that off it just made

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.700 
now we had to take that off it just made
it<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> little<00:01:54.450> bit<00:01:54.630> easier<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.110> get<00:01:55.259> down<00:01:55.439> into

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.440 
tank with it off made it a little bit
easier<00:02:07.049> once<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.680> get<00:02:07.920> both<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.000> 13

way<00:02:30.990> doesn't<00:02:31.170> fall<00:02:31.470> down<00:02:31.680> since<00:02:31.950> it's

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
way doesn't fall down since it's

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.160 
way doesn't fall down since it's
connected<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.700> diff<00:02:32.910> then<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.840> just<00:02:33.990> pull

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
connected to the diff then you just pull

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.540 
connected to the diff then you just pull
the<00:02:34.260> differential<00:02:34.770> back<00:02:34.920> about<00:02:35.160> an<00:02:35.280> inch<00:02:35.400> and

you<00:05:04.840> switch<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.230> socket<00:05:05.560> over<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:05.800> other

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
you switch the socket over the other

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.130 
you switch the socket over the other
side<00:05:06.160> to<00:05:06.340> press<00:05:06.580> that<00:05:06.790> and<00:05:07.030> cap<00:05:07.419> far<00:05:07.780> enough<00:05:07.960> to

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
side to press that and cap far enough to

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:20.480 
side to press that and cap far enough to
put<00:05:08.290> the<00:05:08.380> c-clip<00:05:08.770> on<00:05:08.950> the<00:05:09.280> other<00:05:09.430> side

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:32.330 

okay<00:05:21.490> let's<00:05:22.180> check<00:05:22.270> it

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.200 

just<00:05:32.970> like<00:05:33.090> that

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.659 

you<00:05:36.510> can<00:05:36.630> see<00:05:36.780> the<00:05:36.930> c-clips<00:05:40.340> they<00:05:41.340> weren't<00:05:41.520> too

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
you can see the c-clips they weren't too

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.670 
you can see the c-clips they weren't too
hard<00:05:41.880> to<00:05:42.180> press<00:05:42.510> in<00:05:43.580> once<00:05:44.580> we<00:05:45.530> got<00:05:46.530> them

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
hard to press in once we got them

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.500 
hard to press in once we got them
pressed<00:05:46.919> in<00:05:47.130> we're<00:05:47.729> going<00:05:47.820> to<00:05:47.880> grease<00:05:48.150> the

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
pressed in we're going to grease the

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.719 
pressed in we're going to grease the
grease<00:05:48.870> fitting<00:05:49.199> there<00:05:49.410> on<00:05:49.590> both<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.460> front

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
grease fitting there on both the front

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.710 
grease fitting there on both the front
and<00:05:50.820> the<00:05:50.940> back<00:05:51.780> and<00:05:52.370> then<00:05:53.370> it's<00:05:53.669> cleaned<00:05:54.540> all

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
and the back and then it's cleaned all

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.780 
and the back and then it's cleaned all
up<00:05:54.990> we'll<00:05:55.740> put<00:05:56.070> a<00:05:56.130> little<00:05:56.280> bit<00:05:56.370> of<00:05:56.460> grease<00:05:56.610> in

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
up we'll put a little bit of grease in

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.219 
up we'll put a little bit of grease in
the<00:05:56.880> splines<00:05:57.270> there<00:05:57.600> where<00:05:57.810> it<00:05:57.900> meets<00:05:58.050> the

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
the splines there where it meets the

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.379 
the splines there where it meets the
differential<00:05:59.010> in<00:05:59.100> the<00:05:59.130> engine<00:05:59.550> and<00:05:59.729> then

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
differential in the engine and then

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.250 
differential in the engine and then
we'll<00:06:00.510> put<00:06:00.750> the<00:06:01.340> drive<00:06:02.340> shaft<00:06:02.610> back<00:06:02.820> in<00:06:03.260> all

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
we'll put the drive shaft back in all

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.420 
we'll put the drive shaft back in all
right<00:06:04.380> so<00:06:04.470> in<00:06:04.560> order<00:06:04.620> to<00:06:04.740> get<00:06:04.889> the<00:06:04.950> drive<00:06:05.160> shaft

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
right so in order to get the drive shaft

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.540 
right so in order to get the drive shaft
back<00:06:05.639> in<00:06:05.940> how<00:06:06.630> we<00:06:07.500> did<00:06:07.680> it<00:06:07.770> from<00:06:07.919> the<00:06:08.010> left-hand

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
back in how we did it from the left-hand

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.360 
back in how we did it from the left-hand
side<00:06:08.669> of<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:09.510> bike<00:06:09.720> here<00:06:09.990> we<00:06:10.889> pulled<00:06:11.160> the

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
side of the bike here we pulled the

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.030 
side of the bike here we pulled the
differential<00:06:12.030> back<00:06:12.210> about<00:06:12.570> two<00:06:13.500> inches<00:06:13.860> inch

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
differential back about two inches inch

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.620 
differential back about two inches inch
and<00:06:14.190> a<00:06:14.220> half<00:06:14.280> and<00:06:16.880> stuck<00:06:17.880> the<00:06:18.030> engine<00:06:18.389> side

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
and a half and stuck the engine side

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.659 
and a half and stuck the engine side
through<00:06:18.900> the<00:06:19.020> hole<00:06:19.200> there<00:06:19.470> and<00:06:19.650> then<00:06:20.520> up<00:06:20.639> to

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
through the hole there and then up to

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.480 
through the hole there and then up to
the<00:06:20.790> engine<00:06:21.000> and<00:06:21.470> got<00:06:22.470> it<00:06:22.590> on<00:06:22.710> the<00:06:22.830> spline<00:06:23.160> and

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
the engine and got it on the spline and

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.640 
the engine and got it on the spline and
then<00:06:24.210> slid<00:06:24.539> the<00:06:24.660> differential<00:06:25.229> onto<00:06:25.560> the

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
then slid the differential onto the

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.800 
then slid the differential onto the
spline<00:06:26.010> in<00:06:26.310> the<00:06:26.850> rear<00:06:27.000> here<00:06:27.210> by<00:06:27.360> the<00:06:27.419> brake

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.350 
caliper in order to get it into the rear
differential<00:06:31.490> then<00:06:32.490> once<00:06:32.760> we<00:06:32.880> had<00:06:33.030> it<00:06:33.060> lined

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
differential then once we had it lined

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.320 
differential then once we had it lined
up<00:06:33.539> we<00:06:34.350> put<00:06:34.590> all<00:06:34.680> four<00:06:34.949> bolts<00:06:35.310> there<00:06:35.520> in<00:06:35.729> the

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
up we put all four bolts there in the

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.850 
up we put all four bolts there in the
differential<00:06:36.900> in<00:06:37.200> order<00:06:37.410> to<00:06:37.500> keep<00:06:37.620> it<00:06:37.770> in

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
differential in order to keep it in

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.840 
differential in order to keep it in
place<00:06:38.100> and<00:06:38.400> then<00:06:39.300> tighten<00:06:39.690> to<00:06:39.990> the<00:06:40.850> drive

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
place and then tighten to the drive

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.080 
place and then tighten to the drive
shaft<00:06:41.880> to<00:06:42.479> the<00:06:43.440> differential<00:06:43.830> and<00:06:44.639> the<00:06:44.789> engine

if<00:06:46.020> you<00:06:46.139> put<00:06:46.320> it<00:06:46.410> in<00:06:46.500> neutral<00:06:46.680> the<00:06:47.160> drive<00:06:47.430> shaft

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:47.729 
if you put it in neutral the drive shaft

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:48.950 
if you put it in neutral the drive shaft
will<00:06:47.910> turn<00:06:48.090> a<00:06:48.120> little<00:06:48.270> bit<00:06:48.479> so<00:06:48.630> you<00:06:48.720> can<00:06:48.840> get

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
will turn a little bit so you can get

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.140 
will turn a little bit so you can get
the<00:06:49.080> splines<00:06:49.440> matched<00:06:49.800> up<00:06:50.130> on<00:06:50.370> the<00:06:51.000> engine

side<00:07:05.820> while<00:07:06.389> we<00:07:06.419> had<00:07:06.720> it<00:07:06.840> apart<00:07:07.139> we're<00:07:07.470> also

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
side while we had it apart we're also

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.020 
side while we had it apart we're also
going<00:07:07.860> to<00:07:07.950> change<00:07:08.190> out<00:07:08.370> the<00:07:08.490> differential

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
going to change out the differential

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.990 
going to change out the differential

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 
then the fill plug is missing right

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.250 
then the fill plug is missing right
there<00:07:17.669> we<00:07:17.760> already<00:07:17.849> took<00:07:18.060> that<00:07:18.240> out<00:07:18.270> you<00:07:19.110> want

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.260

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.360 
there we already took that out you want
to<00:07:19.320> make<00:07:19.440> sure<00:07:19.470> that<00:07:19.680> you<00:07:19.800> take<00:07:19.950> the<00:07:20.099> drain

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370 
to make sure that you take the drain

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.089 
to make sure that you take the drain
plug<00:07:20.580> or<00:07:20.880> the<00:07:20.910> fill<00:07:21.270> plug<00:07:21.479> out<00:07:21.690> first<00:07:22.110> to<00:07:22.979> make
