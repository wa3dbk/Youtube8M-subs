should keep either the black one or the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.370 
should keep either the black one or the
blue<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.280> because<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.090> can't<00:01:18.869> make<00:01:19.020> up<00:01:19.200> my<00:01:19.259> mind

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.940 
happens like you buy something and you
expect<00:04:15.540> it<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.720> be<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:16.080> certain<00:04:16.500> amount<00:04:16.560> and
