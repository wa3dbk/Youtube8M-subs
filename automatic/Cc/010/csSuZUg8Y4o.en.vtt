about this and was a really big selling

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.210 
about this and was a really big selling
point<00:00:14.250> for<00:00:14.280> me<00:00:14.429> was<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.960> fact<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:17.010> does

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
point for me was the fact that it does

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.460 
point for me was the fact that it does
not<00:00:17.250> have<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> CD<00:00:17.970> player<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.480> can't<00:00:19.260> remember

not have a CD player I can't remember
the<00:00:19.710> last<00:00:19.740> time<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.130> used<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.520> CD<00:00:20.939> on<00:00:21.869> my<00:00:22.410> musics

the last time I used a CD on my musics

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.830 
the last time I used a CD on my musics
in<00:00:22.949> digital<00:00:23.430> format<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.359> does<00:00:24.510> me<00:00:24.660> no<00:00:24.720> good

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840
