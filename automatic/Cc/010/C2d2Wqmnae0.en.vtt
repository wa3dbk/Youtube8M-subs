00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
from this piece of shit then I would

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
being inside buildings you are just

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.020 
being inside buildings you are just
going<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.590> be<00:05:16.740> going<00:05:17.310> from<00:05:17.550> room<00:05:17.789> to<00:05:18.000> room

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
probably going to be for the close

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.270 
probably going to be for the close
quarters<00:05:22.229> map<00:05:22.440> pack<00:05:22.590> which<00:05:22.800> is<00:05:22.949> obviously

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
quarters map pack which is obviously

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.969 
quarters map pack which is obviously
hence<00:05:23.789> the<00:05:23.970> name<00:05:24.090> come<00:05:24.389> on<00:05:24.510> so<00:05:25.199> yeah<00:05:25.770> I<00:05:25.800> think

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
hence the name come on so yeah I think

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.400 
hence the name come on so yeah I think
that's<00:05:26.220> going<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.370> be<00:05:26.520> it<00:05:26.639> I<00:05:27.080> think<00:05:28.080> out<00:05:28.199> of<00:05:28.229> all

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
that's going to be it I think out of all

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.529 
that's going to be it I think out of all
of<00:05:28.470> these<00:05:28.680> I'm<00:05:28.889> I<00:05:29.130> admit<00:05:29.639> I'm<00:05:29.820> not<00:05:30.150> much<00:05:30.330> of<00:05:30.360> a

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
of these I'm I admit I'm not much of a

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.600 
of these I'm I admit I'm not much of a
close<00:05:30.780> quarters<00:05:31.200> player<00:05:31.530> I<00:05:31.560> like<00:05:31.979> having<00:05:32.550> a

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
close quarters player I like having a

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.100 
close quarters player I like having a
bit<00:05:32.700> of<00:05:32.760> distance<00:05:33.060> between<00:05:33.270> me<00:05:33.660> and<00:05:33.780> the<00:05:33.870> enemy

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
bit of distance between me and the enemy

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.529 
bit of distance between me and the enemy
um<00:05:34.320> so<00:05:35.310> I<00:05:35.370> think<00:05:35.460> out<00:05:35.910> of<00:05:35.940> all<00:05:36.150> of<00:05:36.210> these<00:05:36.360> i'm

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
um so I think out of all of these i'm

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.029 
um so I think out of all of these i'm
probably<00:05:36.720> looking<00:05:36.990> forward<00:05:37.410> to<00:05:37.470> armored<00:05:37.830> kill

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
probably looking forward to armored kill

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.710 
probably looking forward to armored kill

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
the most i do like going in vehicles i

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.909 
the most i do like going in vehicles i
mean<00:05:39.870> come<00:05:40.110> on<00:05:40.200> it's<00:05:40.380> battlefield<00:05:40.770> who

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
mean come on it's battlefield who
