can use why they're going through
massage<00:00:31.130> school<00:00:31.460> so<00:00:31.789> that's<00:00:32.239> what<00:00:32.390> I<00:00:32.419> said

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
massage school so that's what I said

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.350

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
before so that's what I've told them to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.479 
before so that's what I've told them to
watch<00:00:38.150> them<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:38.770> one<00:00:39.770> question<00:00:40.190> that<00:00:40.220> i'd

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
watch them and one question that i'd

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.000 
watch them and one question that i'd
like<00:00:40.699> to<00:00:40.940> ask<00:00:41.120> is<00:00:41.780> do<00:00:42.110> you<00:00:42.199> have<00:00:42.230> any<00:00:42.620> tips<00:00:42.860> for

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
like to ask is do you have any tips for

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.280 
like to ask is do you have any tips for
studying<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:43.580> terminology<00:00:44.330> this<00:00:44.989> may<00:00:45.230> seem

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
studying the terminology this may seem

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.680 
studying the terminology this may seem
trivial<00:00:45.920> but<00:00:46.220> because<00:00:46.970> there<00:00:47.330> are<00:00:47.449> so<00:00:47.479> many

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
trivial but because there are so many

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.930 
trivial but because there are so many
parts<00:00:48.050> of<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.229> body<00:00:48.379> something<00:00:49.309> i<00:00:49.430> am<00:00:49.460> well

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
parts of the body something i am well

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.100 
parts of the body something i am well
aware<00:00:50.030> of<00:00:50.239> that<00:00:51.370> i'm<00:00:52.370> afraid<00:00:52.760> this<00:00:53.479> will<00:00:53.659> be<00:00:53.809> my

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
aware of that i'm afraid this will be my

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.640 
aware of that i'm afraid this will be my
biggest<00:00:54.320> speed<00:00:54.739> bump<00:00:55.570> with<00:00:56.570> that<00:00:56.809> what<00:00:57.559> you

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
biggest speed bump with that what you

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.439 
biggest speed bump with that what you
want<00:00:57.830> to<00:00:57.890> do<00:00:58.040> is<00:00:58.309> you<00:00:58.339> want<00:00:58.670> to<00:00:58.820> look<00:00:58.909> at<00:00:59.120> is

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
want to do is you want to look at is

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.439 
want to do is you want to look at is
kind<00:01:00.049> of<00:01:00.140> you're<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.830> detective<00:01:01.489> if<00:01:02.210> you<00:01:02.299> want

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
kind of you're a detective if you want

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.509 
kind of you're a detective if you want
to<00:01:02.510> look<00:01:02.570> at<00:01:02.720> it<00:01:02.809> that<00:01:02.960> way<00:01:03.129> so<00:01:04.129> what<00:01:04.400> you're

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
to look at it that way so what you're

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.350 
to look at it that way so what you're
going<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.699> do<00:01:04.820> is<00:01:04.940> you're<00:01:05.030> going<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.239> break

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
going to do is you're going to break

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.539 
going to do is you're going to break
down<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.750> words<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.229> understand<00:01:06.740> them<00:01:06.920> so

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
down the words to understand them so

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.230 
down the words to understand them so
there's<00:01:07.970> a<00:01:08.090> prefix<00:01:08.960> suffix<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.549> also<00:01:11.090> the

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
there's a prefix suffix and also the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.770 
there's a prefix suffix and also the
route<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:12.170> prefix<00:01:12.770> is<00:01:13.240> anything<00:01:14.240> before<00:01:14.630> the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
route so prefix is anything before the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.649 
route so prefix is anything before the
word<00:01:15.310> what<00:01:16.310> is<00:01:16.670> actually<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.150> main<00:01:17.330> part<00:01:17.630> of

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
word what is actually the main part of

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.230 
word what is actually the main part of
the<00:01:17.780> word<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:18.399> suffix<00:01:19.399> is<00:01:19.609> the<00:01:19.789> end<00:01:19.939> part<00:01:20.119> of

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
the word and suffix is the end part of

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.109 
the word and suffix is the end part of
the<00:01:20.299> work<00:01:20.479> but<00:01:21.380> if<00:01:21.680> you<00:01:21.859> understand<00:01:22.640> those<00:01:22.880> so

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
the work but if you understand those so

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.609 
the work but if you understand those so
that's<00:01:23.359> why<00:01:23.509> it's<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:23.840> important<00:01:24.409> to<00:01:24.439> learn

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
that's why it's so important to learn

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.950 
that's why it's so important to learn
medical<00:01:25.159> terminology<00:01:25.579> but<00:01:26.539> when<00:01:26.719> you<00:01:26.810> would

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
medical terminology but when you would

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.260 
medical terminology but when you would
learn<00:01:27.140> medical<00:01:27.649> terminology<00:01:28.100> you<00:01:28.670> can<00:01:28.850> put

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
learn medical terminology you can put

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.929 
learn medical terminology you can put
all<00:01:29.420> those<00:01:29.750> things<00:01:29.810> together<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:30.829> again<00:01:31.250> you

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
all those things together so again you

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.459 
all those things together so again you
taken<00:01:32.270> this<00:01:32.390> you're<00:01:32.659> taking<00:01:32.929> that<00:01:33.079> and<00:01:33.350> then

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
taken this you're taking that and then

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.950 
taken this you're taking that and then
you're<00:01:33.590> going<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.829> decide<00:01:34.609> on<00:01:34.880> what<00:01:35.810> it

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
you're going to decide on what it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.520 
you're going to decide on what it
actually<00:01:36.140> means<00:01:36.530> them<00:01:36.859> so<00:01:37.189> again<00:01:37.869> it<00:01:38.869> is<00:01:39.049> like

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
actually means them so again it is like

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.959 
actually means them so again it is like
learning<00:01:39.710> another<00:01:40.130> language<00:01:40.250> in<00:01:40.759> a<00:01:40.850> way

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
learning another language in a way

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.630 
learning another language in a way
because<00:01:41.179> a<00:01:41.439> Latin<00:01:42.439> and<00:01:42.770> stuff<00:01:43.009> a<00:01:43.219> lot<00:01:43.399> of<00:01:43.520> those

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
because a Latin and stuff a lot of those

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.639 
because a Latin and stuff a lot of those
terms<00:01:43.969> are<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.630> it's<00:01:45.170> hard<00:01:45.380> for<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.619> average

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
terms are and it's hard for the average

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.330 
terms are and it's hard for the average
person<00:01:45.859> but<00:01:46.670> least<00:01:47.420> it's<00:01:47.630> not<00:01:48.100> like<00:01:49.100> learning

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
person but least it's not like learning

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.370 
person but least it's not like learning
a<00:01:49.520> totally<00:01:49.939> foreign<00:01:50.210> language<00:01:50.780> I'm<00:01:51.170> you're

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
a totally foreign language I'm you're

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.020 
a totally foreign language I'm you're
not<00:01:51.439> going<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.700> you're<00:01:52.700> not<00:01:52.729> going<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:52.969> learn

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
not going to you're not going to learn

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.789 
not going to you're not going to learn
all<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.659> of<00:01:53.719> course<00:01:53.990> but<00:01:54.320> just<00:01:54.619> those

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
all that and of course but just those

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.410 
all that and of course but just those
some<00:01:55.189> medical<00:01:55.579> terms<00:01:55.850> that<00:01:56.119> you're<00:01:56.240> going<00:01:56.359> to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.529 
some medical terms that you're going to
really<00:01:56.570> use<00:01:56.869> them<00:01:57.249> but<00:01:58.249> now<00:01:59.090> that's<00:01:59.420> my

recommendation is really good good at
medical<00:02:02.119> terminology<00:02:02.509> even<00:02:03.049> though<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.259> might

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
medical terminology even though it might
