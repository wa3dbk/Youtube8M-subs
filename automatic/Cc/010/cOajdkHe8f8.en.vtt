00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.109 
pinch in just like that there's no going
backwards<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.080> might<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.559> future

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119

right now just to make this video quick

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.670 
right now just to make this video quick
but<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.790> animations<00:02:24.270> are<00:02:24.480> very<00:02:25.020> very<00:02:25.260> smooth

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
but the animations are very very smooth

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.930 
but the animations are very very smooth
as<00:02:25.890> any<00:02:26.760> Apple<00:02:27.210> animation<00:02:27.750> would<00:02:28.080> be<00:02:28.940> but

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
as any Apple animation would be but

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.300 
as any Apple animation would be but
they're<00:02:30.120> really<00:02:30.420> really<00:02:30.540> high<00:02:30.750> quality<00:02:31.310> so

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
they're really really high quality so

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.190 
they're really really high quality so
this<00:02:32.490> brings<00:02:32.640> up<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.120> idea<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.540> maybe<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
this brings up the idea that maybe the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.580 
this brings up the idea that maybe the
next<00:02:34.350> iPad<00:02:35.190> 2<00:02:35.490> will<00:02:36.300> not<00:02:36.630> have<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.050> home<00:02:37.350> button

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
next iPad 2 will not have a home button

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.140 
next iPad 2 will not have a home button
and<00:02:38.060> it's<00:02:39.060> something<00:02:39.240> quite<00:02:39.510> interesting

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
and it's something quite interesting

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.090 
and it's something quite interesting
because<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.360> really<00:02:42.840> can<00:02:43.080> take<00:02:43.530> away<00:02:43.830> all<00:02:44.010> the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
because you really can take away all the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.010 
because you really can take away all the
need<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.940> home<00:02:45.090> button<00:02:45.300> with<00:02:45.870> these

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
need of the home button with these

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.010 
need of the home button with these
multi-touch<00:02:46.500> gestures<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.480> mean<00:02:48.480> right<00:02:48.840> at<00:02:48.930> the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
multi-touch gestures I mean right at the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.640 
multi-touch gestures I mean right at the
moment<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.440> could<00:02:49.530> control<00:02:50.070> my<00:02:50.220> whole<00:02:50.400> ipad

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
moment I could control my whole ipad

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.800 
moment I could control my whole ipad
with<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:53.010> four<00:02:53.220> finger<00:02:53.490> gestures<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.210> believe

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
with the four finger gestures I believe

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.310 
with the four finger gestures I believe
you<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:55.050> use<00:02:55.200> five<00:02:55.410> as<00:02:55.590> well<00:02:55.710> if<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:55.980> want

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
you can use five as well if you want

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.510 
you can use five as well if you want
look<00:02:58.320> for<00:02:58.530> do<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.710> work<00:02:58.860> too<00:02:59.180> and<00:03:01.370> it's<00:03:02.370> not

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
look for do you work too and it's not

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.890 
look for do you work too and it's not
perfect<00:03:02.880> right<00:03:03.000> now<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.270> is<00:03:03.420> just<00:03:03.450> in<00:03:03.720> beta

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
perfect right now this is just in beta

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.320 
perfect right now this is just in beta
so<00:03:04.170> for<00:03:04.740> example<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:05.130> was<00:03:05.670> just<00:03:05.850> doing<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.180> and

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
so for example I was just doing it and

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.720 
so for example I was just doing it and
kind<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.600> froze<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.080> whole<00:03:07.110> iPad<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.890> touch

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
kind of froze the whole iPad and touch

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.810 
kind of froze the whole iPad and touch
didn't<00:03:09.000> work<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.390> had<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.660> restart<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.820> but

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
didn't work so I had to restart it but

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.880 
didn't work so I had to restart it but
it'll<00:03:12.330> work<00:03:12.390> all<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.810> kinks<00:03:13.080> out<00:03:13.230> by<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.650> time

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
it'll work all the kinks out by the time

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.680 
it'll work all the kinks out by the time
they<00:03:14.010> released<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.580> public<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.120> should<00:03:15.660> be

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
they released the public it should be

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.050 
they released the public it should be
perfect<00:03:16.020> condition<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.760> I'm<00:03:17.820> really<00:03:17.970> looking

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060
