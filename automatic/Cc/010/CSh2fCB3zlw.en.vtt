staring<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.479> really<00:01:51.840> quick<00:01:52.049> because<00:01:52.920> they

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
staring this really quick because they

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.190 
staring this really quick because they
will<00:01:53.490> go<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.299> they<00:01:54.329> will<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.750> done<00:01:54.990> really

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
will go and they will be done really

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.859 
will go and they will be done really
fast<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.979> know<00:01:56.130> what<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.310> mean<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.869> finally

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
fast if you know what I mean and finally

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.080 
fast if you know what I mean and finally
we<00:01:58.049> will<00:01:58.290> apply<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> tomatoes<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.850> when<00:02:00.000> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
we will apply the tomatoes and when you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.810 
we will apply the tomatoes and when you
fight<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.450> tomatoes<00:02:00.899> make<00:02:01.619> sure<00:02:02.070> make<00:02:02.579> sure

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
fight the tomatoes make sure make sure

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.160 
fight the tomatoes make sure make sure
and<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.090> will<00:02:03.210> repeat<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.479> three<00:02:03.689> times<00:02:03.930> make

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
and I will repeat it three times make

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.050 
and I will repeat it three times make
sure<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.579> cover<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.909> because

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
sure you have this to cover it because

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.270 
sure you have this to cover it because
basically<00:02:06.899> hell<00:02:07.320> will<00:02:07.500> break<00:02:07.619> loose<00:02:07.740> inside

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
basically hell will break loose inside

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.150 
basically hell will break loose inside
now<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:09.000> two<00:02:09.179> people<00:02:09.950> basically<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.039> need

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
now for two people basically you need

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.520 
now for two people basically you need
two<00:02:11.370> cups<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.700> rice<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.150> for<00:02:12.569> water<00:02:12.750> its<00:02:13.110> Oh

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
two cups of rice and for water its Oh

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.440 
two cups of rice and for water its Oh
is<00:02:13.590> two<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:14.040> three<00:02:14.069> ratio<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.970> if<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.240> need<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
is two to three ratio and if you need a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.320 
is two to three ratio and if you need a
mathematical<00:02:16.140> equation<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:17.280> figure<00:02:17.459> out<00:02:17.730> we

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
mathematical equation to figure out we

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.610 
mathematical equation to figure out we
can<00:02:18.480> I'll<00:02:18.690> show<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:19.050> mathematical

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
can I'll show you a mathematical

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.020 
can I'll show you a mathematical
equation<00:02:19.800> but<00:02:20.370> if<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.580> have<00:02:20.670> two<00:02:20.760> cups<00:02:20.940> of

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
equation but if you have two cups of

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.110 
equation but if you have two cups of
rice<00:02:21.090> 3<00:02:21.660> cups<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.080> not<00:02:22.290> water<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:22.680> stock<00:02:23.250> some

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
rice 3 cups of not water but stock some

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.080 
rice 3 cups of not water but stock some
people<00:02:24.390> put<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.660> rice<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:25.020> water<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.819> for

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
people put the rice in water this is for

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.610 
people put the rice in water this is for
two<00:02:27.270> reasons<00:02:27.600> one<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.959> reasons<00:02:28.080> take<00:02:28.470> the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
two reasons one of the reasons take the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.949 
two reasons one of the reasons take the
starch<00:02:28.890> out<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.730> other<00:02:29.910> reason<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.690> make

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
starch out the other reason is to make

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.660 
starch out the other reason is to make
it<00:02:31.110> softer<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.830> cooking<00:02:32.130> process<00:02:32.280> will

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
it softer and the cooking process will

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.150 
it softer and the cooking process will
be<00:02:32.819> more<00:02:33.540> well<00:02:33.840> done<00:02:34.050> basically<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.860> we'll<00:02:34.980> go

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
be more well done basically so we'll go

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.790 
be more well done basically so we'll go
ahead<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.370> start<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.700> broth<00:02:38.970> concept

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
ahead and start the the broth concept

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.470 
ahead and start the the broth concept
when<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:40.830> comes<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.430> broth<00:02:41.610> we<00:02:41.850> need<00:02:42.090> something

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
when it comes to broth we need something

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.170 
when it comes to broth we need something
that<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.750> deep<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.370> my<00:02:44.459> case<00:02:44.520> we'll<00:02:44.970> use

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
that is deep so in my case we'll use

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.590 
that is deep so in my case we'll use
this<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.580> what<00:02:47.580> I'll<00:02:47.760> do<00:02:47.940> I'll<00:02:48.150> put<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> little

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
this and what I'll do I'll put a little

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.830 
this and what I'll do I'll put a little
bit<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.840> oil<00:02:49.170> on<00:02:49.590> top<00:02:49.830> because<00:02:49.980> we're<00:02:50.310> gonna

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
bit of oil on top because we're gonna

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.550 
bit of oil on top because we're gonna
start<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:52.200> fry<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.500> chicken<00:02:54.019> so<00:02:55.019> what<00:02:55.380> we'll

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
start to fry the chicken so what we'll

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.199 
start to fry the chicken so what we'll
do<00:02:55.709> go<00:02:56.340> ahead<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:57.239> heat<00:02:57.600> this<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:59.400> when<00:03:00.120> it

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
do go ahead and heat this and when it

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.650 
do go ahead and heat this and when it
comes<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.660> chicken<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.110> would<00:03:01.950> like<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.400> use

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
comes to the chicken I would like to use

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.570 
comes to the chicken I would like to use
allspice<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.860> we'll<00:03:05.010> put<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.190> little<00:03:05.310> bit<00:03:05.430> on

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
allspice so we'll put a little bit on

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.680 
allspice so we'll put a little bit on
them<00:03:05.730> on<00:03:06.000> both<00:03:06.239> sides<00:03:10.940> okay<00:03:11.940> now<00:03:12.269> some<00:03:12.450> people

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
them on both sides okay now some people

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.150 
them on both sides okay now some people
like<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.870> fry<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:13.290> some<00:03:13.739> people<00:03:14.010> like<00:03:14.130> to

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
like to fry this some people like to

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.309 
like to fry this some people like to
boil<00:03:14.489> them<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:14.940> some<00:03:15.569> people<00:03:15.840> like<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:15.989> fry

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
boil them and some people like to fry

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.400 
boil them and some people like to fry
them<00:03:16.530> boil<00:03:17.100> them<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.870> grill<00:03:18.870> them<00:03:19.049> just<00:03:19.320> to

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
them boil them and grill them just to

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.460 
them boil them and grill them just to
make<00:03:19.560> sure<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.829> chicken<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.220> dead<00:03:21.470> we

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
make sure that the chicken is dead we

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.920 
make sure that the chicken is dead we
will<00:03:22.620> start<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.010> cooking<00:03:23.160> process<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:27.060> we

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
will start the cooking process and we

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.680 
will start the cooking process and we
will<00:03:28.110> wait<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.320> few<00:03:28.500> seconds<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:30.150> we<00:03:30.329> will<00:03:30.510> put

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
will wait a few seconds and we will put

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:39.090 
will wait a few seconds and we will put
our<00:03:31.070> magic<00:03:32.070> ingredients<00:03:32.220> in<00:03:32.640> here

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.320 

let<00:03:40.100> it<00:03:40.220> for<00:03:40.400> like<00:03:40.550> a<00:03:40.580> few<00:03:40.760> minutes<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.180> then

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
let it for like a few minutes and then

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.790 
let it for like a few minutes and then
we'll<00:03:41.420> put<00:03:41.660> boiling<00:03:41.900> water<00:03:42.200> on<00:03:42.320> top<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.680> it

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
we'll put boiling water on top of it

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.740 
we'll put boiling water on top of it
while<00:03:43.340> we're<00:03:43.580> waiting<00:03:43.970> for<00:03:44.000> this<00:03:44.270> I<00:03:44.420> just<00:03:44.570> want

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
while we're waiting for this I just want

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.910 
while we're waiting for this I just want
to<00:03:44.810> mention<00:03:44.930> three<00:03:45.260> things<00:03:45.290> about<00:03:45.590> our

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
to mention three things about our

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.190 
to mention three things about our
program<00:03:46.520> what<00:03:47.090> we<00:03:47.270> want<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.540> do<00:03:47.660> is<00:03:47.840> we<00:03:48.020> wanna

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
program what we want to do is we wanna

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.900 
program what we want to do is we wanna
we<00:03:48.860> just<00:03:49.040> we<00:03:49.280> don't<00:03:49.400> want<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.760> make

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
we just we don't want to make

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.480
