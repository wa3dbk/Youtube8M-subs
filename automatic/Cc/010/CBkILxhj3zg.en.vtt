the keys to staying ahead but we've

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.140 
the keys to staying ahead but we've
always<00:00:29.529> been<00:00:29.890> very<00:00:29.949> much<00:00:30.400> on<00:00:30.699> the<00:00:30.910> edge<00:00:31.029> of

always been very much on the edge of
technology<00:00:31.359> in<00:00:31.720> fact<00:00:31.990> if<00:00:32.110> you<00:00:32.140> look<00:00:32.260> at<00:00:32.500> the

technology in fact if you look at the

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.610 
technology in fact if you look at the
network's<00:00:33.150> this<00:00:34.150> time<00:00:34.360> you<00:00:34.540> leavin<00:00:34.840> here<00:00:35.080> we

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
I have to admit that when we launched

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.270 
I have to admit that when we launched
this<00:00:58.300> in<00:00:58.570> march<00:00:58.899> two<00:00:59.110> thousand<00:00:59.620> seven<00:00:59.770> like<00:01:00.070> we

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
this in march two thousand seven like we

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.529 
this in march two thousand seven like we
didn't<00:01:00.579> know<00:01:00.700> it<00:01:00.850> would<00:01:00.910> be<00:01:01.059> such<00:01:01.239> a<00:01:01.270> great

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
didn't know it would be such a great

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.200 
didn't know it would be such a great
success<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.890> new<00:01:03.129> intrinsically<00:01:03.789> this<00:01:04.030> is<00:01:04.180> a

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
success the new intrinsically this is a

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.570 
success the new intrinsically this is a
great<00:01:04.539> product<00:01:04.839> but<00:01:05.140> in<00:01:05.410> fact<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:06.190> way<00:01:06.369> in

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
great product but in fact the way in

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.690 
great product but in fact the way in
which<00:01:06.970> we<00:01:07.000> launched<00:01:07.539> it<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.840> way<00:01:07.990> in<00:01:08.050> which<00:01:08.200> we

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
which we launched it the way in which we

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.730 
which we launched it the way in which we
we<00:01:09.700> built<00:01:09.970> up<00:01:10.119> distribution<00:01:10.360> network<00:01:10.959> and<00:01:11.170> the

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
we built up distribution network and the

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.040 
we built up distribution network and the
way<00:01:11.860> we<00:01:12.190> made<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:12.910> product<00:01:13.240> so<00:01:13.420> simply<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.840> use

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
way we made the product so simply to use

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.499 
way we made the product so simply to use
has<00:01:14.560> made<00:01:14.860> it<00:01:14.979> a<00:01:15.130> huge<00:01:15.759> success<00:01:15.819> I'll<00:01:16.360> talk

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
has made it a huge success I'll talk

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.990 
has made it a huge success I'll talk
about<00:01:16.569> it<00:01:16.959> in<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.319> little<00:01:17.380> while<00:01:17.789> but<00:01:18.789> I<00:01:18.850> think

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
about it in a little while but I think

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.430 
about it in a little while but I think
the<00:01:19.090> most<00:01:19.179> important<00:01:19.750> thing<00:01:19.780> is<00:01:19.990> we're<00:01:20.140> here<00:01:20.289> a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
the most important thing is we're here a

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.350 
the most important thing is we're here a
number<00:01:20.679> one<00:01:20.979> company<00:01:21.429> like<00:01:21.729> we<00:01:21.910> are<00:01:22.060> we're

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
number one company like we are we're

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.980 
number one company like we are we're
number<00:01:22.539> one<00:01:22.979> numbers<00:01:23.979> of<00:01:24.190> total<00:01:24.550> revenue<00:01:25.479> in

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
number one numbers of total revenue in

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.480 
number one numbers of total revenue in
terms<00:01:26.229> of<00:01:26.349> profitability<00:01:26.770> years<00:01:27.340> in

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
terms of profitability years in

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.490 
terms of profitability years in
particular<00:01:27.819> but<00:01:28.539> these<00:01:29.050> some<00:01:29.319> of<00:01:29.349> this

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
particular but these some of this

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.370 
particular but these some of this
imagine<00:01:29.979> being<00:01:30.190> number<00:01:30.429> one<00:01:30.580> is<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.479> you<00:01:31.750> can

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
imagine being number one is that you can

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.440 
imagine being number one is that you can
become<00:01:32.740> very<00:01:32.770> good<00:01:33.069> places<00:01:33.340> but<00:01:33.700> you<00:01:33.789> one<00:01:34.300> good

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
become very good places but you one good

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.230 
become very good places but you one good
thing<00:01:34.509> about<00:01:34.690> k<00:01:35.020> head<00:01:35.229> is<00:01:35.830> there<00:01:36.039> I<00:01:36.310> think<00:01:37.119> the

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
thing about k head is there I think the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.570 
thing about k head is there I think the
government<00:01:37.599> does<00:01:38.349> understand<00:01:38.860> what<00:01:39.459> is

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
government does understand what is

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.730 
government does understand what is
needed<00:01:39.849> to<00:01:40.000> attract<00:01:40.420> investment<00:01:40.990> dead<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:41.560> to

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
needed to attract investment dead and to

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.279 
needed to attract investment dead and to
keep<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.160> festival<00:01:42.700> yes<00:01:43.539> maybe<00:01:43.869> we<00:01:44.140> don't

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
keep the festival yes maybe we don't

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:45.690 
keep the festival yes maybe we don't
have<00:01:44.410> enough<00:01:44.740> water

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
have enough water

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.789 
have enough water
power<00:01:46.539> but<00:01:47.020> certainly<00:01:47.320> I<00:01:47.409> think<00:01:47.439> we<00:01:47.649> have<00:01:47.680> a

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
power but certainly I think we have a

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.440 
power but certainly I think we have a
government<00:01:48.039> that<00:01:48.250> understands<00:01:48.880> what

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
government that understands what

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.660 
government that understands what
investment<00:01:50.350> climate<00:01:50.500> should<00:01:50.829> be<00:01:50.979> in<00:01:51.369> order<00:01:51.520> to

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
investment climate should be in order to

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.429 
investment climate should be in order to
attract<00:01:51.969> new<00:01:52.060> investor<00:01:52.600> I<00:01:52.780> think<00:01:53.140> people<00:01:53.259> are

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
attract new investor I think people are

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.590 
attract new investor I think people are
surprised<00:01:53.829> at<00:01:53.860> Kenya<00:01:54.280> because<00:01:54.399> if<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:55.390> look

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
surprised at Kenya because if you look
