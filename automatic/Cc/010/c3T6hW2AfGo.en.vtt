00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.860
 hi guys here virtus and this is not 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.670
 a normal commentary 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.260
 well it's not a blog 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:23.730
 moment is a hyper unboxing 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:26.160
 megagalactic limited edition of halo 4 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.220
 I know you're already bringing the hand to 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.129
 pants so I don't get lost besides 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.699
 talk and we go straight to unboxing 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:40.370
 then let's start then I ask you 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:43.610
 kindly neglect the quantum 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.780
 negligible packaging that is not 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.559
 obviously as beautiful as that is the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.559
 legend of halo reach 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:27.270
 ok much more than before 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:31.549
 here it is from this verse we give it 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:39.200
 minutes the package shows this 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:45.060
 much, much more beautiful than magnetic 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:48.539
 then excel a good one 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.890
 image of the infinite I assume is not there 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:57.869
 written nothing or I don't see 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:00.960
 and now the various things the book 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.549
 analogous to the science that I think finish it 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.910
 before the chimera I owe 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:15.390
 read the school a single plate 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:19.890
 just for me but who cares about the la 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.690
 practice is wonderful package with disc 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.110
 1 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:30.260
 disc 2 this is 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:36.240
 something magnificent halo 4 beautiful 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:41.760
 the warthog model this here 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:49.230
 remains packaged is then embarked 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:52.110
 we have what we find inside 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.350
 Instructions for Use 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:08.670
 and let's try to see what's underneath 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:11.070
 to everything we have we have as how it is 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:23.070
 I do not want to create damage at least for 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:31.519
 these are always so out 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:41.660
 nsc there are infinite vrsc envelopes 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:41.660
 I think it's a book that tells me where 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.440
 all 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:56.340
 it looks like the instruction book 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:58.680
 so nice to finally return to 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.270
 in fact, restart the instructions as you do 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.680
 needs to 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:13.920
 here in no idea what we find but 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:17.580
 we open we do not remove from the bridge 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:26.100
 ranger dinners and destroy interesting 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:32.610
 not ideal you can open ok briefing 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:35.070
 missions missions no better than what ok 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.240
 we were not owe then I have to 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:43.680
 destroy what they like 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:48.690
 indicatively I would say other contents 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.560
 that I will not show you the 14 months yes 14 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.560
 months but 14 days trial content 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.560
 extra 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:03.180
 ok ok 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:05.430
 and here we are 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.840
 let's try the super mega poster you don't 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:13.620
 I'm going to open but that will surely end 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:17.940
 in my room I think another super mega 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.260
 poster not the idea but we are not doing 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:25.169
 too much mess because I want it 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:32.480
 actually try and their mega 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:38.870
 blocks with a beautiful warthog 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:44.210
 oh well now we request everything and say that 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:46.810
 the unboxing of today quite fast 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.760
 albeit in and full it's full of stuff 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.790
 it can end here because there is a desire 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.170
 crazy to try the game a shore hello 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.170
 is the next
