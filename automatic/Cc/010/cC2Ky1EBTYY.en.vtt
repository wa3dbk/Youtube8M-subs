00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.110
 but 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.080
 all the hotels gets at the overall project will show how the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.949
 Lawyers take we are two points 3 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.490
 for motherboards and also can 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.909
 so what 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:26.119
 I will still cost the page description again 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.619
 you go to the side and rest arbitrarily because of who called many details 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.680
 Kingship has brought for the Beta 1 1 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.560
 the power of the military look at 1 and 4 he gives open and the countdown is on 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.370
 KÃ¼pper FCA 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.370
 then openly had hers 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.060
 the intact course 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.730
 then 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.239
 opens her march 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.239
 Wind with the windows button and Gehrke at the same time 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.480
 exporting there gives off a percent AP taz 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.970
 Sticker run 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.110
 There he clicks my power on pump 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.380
 and know-how 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.350
 Forster also already in my head Dieter 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.790
 whatever is desired with you march program either or i will find it 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.280
 personally significantly better 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.150
 there 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
 she simply pulls the Rheine data 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.810
 of course, there is still the Nordler or 1 point to pay attention 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.180
 The corpses also operate Noriyuki Post Post 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.470
 and 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.250
 now it still has to opiate opium poppy Mainz Voigt the tenant 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.840
 Simply delete Feist's Winner 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.750
 and then we look at it too 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.750
 It goes on my curves 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.070
 you looked and worked 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.309
 and that worked 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:12.309
 that looks in the upper right corner 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.979
 the 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.679
 to which point am I 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.679
 valuable could still be with you 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:28.289
 settings 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:29.709
 we work 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.709
 on such a tick thoroughly 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.499
 what you see on the minimap are the grandma's 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:39.419
 the temperatures 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.699
 and so on Sanitation Poken mountain point 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:45.959
 Hamburg died 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.810
 and then several other options but do not mind crooked all over 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.689
 let it be 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.899
 Phnom Penh I hope thrown back 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:57.659
 but you can never contact me 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:58.309
