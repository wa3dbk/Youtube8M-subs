I<00:00:50.489> actually<00:00:50.640> think<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.059> two<00:00:51.390> people<00:00:51.600> have

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
I actually think like two people have

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.869 
I actually think like two people have
died<00:00:52.050> doing<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.070> I'm<00:00:53.280> gonna<00:00:53.370> be<00:00:53.550> really

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
died doing this so I'm gonna be really

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.069 
died doing this so I'm gonna be really
careful<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.510> don't<00:00:54.539> choke<00:00:54.930> on

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
careful that I don't choke on

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.319 
careful that I don't choke on
marshmallows<00:00:55.410> cuz<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.430> die<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.879> camera<00:00:57.270> and

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
marshmallows cuz if I die on camera and

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.319 
marshmallows cuz if I die on camera and
choking<00:00:57.539> on<00:00:57.719> marshmallows<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.879> yeah<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.120> just

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
choking on marshmallows I yeah it's just

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.329 
choking on marshmallows I yeah it's just
it's<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.140> such<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> shitty<00:01:02.039> way<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.280> die<00:01:02.550> so

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
it's just such a shitty way to die so

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.950 
it's just such a shitty way to die so
we're<00:01:05.339> gonna<00:01:05.430> hope<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.670> doesn't<00:01:06.119> happen<00:01:06.180> you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
we're gonna hope that doesn't happen you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.690 
we're gonna hope that doesn't happen you
know<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.439> could<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.860> an<00:01:08.070> amazing<00:01:08.490> gameplay

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
know I could have an amazing gameplay

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.399 
know I could have an amazing gameplay
where<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.060> don't<00:01:09.270> die<00:01:09.450> much<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.049> free<00:01:10.229> for

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
where I don't die much but it's free for

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.940 
where I don't die much but it's free for
all<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.920> likelihood<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.850> me<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.479> dying<00:01:12.950> is

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
all so the likelihood of me not dying is

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.260 
all so the likelihood of me not dying is
slim<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.310> none<00:01:16.100> i'm<00:01:17.100> joined<00:01:17.340> about<00:01:17.549> halfway<00:01:17.909> in

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
slim to none i'm joined about halfway in

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.539 
slim to none i'm joined about halfway in
the<00:01:18.540> first<00:01:18.810> place<00:01:19.020> guy<00:01:19.350> has<00:01:19.590> nine<00:01:19.950> kills<00:01:20.280> needs

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
the first place guy has nine kills needs

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.640 
the first place guy has nine kills needs
to<00:01:20.640> get<00:01:20.759> 25<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.810> little<00:01:22.259> less<00:01:22.439> than<00:01:22.470> half

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
to get 25 so a little less than half

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.679 
to get 25 so a little less than half
maybe<00:01:23.250> i<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.460> work<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.060> catch<00:01:24.240> him<00:01:24.420> who

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
maybe i do work and I catch him who

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.179 
maybe i do work and I catch him who
knows<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:26.060> I'm<00:01:27.060> about<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.659> spawn<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.350> any

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
knows but I'm about to spawn in any

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.130 
knows but I'm about to spawn in any
