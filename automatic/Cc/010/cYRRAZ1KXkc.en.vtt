00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.720
 one of the most frequent questions with 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:07.419
 regarding training is how 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.240
 increase my muscle mass how to achieve 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:12.520
 hypertrophy and the response to this 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.620
 question is the topic of today and 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.619
 that there are numerous programs 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.869
 training whose objective is the 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.179
 increase in muscle mass but these 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.519
 programs are always chosen under certain 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.640
 principles and then I'm going to talk about 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:30.200
 these principles are 5 and I will be 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.080
 explaining briefly 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.990
 how they work and how with the aim of 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.390
 how to make your own routines your 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.750
 own training programs for 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.340
 get an increase in muscle mass 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.010
 First of all it is important to mention 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.420
 that these are basic principles about 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.880
 which is going to sustain any 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.010
 effective program for the increase of 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.530
 muscle mass there are more issues 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.130
 elaborated more advanced but always 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.820
 under this same base ok this is going to be the 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.250
 foundation of everything else then if 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.040
 we have these issues in order what 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.170
 others will really be under the 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.810
 first of these principles is the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.360
 Volume volume means the quantity 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.700
 total work they are doing in 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.460
 terms of series and repetitions 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.710
 usually while series increase 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.050
 the repetitions decreases and at 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.070
 otherwise, if the series decreases 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.320
 repetitions increases 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.750
 for the purpose of mass increase 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.530
 muscular ideal in a matter of series 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.620
 it would be about 3 to 4 series in question 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.500
 of repetitions would be in a range of 8 to 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.000
 12 repetitions less repetitions 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.979
 we are entering the field of 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.900
 strength training which is a 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.360
 totally separate topic and more 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.100
 repeats of 12 we are talking about 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.470
 training with the objective of 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.720
 resistance which is also not very 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.910
 hand aiming mass increase 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.039
 muscular the next principle is the 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.310
 intensity that is basically about 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.740
 the amount of weight you're using 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.350
 for example if you are using a high 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.720
 intensity or a high weight means 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.280
 that the repetitions are going to decrease and 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.959
 on the contrary if you are using a 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.850
 very low intensity the repetitions 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.580
 they tend to go up ok 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.650
 is this relationship now roughly 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.180
 we are talking about that for the increase 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.489
 of muscle mass 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.580
 the ideal intensity would be 70 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.930
 a hundred of your 1st or a repeat 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.459
 maximum 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.280
 here the statesman in whom many do not know 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.650
 what is one rm and there is a very 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.890
 simple to know what weight to use what 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.719
 intensity to use and it's simply 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.579
 do the repetitions if they take out more than 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.189
 all repetitions means that 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:47.250
 you are using very little weight and if 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:49.739
 you get less than 8 repetitions means 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.900
 that you put a lot of weight on him then 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.239
 let's try to use a weight in the 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.639
 that allows us to have this point of 8 to 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.970
 12 repetitions that cost us work 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:02.669
 but that is not very light and very 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.439
 very forced the following principle to 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.150
 take into account for the increase in mass 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.000
 muscle is the matter of breaks 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.489
 the time it takes you from series to series 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.189
 which is usually an ignored principle 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.709
 it is very important to keep this in mind 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.329
 the time of muscle mass gain 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.819
 we also have a relationship between 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.590
 breaks and intensity for example if 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.640
 we are using a lot of intensity or 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.980
 be a lot of weight in these exercises we are going 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.900
 to rest longer if by the 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.180
 otherwise we do a lower intensity 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.030
 we will tend to rest less time 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.260
 roughly ok then for 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.970
 our goal which is the increase of 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.240
 muscle mass let's try to have 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.370
 a a resting range close to 60 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.530
 seconds can be a little more can be 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.080
 a little less here is going to depend on 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.270
 other factors but basically we're going to 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.690
 try to go in that range of 60 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.040
 seconds of rest between series and 6 a 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.260
 then we have the following 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.390
 principle that it's about speed 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.370
 with which the exercise is done it 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.989
 it means how fast or how fast 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.420
 slow is going to be the speed with which 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.790
 you do the repetitions and this goes 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.190
 the hand always called more time 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.769
 attention consisting roughly 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.720
 of the amount of time in which the 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.209
 muscles are on a load of 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.970
 the higher the work time 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.820
 greater tension is going to be the answer 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.190
 So the ideal is not to go too fast or 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.680
 not so slow and we're talking about 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.370
 a time of approximately 30 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.610
 this means 3 seconds in the phase 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.639
 concentric and 3 seconds in the phase 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:42.400
 eccentric can also be modified 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:45.770
 313 that are 3 seconds a pause of a 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.530
 second and 3 seconds down 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.110
 well the last concept consists of the 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.569
 often how often work 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.449
 muscles that so often towards certain 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:59.599
 movements and what has been seen that is 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.759
 more advisable and more effective is to make 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:04.759
 twice a week work the 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.229
 muscles twice a week this is 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.900
 can pose as follows 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.569
 we can make monday top half 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.909
 of the body Tuesday the lower half of the 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.979
 body on Wednesday take it resting 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:18.050
 Thursday distribute from above and Friday 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.240
 repeat to below and this is one of the 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.270
 methods in which we can have this 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.930
 full work twice a week from 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.659
 an effective way and well these are the 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.449
 five basic concepts about which 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:33.430
 will govern any program of 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.830
 training 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.170
 in the matter that is more important or 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.840
 equally important that all of these is 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.330
 the constancy and desire to do the 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.000
 things no program for more cash 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.190
 that is going to work if you do it with 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.950
 an apathetic mentality you do it bad 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.170
 win if you do it again if you do it 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.050
 without the will to do it and for the 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.060
 opposite a program for more than 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.190
 be as mediocre as it is if 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.710
 performed with the right mindset can 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.230
 be more successful than if it is not done with 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:09.180
 the right mindset ok I have them 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.180
 served and see you until next time
