I took the web which is already stacked

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.290 
I took the web which is already stacked
double<00:00:52.930> and<00:00:53.170> I<00:00:53.500> just<00:00:53.770> folded<00:00:54.700> that<00:00:54.880> and<00:00:55.180> me

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
double and I just folded that and me

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.880 
double and I just folded that and me
like<00:00:55.570> a<00:00:55.600> four<00:00:56.790> you<00:00:57.790> know<00:00:57.910> poor<00:00:58.900> wefted<00:00:59.410> clip

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
like a four you know poor wefted clip

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.270 
like a four you know poor wefted clip
and<00:01:00.460> I<00:01:01.060> just<00:01:01.420> did<00:01:01.540> two<00:01:01.810> clips<00:01:02.500> on<00:01:02.680> each<00:01:02.920> one<00:01:03.250> I

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
and I just did two clips on each one I

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.560 
and I just did two clips on each one I
only<00:01:03.520> got<00:01:03.670> like<00:01:03.880> one<00:01:05.430> piece<00:01:06.430> without<00:01:06.970> one<00:01:07.270> clip

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
only got like one piece without one clip

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.050 
only got like one piece without one clip
but<00:01:07.869> majority<00:01:08.079> of<00:01:08.439> them<00:01:08.619> is<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:09.130> clip<00:01:09.460> just

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
but majority of them is to clip just

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.389 
but majority of them is to clip just
because<00:01:10.450> I<00:01:10.840> don't<00:01:11.320> know<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:12.100> reason<00:01:12.189> why

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
because I don't know and the reason why

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.090 
because I don't know and the reason why
I<00:01:12.429> did<00:01:12.609> it<00:01:12.640> this<00:01:12.789> way<00:01:12.939> was<00:01:13.359> because<00:01:14.100> even

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
I did it this way was because even

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.819 
I did it this way was because even
though<00:01:15.369> it's<00:01:15.549> less<00:01:15.789> clips<00:01:16.270> it's<00:01:16.960> more<00:01:17.439> hair

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
though it's less clips it's more hair

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.819 
though it's less clips it's more hair
because<00:01:18.250> this<00:01:18.399> is<00:01:18.609> a<00:01:18.640> thin<00:01:18.999> weft<00:01:19.299> so<00:01:19.630> yeah<00:01:20.499> I

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
because this is a thin weft so yeah I

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.349 
because this is a thin weft so yeah I
just<00:01:21.039> wanted<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:21.549> make<00:01:21.700> it<00:01:21.820> thicker<00:01:22.499> basically

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:24.359 
just wanted to make it thicker basically

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.800 
just wanted to make it thicker basically
it<00:01:25.359> is<00:01:25.749> a<00:01:26.469> future<00:01:27.399> or<00:01:27.609> free<00:01:28.060> invisible<00:01:28.570> weave
