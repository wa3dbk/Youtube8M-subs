00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
close I guess let's put him on a

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.610 
close I guess let's put him on a
transfer<00:03:11.069> list<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.519> walk<00:03:12.480> what<00:03:12.780> he<00:03:13.260> might<00:03:13.440> go

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.000 
transfer list and walk what he might go
for<00:03:13.859> a<00:03:13.920> bit<00:03:14.129> and<00:03:14.569> I<00:03:15.569> think<00:03:15.599> that's<00:03:16.139> it<00:03:16.409> yeah

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
for a bit and I think that's it yeah

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.939 
for a bit and I think that's it yeah
that's<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:17.629> discard<00:03:18.629> the<00:03:18.750> rest<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.199> opened

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
that's it so discard the rest and opened

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.369 
that's it so discard the rest and opened
one<00:03:20.190> final<00:03:20.639> pack<00:03:20.819> guys<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.329> that<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.019> gonna<00:03:22.230> be

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510
