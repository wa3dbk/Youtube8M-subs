00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.529
 The main component of make-up is Jennifer 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.420
 lopez smooth glossy leather and golden 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.890
 flour oh and in the autumn such makeup will be 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.380
 look like never win on 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.210
 tanned skin well let's start in 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.519
 If you do not have a base for a person with 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.560
 the effect of shine does not matter girls just 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.730
 mix your favorite take and cream and 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.590
 cream highlighter 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.420
 and make your face look healthy and 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.840
 smooth suggest using tonal 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.030
 fluid 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.160
 I have from gerlen fool meer who 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.600
 gives the skin the shine we need and 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.280
 By the way, he does not need to use 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.010
 because in itself is very 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.420
 persistent now let's move on with the quality 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.770
 base i will use the shadows from 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.180
 meybellin color tattoo in the fortieth 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.800
 shades to the word 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.800
 i have also adjusted my eyebrows 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.890
 then put the shade golden peach 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.930
 shade from eyelash line to eyelid fold 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:16.550
 my case is a stunning shadow from 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:17.810
 catrice room 450 a century fold i would 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.119
 apply dark brown matt 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.119
 shade and its pallet its coins 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.210
 and then a shade twice as lighter 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.100
 rattling the border up under the brow you 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.750
 you can put a little highlighter but in 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.369
 in my case, I emphasize even more 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.720
 its small overhang therefore 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.290
 I leave this area practically 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.570
 intact 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.610
 to give even more blink of an eye 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.740
 take a brilliant shade of champagne and 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.600
 I will put it on top of our golden a 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.680
 also add his inner corner of the eyes 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.680
 for greater expressiveness 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.549
 then you can add eyeliner but then 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.500
 you have to work hard over 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.659
 cilia because jay lo they always 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.219
 long volumetric for her image she 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.080
 usually uses false eyelashes but 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.300
 we will not do that because our 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:16.420
 aim to do makeup as much as possible on 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:18.519
 strong skin dzhe lo brown enough 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.440
 thanks to her Latin American roots and 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.630
 of course by tanning but if you donâ€™t 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.880
 chocolate do not despair you here 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.920
 will help bronzer or powder for two 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.480
 tones darker than your skin tone i 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.489
 I will apply all over the oval face 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.489
 shading all the lines up 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.150
 then literally add a little bit 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.250
 a peach shade of blush and of course 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.210
 additionally on the cheekbones back of the nose and 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.210
 chin will put a highlighter 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.830
 we 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.870
 with this makeup, the emphasis on the lips will be 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.120
 superfluous therefore I only slightly emphasize 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.040
 lip contour of mind with a pencil from art visage 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.360
 and then put a peach lipstick 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.360
 pink tint from liver 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.650
