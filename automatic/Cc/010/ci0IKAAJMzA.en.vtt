00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.650
 actually I did not want a movie about 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.020
 This machine will stop you 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.950
 monument represents but you wanted it 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:18.029
 please beforehand here 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:19.949
 that karl device is the only one in total 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.470
 There were six brothers in the family 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.619
 this self-propelled moerser adam eva 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.900
 toro the lock and become someone 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.820
 mean that he is a girl but if 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.710
 a girl will have such a cannon 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.469
 it automatically to a young the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.780
 Projecting went on in 1935 years 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.719
 at the company Rheinmetall Musik das 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.360
 device 0 40 project was created by artillerie 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.870
 General Karl Becker therefore rendered the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.780
 nickname caro the prototype became 19 37 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.910
 harder put the moerser 55 tons 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.070
 then this was decided on one 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.530
 mount the chassis and then even 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.370
 to armor as result one got one 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.859
 weight of 126 tons 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.629
 here is the run he is huge me 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.519
 could just crawl inside 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.619
 but I could fall down there and me 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.590
 break something 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.810
 this is a 600 mm monster with pulled 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.659
 run shot the circa with a grenade 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.479
 two tons at a distance of about 7 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.090
 kilometers the grenade flies 49 seconds 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.830
 I'll stand there for 40 seconds 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.830
 so you can see how long it is 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.430
 it was only ten seconds ago 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.750
 leave us while they are still flying 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.930
 I estuary no concrete grenade 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.390
 now 2000 170 kilograms weeks 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.030
 220 meters in the second at the high 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.600
 expansive grenade 283 meters in the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.330
 second 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.409
 the barrel is a monoblock horizontal 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.659
 karl closure with a 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:55.250
 cylindrical wedge separate charge 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.810
 This is done manually 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.810
 to judge behind the vertical 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.500
 it does not work 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.800
 Smells area up 70 degrees left 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.319
 and right there was no right 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.900
 possibility so only who chassis the 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.880
 bÃ¶rse has a mocking recoil 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.690
 To dampen this one has one 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.730
 Two -stage rear shock absorber developed 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.950
 Here one sees the recoil does not drive 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.940
 only by running back but the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.200
 complete sledges 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.730
 the front is here and not here in 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.510
 shot position became backwards 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.510
 hit 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.860
 Brazil where we got the grenades 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.610
 carries very heavy 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.230
 the crew consisted of 16 men 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.780
 ammunition stock eight shot new 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.310
 separate cargo demo channel followed two 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.520
 transporter rebuilt armor can 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.100
 ask 4 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.550
 the shot was shot in 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.610
 ten minutes after reaching the 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.130
 fight position needs the karl circa 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:24.450
 three hours to get ready 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.450
 to come very productive 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.910
 We understood night was the loading process 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.459
 tedious and laborious with 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.830
 The help of this direction was the 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.560
 two tons bullet on this rail 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.360
 placed and with the rod inside 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.459
 deferred afterwards follows one 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.980
 propellant and the sleeve here you can see 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.280
 the good fixation of the sleeve important 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.280
 these 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.230
 that transport karl to 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.210
 place of use was a special invites some 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.460
 wrote that was taken down in full 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.010
 on special railway platforms 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.840
 distributed our transported on site 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.120
 they were then reassembled 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.400
 in half a day or night 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.040
 could move independently more often 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.960
 you can see photos of the transport the carls 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.210
 with complete on special platforms 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.820
 by the way, solve the attachment 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:50.000
 there are available for this we come to 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.710
 This engine drive here 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.250
 twelve-cylinder liquid-cooled pure 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:59.490
 diesel engine daimler-benz 507 with one 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.860
 power of 750 ps that was the engine 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.360
 By the way, the torpedo offered the 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.370
 same engine was after one 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.370
 machining on this tank installed 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.040
 the engine was connected to the 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.260
 rear room mechanical gearbox with 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.300
 three hydro series connected in series 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.290
 transformers was the speed 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:25.310
 modest with 10 110 km / h I climb 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:29.390
 here in the driver's seat 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.390
 that 's about it 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.520
 the landing gear on one side consisted of 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.060
 eleven small rollers five lintels 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.970
 roll back cock and roll 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.720
 Front drive shaft type of the suspension 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:50.330
 turn cushioning chains width 500 mm 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:56.650
 Incidentally, the external dimensions of the device are 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:06:02.810
 We print a length 11.370 mm wide 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:05.000
 3160 mm height 4780 mm before the shot 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.100
 the moerser became stabilized 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:16.910
 put the belly with the help 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:20.530
 special hydraulic lumber behind 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:23.650
 This door still access to the motor 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.820
 Here you can see the three bars good 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:31.090
 also good to see the mechanisms 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.090
 raising and lowering the landing gear 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.990
 I think, why is that ? 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.480
 welded so when the device gets 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.260
 on the belly puts it all roll 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.260
 in this position 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.870
 when the construction and the 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.040
 there are many 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.870
 contending ask 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.570
 on the one hand because of the impact strength 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.250
 fixing high concrete walls up to 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.000
 three and a half feet thick 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.550
 by beating 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.470
 the explosion was hellish though 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.430
 the succession and the sensitivity 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.810
 There were many occasions for criticism 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.700
 stoppages and inhibitions 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.570
 Chassis defects were at the 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.970
 Agenda 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.310
 the devices have pressed the city 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.350
 Sevastopol and Warsaw were shot at 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.240
 in one shot, the smoke cloud rose in 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.250
 a height of 170 meters 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:34.640
 As you can see very well in the suvs double 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:36.890
 chronicles but they were there on the 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.280
 Moers is adam in reality is 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:43.490
 it rather not so the Soviet army 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:46.700
 captured three devices number 1 4 and 6 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:49.340
 adam tor and moves to the report of 

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:51.530
 troops only the cdu succumbed to one 

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:55.090
 restoration probably dates back 

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:58.420
 the cannon of adam and ivan d of c 

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.420
 That's it
