00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.210 

all<00:00:01.439> right<00:00:01.620> today<00:00:01.770> we're<00:00:01.920> going<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.159> be

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
all right today we're going to be

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.120 
all right today we're going to be
talking<00:00:02.399> about<00:00:02.520> Duramax<00:00:03.090> crankshaft<00:00:03.689> I<00:00:04.130> have

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
talking about Duramax crankshaft I have

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.430 
talking about Duramax crankshaft I have
two<00:00:05.339> over<00:00:05.520> here<00:00:06.350> of<00:00:07.350> mine<00:00:07.649> that<00:00:07.890> uh<00:00:07.950> that<00:00:08.700> broke

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
two over here of mine that uh that broke

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.190 
two over here of mine that uh that broke
on<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.710> one<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.550> reason<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.000> broke<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.480> if

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
on this one the reason it broke is if

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.890 
on this one the reason it broke is if
you<00:00:13.349> look<00:00:13.500> here<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.700> dowel<00:00:14.940> pins<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.570> it

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
you look here the dowel pins on it

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.470 
you look here the dowel pins on it
they<00:00:16.650> sheared<00:00:16.980> off<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:18.029> that's<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.359> they

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
they sheared off and that's how they

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.650 
they sheared off and that's how they
come<00:00:18.660> from<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.900> factory<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:20.090> the<00:00:21.090> harmonic

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
come from the factory so the harmonic

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.439 
come from the factory so the harmonic
balancer<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:23.100> timing<00:00:23.970> gear<00:00:24.000> they<00:00:24.269> just

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
balancer and the timing gear they just

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.880 
balancer and the timing gear they just
started<00:00:24.689> free<00:00:24.900> spinning<00:00:25.170> throwing

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
started free spinning throwing

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.310 
started free spinning throwing
everything<00:00:26.130> out<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.490> time<00:00:26.840> you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:27.990> break<00:00:28.140> all

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
everything out of time you can break all

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.830 
everything out of time you can break all
kinds<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.519> one<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.359> managed<00:00:30.779> to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
kinds of this one that I managed to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.229 
kinds of this one that I managed to
break<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.380> don't<00:00:32.309> know<00:00:32.369> why<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.579> broke<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.090> think

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
break I don't know why I broke I think

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.299 
break I don't know why I broke I think
it's<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.600> weak<00:00:33.809> casting<00:00:34.260> when<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.130> broke

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
it's just a weak casting when it broke

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.330 
it's just a weak casting when it broke
in<00:00:35.489> two<00:00:35.579> places<00:00:38.780> and<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.590> weird<00:00:40.800> thing<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.040> is

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
in two places and the weird thing is is

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.500 
in two places and the weird thing is is
this<00:00:41.460> one<00:00:41.670> had<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.210> dowel<00:00:42.930> pins<00:00:43.260> still<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.829> it

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
this one had the dowel pins still on it

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.200 
this one had the dowel pins still on it
so<00:00:45.829> it's<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.460> freak<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.760> nature<00:00:47.820> while

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
so it's just a freak of nature while

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.180 
so it's just a freak of nature while
that<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.510> broke<00:00:48.690> put<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.680> over<00:00:49.710> here

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
that one broke put this one over here

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.610 
that one broke put this one over here
you<00:00:51.199> know<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:52.320> good<00:00:52.850> it's<00:00:53.850> got<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.530> bent<00:00:55.530> of

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
you know it's good it's got the bent of

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.830 
you know it's good it's got the bent of
the<00:00:55.680> machine<00:00:56.010> shop<00:00:56.280> has<00:00:56.610> two<00:00:56.910> five<00:00:57.360> millimeter

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the machine shop has two five millimeter

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.580 
the machine shop has two five millimeter
keys<00:00:58.399> that<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.789> put<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.120> there<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.480> uh<00:01:00.590> it's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
keys that are put in there and uh it's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.950 
keys that are put in there and uh it's
very<00:01:01.739> critical<00:01:02.309> putting<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> keys<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.780> there

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
very critical putting the keys in there

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.990 
very critical putting the keys in there
because<00:01:04.650> if<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.890> put<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.369> too<00:01:05.519> far<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
because if you put it too far to the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.670 
because if you put it too far to the
left<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.540> if<00:01:06.659> they<00:01:06.780> machine<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.229> too<00:01:07.350> far<00:01:07.590> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
left or if they machine it too far to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.890 
left or if they machine it too far to
the<00:01:07.740> right<00:01:07.920> either<00:01:08.549> or<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.689> throws

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the right either or and it just throws

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.690 
the right either or and it just throws
your<00:01:10.049> timing<00:01:10.409> off<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.799> Hickam<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.580> be

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
your timing off and Hickam it can be

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.640 
your timing off and Hickam it can be
critical<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:13.020> get<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.320> done<00:01:13.470> make

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
critical so if you do get it done make

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.499 
critical so if you do get it done make
sure<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.909> you're<00:01:15.119> getting<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.390> done

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
sure you this you're getting it done

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.499 
sure you this you're getting it done
right<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:17.390> something<00:01:18.390> weird<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:19.729> on<00:01:20.729> these

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
right and something weird is on these

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.170 
right and something weird is on these
Duramax<00:01:22.080> motors<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.640> harmonic<00:01:24.150> balancer

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
Duramax motors the harmonic balancer

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.679 
Duramax motors the harmonic balancer
actually<00:01:24.930> has<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> straight<00:01:26.090> keyhole<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.509> a

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
actually has a straight keyhole for it a

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.460 
actually has a straight keyhole for it a
key<00:01:28.140> way<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.700> when<00:01:29.700> they<00:01:29.820> machine<00:01:30.180> them<00:01:30.470> they

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
key way and when they machine them they

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.929 
key way and when they machine them they
make<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.950> where<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.189> looks<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.579> how<00:01:32.759> it's

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
make it to where it looks like how it's

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.690 
make it to where it looks like how it's
supposed<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.299> go<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.439> don't<00:01:34.530> know<00:01:34.740> why<00:01:34.920> GM

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
supposed to go but I don't know why GM

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.060 
supposed to go but I don't know why GM
decided<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.270> put<00:01:36.450> too<00:01:36.630> little<00:01:36.920> too<00:01:37.920> little

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
decided to put too little too little

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.819 
decided to put too little too little
freakin<00:01:38.640> dowel<00:01:39.180> pins<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.900> there<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.500> hold<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
freakin dowel pins in there to hold the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.310 
freakin dowel pins in there to hold the
whole<00:01:40.979> prank<00:01:41.250> shaft<00:01:41.570> because<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:42.720> higher

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
whole prank shaft because at higher

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.600 
whole prank shaft because at higher
horsepower<00:01:43.680> levels<00:01:44.159> higher<00:01:44.970> rpms<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:47.490> know

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
horsepower levels higher rpms you know

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.929 
horsepower levels higher rpms you know
 just<00:01:48.090> start<00:01:48.360> spinning<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:49.700> right<00:01:50.700> here

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
 just start spinning this right here

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.760 
 just start spinning this right here
the<00:01:51.210> harmonic<00:01:51.659> balancer<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.229> crankshaft

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
the harmonic balancer and crankshaft

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.030 
the harmonic balancer and crankshaft
here<00:01:53.100> will<00:01:53.250> actually<00:01:54.200> share<00:01:55.200> those<00:01:55.500> off<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
here will actually share those off and

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.850 
here will actually share those off and
they'll<00:01:56.460> everything<00:01:56.969> just<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.450> spinning

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
they'll everything just just be spinning

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.620 
they'll everything just just be spinning
it's<00:01:58.860> what<00:01:59.009> happened<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.490> one<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:00.540> know

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
it's what happened to this one you know

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.999 
it's what happened to this one you know
and<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.899> didn't<00:02:01.170> know<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.590> kept<00:02:01.860> running

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
and I didn't know it and I kept running

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.920 
and I didn't know it and I kept running
it<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.700> everything<00:02:03.119> was<00:02:03.270> off<00:02:03.390> balance<00:02:03.570> and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
it and everything was off balance and

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
blocks they're pretty much junk in my

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.910 
blocks they're pretty much junk in my
opinion<00:02:51.950> because<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.120> mains<00:02:53.620> we<00:02:54.620> actually

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
opinion because the mains we actually

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.290 
opinion because the mains we actually
checked<00:02:55.190> them<00:02:55.340> in<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.750> front<00:02:57.050> main<00:02:57.230> and

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
checked them in the the front main and

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.900 
checked them in the the front main and
the<00:02:59.300> middle<00:02:59.600> main<00:03:00.190> what<00:03:01.190> happened<00:03:01.610> was<00:03:01.730> they

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
the middle main what happened was they

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.640 
the middle main what happened was they
started<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.420> egg<00:03:02.570> shape<00:03:02.840> because<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:03.530> know

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
started the egg shape because you know

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.350 
started the egg shape because you know
that<00:03:03.860> crank<00:03:04.100> shafts<00:03:04.340> not<00:03:04.430> exactly<00:03:04.940> light<00:03:05.180> so

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
that crank shafts not exactly light so

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.570 
that crank shafts not exactly light so
it<00:03:05.480> started<00:03:05.780> wobbling<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.380> it<00:03:07.010> distorted

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
it started wobbling and it distorted

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.220 
it started wobbling and it distorted
them<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:07.910> mean<00:03:08.390> I'm<00:03:08.510> sure<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.989> could<00:03:09.140> get

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
them I mean I'm sure that you could get

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.290 
them I mean I'm sure that you could get
it<00:03:09.350> machined<00:03:09.709> you<00:03:10.459> know<00:03:10.580> honed<00:03:10.880> out<00:03:11.090> with<00:03:11.269> a

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
it machined you know honed out with a

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.319 
it machined you know honed out with a
bigger<00:03:12.070> bigger<00:03:13.070> size<00:03:13.400> but<00:03:13.670> it's<00:03:13.820> not<00:03:13.970> worth<00:03:14.180> it

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
bigger bigger size but it's not worth it

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.880 
bigger bigger size but it's not worth it
you<00:03:14.390> know<00:03:14.570> I<00:03:14.600> can<00:03:14.660> get<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.200> can<00:03:15.560> get<00:03:15.680> another

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
you know I can get a I can get another

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.030 
you know I can get a I can get another
