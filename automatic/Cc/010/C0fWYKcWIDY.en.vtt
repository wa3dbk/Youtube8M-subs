00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
I'm doing better kind of avoiding the

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:31.980

rush<00:05:30.099> in<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:30.430> pocket<00:05:30.849> and<00:05:31.030> checking<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.810> ball

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
rush in the pocket and checking the ball

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.189 
rush in the pocket and checking the ball
down<00:05:32.199> if<00:05:32.349> it's<00:05:32.440> not<00:05:32.650> my<00:05:33.280> first<00:05:33.430> second<00:05:33.789> read

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
down if it's not my first second read

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.899 
down if it's not my first second read
and<00:05:35.199> that<00:05:35.470> helps<00:05:35.710> everybody<00:05:35.949> know<00:05:36.370> puts

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
and that helps everybody know puts

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:38.610 
and that helps everybody know puts
pressure<00:05:37.060> on<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:37.389> defense<00:05:37.539> to<00:05:37.990> cover<00:05:38.380> a<00:05:38.470> lot

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
pressure on the defense to cover a lot

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.140 
pressure on the defense to cover a lot
of<00:05:38.650> people<00:05:39.009> and<00:05:39.190> I<00:05:39.400> mean<00:05:39.580> we<00:05:39.699> keep<00:05:39.880> the<00:05:40.000> ball

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
of people and I mean we keep the ball

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.779 
of people and I mean we keep the ball
moving<00:05:40.180> keep<00:05:40.659> the<00:05:40.780> tempo<00:05:41.110> up<00:05:41.320> and<00:05:41.789> that's

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
moving keep the tempo up and that's

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.550 
moving keep the tempo up and that's
probably<00:05:42.940> what<00:05:43.210> most<00:05:43.419> improved<00:05:43.870> all<00:05:44.349> right

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
probably what most improved all right

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.310 
probably what most improved all right
that's<00:05:44.800> it<00:05:44.949> 2014<00:05:46.380> 247<00:05:48.180> top247<00:05:49.320> quarterback
