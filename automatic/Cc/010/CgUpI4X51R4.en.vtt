00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
is aluminum and the s3 is plastic so you

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.670 
is aluminum and the s3 is plastic so you
see<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.009> kind<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.369> frosted<00:01:38.670> aluminum

different<00:04:21.299> looks<00:04:21.780> like<00:04:26.240> actually<00:04:27.560> one<00:04:28.560> other

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
different looks like actually one other

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:36.050 
different looks like actually one other
thing<00:04:29.040> we<00:04:29.160> need<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.370> check<00:04:33.560> is<00:04:34.730> I<00:04:35.730> think<00:04:35.790> that

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
thing we need to check is I think that

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.290 
thing we need to check is I think that
this<00:04:36.150> one<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.630> u1<00:04:36.900> pro<00:04:37.110> has<00:04:37.320> bluetooth<00:04:41.300> yeah

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
this one the u1 pro has bluetooth yeah

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.720 
this one the u1 pro has bluetooth yeah
so<00:04:42.450> this<00:04:42.540> one<00:04:42.720> has<00:04:42.810> bluetooth<00:04:44.900> and<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:47.370> ps3

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
so this one has bluetooth and the ps3

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:55.010 
so this one has bluetooth and the ps3
does<00:04:48.060> not<00:04:48.210> have<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.510> truth

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.999 

so<00:04:55.530> that<00:04:55.740> one<00:04:55.860> does<00:04:55.979> not<00:04:56.099> have<00:04:56.160> bluetooth

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
so that one does not have bluetooth

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.619 
so that one does not have bluetooth
another<00:04:59.009> thing<00:04:59.310> that's<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.180> different

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:00.629 
another thing that's the different

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:05.260 
another thing that's the different
that's<00:05:00.810> different<00:05:00.960> is<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.949> viewing<00:05:02.580> angle

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.689 

sorry<00:05:06.270> yeah<00:05:06.720> this<00:05:07.229> is<00:05:07.379> a<00:05:07.409> IPS<00:05:08.220> screen<00:05:08.310> so<00:05:08.520> as<00:05:08.639> a

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
sorry yeah this is a IPS screen so as a

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.330 
sorry yeah this is a IPS screen so as a
180<00:05:09.270> degree<00:05:09.360> degree<00:05:09.690> angle<00:05:10.259> where<00:05:11.039> this<00:05:11.159> is

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
180 degree degree angle where this is

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.300 
180 degree degree angle where this is
178<00:05:12.090> degrees<00:05:12.830> the<00:05:13.830> spring<00:05:14.069> realize

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
178 degrees the spring realize

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.710 
178 degrees the spring realize
resolution<00:05:14.909> is<00:05:15.000> a<00:05:15.060> little<00:05:15.270> bit<00:05:15.360> different<00:05:15.629> as

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
resolution is a little bit different as

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.860 
resolution is a little bit different as
well<00:05:17.569> this<00:05:18.569> is<00:05:18.750> 1024<00:05:19.500> x<00:05:19.710> 600<00:05:20.550> this<00:05:21.330> one's<00:05:21.539> 10

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
well this is 1024 x 600 this one's 10

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.309 
well this is 1024 x 600 this one's 10
sorry<00:05:22.770> 1280<00:05:23.340> by<00:05:24.030> 800<00:05:26.870> so<00:05:27.870> that<00:05:28.080> we<00:05:28.199> have

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
sorry 1280 by 800 so that we have

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.140 
sorry 1280 by 800 so that we have
different<00:05:28.830> pixel<00:05:29.069> resolutions<00:05:29.639> the<00:05:29.909> speaker

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
different pixel resolutions the speaker

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.089 
different pixel resolutions the speaker
here<00:05:30.449> on<00:05:30.630> the<00:05:31.169> one<00:05:31.380> parole<00:05:31.620> is<00:05:33.770> is<00:05:34.770> on<00:05:34.979> the

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
here on the one parole is is on the

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:39.589 
here on the one parole is is on the
front<00:05:36.860> so<00:05:37.860> there<00:05:38.490> are<00:05:39.090> a<00:05:39.120> little<00:05:39.300> bit<00:05:39.449> this<00:05:39.539> is

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
front so there are a little bit this is

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:40.969 
front so there are a little bit this is
the<00:05:39.750> IPS<00:05:40.139> screen<00:05:40.259> which<00:05:40.500> is<00:05:40.620> basically<00:05:40.860> the

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
the IPS screen which is basically the

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:46.070 
the IPS screen which is basically the
same<00:05:41.130> that<00:05:41.340> the<00:05:41.520> ipad<00:05:43.099> to<00:05:44.099> use<00:05:44.280> this<00:05:44.460> but<00:05:45.360> the

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
same that the ipad to use this but the

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.240 
same that the ipad to use this but the
viewing<00:05:46.349> angles<00:05:46.590> are<00:05:46.710> really<00:05:47.099> similar<00:05:48.800> and<00:05:49.800> so

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
viewing angles are really similar and so

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.890 
viewing angles are really similar and so
to<00:05:50.310> wrap<00:05:50.639> up<00:05:50.819> this<00:05:50.940> review<00:05:51.270> let's<00:05:51.509> just<00:05:51.690> check

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
to wrap up this review let's just check

00:05:51.900 --> 00:06:00.459 
to wrap up this review let's just check
out<00:05:52.940> the<00:05:53.940> weight<00:05:54.180> difference<00:05:58.580> this<00:05:59.580> is<00:05:59.789> a

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:00.469 
out the weight difference this is a

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:05.270 
out the weight difference this is a
point<00:06:01.469> 343<00:06:02.280> for<00:06:02.849> the<00:06:03.050> cook<00:06:04.050> kilograms<00:06:04.919> for<00:06:05.130> the

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
point 343 for the cook kilograms for the

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:14.240 
point 343 for the cook kilograms for the
ps3<00:06:06.240> and<00:06:06.810> this<00:06:07.710> is<00:06:08.960> point<00:06:10.940> 336<00:06:12.650> so<00:06:13.650> the<00:06:13.800> UN<00:06:14.039> pros

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
ps3 and this is point 336 so the UN pros

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:20.809 
ps3 and this is point 336 so the UN pros
a<00:06:14.279> little<00:06:14.699> bit<00:06:14.900> lighter<00:06:18.560> battery<00:06:19.560> size<00:06:19.830> that

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:20.819 
a little bit lighter battery size that

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:27.439 
a little bit lighter battery size that
you<00:06:20.849> want<00:06:21.000> pro<00:06:21.360> has<00:06:21.599> a<00:06:22.819> 35<00:06:25.940> 35<00:06:26.940> hundred<00:06:27.240> million

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449 
you want pro has a 35 35 hundred million

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:33.769 
you want pro has a 35 35 hundred million
that<00:06:27.539> battery<00:06:27.960> and<00:06:29.419> and<00:06:30.419> the<00:06:31.409> s3<00:06:31.740> has<00:06:31.889> a<00:06:32.779> 3200

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:33.779 
that battery and and the s3 has a 3200
