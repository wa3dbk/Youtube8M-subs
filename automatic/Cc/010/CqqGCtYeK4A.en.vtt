00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
to have to West lowes now the only

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.940 
to have to West lowes now the only
reason<00:01:08.640> I'm<00:01:09.119> doing<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.630> West<00:01:09.869> Los<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.229> because

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
reason I'm doing to West Los is because

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.100 
reason I'm doing to West Los is because
what's<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.220> low<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.520> pretty<00:01:11.760> slow<00:01:12.060> now<00:01:12.930> let's

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
what's the low is pretty slow now let's

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.980 
what's the low is pretty slow now let's
be<00:01:13.229> real<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.610> setting<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.700> monster<00:01:15.060> even<00:01:15.869> in

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
be real here setting a monster even in

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.810 
be real here setting a monster even in
this<00:01:16.080> day<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.259> age<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.979> still<00:01:17.189> pretty<00:01:17.400> slow

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
this day and age it's still pretty slow

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.080 
this day and age it's still pretty slow
so<00:01:18.259> we<00:01:19.259> only<00:01:19.619> chose<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.159> do<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.460> what<00:01:20.729> slow<00:01:20.880> only

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so we only chose to do to what slow only

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.450 
so we only chose to do to what slow only
because<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.840> fact<00:01:22.020> if<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.100> was<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> little

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
because of that fact if it was a little

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.620 
because of that fact if it was a little
bit<00:01:23.580> slower<00:01:23.820> format<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.330> would<00:01:24.450> definitely

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
bit slower format I would definitely

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.100 
bit slower format I would definitely
consider<00:01:24.930> three<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.100> find<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.490> optimal<00:01:27.110> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
consider three but I find to optimal to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.260 
consider three but I find to optimal to
