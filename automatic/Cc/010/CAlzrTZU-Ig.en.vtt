00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 and then the same as the game increases 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.580
 angelo 15 yesterday were 17 and now it's over 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.759
 who will be able to help the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.559
 map of the game in time because of Pedro 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.719
 come rescue we are here today to 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.760
 to make a video about masters in rap 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.210
 basically the opposite problem about the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.890
 video that we talked about the euro having the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.810
 risk more than four players 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.939
 if you want to see had like another video 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.439
 there is a certain average number of players 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.149
 same thing always four to six 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.980
 players that most of the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.680
 adventure is ready to give you more 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.570
 than this can cause chaos 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.790
 The problem of having more players is 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.140
 difficulty to maintain order and for now 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.390
 we do not want to see a classroom with 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.640
 everyone quietly order in this case 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.170
 It's all because of the good progress of the game and it was 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.670
 the general use of history to 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.829
 all players without anyone 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.829
 need to be feeling out or excluded 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:05.909
 brother will get you the dust 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.159
 Let's go to the first conversation tips with 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.659
 your players do seem pretty basic but 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.369
 it is very important that you leave the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.990
 clear things for rafa made party for 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.850
 everyone learn their chips well in 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.470
 their characters term for all 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.390
 on the scene paying attention to the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.280
 game will be good at any table and if 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.259
 want to take care of themselves in a way that 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.939
 this in another body a conversation there 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.979
 in the middle group can already disrupt 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.659
 bit the scene now did in two three 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.600
 four conversations parallel to the same 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.180
 time 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.460
 it just when you have the second 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.470
 body and get ready to improvise 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.570
 if the average group player can speak 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.970
 she is in a dialogue scene and change 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.100
 all calculating that 12 players can 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.840
 end up doing the scenes and maybe it's 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.820
 good to go back to activity for everyone to 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.650
 no one is feeling useless if 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.140
 prepare to have the fighting scenes 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.390
 as needed she goes there and offers 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.470
 for you it is not good that the dragon is like 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.840
 jap 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.780
 Okay, it was actually a god in disguise. 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.920
 it turns its natural and near shape 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.390
 third parties and for groups of 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.610
 while in medium or small groups 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.300
 separating the group can mean two 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.070
 things 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.330
 premature death players who 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.700
 find challenges for a group 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.110
 and the slowness of the game as the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.790
 messi has to be split with the tension 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.250
 between players but a large group 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.780
 sd can remove the danger of the challenges and 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.650
 also advance the story in a way that 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.209
 different 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.100
 the fifth edition from within helping the 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.200
 time to tivit for example you can 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.570
 literally separate the group divided the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.850
 players in different rooms knows type 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.950
 recreation of the playground or keep the boys 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.300
 team has already thought whether the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.430
 adam johnson has just arrived 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.750
 at the same time as the boss or until the 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.690
 different time with low as if 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.790
 was the fucking cavalry ro zone our 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.050
 can not continue on the scholarship or here 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.550
 Are you looking for a room? 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.790
 comfortable space 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.340
 occurs that this is absolutely 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.840
 important you do not want you or your 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.130
 uncomfortable players 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.860
 this means that finding a place 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.330
 support everyone would be ideal can be 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.280
 a ballroom with those voices 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.110
 Plastic chairs and tables if hotel 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.459
 can play in a cafeteria since it is 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.140
 essential that you have access to 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.700
 you eat and drink not if you just 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.870
 partially violating so you can 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.790
 eat healthy things 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.980
 just can not play dying of hunger or 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.690
 headquarters of the 5th material for all would be 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.670
 ideal that each player had his own 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.100
 This material means that having 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.080
 pencil or pencil eraser and who knows 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.299
 some data keep trying to tinker with 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.390
 virtual material lot to the table so 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:40.889
 you will arrive in front of the castle and 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.290
 the doors if there are numerous ways of 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.180
 improve game flow 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.379
 the tips you might not use 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.180
 forget to tell us how they 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.709
 have worked for you and you can 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.060
 tell you how you handle it 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.060
 good lady and good stores
