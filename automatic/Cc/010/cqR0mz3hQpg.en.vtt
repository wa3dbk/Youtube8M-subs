00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.859
 hello we're all in black ops 2 other 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:07.120
 time and this time we are in zombies at 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:10.800
 which one I 'm not going up 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.800
 going down any little thing 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.630
 It's so low and I do not know why it's 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.820
 changes 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.820
 know he has changed from here to 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.490

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.600

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.770
 I have to change 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.200
 and now that I have to go back to 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.560
 change 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.990
 good 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.990
 where lower 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.260
 there is 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.260
 it's hard for you I can not cover this truth 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:01.350
 so balls around here is what I 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.350
 I'm afraid it takes away 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:11.039
 fuck down here 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.039
 how many hours does this gun have why 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.659
 although I do not have a knife either in 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.350
 this key 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.350
 aside 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.350
 logical advanced I do not know that there are not 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.200
 controls 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:33.280
 in class on the right I do not know that in 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.280
 no side of the body and so I like 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.260
 throw secondary w 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.600
 where is where is it has to be 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.230
 I had to be in control 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.520
 to be as control here what is 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.320
 this 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.450
 with these things they do not change 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.380
 the night 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.240
 Faith 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.530
 and it is already 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.530
 I believe not the truth 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.479
 careful now that you have colleagues 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.560
 in front of your face 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.890
 damn car 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.780
 the slash is better correlation 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:22.099
 like you said more insulted and I 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.099
 also to the truth 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:28.470
 I really like you supposedly 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.380

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.280

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.640

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.640
 hardcore 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.660
 walesa 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.890

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.579
 I'm crazy I'm crazy 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.079
 good thing is that here you can search me 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.359
 anywhere this is the most 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:02.069
 motive that calls past a escopetilla 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:04.109
 how much it costs 500 is nothing for me 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.410
 to see where there are people and 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:09.160
 Connecticut 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.160

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
 as well 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.890

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:46.099

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.650

 four rounds 

00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:57.569
 worth the cost that is my first game 

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:57.569
 of zombies 

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:03.280
 If you want it to improve or start

 play a little zombies like 

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.560

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.760
 but good 

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.760
 would have to rise is
