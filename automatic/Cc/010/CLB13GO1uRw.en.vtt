00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.970

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.250
 put in the batter bowl 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.250
 knead it into cool crumbs with cool hands 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.530
 clean a lemon well and grate the 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.530
 yellow skin 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.550

 quickly knead into a flexible dough and shape 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.039
 a ball 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.820
 if the dough feels a bit dry then add 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.820
 some ice cold water 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.850

 rest in the fridge for half an hour 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.429
 cover the bottom of a spring form with 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.679
 a diameter of 28 centimeters with 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.679
 baking paper and grease the edges with butter 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.880
 take the dough ball out of the fridge 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.909
 the work surface with flour and roll the dough 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.270
 to a round piece of about 32 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.270
 centimeters 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.610
 cover the spring form with the dough piece 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.610
 cut away the excess dough 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.580
 prick with fork holes in the bottom and 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.330
 put the mold in the fridge for half an hour 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.250
 Preheat the oven to 200 degrees 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.619
 take the cake base out of the refrigerator 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.539
 cover the bottom with baking paper and sprinkle 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.280
 there is a pack of dried beans or lentils 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.140
 about 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.489
 take the pie bottom for about ten minutes 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.819
 in the oven 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.250
 this is what you call blind baking heel 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.970
 300 grams of white chocolate in small 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.970
 pieces 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.520
 remove the pie bottom from the oven and 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.040
 remove the baking paper with the beans and 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.400
 Bake in the bottom for about 5 minutes 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.400
 the oven 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.450
 remove the bottom from the oven and 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.440
 lower the oven temperature to 180 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.480
 degrees 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.610
 put the white chocolate in a bowl and 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.019
 hang it in a slightly larger pan with 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.790
 boiling water 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.849
 make sure the water could not 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.140
 touches let the chocolate melt gently 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.530
 this technique 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.090
 we call 500 grams under Marie 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.129
 crÃ¨me fraiche and the melted chocolate 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.129

 scoop the chocolate mixture on the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.099
 cake base and bake the cake about 25 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.099
 minutes in the oven 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.230
 the filling does not have to be completely firm 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.710
 and may still be what the 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.710
 be fun 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.790
 let the cake cool 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:03.599
 chop 100 grams of white chocolate into small 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.599
 pieces and melts on bvlgari 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.060
 quickly cover the cake with a thin layer 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.060
 layer of chocolate 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.270
 the stream with 2 tablespoons powdered sugar 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.269
