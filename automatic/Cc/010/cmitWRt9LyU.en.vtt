00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.460
 this only goes 250 but then with it 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.010

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.970
 yes lighter so has much more builder 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.280
 1000hp ticks and probably also 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.390
 just 1000 pounds or twelve hundred 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.390
