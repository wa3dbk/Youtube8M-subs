00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.649
 the most talk television we are 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.360
 doing something very fast are the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.740
 butters during each shortbread that 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.700
 it has a lot of difference with a bread that 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.679
 cited in so if this leads 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.360
 butter the whole process is different 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.850
 because yesterday we believe butter and sugar 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.660
 although here I'm going to make egg and sugar 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.660
 I'm going to do 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.910
 4 eggs I thought cost 4 pesos with 48 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.789
 cents now sugar and a cup of 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.540
 sugar 200 gave the weights with 40 cents 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.010
 the table is costing that I'm going to 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.410
 to do there I'm going to let it be 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.210
 lift normally to flush and 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.250
 thereafter 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.489
 while I'm going to put flour and powder 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.489
 to bake 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:19.560
 the eavesdropping of the pound is already there 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.380
 now the cost of butter gives in 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.690
 this recipe is going to yield for 24 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.880
 pieces and I want to show you that in the 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.710
 market they are going to find this one that has 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.710
 12 pieces that cost 20 pesos 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.659
 120 pesos 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.390
 the quality that's why 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.760
 because if there are 220 metal signals it's 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.170
 much harder 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.600
 if it is for 2 2 3 4 5 6 for 4 2 for 24 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.160
 for these recipes to be reaching 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.220
 I needed to see the size of 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.140
 they also have to do with so 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.740
 great that they do not get there no longer 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.060
 can enter the clear oven 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:20.340
 and there is another one that is more professional 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.340
 good that they are 35 pieces 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:44.950
 and there we are going to sing the theme of 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:47.459
 novel 'it was for to mount them 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.190
 we have a mold cited that the number is 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.470
 72 has traditional 72 that is with the 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.180
 that we did these 9 and put together read little with 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.700
 it a little fat that I have here 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.610
 If I want to talk with a little bit like 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.970
 my molds oil mom normal oil 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.560
 end or it can be shortening also 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.420
 form vegetable teak 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.890
 the full 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.670
 of the lots although they have undertaken 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:16.020
 at 180 degrees very well with how long 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:20.140
 I paid them 25 to 30 minutes 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.810
 depending on the environment to look here 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.880
 already mix the baking powder with flour 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.680
 and here I'm going to put the milk with the 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.740
 yeast when we have yeast and of 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.810
 Milk milk we have 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.890
 We have 20 grams of fresh yeast 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.890
 they are 80 cents 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:44.680
 I already have here but I put it very fast 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.680
 obviously to gain time very well and 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.440
 what I'm going to do is put the oil in 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.440
 Thread shape when we have oil 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.430
 any oil now here is a 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.890
 trick sometimes we do it by steps 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.520
 but I can do this give you more 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.440
 speed put all the oil does not pass 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.960
 nothing does not lower the shake low 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.080
 then I put the milk with the yeast 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.820
 that this lukewarmness and they will see the shake continues 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.820
 still raised has not been lowered 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.629
 although they have bits of yeast 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:29.190
 obviously it mixes well 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:31.530
 recipes for the flour to be incorporated 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.090
 finally we have already the flour that already 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.500
 has the baking powder 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.450
 and I'm going to empty it 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.020
 if they wanted monthly we have two 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.020
 courses 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.280
 this is not sponsored by sagarpa and the snics 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:52.660
 which are two institutions that promote 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.940
 the consumption of these elites to command 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.800
 great a point of quelites on 3 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.800
 August and a purslane course 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.500
 the restaurant that we have the truth 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.930
 Remember back dates is 3 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.139
 August 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.699
 August 10, talk to the school and 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.949
 they have the phones so they 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.590
 enroll in your free course where they go 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:29.060
 to learn obviously how to cook them if 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:32.690
 you have to go to elites or you have to go to 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.699
 try very good here is telling us 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.300
 that the total cost of the recipe is 21 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.960
 pesos 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:42.139
 rim of kilograms 600 grams the weight for each 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.259
 piece is 70 grams the performance of 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:48.680
 pieces are 24 and the cost of piece by 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:51.410
 goals is 90 cents more than the k 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:56.150
 hall is 99 cents and then 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:58.690
 then a peso that they have here is this 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.690
 printer 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:16.639
 three quarters I put him more are 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.499
 70 70 75 grams 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.830
 tell me what is the secret so that it does not 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:25.310
 join and rise this recipe has to 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.979
 stay at this level here and there if I want 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.099
 I can add a little touch more 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:30.099
 is 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:38.340
 I can put you loved the oven must 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:40.319
 be prewarmed ladies to a 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.580
 average temperature 180 preparation 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:44.159
 been 20 minutes 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.740
 the baked for 25 minutes and the 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:48.740
 difficulties 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.740
 bridges 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.849
 in 45 pesos that we will increase 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.849
 always which is at 200 percent 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:06.210
 it costs me a peso to people in three 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:10.219
 weights but we're going to beat you are 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.219
 bigies this estimate 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:19.169
 these are more expensive and returning to the 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:20.039
