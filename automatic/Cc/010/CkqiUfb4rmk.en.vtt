flavoring<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:22.510> again<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:23.660> is<00:03:23.870> just<00:03:24.110> to

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
flavoring to this again this is just to

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.960 
flavoring to this again this is just to
get<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.440> maize<00:03:24.620> nice<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.519> swollen<00:03:25.730> it

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
get the maize nice and swollen it

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.479 
get the maize nice and swollen it
doesn't<00:03:26.239> actually<00:03:26.330> flavor<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:27.019> maize<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.500> the

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
doesn't actually flavor the maize it the

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.120 
doesn't actually flavor the maize it the
flavor<00:03:28.700> burns<00:03:29.030> out<00:03:29.300> so<00:03:29.660> I'm<00:03:30.530> going<00:03:30.830> to<00:03:30.860> use<00:03:31.010> the

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
flavor burns out so I'm going to use the

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.360 
flavor burns out so I'm going to use the
rest<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.459> that<00:03:31.519> anyways<00:03:32.830> but<00:03:33.830> you<00:03:33.950> can<00:03:34.070> see<00:03:34.220> my

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
rest of that anyways but you can see my

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.150 
rest of that anyways but you can see my
boil<00:03:34.640> is<00:03:34.820> nice<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.180> low<00:03:35.650> it's<00:03:36.650> not<00:03:36.860> very<00:03:37.480> rapid

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
boil is nice and low it's not very rapid

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.410

of<00:06:24.990> time<00:06:25.170> to<00:06:25.200> absorb<00:06:25.620> that<00:06:25.770> flavor<00:06:26.070> and<00:06:26.250> what

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
of time to absorb that flavor and what

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.920 
of time to absorb that flavor and what
