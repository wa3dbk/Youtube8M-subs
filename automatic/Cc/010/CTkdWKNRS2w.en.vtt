00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
right and so then you just let it kind

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.509 
right and so then you just let it kind
of<00:01:04.170> go<00:01:04.379> down<00:01:04.409> all<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.890> way<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.250> bottom

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
of go down all the way to the bottom

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.960 
of go down all the way to the bottom
here<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.820> then<00:01:06.320> it<00:01:07.320> goes<00:01:07.500> into<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.970> 90

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
here and then it goes into this 90

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.160 
here and then it goes into this 90
degree<00:01:09.270> angle<00:01:09.799> right<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.189> cut<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> hole<00:01:12.170> this

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
degree angle right and I cut a hole this

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.679 
degree angle right and I cut a hole this
is<00:01:13.350> drilled<00:01:14.100> into<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.549> drilled<00:01:15.360> into<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
is drilled into the drilled into the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.179 
is drilled into the drilled into the
back<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.140> coop<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.650> bottom<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.040> coop

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
back of the coop the bottom of the coop

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.090 
back of the coop the bottom of the coop
but<00:01:17.729> basically<00:01:18.110> this<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.170> 90<00:01:19.470> degree<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.890> food

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
but basically this is 90 degree the food

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.870 
but basically this is 90 degree the food
will<00:01:20.250> feed<00:01:20.430> down<00:01:20.610> into<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> 90<00:01:21.360> degree<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
will feed down into the 90 degree and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.960 
will feed down into the 90 degree and
into<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> actual<00:01:24.420> coop<00:01:25.549> see<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.610> there

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.740 
under the nest boxes the only thing is
is<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.430> need<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.670> cover<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.150> area<00:01:33.570> right

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
here with something so that it blocks

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.350 
here with something so that it blocks
the<00:01:36.810> rainwater<00:01:37.740> from<00:01:37.920> getting<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:39.090> feeder

I got right here and just make the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.880 
I got right here and just make the
plastic<00:01:50.600> make<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> plastic<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.619> how<00:01:52.680> this

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
plastic make the plastic see how this

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.010 
plastic make the plastic see how this
this<00:01:53.729> piece<00:01:53.939> over<00:01:54.119> here<00:01:54.329> has<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> little

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
this piece over here has like a little

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.319 
this piece over here has like a little
lip<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.409> plastic<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.430> make<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.759> lip<00:01:57.030> come

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
lip of plastic just make that lip come

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.209 
lip of plastic just make that lip come
in<00:01:57.509> further<00:01:57.899> underneath<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.979> make<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
in further underneath this and make the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.980 
in further underneath this and make the
pipe<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.549> little<00:01:59.729> longer<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:00.750> underneath

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
pipe a little longer but it's underneath

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.109 
pipe a little longer but it's underneath
the<00:02:01.079> nest<00:02:01.350> boxes<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.040> there'll<00:02:02.219> be<00:02:02.250> no<00:02:02.430> rain<00:02:02.729> to

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
the nest boxes so there'll be no rain to

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.090 
the nest boxes so there'll be no rain to
get<00:02:03.299> into<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:04.049> curved<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.710> way<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
get into it and it's curved that way the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.070 
get into it and it's curved that way the
opening<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:09.179> rainwater<00:02:09.390> won't<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:09.989> able

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
opening so the rainwater won't be able

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.300 
opening so the rainwater won't be able
to<00:02:10.170> hit<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.679> side<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.160> would<00:02:11.250> be

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
to hit it on this side and it would be

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.619 
to hit it on this side and it would be
less<00:02:11.520> likely<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.940> come<00:02:12.209> in

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
less likely to come in

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.050 
less likely to come in
on<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.200> side<00:02:13.409> but<00:02:14.280> if<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.519> gets<00:02:14.609> in<00:02:14.849> there<00:02:14.969> it

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
on this side but if it gets in there it

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.250 
on this side but if it gets in there it
gets<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.299> there<00:02:15.450> I'll<00:02:15.540> have<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.810> clean<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.109> out

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
gets in there I'll have to clean it out

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.280 
gets in there I'll have to clean it out
but<00:02:16.560> anyway<00:02:16.999> so<00:02:17.999> that<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:19.079> the<00:02:19.650> feeder<00:02:21.290> pipe

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
but anyway so that is the feeder pipe

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:31.959 
but anyway so that is the feeder pipe
idea<00:02:24.980> let's<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.129> better<00:02:26.280> look<00:02:26.370> at<00:02:26.730> it

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:31.969 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:38.149 

yeah<00:02:32.969> neat<00:02:34.519> to<00:02:35.519> me<00:02:35.670> it's<00:02:35.849> neat<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.989> it's<00:02:37.950> gonna

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
yeah neat to me it's neat and it's gonna

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.540 
yeah neat to me it's neat and it's gonna
save<00:02:38.579> a<00:02:38.969> world<00:02:39.480> for<00:02:39.719> my<00:02:39.840> for<00:02:40.230> my<00:02:40.319> chickens

so<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.840> cap<00:02:46.079> there<00:02:46.409> holds<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.189> feed<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.639> and

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
so that cap there holds the feed in and

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.849 
so that cap there holds the feed in and
when<00:02:48.900> they<00:02:49.019> go<00:02:49.139> in<00:02:49.349> there<00:02:49.439> they're<00:02:49.650> gonna<00:02:49.769> be

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
when they go in there they're gonna be

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.069 
when they go in there they're gonna be
pecking<00:02:50.219> inside<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.939> there<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.389> stuff<00:02:51.659> and

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
pecking inside of there and stuff and

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.009 
pecking inside of there and stuff and
you<00:02:52.769> know<00:02:52.889> I'm<00:02:53.129> gonna<00:02:53.340> be<00:02:53.400> moving<00:02:53.819> it<00:02:53.909> out<00:02:54.060> you

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
you know I'm gonna be moving it out you

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.069 
you know I'm gonna be moving it out you
know<00:02:55.139> they<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.409> to<00:02:55.560> spread<00:02:55.859> it<00:02:56.099> so<00:02:56.849> it<00:02:57.840> won't

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
know they like to spread it so it won't

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:05.270 
know they like to spread it so it won't
come<00:02:58.169> out<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:59.430> this<00:02:59.609> end<00:02:59.879> of<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.060> pipe<00:03:04.280> so

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
come out of this end of the pipe so

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.709 
come out of this end of the pipe so
that'll<00:03:05.760> save<00:03:05.969> some<00:03:06.180> room<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.540> then<00:03:06.629> I'm

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
that'll save some room and then I'm

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.500 
that'll save some room and then I'm
thinking<00:03:07.109> about<00:03:07.739> putting<00:03:08.099> water<00:03:08.909> bucket<00:03:09.389> with
