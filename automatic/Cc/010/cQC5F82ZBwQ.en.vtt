00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.370
 marakasi 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.259
 today I would like to show you the fight on 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.830
 square-5 on the map of Karelia 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.490
 here we are under attack mode and this is a heading super 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.740
 headlights in it i show only fights where on 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.199
 formally a huge amount of silver and 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.210
 This fight is not an exception our square-5 with a nickname 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.019
 terminus mage we again be shoot 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.410
 babe 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.320
 and it's just great he is a lot on farm 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.710
 and plus he still knows how to target 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.399
 weaknesses of opponents on that for this 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.230
 headings just fine general ap-5 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.770
 quite frequent guest 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.039
 This rubric is probably due to the fact 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.750
 that all the same tank is good well at least 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.739
 least if you can 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.750
 aiming weak points it is no longer 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.300
 bad so our hero is storming the bathroom 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.760
 there he meets quite a lot 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.519
 opponents 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.610
 1 for some reason I went kvass and of course it 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.799
 immediately killed but in general he at least 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.010
 some kind of shelter 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.560
 his corpse does that too not so 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.420
 and bad 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.450
 IS-3 enemy there from the center tried 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:27.350
 get around she already left because someone 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:31.710
 he will throw well here is another enemy 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.320
 unlucky of course, he then went on 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.250
 I grabbed the center from everyone like I already 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.470
 said that this position is never very 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.610
 make a video about superpershing 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.430
 parsing error in the novice and that's just 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.149
 and from demonstrated what is really 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.869
 it is dangerous to drive and so the enemies leave 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:02:00.299
 the board of IS-3 was somehow distracted for some reason 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.560
 on someone else and you can sometimes him 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.590
 aim us 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.340
 the enemies warmed on Isa the third seemingly 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:12.420
 and, in general, they stand here that 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.599
 for at 5 just perfect conditions gun 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.420
 him with a rather bad break-through but in 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:22.019
 such conditions are excellent for all 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.540
 punch there already enemies here is not very 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.260
 they see it for too long 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.030
 aim out hiwatt is-3 unlucky 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.120
 goes to the hangar 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.150
 because too carelessly playing 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.480
 you can not leave the board friends is very 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.030
 such a bad mistake well only good and 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.090
 the tank does not happen but you do not do that at all 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.180
 in no case can it stand here center 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.390
 and our hero will be fine with him now 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.810
 vytselivat NLD centered kakayato 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.840
 Armor is here from 3 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.480
 going to the same side began to turn around 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:06.810
 apparently he had a recharge and in general 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:09.060
 he gets a bun of course here to him 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.030
 probably say that everything is pretty easy 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.510
 the enemies themselves are substituted in but friends is 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.130
 rubric basically show exactly 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.920
 great farm and they were substituted 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.760
 enemies or not, this is not really 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.930
 important but mostly i really don't like 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.109
 show fight where 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.260
 of a cage nye tanks but if they are in 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:34.769
 Tokyo Stress and Don't Show Especially 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.650
 in fact Ferdinand seems to be alive 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.989
 smart little 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.600
 especially he, too, play here strange 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.920
 look drove off means not africa 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.549
 well, a monk was a great success here 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.400
 of 2 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:55.290
 the scout behind is trying under the red 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.920
 Generally did not shoot I do not know why 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.709
 general on the 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.270
 distracted by allies who are down there 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.510
 those 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:07.050
 but just fine in the stern he manages to 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.630
 low damage and even set fire lucky 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.740
 to our heroes, I notice that in 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.310
 In many battles, this is precisely the key luck. 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.340
 factor 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.540
 applying a large amount of damage well 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.130
 and here the same thing let's just 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.390
 pretty weird that's why go 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.830
 board why so strange to play but 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:34.410
 Generally it is not important if such 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.740
 there would be no players then 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.620
 probably excellent results in our 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.340
 fights all would probably be so 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.540
 medium cheeks and so there are still 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.960
 last enemies they are somewhere near here 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:55.820
 last shone on d1 here 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:58.650
 the royal tiger glows and ahead 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.160
 somebody else should be ours well 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:05.250
 look at the hero how much hp he felt 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.190
 lost anything that's great really 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:12.120
 can he be afraid to tank now not 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:15.380
 all this is worth nothing can be more under 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.210
 farm look great here 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.540
 he drove a little to the left 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:26.390
 because of which of course he was not punched into the board 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:30.290
 at that angle yaga 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:33.890
 also c so we are not the most armored and 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:36.350
 it is perfectly possible to punch it with badges and 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:40.170
 great still to myself 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:43.050
 loans earn even yaga not 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:46.650
 breaks for vani strange this one 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.260
 the engine broke our hero just 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:54.470
 watch shot after shot about him and 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:06:00.110
 it does not break too very lucky but 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:01.060
 This is basically good and hit the video in 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.840
 tele 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.590
 Well, in general, there were only t29 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.940
 horin 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:13.490
 but its possible principle 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:17.620
 Last but not least 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:25.360
 and kill even if no one comes down there 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:28.970
 I can not get all the same escaped t29 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.610
 lucky in general, then such a fight 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:35.270
 hero earns 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:39.700
 the whole warrior is pretty good and now we 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:44.540
 see the result is quite a good farm 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:45.170
 so here is the result of the battle of 6 frags 3250 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.780
 of experience 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:51.880
 there probably still gave a bit of stock 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:57.320
 experience yes 541 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:07:00.140
 208 thousand loans from them net 189000 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.840
 very cool probably our hero 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.570
 rejoiced after this fight right away 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:10.660
 accumulated on some tank or on another 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:15.800
 Anything 7 thousand damage is quite cool 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:18.680
 Well, in general, a great fight and if you 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:21.320
 there are some good fights on premium 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.720
 please send the equipment 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.370
 and maybe you will fall into this category. 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.370
 thank you dear friends
