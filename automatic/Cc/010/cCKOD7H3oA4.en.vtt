which I'm getting ready to demonstrate
so<00:01:15.479> first<00:01:15.720> what<00:01:15.990> we're<00:01:16.110> going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.650> we're

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
so first what we're going to do is we're

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.859 
so first what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.920> open<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> case<00:01:17.610> we're<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
going to open up the case we're going to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.740 
going to open up the case we're going to
take<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.830> inlet<00:01:20.220> hose<00:01:20.270> drop<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.450> into<00:01:21.570> the

take the inlet hose drop it into the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.940 
take the inlet hose drop it into the
source<00:01:21.960> water<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.439> we're<00:01:22.560> going<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> filter

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
source water that we're going to filter

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.090 
source water that we're going to filter
which<00:01:23.460> happens<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.000> our<00:01:24.090> swimming<00:01:24.330> pool

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
which happens to be our swimming pool

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.910 
which happens to be our swimming pool
then<00:01:26.100> we're<00:01:26.400> going<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.549> take<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.680> clean<00:01:28.680> water

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
then we're going to take the clean water

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.800 
then we're going to take the clean water
which<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.369> our<00:01:29.490> blue<00:01:29.670> hose<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.570> we're<00:01:30.689> going

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
now that drain line you can either put

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.700 
now that drain line you can either put
it<00:01:45.270> back<00:01:45.509> into<00:01:45.750> your<00:01:45.869> source<00:01:46.200> water<00:01:46.409> which

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
it back into your source water which

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.230 
it back into your source water which
would<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> swimming<00:01:47.369> pool<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.119> can

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
would be the swimming pool or you can

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.940 
would be the swimming pool or you can
let<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.420> drain<00:01:48.720> away<00:01:48.840> where<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.799> going

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
let it drain away where it's not going

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.260 
let it drain away where it's not going
to<00:01:50.009> contaminate<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> rest<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.939> system

to contaminate the rest of the system

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.819 
to contaminate the rest of the system
it's<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> small

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
it's up to you if you have a small

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.319 
it's up to you if you have a small
amount<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.159> water<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.460> recommend<00:01:53.970> putting<00:01:54.149> it

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
amount of water I recommend putting it

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.969 
amount of water I recommend putting it
back<00:01:54.450> into<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.810> source<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.530> way<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.770> can

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
back into the source that way you can

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.770 
back into the source that way you can
continue<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.430> recycle<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:57.000> until<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.630> get

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
continue to recycle it until you get

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.780 
continue to recycle it until you get
enough<00:01:57.960> clean<00:01:58.170> water<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:59.250> we'll<00:01:59.340> put<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.549> in

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
enough clean water so we'll put that in

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.499 
enough clean water so we'll put that in
there<00:01:59.969> now<00:02:00.899> what<00:02:01.799> we're<00:02:01.890> going<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.040> use<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.640> 140

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
there now what we're going to use is 140

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.069 
there now what we're going to use is 140
watt<00:02:03.659> solar<00:02:03.899> panel<00:02:04.020> today<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.360> hard

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
watt solar panel today and it's a hard

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.859 
watt solar panel today and it's a hard
panel<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.459> lightweight<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.450> very

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
panel that is lightweight and very

portable<00:02:10.140> easy<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.739> maneuver<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:11.730> also

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
portable easy to maneuver but we also

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.430 
portable easy to maneuver but we also
can<00:02:12.360> power<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.750> unit<00:02:13.020> with

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
can power the unit with

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.910 
can power the unit with
flexible<00:02:13.950> panel<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.880> we<00:02:14.970> have<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.800> 120<00:02:16.800> watt

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
flexible panel so we have a 120 watt

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.390 
flexible panel so we have a 120 watt

and it fits in the case and can be

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.260 
and it fits in the case and can be
carried<00:02:25.650> just<00:02:25.830> about<00:02:26.040> anywhere<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:27.000> we<00:02:27.120> have<00:02:27.240> a

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
carried just about anywhere so we have a

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.670 
carried just about anywhere so we have a
lot<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.540> different<00:02:27.900> options<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.290> power<00:02:28.500> this

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
lot of different options to power this

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.070 
lot of different options to power this
unit<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.610> I'm<00:02:29.970> going<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.270> go<00:02:30.360> ahead<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.810> plug

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
unit so I'm going to go ahead and plug

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.070 
unit so I'm going to go ahead and plug
it<00:02:31.230> up<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.560> turn<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:31.980> on<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.340> get<00:02:32.400> started<00:02:32.730> and

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
it up and turn it on and get started and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.820 
it up and turn it on and get started and
and<00:02:34.080> then<00:02:34.230> I'll<00:02:34.320> talk<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.530> little<00:02:34.590> bit<00:02:34.800> more

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
and then I'll talk a little bit more

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.910 
and then I'll talk a little bit more
about<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.250> system<00:02:36.470> okay<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.500> here<00:02:37.800> we<00:02:37.890> are

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
about the system okay so here we are

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.190 
about the system okay so here we are
I've<00:02:38.370> got<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.820> solar<00:02:39.120> panels<00:02:39.480> running<00:02:39.630> like<00:02:40.170> I

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
I've got the solar panels running like I

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.960 
I've got the solar panels running like I
said<00:02:40.470> it's<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.740> it's<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.130> somewhat<00:02:41.460> cloudy<00:02:41.700> day

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
said it's a it's a somewhat cloudy day

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.640 
said it's a it's a somewhat cloudy day
we<00:02:42.210> do<00:02:42.330> have<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.480> little<00:02:42.660> bit<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:42.810> sunlight<00:02:43.140> so

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
we do have a little bit of sunlight so

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.650 
we do have a little bit of sunlight so
we're<00:02:43.800> generating<00:02:44.100> maximum<00:02:44.640> pressure<00:02:44.850> of

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
we're generating maximum pressure of

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.410 
we're generating maximum pressure of
approximately<00:02:45.780> 100<00:02:46.440> psi<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.040> as<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.120> can<00:02:48.210> see

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
approximately 100 psi and as you can see

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.660 
approximately 100 psi and as you can see
our<00:02:48.570> drain<00:02:48.840> water<00:02:49.050> is<00:02:49.350> coming<00:02:50.070> out<00:02:50.250> quite<00:02:50.640> a

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
our drain water is coming out quite a

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.850 
our drain water is coming out quite a
bit<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.690> have<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:52.380> is<00:02:52.530> our<00:02:52.650> fresh<00:02:52.830> water

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
bit and we have this is our fresh water

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.200 
bit and we have this is our fresh water
outlet<00:02:53.370> I'm<00:02:53.520> going<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.730> go<00:02:53.790> ahead<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.000> put<00:02:54.120> it

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
outlet I'm going to go ahead and put it

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.420 
outlet I'm going to go ahead and put it
in<00:02:54.270> here<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.650> we'll<00:02:55.650> fill<00:02:55.830> up<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:56.040> glass<00:02:56.280> of

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
in here and we'll fill up this glass of

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.610 
in here and we'll fill up this glass of
water<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:56.850> can<00:02:57.060> have<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.210> nice<00:02:57.330> glass<00:02:57.620> after

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
water so I can have a nice glass after

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.160 
water so I can have a nice glass after
the<00:02:58.710> demonstration<00:02:59.340> so<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.600> unit<00:03:00.840> will<00:03:01.050> do

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
the demonstration so this unit will do

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.580 
the demonstration so this unit will do
up<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.350> about<00:03:01.620> 75<00:03:02.130> gallons<00:03:02.520> per<00:03:02.670> day<00:03:03.320> it<00:03:04.320> will

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
up to about 75 gallons per day it will

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.090 
up to about 75 gallons per day it will
take<00:03:05.010> out<00:03:05.270> salt<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:06.510> contamination<00:03:07.100> again

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
take out salt and contamination again

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.480 
take out salt and contamination again
brackish<00:03:08.880> water<00:03:09.150> not<00:03:09.930> full<00:03:10.200> seawater<00:03:10.650> however

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
brackish water not full seawater however

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.160 
brackish water not full seawater however
if<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.910> are<00:03:11.940> an<00:03:12.150> area<00:03:12.510> where<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:12.750> have<00:03:12.780> salt

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
if you are an area where you have salt

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.930 
if you are an area where you have salt
in<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.350> system<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:14.130> will<00:03:14.280> take<00:03:14.490> it<00:03:14.610> out<00:03:14.730> it

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
in the system it will take it out it

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.660 
in the system it will take it out it
removes<00:03:15.210> all<00:03:15.330> chlorine<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.080> odor<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.470> taste

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
removes all chlorine and odor and taste

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.880 
removes all chlorine and odor and taste
it<00:03:17.670> removes<00:03:18.060> any<00:03:18.510> contaminants<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.230> that

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
it removes any contaminants that that

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.610 
it removes any contaminants that that
may<00:03:20.010> make<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.280> sick<00:03:20.900> like<00:03:21.900> viruses<00:03:22.500> and

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
may make you sick like viruses and

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
may make you sick like viruses and
bacteria<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.770> obviously<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:26.190> Sun

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
bacteria so it and obviously the Sun

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.540 
bacteria so it and obviously the Sun
Goes<00:03:26.880> Down<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.330> it<00:03:27.900> shuts<00:03:28.200> off<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:28.709> what<00:03:29.400> we're

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
Goes Down and it shuts off so what we're

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.229 
Goes Down and it shuts off so what we're
doing<00:03:29.760> now<00:03:29.940> is<00:03:31.160> we'll<00:03:32.160> wait<00:03:32.340> for<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.850> Sun<00:03:33.209> to

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
doing now is we'll wait for the Sun to

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.320 
doing now is we'll wait for the Sun to
come<00:03:33.360> back<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:33.930> there<00:03:34.860> we<00:03:35.040> go<00:03:35.190> we're<00:03:35.940> back<00:03:36.120> up

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
come back and there we go we're back up

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.870 
come back and there we go we're back up
and<00:03:36.420> running<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:37.440> if<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.980> power<00:03:38.160> goes<00:03:38.280> out<00:03:38.670> and

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
and running so if the power goes out and

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.449 
and running so if the power goes out and
you're<00:03:39.150> complete<00:03:39.480> without<00:03:39.720> power<00:03:40.070> this<00:03:41.070> unit

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
you're complete without power this unit

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.640 
you're complete without power this unit
will<00:03:41.610> allow<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:42.600> filter<00:03:42.840> up<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.170> 75

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
will allow you to filter up to 75

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.710 
will allow you to filter up to 75
gallons<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.160> water<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.580> day<00:03:44.760> during<00:03:45.360> full

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
gallons of water in a day during full

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.300 
gallons of water in a day during full
Sun<00:03:45.989> and<00:03:46.580> which<00:03:47.580> is<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:48.110> pretty<00:03:49.110> pretty<00:03:50.100> neat

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
Sun and which is a pretty pretty neat

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.240 
Sun and which is a pretty pretty neat
advantage<00:03:51.060> because<00:03:51.480> if<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.590> power<00:03:52.800> goes<00:03:52.890> out

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
advantage because if the power goes out

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.800 
advantage because if the power goes out
and<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.519> have<00:03:53.730> no<00:03:53.880> water<00:03:54.120> or<00:03:54.269> no<00:03:54.600> way<00:03:54.750> to

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
and you have no water or no way to

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.080 
and you have no water or no way to
filter<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:55.320> then<00:03:55.890> you're<00:03:56.280> stuck<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:56.790> this

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
filter it then you're stuck and this

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.880 
filter it then you're stuck and this
allows<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:57.660> just<00:03:57.840> use<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.019> solar<00:03:58.380> panel<00:03:58.769> in

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
allows you to just use a solar panel in

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.850 
allows you to just use a solar panel in
this<00:03:58.980> unit<00:03:59.360> and<00:04:00.360> of<00:04:01.080> course<00:04:01.290> here<00:04:01.530> we<00:04:01.560> have

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
this unit and of course here we have

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.890 
this unit and of course here we have
about<00:04:02.430> thirty<00:04:02.670> five<00:04:02.850> thousand<00:04:03.450> gallons<00:04:03.810> of

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
about thirty five thousand gallons of

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.770 
about thirty five thousand gallons of
drinking<00:04:04.110> water<00:04:04.500> as<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:04.739> potential<00:04:05.610> so<00:04:06.510> we've

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
drinking water as a potential so we've

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.810 
drinking water as a potential so we've
been<00:04:06.930> running<00:04:07.080> for<00:04:07.230> about<00:04:07.350> three<00:04:07.709> minutes<00:04:08.010> and

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
been running for about three minutes and

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.060 
been running for about three minutes and
as<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.420> can<00:04:09.600> see<00:04:09.810> I've<00:04:10.019> got<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.230> nice<00:04:10.590> glass<00:04:10.860> of
