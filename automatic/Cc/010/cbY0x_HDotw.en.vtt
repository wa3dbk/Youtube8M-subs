00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:16.160
 hello power number 15 you're here I 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:17.540
 am here it's super perverse pp you 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.040
 find that jean your pc or your mac 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.540
 is not terrible the ben audio output 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.980
 yes you are right it is not terrible 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.270
 I have a solution and look at it 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.710
 squarely in my hand the solution nothing 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.180
 it's very small it's all mimi it's 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.279
 a mini takkal explains it knows that 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.689
 the dac the dax to audio converter which 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.669
 converts digital signals into 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.260
 analog signals it's simple 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.760
 it's all stupid we plug this thing 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.770
 on the usb port of your mac your pc 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.330
 you send the music inside 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.070
 so if possible even 24 files 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.380
 bit 192 kilometers that it is compatible 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.750
 24 goals and 92 km is simply 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.470
 wants to get the sound here so converted 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.970
 in analog 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.080
 you have a super and helmet shots 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.120
 you can hook up a hi-fi system and 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.530
 it's way better than most 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.820
 sounds that come out of the marks and 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.970
 pc i can tell you right now and 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.870
 it costs 149 euros is the doc xls of 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.020
 audio cambridge 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.270
 the dac magic come with me as chemistry 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.890
 as schumi we enter the jazz club on 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.229
 young club is the old whiskey galore 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.610
 this is the wagg why because in 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.859
 power taking note of the never seen 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.509
 still a small mixer for 

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:14.899
 the general public called the pioneer 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.579
 we go cube and mixed with this table of 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.899
 Mixing and stand face like 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.329
 professionals you need for this a 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.240
 mac on the mac you put a super 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:25.850
 software or more cheerful precisely with the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.590
 mac in sync an ipod an iphone or 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.719

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.639
 so my friend marc ryan who is 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.049
 currently on the screen to mix a small 

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.280
 little of course not worth the materials 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.719
 super professional 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.280

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.020
 general public for home for its 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.579
 buddies it's really not bad these little 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.469
 mixers hold more so I'll you 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.999
 propose in power is the first 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.999
 I 'm happy it's great 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.050
 I like traveled a lot and here I have 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.850
 squarely taken the mobile grandfather 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.619
 direction oups amsterdam 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.880
 why amsterdam because a super 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.040
 according to amsterdam that number of beds 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.780
 is it the integrators' fair 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.670
 be careful in two words the kids not 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.290
 only one knows the integrations you have 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.670
 big screens you to the screens for 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.350
 them for the screens cinemas 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.850
 for the stadiums actually it's great on 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.900
 the epson stand to present a pair 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.610
 of glasses that is absolutely 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.450
 revolutionary and who will arrive in 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.310
 france in may 2014 at 699 euros these are 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.720
 the two-way animals that are not due is 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.190
 immersive by the way it's not sony or 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.200
 aids is better than that 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.880
 it's augmented reality then 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.530
 downright why because look at the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.910
 thing a slap power we see at 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.300
 through the glasses and over my 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.010
 world 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.989
 I also have the name the world that is 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.980
 imposed by the glasses simply 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.690
 by epson ie it's a 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.280
 system that work under android 4.0 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.810
 It's as if you were looking at 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.880
 through a tablet your tablet is going 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.780
 look through your world through 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.640
 the tablet is absolutely fabulous 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.280
 so the craft was endowed with a small 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.450
 camera via a gyroscope ya ya compasses 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.680
 lots of things inside so 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.880
 just fabulous at the same time y'a 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.810
 maybe calculations so that the image does not 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.190
 not leave all sides when you 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.049
 do this i the censors sensors 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.220
 favre i love this product i think that 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.660
 the future passes precisely by this 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.239
 augmented reality of google ice in 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.370
 are proof so in May 2014 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.650
 in France up to 13.9 euros you will 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.580
 the bete 200 the glasses actually 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.580
 augmented by epson 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.920
 you wait for them here they are 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.480
 the little movies on blu ray the pizza 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.470
 movie to top it all so good 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.280
 we start with a movie that I like 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.330
 a lot because I really like them 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.980
 Horror movies I like pinball 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.590
 maras in the evening before the video projector 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.180
 it's insidious number 2 remember 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.220
 the first insidious a family 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.420
 classic american kids all that 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.740
 who is attacked by guest posters 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.480
 which leads from all over the coast and 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.750
 good of this horrible out of this 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.550
 body 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.410
 and if this number two is exactly 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.370
 the same thing the family and think about being 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.380
 rid are the same actors 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.360
 think to be rid of but report 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.680
 badaboum the thorgen shoulder falls over 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.209
 an old woman of the very things 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.290
 good matches and really good is 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.700
 still a repetition of the 1 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.840
 but it's a very interesting thing 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.100
 in this film it is that she does not loop 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.870
 script that is made between the 1 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.450
 and 2 rather from 2 to 1 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.950
 it's amazing it's great we say 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.970
 but common sense they thought of all and 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.800
 a trilogy already when they turned 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.030
 so really for that a situation is worth 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.230
 the shot the blu ray very successful 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.060
 technically it's a beautiful image that 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.739
 was shot in 4k with a very 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.209
 percussive so I advise you to 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.500
 pinball your to be done by others 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.480
 girlfriends your boyfriend your mother your 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.480
 mother-in-law insidious evening 2 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.660
 you're going to tell yourself but how is this 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.880
 that power can find such films 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.320
 I will tell you they send me because 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.850
 that power and pizzas movie that 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.290
 begins to me an institution that the 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.919
 publishers who saw me all their 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.930
 z superb film series has a little b c 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.210
 the daubesque what and there I found a 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.890
 thing called global zombies taxed 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.510
 the craziest seriousness that ever seen 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.979
 imagine a guy who woke up 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.140
 again hollywood a morning etc a 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.210
 says oussama ben laden is not dead 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.620
 oussama ben laden has become a zombie 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.370
 but yes you do not dream then 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.930
 the story of this film absolutely 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.220
 delirious is a band of marines 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.630
 is in the desert and fighting 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.919
 obviously Taliban but the 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.700
 Taliban said off the aisles but 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.020
 when there they are so 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.640
 decomposed that shoots bench and all me 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.900
 I love I've already died of laughter and well 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.729
 sure the leader of these Taliban said 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.260
 this is the chief zombie who therefore 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.930
 ben laden who is not dead has become 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.860
 a Taliban leader of the Taliban are bi 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.880
 so there are scenes that are 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.380
 absolutely brilliant going on and 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.669

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.800
 bathe in the water that is being made 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.930
 attack the teeth of the sea by 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.000
 oussama ben laden in zombies you do not have 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.680
