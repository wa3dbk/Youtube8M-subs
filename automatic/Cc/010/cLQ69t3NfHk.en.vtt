00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.700
 and in three other best goals of the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.410
 week and nothing more guys but that you 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.710
 like and nothing we will see the goals as 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.710
 forever 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.650
 well he knows the boy I am conscious 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.500
 that there are only my few videos with the 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.510
 fc barcelona or voley in the top 3 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.340
 to mark with messi a pass from neymar 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.600
 online as you are looking up at the 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.690
 left that puts 0 2 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.310
 and just do not hit it there is a volleyball 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.780
 and entered through the entire ghost squad and 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.670
 I protect recording by entering 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.800
 there nothing could record it so 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.800
 nothing we go to the second goal of this week 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.960
 good guys you already know that in my channel 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.670
 Sometimes we see weird things 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.239
 I do not think this style is good 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.620
 funny because he looks at something good as if 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.809
 outside a little hat did not raise me 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.879
 ball from behind hit him and the thing is 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.110
 what then when he gets up is valdÃ©s 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.909
 when he gets up he throws the ball 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.800
 for inside does not give a little funny not 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.390
 the goal but good look where I 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.159
 when I saw him I kept saying 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.869
 I see what has come out not because the 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.190
 truth is that this has never happened to me 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.860
 the few times that has happened to me and I do not know 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.090
 well a curious goal not because doing 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.580
 what I have done the dribble that I have done and 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.899
 then hit and first after 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.170
 do that the goalkeeper spots note the 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.170
 sword 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.310
 and in the last goal of the week boy and 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.500
 his goal of ronaldo Christian but of 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.510
 missing but we were not creating others and not 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.040
 is needed but of play rehearsed 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.600
 although it has not been rehearsed because I 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.390
 I did it first I did not take a step 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.729
 there and then I will go as if it were me 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.229
 but when he hit the 38 before with 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.670
 as many missiles as you can see already 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.020
 that was the connection with a bit of 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.820
 because look until the repetition is 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.290
 Weighed but good does not matter 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.899
 thing is the goal where it enters because it is 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.070
 that hit him hard and there he entered by 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.390
 the whole squadron not for you to see that 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.830
 the plays rehearsed for the truth are 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.540
 they read better than many mistakes 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.310
 times so nothing I think you liked 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.509
 see you next week a greeting 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.050
 and until next time 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.050
 goodbye
