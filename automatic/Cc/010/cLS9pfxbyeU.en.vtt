00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
I love these and I think this is a

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.999 
I love these and I think this is a
little<00:04:27.930> different<00:04:28.110> than<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.590> one<00:04:28.710> I<00:04:28.740> already

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
little different than the one I already

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.279 
little different than the one I already
have<00:04:29.280> why<00:04:30.060> is<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.300> just<00:04:30.449> focusing<00:04:30.990> do<00:04:31.080> i<00:04:31.110> need

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
have why is it just focusing do i need

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.350 
have why is it just focusing do i need
to<00:04:31.379> touch<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.710> screen<00:04:31.919> there<00:04:32.639> we<00:04:32.729> go<00:04:32.849> I<00:04:33.060> think

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.779 
to touch the screen there we go I think
that's<00:04:33.509> better<00:04:33.659> um<00:04:34.229> because<00:04:34.919> these<00:04:35.190> are<00:04:35.400> like

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
that's better um because these are like

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.029 
that's better um because these are like
a<00:04:35.819> lot<00:04:36.060> smaller<00:04:36.449> than<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.870> other<00:04:36.900> tattoo<00:04:37.800> ones
