00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
side one over here and one over here I

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.990 
side one over here and one over here I
only<00:00:43.590> slide<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.100> corner<00:00:44.460> down<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.789> blade

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
only slide the corner down the blade

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.520 
only slide the corner down the blade
just<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:47.629> 45<00:00:48.629> degrees<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> blade

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
just like this 45 degrees to the blade

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.170 
just like this 45 degrees to the blade
see<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.950> would<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.219> parallel<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.969> blade

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
see this would be parallel to the blade

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.020 
see this would be parallel to the blade
that's<00:00:51.719> 90<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> blade<00:00:52.710> that's<00:00:53.039> 45<00:00:53.640> degrees

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
that's 90 to the blade that's 45 degrees

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.139 
that's 90 to the blade that's 45 degrees
tip<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.750> until<00:00:54.989> they<00:00:55.110> touch<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.820> then<00:00:56.820> slide

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
tip it until they touch and then slide

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.720 
tip it until they touch and then slide
down<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.510> blade<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> what<00:00:59.699> I

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
down the blade just like that so what I

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.330 
down the blade just like that so what I
would<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.300> slide<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:00.989> this

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
would do is just slide it like this

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.680 
would do is just slide it like this
don't<00:01:02.340> press<00:01:02.609> too<00:01:02.640> hard<00:01:02.820> about<00:01:03.180> an<00:01:03.420> eighth<00:01:03.570> of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
don't press too hard about an eighth of

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.750 
don't press too hard about an eighth of
a<00:01:03.780> pound<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.170> pressure<00:01:04.489> slide<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.610> down<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
a pound of pressure slide it down the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.480 
a pound of pressure slide it down the
other<00:01:06.060> side<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.619> if<00:01:07.740> you'll<00:01:07.950> watch<00:01:08.189> here

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
other side and then if you'll watch here

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.730 
other side and then if you'll watch here
I<00:01:08.520> come<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> tip<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.780> blade<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.200> I

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
I come to the tip of the blade and I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.440 
I come to the tip of the blade and I
slide<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.220> from<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> tip<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.970> blade<00:01:12.060> back

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
slide it from the tip of the blade back

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.039 
slide it from the tip of the blade back
towards<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.860> handle<00:01:14.509> then<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.540> turn<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.869> over

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
towards the handle then I turn it over

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.469 
towards the handle then I turn it over
and<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.350> same<00:01:16.619> thing<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.220> side<00:01:17.520> most

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479

top and how we do that is just like this

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.339 
top and how we do that is just like this
and<00:02:38.340> let<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.489> bump<00:02:38.760> right<00:02:38.970> on<00:02:39.150> through<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
and let it bump right on through the

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.320 
and let it bump right on through the
square<00:02:40.680> edges<00:02:42.560> on<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:44.250> tungsten<00:02:44.519> carbide<00:02:44.910> is

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
square edges on the tungsten carbide is

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.390 
square edges on the tungsten carbide is
what<00:02:45.690> does<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.110> work<00:02:46.260> slide<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.220> back<00:02:47.370> and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
what does the work slide it back and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.250 
what does the work slide it back and
forth<00:02:47.640> don't<00:02:48.090> push<00:02:48.299> hard<00:02:48.510> let<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.870> work<00:02:49.019> don't

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
forth don't push hard let it work don't

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.259 
forth don't push hard let it work don't
make<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.680> work<00:02:49.860> if<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.670> want<00:02:50.819> to<00:02:50.880> sharpen<00:02:51.090> a

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
make it work if you want to sharpen a

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.120 
make it work if you want to sharpen a
pair<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.510> pruners<00:02:51.810> like<00:02:52.140> this<00:02:52.349> is<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:52.739> simple

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
pair of pruners like this is so simple

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.890 
pair of pruners like this is so simple
because<00:02:53.280> all<00:02:53.579> we<00:02:53.760> have<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.090> do<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.360> slide<00:02:54.569> it<00:02:54.630> up

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
because all we have to do is slide it up

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.720 
because all we have to do is slide it up
the<00:02:54.930> blade<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.709> can<00:02:55.860> actually<00:02:56.040> just<00:02:56.430> set<00:02:56.610> it

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
the blade you can actually just set it

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.170 
the blade you can actually just set it
down<00:02:56.910> turn<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:57.930> way<00:02:58.819> then<00:02:59.819> you<00:02:59.940> tip<00:03:00.150> it

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
down turn it this way then you tip it

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.120 
down turn it this way then you tip it
down<00:03:00.420> sharpen<00:03:01.319> this<00:03:01.470> side<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:02.480> then<00:03:03.480> make<00:03:03.720> the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
down sharpen this side and then make the

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.819 
down sharpen this side and then make the
square<00:03:05.130> or<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.519> square<00:03:05.940> corner<00:03:06.329> square<00:03:06.690> all<00:03:07.680> you

square or a square corner square all you
have<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.130> do<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.549> get<00:03:08.700> those<00:03:08.940> sharp<00:03:09.299> is<00:03:09.480> to

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
have to do to get those sharp is to

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.449 
have to do to get those sharp is to
slide<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.049> Handy<00:03:10.380> sharp<00:03:10.620> up<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.160> down<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
slide the Handy sharp up and down the

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.910 
slide the Handy sharp up and down the
blade<00:03:11.670> now<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.599> might<00:03:12.840> consider<00:03:13.079> this<00:03:13.530> really

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
blade now you might consider this really
