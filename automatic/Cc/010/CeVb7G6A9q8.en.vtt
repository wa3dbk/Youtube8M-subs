00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.650
 for many years the mushrooms have been 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.720
 the basis of modern medicine but 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.310
 recently a species was discovered 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.200
 different that has conditioned and 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.480
 revolutionized the future of medicine 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.460
 although its scientific name is ganoderma 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.649
 lucidum this species is better known 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.660
 as a red mushroom the huge amount of 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.160
 concentrated nutrients in this fungus and 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.170
 the infinite helix of properties that 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.170
 owns have surprised scientists and 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.700
 media of all the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.280
 hannover more lucid is the king of the 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.780
 eyes the red mushroom the chalice of life 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.699
 the fungus does not have more properties 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.309
 Healing Surprises Scientists 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.469
 everyone cure the 20th century 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.929
 healing fungus over 200 conditions 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.149
 and it has shown amazing results 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.579
 by fighting more than 150 diseases 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.829
 autoimmune that attack the organs most 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.010
 important as the heart the pancreas 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.600
 the liver the respiratory tract 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.580
 including the lungs and the system 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.230
 nervous thousands of years ago the Chinese 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.820
 they discovered a red mushroom with 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.400
 miraculous properties that contributed 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.600
 energy improved health and prolonged 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.300
 the life of those who ate it 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.340
 regularly the ganoderma lucidum enjoys 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.900
 of special veneration in Asia where it 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.660
 has used in medicine 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.150
 as a medicine in japan they called it 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.190
 racing which means left of the 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.450
 spiritual potency and has also been 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.670
 described as the fungus of the 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.530
 immortality until recently this 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.600
 Mighty mushroom was booked in Asia 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.700
 only for the privileged classes but 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.860
 soon the consumption expanded to all the 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.050
 world and is an excellent regenerator of the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.480
 immune system that is in charge 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.030
 to keep them alive and healthy from the system 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.070
 immunological depends entirely on our 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.020
 quality of life the scientific community 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.420
 from china japan south korea and 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.280
 North America met to identify 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.170
 the assets that this fungus has and 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.540
 they found that thanks to that it reinforces 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.460
 our immune system improves everything 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.840
 the circulatory system levels the 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.670
 blood pressure decreases 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.830
 cholesterol thus reducing the risk of 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.200
 suffer from strokes attacks 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.060
 heart infarcts and embolisms improves the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.950
 circulatory system avoiding the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.310
 headaches the blocked arteries 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.810
 varicose veins and cellulite up 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.060
 fight diabetes by decreasing 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.770
 blood glucose levels optimizes 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.840
 the oxygenation of the blood what 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.510
 it means that you will not suffer from fatigue 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.100
 difficulty breathing irritability and 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.500
 low sex drive 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.200
 with oxygenation you will be filled with 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.480
 energy eliminates stress anxiety the 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.610
 fatigue and provides energy improving 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.800
 physical performance relieves 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.170
 hemorrhoids decreases the symptoms of 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.390
 menopause such as hot flushes and changes 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.360
 mood improves the situation in angina of 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.610
 chest sight kidneys and lungs in addition to 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.560
 repair the damage in them keeps 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.940
 healthy the most important organs of 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.160
 body like the liver and the pancreas 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.500
 repairing the injuries caused by the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.210
 hepatitis and cirrhosis too 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.880
 detoxifies the body of substances 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.750
 negative like heavy metals 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.270
 auxiliary prevents cavities 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.010
 providing health to the whole mouth and 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.560
 in case it was little improvement 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.150
 considerably the memory the extract 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.760
 reaches the stomach where the body 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.650
 assimilates its benefits and transports them 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.780
 to the bloodstream where it is activated 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.090
 the production and regeneration of globules 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.400
 whites or lymphocytes that are the cells 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.710
 warriors charged with eliminating all 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.020
 coast any bacterium parasite fungus 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.120
 or virus that enters our body to 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.220
 hurt him by regenerating the lobes 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.870
 responsible for defending our health 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.819
 we managed to protect each of the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.159
 systems and vital organs of the organism 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.379
 reinforces in a completely natural way 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.749
 the immune system doing this 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.999
 a very effective armor to keep 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:44.739
 our health so many benefits seemed 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:46.599
 impossible for that reason the community 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.060
 scientific from around the world became interested 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.340
 However, the secret is not 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.139
 it lasted a long time saved soon this 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.060
 great discovery caught the attention of 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.680
 the media the interest 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.719

 part of the immune system the 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.570
 killer cells are those that 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.240
 annihilate any type of bacteria 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.520
