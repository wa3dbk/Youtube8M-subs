00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:12.400
 Good morning from home all net today 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:17.019
 we would predict how flowers will prevail 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:20.859
 pumpkin in batter the pines with ricotta 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:23.259
 and fried in hot oil 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:26.560
 obviously oven of pumpkin flowers 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.749
 the large open well I washed them 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.730
 put to wash in water and baking soda 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:37.540
 to eliminate any parasites too 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.820
 the ski linen then particularly well and well 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.640
 I dried dabbed with paper from 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.590
 cook or prepare a batter to 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.400
 bible that you can certainly find 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:51.940
 also on youtube and now it's a meal there 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.910
 reminiscent of a bit of Parmesan and a 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:01.900
 pinch of pepper that can be avoided 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:04.780
 if there are children in the house we put a 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.680
 bit of pepper in turkey and already memories 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.280
 it is launched 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.280
 May 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.140
 we mix everything with a fork 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.810
 pinch of salt than the fondant 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:33.430
 and then we go to fill the flowers of 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.430
 pumpkin 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.370
 here we go 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.480
 till now 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.370
 we will also try with our hands because 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.760
 a rather difficult operation then 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.860
 we see 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.440
 so the tufts and see on paper from 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.490
 oven 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.490
 let's move on to the next one 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:12.860
 we widen just a little bit like gods 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:16.840
 glasses we fight or you have flowers invitations 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:26.500
 of pumpkin with the ricotta of taxerÃ  in 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:32.150
 batter and then we put affliction 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.480
 let's drop a little with her 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.480
 it 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:58.450
 this year I was coming to you with oil 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:02.700
 and we will start on blotting paper and will do 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.700
 smiles excess point 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.700
 and behold our pumpkin flowers 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.230

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.110
 just that brings them are ready for 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.319
