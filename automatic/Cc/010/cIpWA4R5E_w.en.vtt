00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.749
 the mind is so beautiful commenting on the girl's goal and the goal the tranquility 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.760
 it's the moment you were out in the first time where coritiba too 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.859
 produced a beautiful football managed to make both goals but in the second half your 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.509
 entrance and also of the marks Paulo gave a different dynamic to the team if 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:31.859
 understand that too 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.130
 collaborated so that the politician can reach our victory today 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.780
 I think it's the middle of the year. 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.100
 beautiful 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.270
 in all games 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.140
 I understand 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.790
 Fantastic 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.340
 everyone has on the ground 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.420
 mount so 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.490
 Like me but I miss it then with the younger one. 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.560
 being able to help the team plus the team is so happy that they chained young people 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.380
 little advance with what thought athlete at the moment 10 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.980
 in the view of the group being the new owner of the folder 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.010
 playing as was playing coritiba team today 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.460
 and you in the bank at the moment you have to enter for the first test 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.800
 you already did it in other matches there was no chance to make the goal 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.760
 excited as you had today 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.660
 that you 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.930
 keep thinking human 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.689
 moon or bank cover appearance per entry 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.770
 on soccer team 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.110
 do not identify 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.110
 will concentrate as much as possible to enter 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.960
 it was my best sometimes 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.340
 the circumstance of the game ended up happening something more 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.120
 always focused to try 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.370
 and help the team in the best way with a goal with pass now the team has entered and already 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.810
 put 2 to 0 by going up the window 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.510
 was 17 minutes from the first half 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.770
 and evidently no ticket the group is not that he has a future teacher propose 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.090
 pure cadence play a game in a certain way the collective would put 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.800
 following how did you start you think the score could be much higher and 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.869
 there would be no time at all 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.299
 I'll have a little monkey attitude part of the athletic-mg if you see this 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.599
 I think the team is going to kill the game. 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.399
 in the first 20 minutes 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:18.869
 and then no 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:20.999
 hit the wall falls ill and 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.079
 the marking the footprint all the time then 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.129
 then made it 2 - 0 with a good header after a corner, 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:31.309
 We took our client side 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:33.499
 they scored a goal more 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:34.669
 with the entrance 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:37.679
 marks paulo closed Bethany too 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.589
 help the team to gain a little more speed 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:43.239
 and this proves that the group is very strong 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.639
 who enters 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:45.499
 What was this night?
