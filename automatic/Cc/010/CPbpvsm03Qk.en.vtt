00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:31.100
 You thought it was all about the small world of lies 

00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:42.200
 Anything approaching was hurting and you thought the sky was square 

00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:49.000
 "Everything is all about it ... Anyhow?" You said ... 

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.900
 It is also a lie ... 

00:00:51.901 --> 00:01:02.500
 I heard that your pattern is so lonely that a bird of paradise talks unusually 

00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:08.000
 "Come on with the wings of the butterfly." 

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:12.000
 "As expected over there" 

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:17.400
 Pink spider "I want to go" 

00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:23.200
 Pink Spider "I want a wing ..." 

00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:33.300
 You hate the sky without knowing the life of the captured butterfly 

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:54.000
 "I'm not hurting because it's not ugly I have no feathers, because that sky was too high ..." 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 (Serif) "I'd like to use my wings, spiders. 

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:04.000
 If you don't know how hard it is to keep flying, you will notice someday. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.400
 I was flying only in someone's hand. 

00:02:09.401 --> 00:02:14.000
 And even that I was calling it freedom .... " 

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:23.500
 With the wing of the borrowed thing it can fly well, it will crash 

00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:28.250
 Pink Spider "I can't do it anymore." 

00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:33.400
 Pink Spider "I can see the sky ..." 

00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:38.600
 Pink Spider "It's a failure." 

00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:44.400
 Pink Spider "I want a wing ..." 

00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:54.400
 The birds behind the sky that I could see slightly go south 

00:02:54.401 --> 00:03:15.000
 "Let's fly again. If this cloud is torn by this thread tearing its own jet ..." 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.000
 pink spider 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.100
 The sky is calling 

00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:26.500
 pink spider 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.800
 pink spider 

00:03:31.801 --> 00:03:38.000
 Pink colored spiders flow in the sky ...
