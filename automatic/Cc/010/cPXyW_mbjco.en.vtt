 the rest is easy to teach self-development 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.170
 the graphics went by several good masters 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.000
 It was thought up the most simple 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.489
 the simplest were precisely invented 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.519
 Forms of project basic basic

 who are drawn usually young boy 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.009
 with balonchika in hand a vivid example of what 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.490
 youth of our republic is what it is 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.440
 to occupy 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.270

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.460
 school years actively interested 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.960
 a graffiti pattern so unusual on 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.759
 first look incomprehensible but 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.560
 fascinating soul that instantly 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.810
 makes you grab a pencil 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.369
 portray something like this afterwards 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.649
 pencil replaced professional 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.170
 markers and cans with bright colors and 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.640

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.640
 Dagestan State 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.009
 the university helped open the school 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.450
 graffiti appeared stable practice 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.250
 new interesting people 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.500
 each of which brings to art 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:51.670
 something new desire to work age 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.869
 triple infanta situation in the scene and

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.510
 great victory last september 5 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.690
 take classes 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:09.140
 the very idea of opening a school originated too in 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.080
 2010 after this promotion since we 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.790
 wanted to put more precisely continue 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.970
 development of pebbles in Dagestan 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.800
 because so many people want to draw 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.200
 or even those who want to shit don't know where 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.820
 get information with the school building in 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.890
 collectives began to appear in the republic 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.110

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.600
 plans to develop further 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.490
 attracting more and more 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.410
 number of people however everyone knows 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.330
 adult generation refers to this 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.190
 kind of art is disapproving and often 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.350
 the reasons are confusing 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.750
 explains the graffiti rider it's urban 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.120
 painting having no relation to 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.760
 vandalism according to get damage 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.570
 state property in defacing out 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.960
 buildings poster on not showing monuments 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.970
 architecture we are promoting at school 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.170
 fighting masturbation and legal graffiti 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.030
 because during medal drawing 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.489
 leaks can fully express themselves 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.680
 because no one bothers him he will not 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.959
 worry about him coming now 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.980
 will take away his leadership he will 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.140
 problems of law therefore 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.730
 a big plus for legal graffiti 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.680
 a look at the work of school students 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.510
 graffiti all doubts disappear 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.400
 drawings decorating one of the federal 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.620
 routes of Dagestan brought to society 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.150
 lots of positive noise and therefore it is up to 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.430
 which the young rotaru took 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.770

 everyone has their own unique perspective on 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.140
 the image of Aida Shabanova about what 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.180
 you can learn graffiti learned by chance 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.550
 on one social network page 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.530
 the girl for which she went there was 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.510
 absolutely everything immediately took up 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.820
 Finding a school today is a successful student 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.620

 Makhachkala and left from 100 street to 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.970
 places where a person would fight something himself 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:10.610

 On drawing it turned out to try everything 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.550
 judging by the test drawing study 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.950
 the mastery of this art remains to be 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.810
 but the main one has achieved success let these 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.880
