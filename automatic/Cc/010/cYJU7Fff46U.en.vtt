00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
and now your program is going to link

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.770 
and now your program is going to link
these<00:01:06.390> photos<00:01:06.900> together<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:11.479> now<00:01:12.479> this

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
these photos together for you now this

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.050 
these photos together for you now this
is<00:01:12.960> why<00:01:13.110> overlapping<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.130> photos<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.670> also

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
is why overlapping the photos is also

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.990 
is why overlapping the photos is also
key<00:01:15.299> because<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.780> overlapped<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:17.000> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
key because you overlapped it the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.149 
key because you overlapped it the
program<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.630> actually<00:01:18.900> going<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.799> able<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
program is actually going to be able to

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.060 
program is actually going to be able to
match<00:01:20.759> up<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.479> edges<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> photo<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.560> lot
