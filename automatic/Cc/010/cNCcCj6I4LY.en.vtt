00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
looked like velvet it was just really a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.130 
looked like velvet it was just really a
beautiful<00:01:23.090> not<00:01:24.090> heavy<00:01:24.390> not<00:01:24.750> cakey<00:01:25.020> not

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
beautiful not heavy not cakey not

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.810 
beautiful not heavy not cakey not
obvious<00:01:25.710> finish<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.430> looked<00:01:26.640> very

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
obvious finish but that looked very

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.149 
obvious finish but that looked very
naturally<00:01:27.360> matte<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.439> if<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> kind<00:01:29.130> of

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
naturally matte so if that's the kind of

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.469 
naturally matte so if that's the kind of
finish<00:01:29.369> you're<00:01:29.520> looking<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
finish you're looking for and the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.210 
finish you're looking for and the
coverage<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.259> want<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.680> not<00:01:31.829> too<00:01:32.009> heavy

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
coverage that you want is not too heavy

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.310 
coverage that you want is not too heavy
because<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.909> definitely<00:01:33.200> what<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.229> would

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
because this is definitely what I would

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.130 
because this is definitely what I would
consider<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.650> buildable<00:01:35.189> medium<00:01:35.579> coverage<00:01:36.140> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
consider a buildable medium coverage and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.600 
consider a buildable medium coverage and
you<00:01:37.229> want<00:01:37.439> something<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.799> last<00:01:37.979> all<00:01:38.159> day

doesn't have a super great coverage but

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.580 
doesn't have a super great coverage but
it<00:01:57.000> also<00:01:57.119> doesn't<00:01:57.329> look<00:01:57.509> cakey<00:01:57.810> or<00:01:58.020> powdery<00:01:58.469> on

the<00:01:58.710> skin<00:01:58.920> either<00:01:59.070> so<00:02:00.590> it's<00:02:01.590> nice<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:02.040> I

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
the skin either so it's nice like I

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.499 
the skin either so it's nice like I
think<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.430> top<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:02.909> like<00:02:03.090> whatever<00:02:03.360> this

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
think on top of this like whatever this

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.600 
think on top of this like whatever this
won't<00:02:03.750> cover<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.320> will<00:02:04.500> kind<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.740> add<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
won't cover this will kind of add the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.940 
won't cover this will kind of add the
extra<00:02:05.909> coverage<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.509> need<00:02:06.540> for<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.020> on

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
extra coverage that you need for it on

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.790 
extra coverage that you need for it on
its<00:02:08.280> own<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:09.000> not<00:02:09.179> like<00:02:09.450> amazing<00:02:10.170> coverage<00:02:10.530> I

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
its own it's not like amazing coverage I

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.380 
its own it's not like amazing coverage I
definitely<00:02:11.489> wouldn't<00:02:11.640> use<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.790> underneath

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
definitely wouldn't use it underneath

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.910 
definitely wouldn't use it underneath

personally because it's definitely like

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.700 
personally because it's definitely like
a<00:02:33.210> lighter<00:02:33.450> coverage<00:02:33.690> than<00:02:34.230> what<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.470> would

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
a lighter coverage than what I would

a lighter coverage than what I would
personally<00:02:34.890> want<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:35.490> think<00:02:36.060> it's<00:02:36.600> actually

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
personally want I think it's actually

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.600 
personally want I think it's actually
very<00:02:37.530> natural-looking<00:02:38.040> on<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.400> skin

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
very natural-looking on the skin

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.190 
very natural-looking on the skin
considering<00:02:39.060> it's<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.180> powder<00:02:39.390> foundation<00:02:39.600> it

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
with one layer it just looks kind of

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.770 
with one layer it just looks kind of
softly<00:02:44.310> matte<00:02:44.550> like<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.090> has<00:02:45.300> like<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.570> little

tiny bit of like a like a natural not

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.960 
tiny bit of like a like a natural not
sheen<00:02:49.320> because<00:02:49.560> it's<00:02:49.680> not<00:02:49.800> shiny<00:02:50.130> but<00:02:50.459> it

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
sheen because it's not shiny but it

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.060 
sheen because it's not shiny but it
doesn't<00:02:51.209> look<00:02:51.330> over<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.690> powder<00:02:52.350> -<00:02:52.739> if<00:02:52.890> that

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
doesn't look over the powder - if that

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.949 
doesn't look over the powder - if that
makes<00:02:53.190> any<00:02:53.250> sense<00:02:53.400> if<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.420> do<00:02:54.510> try<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.720> build

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
like a light coverage I think you're

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.880 
like a light coverage I think you're
gonna<00:03:09.030> sacrifice<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.720> nice<00:03:10.500> initial

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
gonna sacrifice that nice initial

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.500 
gonna sacrifice that nice initial
texture<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.489> it's<00:03:11.790> gonna<00:03:11.940> start<00:03:12.209> looking

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
texture and it's gonna start looking

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.479 
texture and it's gonna start looking
really<00:03:12.720> time<00:03:12.870> cakey<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.380> powdery<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:14.310> being

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
really time cakey and powdery that being

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.949 
really time cakey and powdery that being
said<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:14.670> do<00:03:14.850> actually<00:03:15.120> like<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.570> as<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.690> setting

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
said I do actually like it as a setting

said I do actually like it as a setting
powder<00:03:16.020> for<00:03:16.769> this<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.100> don't<00:03:17.220> need<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.640> setting

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
powder for this I don't need a setting

powder for this I don't need a setting
powder<00:03:17.970> with<00:03:18.360> this<00:03:18.480> because<00:03:19.019> this<00:03:19.830> gives<00:03:20.010> me

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
powder with this because this gives me

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.060 
powder with this because this gives me
complete<00:03:20.910> oil<00:03:21.269> control<00:03:21.570> all<00:03:21.720> day<00:03:21.930> but<00:03:22.860> this

complete oil control all day but this

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.130 
complete oil control all day but this
boosts<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.790> coverage<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.209> this<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.690> little<00:03:25.019> bit

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
boosts the coverage of this a little bit

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.990 
boosts the coverage of this a little bit
so<00:03:25.560> if<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.739> want<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.100> again<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.489> buy<00:03:26.640> kind<00:03:26.940> of
