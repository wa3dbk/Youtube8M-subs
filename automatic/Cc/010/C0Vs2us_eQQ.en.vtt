the way back up into a parallel position
to<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.300> ground<00:01:36.540> check<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.900> out

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.500 

the<00:01:47.230> one<00:01:47.500> thing<00:01:47.740> I<00:01:47.860> have<00:01:48.010> to<00:01:48.070> say<00:01:48.160> is<00:01:48.550> those<00:01:49.300> can

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
the one thing I have to say is those can

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.060 
the one thing I have to say is those can
be<00:01:49.540> very<00:01:49.810> dangerous<00:01:49.990> for<00:01:50.290> your<00:01:50.440> shoulders<00:01:50.860> if

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
be very dangerous for your shoulders if

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.400 
be very dangerous for your shoulders if

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
you're not flexible enough and go into a

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:02.219 
you're not flexible enough and go into a
tuck<00:01:53.710> position<00:01:53.980> like<00:01:54.490> this

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.899 

once<00:02:02.860> you<00:02:02.950> get<00:02:03.070> flexible<00:02:03.520> enough<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.729> watch

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
once you get flexible enough to watch

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.230 
once you get flexible enough to watch
you<00:02:04.030> get<00:02:04.150> strong<00:02:04.390> enough<00:02:04.659> then<00:02:05.729> fully<00:02:06.729> extend

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
you get strong enough then fully extend

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.320 
you get strong enough then fully extend
that<00:02:07.390> knee<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:08.220> bring<00:02:09.220> your<00:02:09.819> all<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.179> your

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
legs up into a back lever the final

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.479 
legs up into a back lever the final
progression<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:14.650> actually<00:02:15.010> my<00:02:15.160> favorite

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
progression is actually my favorite

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:30.500 
progression is actually my favorite
progression<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:17.319> goes<00:02:17.500> like<00:02:17.709> this

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.240 

what<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.470> going<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.680> do<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:32.159> help<00:02:34.250> develop

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
what this is going to do is help develop

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.479 
what this is going to do is help develop
your<00:02:35.280> posterior<00:02:36.090> delts<00:02:36.480> your<00:02:37.200> lats<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.890> your

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
your posterior delts your lats in your

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.970 
your posterior delts your lats in your
lower<00:02:38.760> back<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.390> really<00:02:40.110> help<00:02:40.379> you<00:02:40.530> stabilize

your core all right so now that we have
progression<00:02:43.260> let's<00:02:43.409> get<00:02:43.560> into<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.829> technique

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
progression let's get into the technique

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.789 
progression let's get into the technique
of<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:44.970> back<00:02:45.150> lever<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.959> technique<00:02:46.530> is

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
of the back lever the technique is

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.369 
of the back lever the technique is
actually<00:02:47.489> very<00:02:47.640> simple<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.599> one<00:02:48.840> tip<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.200> I

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
actually very simple the one tip that I

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.710 
actually very simple the one tip that I
have<00:02:49.680> for<00:02:50.010> all<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.310> clients<00:02:50.819> that<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.239> teach<00:02:51.540> is

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
have for all the clients that I teach is

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.199 
have for all the clients that I teach is
back<00:02:51.900> lever<00:02:52.079> to<00:02:52.379> is<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.430> bringing<00:02:54.030> your

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
back lever to is that of bringing your

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.780 
back lever to is that of bringing your
grip<00:02:54.569> from<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.930> wide<00:02:55.200> grip<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:56.069> a<00:02:56.099> close<00:02:56.519> grip

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
also what you want to do is start off in

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.140 
also what you want to do is start off in
a<00:03:10.109> tuck<00:03:10.349> position<00:03:10.459> once<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.609> can<00:03:11.760> do<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:11.940> Tuck

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
a tuck position once you can do the Tuck

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.080 
a tuck position once you can do the Tuck
position<00:03:12.389> then<00:03:13.290> bring<00:03:13.590> one<00:03:13.620> leg<00:03:14.040> out<00:03:14.220> then

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
position then bring one leg out then

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.059 
position then bring one leg out then
bring<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.569> other<00:03:15.599> leg<00:03:15.900> out<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.650> straddle

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
bring the other leg out in a straddle

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.149 
bring the other leg out in a straddle
position<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:18.569> finally<00:03:19.349> bring<00:03:19.950> your

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
position and then finally bring your

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.550 
position and then finally bring your
legs<00:03:20.549> together<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.480> watch<00:03:21.750> as<00:03:22.049> I'll<00:03:22.379> show<00:03:22.409> you

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
legs together so watch as I'll show you

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:46.320 
legs together so watch as I'll show you
the<00:03:22.799> steps<00:03:23.099> of<00:03:23.459> learning<00:03:23.909> this<00:03:24.060> technique

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.440 

so<00:03:47.330> as<00:03:47.540> you<00:03:47.780> can<00:03:47.960> see<00:03:48.290> I<00:03:48.790> went<00:03:49.790> from<00:03:49.880> a<00:03:50.000> straddle

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
so as you can see I went from a straddle

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.130 
so as you can see I went from a straddle
position<00:03:50.890> which<00:03:51.890> will<00:03:52.640> relieve<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.870> amount

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
position which will relieve the amount

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.070 
position which will relieve the amount
of<00:03:54.290> gravity<00:03:55.220> pushing<00:03:55.610> down<00:03:55.880> at<00:03:56.240> the<00:03:56.720> center<00:03:57.020> of

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
of gravity pushing down at the center of

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.140 
of gravity pushing down at the center of
your<00:03:57.140> axis<00:03:57.590> so<00:03:57.950> I'll<00:03:58.130> leave<00:03:58.580> an<00:03:58.730> opening

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
your axis so I'll leave an opening

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.970 
your axis so I'll leave an opening
between<00:03:59.450> your<00:03:59.569> legs<00:03:59.780> and<00:04:00.080> the<00:04:00.560> gravity<00:04:00.890> will

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
between your legs and the gravity will

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.650 
between your legs and the gravity will
be<00:04:01.069> pushing<00:04:01.459> down<00:04:01.490> but<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:02.180> has<00:04:02.270> nothing<00:04:02.420> to

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
be pushing down but it has nothing to

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.270 
be pushing down but it has nothing to
grab<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:03.440> it's<00:04:03.530> actually<00:04:03.800> easier<00:04:04.220> to

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
grab so it's actually easier to

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.280 
grab so it's actually easier to
stabilize<00:04:04.940> yourself<00:04:05.090> in<00:04:05.480> that<00:04:05.870> back<00:04:06.050> lever

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
stabilize yourself in that back lever

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.280 
stabilize yourself in that back lever
position<00:04:06.580> so<00:04:07.580> the<00:04:07.700> one<00:04:07.880> thing<00:04:08.090> like<00:04:08.930> I<00:04:09.050> said<00:04:09.200> at

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
position so the one thing like I said at

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.830 
position so the one thing like I said at
the<00:04:09.350> beginning<00:04:09.470> that<00:04:09.980> helps<00:04:10.880> everyone<00:04:11.450> that<00:04:11.780> I

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
the beginning that helps everyone that I

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.570 
the beginning that helps everyone that I
know<00:04:11.900> through<00:04:12.770> the<00:04:12.830> back<00:04:13.010> lever<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.370> this<00:04:13.489> is
