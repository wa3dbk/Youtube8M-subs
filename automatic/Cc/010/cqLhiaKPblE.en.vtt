00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
to them and then they'll start pressing

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.240 
to them and then they'll start pressing
and<00:04:18.370> also<00:04:18.669> cracking

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.640 

and<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:24.360> will<00:04:24.660> crack<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.170> they'll<00:04:25.470> think

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
and it will crack and they'll think

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.100 
and it will crack and they'll think
you're<00:04:25.770> cracked<00:04:26.010> on<00:04:26.970> that<00:04:27.450> I<00:04:27.630> don't<00:04:27.900> know<00:04:27.960> how

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
you're cracked on that I don't know how

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.110 
you're cracked on that I don't know how
realistic<00:04:28.440> it<00:04:28.740> is<00:04:28.860> pretty<00:04:29.130> realistic<00:04:30.169> but<00:04:31.169> I

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
realistic it is pretty realistic but I

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.460 
realistic it is pretty realistic but I
can't<00:04:33.120> give<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.270> up<00:04:33.389> there<00:04:33.630> right<00:04:33.780> but<00:04:34.380> it

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
can't give that up there right but it

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.470 
can't give that up there right but it
might<00:04:34.590> be<00:04:34.620> nice<00:04:34.860> if<00:04:34.919> you<00:04:35.490> had<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.730> tap<00:04:35.940> by<00:04:36.150> twice

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
might be nice if you had to tap by twice

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.210 
might be nice if you had to tap by twice
to<00:04:36.660> do<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:36.930> so<00:04:37.139> they<00:04:37.169> tap<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.620> once<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:37.980> doesn't

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
to do it so they tap it once it doesn't

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.980 
to do it so they tap it once it doesn't
do<00:04:38.280> anything<00:04:38.460> so<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.639> tad<00:04:38.850> bit<00:04:39.030> harder<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:39.870> then

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
do anything so I tad bit harder and then

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.480 
do anything so I tad bit harder and then
once<00:04:40.200> they<00:04:40.290> tap<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.620> third<00:04:40.800> time<00:04:41.010> it<00:04:41.250> would

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
once they tap the third time it would

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.390 
once they tap the third time it would
make<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:41.940> crack<00:04:42.300> in<00:04:42.330> screen<00:04:42.830> maybe<00:04:43.830> if<00:04:44.040> they<00:04:44.160> did

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
make a crack in screen maybe if they did

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.720 
make a crack in screen maybe if they did
the<00:04:44.580> broken<00:04:45.389> LCD<00:04:45.770> screen<00:04:46.770> thing<00:04:46.980> where<00:04:47.580> it's

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
the broken LCD screen thing where it's

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.280 
the broken LCD screen thing where it's
like<00:04:47.790> white<00:04:48.120> and<00:04:48.330> black<00:04:48.570> and<00:04:48.810> it's<00:04:48.930> all<00:04:49.080> messed

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
like white and black and it's all messed

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.790 
like white and black and it's all messed
up<00:04:49.440> because<00:04:49.710> that's<00:04:50.100> pretty<00:04:50.370> realistic<00:04:51.800> so

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
up because that's pretty realistic so

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.430 
up because that's pretty realistic so
here<00:04:52.980> you<00:04:53.130> just<00:04:53.430> make<00:04:53.639> cracks<00:04:53.940> so<00:04:54.930> get<00:04:55.320> the
