gram or amatory one might possibly

gram or amatory one might possibly
happen<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.329> because<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:00.990> fact<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.439> had

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
happen just because of the fact that had

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.260 
happen just because of the fact that had
their<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.979> head-to-head<00:02:02.280> stats<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:03.240> that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
their the head-to-head stats I like that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.999 
their the head-to-head stats I like that
anyway<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:03.869> basically<00:02:04.320> kept<00:02:04.500> silver<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> stem

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
anyway so basically kept silver the stem

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.770 
anyway so basically kept silver the stem
and<00:02:05.159> probably<00:02:05.939> would<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.149> moved<00:02:06.270> into<00:02:06.509> cam

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
and probably would have moved into cam

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.880 
and probably would have moved into cam
but<00:02:06.990> maybe<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.290> guys<00:02:07.409> are<00:02:07.469> never<00:02:07.710> know<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.829> a

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
comment section below anyway so that's

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.360

the<00:02:09.479> first<00:02:09.690> free<00:02:10.319> players<00:02:10.649> covered<00:02:11.039> what<00:02:11.220> no

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
the first free players covered what no

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.500 
the first free players covered what no
more<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.730> look<00:02:11.819> at<00:02:11.940> in

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
more to look at in

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.929 
more to look at in
in<00:02:12.689> their<00:02:12.930> fresh<00:02:13.230> new<00:02:13.620> transfers<00:02:14.129> so<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.790> next

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
in their fresh new transfers so the next

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.030

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
free rate card I think you possibly

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.050 
free rate card I think you possibly
could<00:02:19.049> be<00:02:19.170> an<00:02:19.379> 84<00:02:19.890> pushing<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.370> where<00:02:20.790> he's<00:02:20.909> in

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
could be an 84 pushing on where he's in

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.610 
could be an 84 pushing on where he's in
the<00:02:21.120> same<00:02:21.299> boat<00:02:21.540> as<00:02:21.689> the<00:02:21.840> Ivanovich<00:02:22.290> which<00:02:22.500> we

i<00:03:35.129> don't<00:03:35.310> know<00:03:35.370> i<00:03:35.400> think<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.940> well<00:03:36.690> i'm

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
i don't know i think and well i'm

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.509 
i don't know i think and well i'm
thinking<00:03:37.769> that<00:03:37.799> manchester<00:03:38.220> city<00:03:38.370> may

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
thinking that manchester city may

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.520 
thinking that manchester city may
utilize<00:03:38.970> him<00:03:39.180> on<00:03:39.389> the<00:03:39.750> right<00:03:40.109> midfield

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
utilize him on the right midfield

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.619 
utilize him on the right midfield
position<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.949> mainly<00:03:41.910> because<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.419> fact

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
position and mainly because of the fact

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:43.789 
position and mainly because of the fact
that<00:03:42.720> now<00:03:42.989> bass<00:03:43.169> has<00:03:43.319> been<00:03:43.470> out<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.680> favour

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
that now bass has been out of favour

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.830 
that now bass has been out of favour
from<00:03:44.010> antis<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.459> for<00:03:44.639> a<00:03:44.669> while<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.329> sterling<00:03:45.540> in

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
from antis it for a while so sterling in

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.150 
from antis it for a while so sterling in
the<00:03:45.930> right<00:03:46.079> midfield<00:03:46.379> position<00:03:46.440> maybe<00:03:46.859> or

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
the right midfield position maybe or

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.379 
the right midfield position maybe or
even<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.519> cam<00:03:47.669> who<00:03:47.849> knows<00:03:48.030> what<00:03:48.209> we<00:03:48.269> walked

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
even it cam who knows what we walked

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.539 
even it cam who knows what we walked
into<00:03:48.599> an<00:03:48.690> 81<00:03:49.049> but<00:03:49.470> Andy<00:03:49.680> know<00:03:49.859> we've<00:03:50.010> kept<00:03:50.340> at

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
into an 81 but Andy know we've kept at

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.240 
into an 81 but Andy know we've kept at
an<00:03:50.849> 82<00:03:51.389> days<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:51.900> with<00:03:52.650> borning<00:03:53.069> I'm<00:03:53.160> actually

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
an 82 days and with borning I'm actually

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.770 
an 82 days and with borning I'm actually
checking<00:03:53.549> on<00:03:53.669> FIFA<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.120> we<00:03:54.209> booked<00:03:54.480> him<00:03:54.629> I

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
checking on FIFA it we booked him I

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.420 
checking on FIFA it we booked him I
think<00:03:54.959> we've<00:03:55.079> actually<00:03:55.199> downgrading<00:03:55.650> by<00:03:56.190> one

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
think we've actually downgrading by one

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.640 
think we've actually downgrading by one
no<00:03:56.790> we<00:03:56.879> can't<00:03:57.060> see<00:03:57.419> me<00:03:57.599> in<00:03:57.810> Kate<00:03:58.079> me<00:03:58.199> I<00:03:58.349> probably
