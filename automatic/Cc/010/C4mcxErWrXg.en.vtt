00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
of switched away at a critical point

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.219 
of switched away at a critical point
just<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.379> look<00:04:10.500> at<00:04:10.620> Santa<00:04:11.040> Claus<00:04:11.280> head<00:04:11.519> people

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
but stork not managing to deny that base

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.199 
but stork not managing to deny that base
any<00:04:16.859> longer<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.400> here<00:04:17.609> come<00:04:17.789> the<00:04:17.820> zerglings

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
any longer and here come the zerglings

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.899 
any longer and here come the zerglings
so<00:04:18.810> if<00:04:18.959> stork<00:04:19.560> follows<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.280> zerglings<00:04:20.639> he's

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
so if stork follows the zerglings he's

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.610 
so if stork follows the zerglings he's
going<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.180> know<00:04:21.269> what<00:04:21.419> what's<00:04:21.780> up<00:04:21.959> but<00:04:22.500> i<00:04:22.530> think

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
going to know what what's up but i think

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.350 
going to know what what's up but i think
he'd<00:04:22.830> lost<00:04:22.949> his<00:04:23.099> probe<00:04:23.460> yeah<00:04:23.759> i<00:04:23.849> think<00:04:23.940> stork

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
he'd lost his probe yeah i think stork

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.029 
he'd lost his probe yeah i think stork
lost<00:04:24.599> his<00:04:24.780> pro<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.289> circling<00:04:25.710> so<00:04:25.889> this

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
lost his pro to the circling so this

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.339 
lost his pro to the circling so this
could<00:04:26.159> be<00:04:26.220> very<00:04:26.520> bad<00:04:27.330> for<00:04:27.389> store<00:04:27.840> key<00:04:27.990> if<00:04:28.199> he

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
could be very bad for store key if he

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.050 
could be very bad for store key if he
does<00:04:28.530> not<00:04:28.560> scout<00:04:29.070> this<00:04:29.250> he<00:04:29.400> hasn't<00:04:29.639> scouted<00:04:30.000> it

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
does not scout this he hasn't scouted it

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.050 
does not scout this he hasn't scouted it
yet<00:04:30.330> but<00:04:31.199> he<00:04:32.039> knows<00:04:32.220> about<00:04:32.400> that<00:04:32.610> feature<00:04:32.820> of

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
yet but he knows about that feature of

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.249 
yet but he knows about that feature of
the<00:04:33.150> map<00:04:33.330> so<00:04:33.539> he's<00:04:33.659> probably<00:04:33.780> going<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.139> go<00:04:34.199> to

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
the map so he's probably going to go to

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.310 
the map so he's probably going to go to
up<00:04:34.470> there<00:04:34.710> soon<00:04:34.949> enough<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.370> scout<00:04:36.050> I've<00:04:37.050> seen

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
up there soon enough to scout I've seen

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.719 
up there soon enough to scout I've seen
this<00:04:37.440> type<00:04:37.800> of<00:04:37.830> thing<00:04:38.099> happen<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.400> pure

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
this type of thing happen to pure

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.089 
this type of thing happen to pure
recently<00:04:39.240> but<00:04:39.449> pure<00:04:39.659> scouted<00:04:40.139> it<00:04:40.199> at<00:04:40.380> pretty

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
recently but pure scouted it at pretty

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.060 
recently but pure scouted it at pretty
much<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.340> last<00:04:41.729> second<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.389> he<00:04:43.320> was<00:04:43.770> able<00:04:43.919> to

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
much the last second and he was able to

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.520 
much the last second and he was able to
get<00:04:44.250> by<00:04:44.849> the<00:04:44.909> choke<00:04:45.389> with<00:04:45.570> a<00:04:45.630> few<00:04:45.870> probes<00:04:46.229> and

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
get by the choke with a few probes and

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.370 
get by the choke with a few probes and
keep<00:04:47.099> the<00:04:47.280> circling<00:04:47.699> from<00:04:47.880> running<00:04:48.120> by<00:04:48.380> it's

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
keep the circling from running by it's

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.170 
keep the circling from running by it's
kind<00:04:49.530> of<00:04:49.650> difficult<00:04:49.830> for<00:04:50.550> okay<00:04:50.880> here<00:04:51.000> comes

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
kind of difficult for okay here comes

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.850 
kind of difficult for okay here comes
store<00:04:51.419> keys<00:04:51.599> coming<00:04:51.870> up<00:04:51.990> he's<00:04:52.320> going<00:04:52.529> to<00:04:52.620> scout

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
store keys coming up he's going to scout

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.200 
store keys coming up he's going to scout
this<00:04:53.099> but<00:04:53.250> it<00:04:53.340> might<00:04:53.490> be<00:04:53.669> a<00:04:53.700> little<00:04:53.909> bit<00:04:54.090> too

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
this but it might be a little bit too

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.339 
this but it might be a little bit too

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
way that the circles can run by this is

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.860 
way that the circles can run by this is
going<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:08.669> be<00:05:08.759> closed<00:05:08.999> pulling<00:05:09.240> even<00:05:09.629> more

at<00:05:34.919> this<00:05:35.039> point<00:05:35.310> stork<00:05:35.879> needs<00:05:36.120> to<00:05:36.240> be<00:05:36.360> mining

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
at this point stork needs to be mining

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.510 
at this point stork needs to be mining
at<00:05:36.900> that<00:05:37.050> second<00:05:37.379> base<00:05:37.500> but<00:05:37.710> he<00:05:37.740> can't<00:05:38.039> do<00:05:38.279> much

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
at that second base but he can't do much

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.089 
at that second base but he can't do much
mining<00:05:38.759> at<00:05:38.939> all<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.719> think<00:05:40.259> he<00:05:40.349> might<00:05:40.710> want<00:05:41.009> to

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
mining at all I think he might want to

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:42.980 
mining at all I think he might want to
consider<00:05:41.460> throwing<00:05:41.759> down<00:05:42.000> a<00:05:42.029> third<00:05:42.449> cannon

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
consider throwing down a third cannon

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.230 
consider throwing down a third cannon
closer<00:05:43.500> to<00:05:43.800> this<00:05:43.949> joke<00:05:44.219> because<00:05:44.400> he's<00:05:45.029> going

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
closer to this joke because he's going

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.279 
closer to this joke because he's going
to<00:05:45.300> have<00:05:45.389> to<00:05:45.419> wait<00:05:45.629> until<00:05:45.779> he<00:05:45.960> gets<00:05:46.020> some

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
to have to wait until he gets some

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.529 
to have to wait until he gets some
zealots<00:05:46.529> out<00:05:46.860> to<00:05:47.069> really<00:05:47.729> deal<00:05:47.939> with<00:05:48.060> this<00:05:48.270> and

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
zealots out to really deal with this and

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.300 
zealots out to really deal with this and
this<00:05:49.080> is<00:05:49.229> hurting<00:05:49.500> his<00:05:49.589> economy<00:05:49.889> right<00:05:50.250> now

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
this is hurting his economy right now

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.189 
this is hurting his economy right now

tech and I have a feeling it's going to

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.279 
tech and I have a feeling it's going to
be<00:06:38.819> something<00:06:39.000> different<00:06:39.629> than<00:06:39.870> what<00:06:39.899> Serbs
