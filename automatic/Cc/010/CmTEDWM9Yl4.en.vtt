um this is then taken and covered with

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.640 
um this is then taken and covered with
saran<00:00:46.370> wrap<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:46.850> it<00:00:46.879> doesn't<00:00:47.269> leak<00:00:47.500> then<00:00:48.500> we

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
saran wrap so it doesn't leak then we

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.500 
saran wrap so it doesn't leak then we
fill<00:00:48.860> it<00:00:48.949> with<00:00:49.100> plaster<00:00:49.640> with<00:00:50.239> a<00:00:50.269> pipe

fill it with plaster with a pipe
sticking<00:00:50.900> out<00:00:51.049> which<00:00:51.290> hardens<00:00:52.089> once<00:00:53.089> we<00:00:53.239> strip

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
sticking out which hardens once we strip

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.810 
sticking out which hardens once we strip
that<00:00:53.869> cast<00:00:54.229> off<00:00:54.530> we<00:00:54.920> have<00:00:55.070> a<00:00:55.100> positive<00:00:55.640> model

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
that cast off we have a positive model

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.289 
that cast off we have a positive model
of<00:00:56.089> our<00:00:56.180> patient<00:00:57.339> this<00:00:58.339> positive<00:00:58.850> model<00:00:59.150> can

00:00:59.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
of our patient this positive model can

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.049 
of our patient this positive model can
be<00:00:59.330> put<00:00:59.600> in<00:00:59.690> a<00:00:59.750> vise<00:00:59.960> to<00:00:59.989> be<00:01:00.320> worked<00:01:00.530> on<00:01:00.739> and

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
be put in a vise to be worked on and

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.969 
be put in a vise to be worked on and
they'll<00:01:02.059> modify<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:02.629> which<00:01:02.960> means<00:01:03.170> making<00:01:03.799> it

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
they'll modify it which means making it

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.830 
they'll modify it which means making it
smooth<00:01:04.309> on<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.610> bottom<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.210> that<00:01:05.239> it<00:01:05.390> stands

smooth on the bottom so that it stands
up<00:01:06.049> straight

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
up straight

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.560 
up straight
they<00:01:07.070> put<00:01:07.340> buildups<00:01:07.820> on<00:01:08.060> any<00:01:08.240> bony

they put buildups on any bony

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.170 
they put buildups on any bony
prominences<00:01:09.410> so<00:01:10.250> that<00:01:10.460> there's<00:01:10.640> no<00:01:10.760> rubbing

what<00:01:59.600> this<00:01:59.780> does<00:02:00.020> is<00:02:00.290> it<00:02:00.590> links<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:01.070> two<00:02:01.100> legs

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
what this does is it links the two legs

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.289 
what this does is it links the two legs
together<00:02:02.680> by<00:02:03.680> way<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:04.190> this<00:02:04.460> rocker<00:02:04.790> bar<00:02:05.120> in

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
together by way of this rocker bar in

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.960 
together by way of this rocker bar in
the<00:02:05.420> back<00:02:05.799> as<00:02:06.799> I<00:02:06.890> move<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.220> legs<00:02:07.430> that<00:02:07.610> goes<00:02:07.790> up

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
the back as I move the legs that goes up

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.330 
the back as I move the legs that goes up
and<00:02:08.149> down<00:02:08.470> now<00:02:09.470> you<00:02:09.530> can<00:02:09.709> really<00:02:09.860> see<00:02:10.129> its

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
and down now you can really see its

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.260 
and down now you can really see its
mechanism

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
mechanism

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.950 
mechanism
we<00:02:12.270> also<00:02:12.450> do<00:02:12.690> bracing<00:02:13.200> for<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.920> spine<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.960> in

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
we also do bracing for the spine and in

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.780 
we also do bracing for the spine and in
the<00:02:16.140> background<00:02:16.350> here<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.100> see<00:02:17.310> an<00:02:17.400> x-ray<00:02:17.760> of

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
the background here you see an x-ray of

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.150 
the background here you see an x-ray of
a<00:02:17.970> patient<00:02:18.360> with<00:02:18.450> scoliosis<00:02:19.010> we'd<00:02:20.010> have<00:02:20.130> a

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
a patient with scoliosis we'd have a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.010 
a patient with scoliosis we'd have a
patient<00:02:20.430> like<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.810> would<00:02:21.900> be

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
patient like that and it would be

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.810 
patient like that and it would be
important<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.710> try<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.070> straighten<00:02:23.490> this

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
important to try to straighten this

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.720 
important to try to straighten this
curve<00:02:24.300> until<00:02:25.230> they<00:02:25.350> reach<00:02:25.560> maturity<00:02:25.800> which<00:02:26.520> is

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
curve until they reach maturity which is

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.360 
curve until they reach maturity which is
usually<00:02:27.300> about<00:02:27.480> 16<00:02:27.990> years<00:02:28.020> old<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.650> little<00:02:29.190> less

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
usually about 16 years old a little less

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.660 
usually about 16 years old a little less
for<00:02:29.640> girls<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:30.090> little<00:02:30.210> bit<00:02:30.450> more<00:02:30.630> for<00:02:30.870> boys<00:02:31.050> and

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
for girls a little bit more for boys and

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.280 
for girls a little bit more for boys and
what<00:02:32.670> we<00:02:32.820> would<00:02:32.970> do<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.360> measure<00:02:33.570> our<00:02:33.840> patient

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
what we would do is measure our patient

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.630 
what we would do is measure our patient
and<00:02:35.390> by<00:02:36.390> using<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.870> x-ray<00:02:37.230> we<00:02:37.920> place<00:02:38.220> pads

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
and by using the x-ray we place pads

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.420 
and by using the x-ray we place pads
inside<00:02:39.350> strategically<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.770> press<00:02:41.010> against

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
inside strategically to press against

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.020 
inside strategically to press against
the<00:02:41.460> ribs<00:02:42.230> that<00:02:43.230> articulate<00:02:43.980> with<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.730> curve

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
the ribs that articulate with the curve

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.360 
the ribs that articulate with the curve
in<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.330> spine<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.650> holds<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.130> spine

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
in the spine so it holds the spine

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.460 
in the spine so it holds the spine
straight<00:02:47.820> or<00:02:48.060> straighter<00:02:48.570> at<00:02:48.780> least<00:02:49.020> while

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
straight or straighter at least while

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.670 
straight or straighter at least while
they're<00:02:49.650> wearing<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.070> brace<00:02:51.200> we<00:02:52.200> do<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.470> same

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
plaster with a pipe so that we have a

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.690

inside of it with their leg what this

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.370 
inside of it with their leg what this
allows<00:03:16.200> us<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.380> do<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.890> view<00:03:17.670> their<00:03:17.880> skin

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
this a little bit bigger there if we see

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.940 
this a little bit bigger there if we see
gapping<00:03:29.610> then<00:03:30.300> we<00:03:30.450> know<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:30.900> there<00:03:31.709> might

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
need to be more total contacts so you

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.140 
need to be more total contacts so you
don't<00:03:33.930> get<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.140> Deema<00:03:34.440> from<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.459> skin<00:03:35.700> hanging

allows us to shift its side-to-side and
it<00:04:05.760> allows<00:04:05.970> us<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.180> make<00:04:06.390> angular<00:04:06.780> changes<00:04:08.660> now

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
it allows us to make angular changes now

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.170 
it allows us to make angular changes now
once<00:04:09.900> we<00:04:10.049> have<00:04:10.200> that<00:04:10.230> done<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.910> foots
