00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
rather simple all you do is peel off the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.490 
rather simple all you do is peel off the
first<00:00:28.320> layer<00:00:28.640> stick<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.500> plastic

thing<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.769> allows<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.399> align<00:00:32.669> it

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
thing that allows you to align it

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.790 
thing that allows you to align it
perfectly<00:00:33.239> just<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> frame<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.320> allows

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
perfectly just like a frame and allows

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.500 
perfectly just like a frame and allows
it<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.040> pretty<00:00:35.430> much<00:00:35.550> center<00:00:35.910> align<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.300> very

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it to pretty much center align it very

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.150 
it to pretty much center align it very
very<00:00:36.690> well<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.110> all<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.410> really<00:00:37.440> need<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.920> do

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
most of its competitors it's a pretty

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.499 
most of its competitors it's a pretty
good<00:01:43.979> deal<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.490> concerning<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.240> also

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
ipad mini and so on i think this is

definitely<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.729> very<00:01:50.759> very<00:01:51.270> great<00:01:51.509> product<00:01:51.990> but

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
definitely a very very great product but

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.109 
definitely a very very great product but
now<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.500> pretty<00:01:52.680> much<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:52.979> comes<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.610> how

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
now it pretty much just comes to how

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.420 
now it pretty much just comes to how
exactly<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.140> quality<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.100> skin

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
thoughts on this i have to say i did a

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.530 
thoughts on this i have to say i did a
very<00:02:25.799> very<00:02:26.040> good<00:02:26.250> job<00:02:26.459> installing<00:02:26.939> it<00:02:27.299> in

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
very very good job installing it in

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.849 
very very good job installing it in
terms<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.989> alignment<00:02:28.500> I'd<00:02:28.650> say<00:02:28.829> it's

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
terms of the alignment I'd say it's

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.649 
terms of the alignment I'd say it's
pretty<00:02:29.069> much<00:02:29.250> perfect<00:02:29.579> and<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.359> those<00:02:30.480> who

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
pretty much perfect and for those who

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.569 
pretty much perfect and for those who
are<00:02:30.780> afraid<00:02:31.019> of<00:02:31.140> installing<00:02:31.859> skin<00:02:32.189> protectors

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
are afraid of installing skin protectors

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.670 
are afraid of installing skin protectors
due<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:32.969> fact<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.359> the<00:02:33.590> chance<00:02:34.590> of

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
due to the fact that the chance of

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.770 
due to the fact that the chance of
getting<00:02:34.920> bubbles<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:36.090> alignment<00:02:36.569> getting

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
getting bubbles the alignment getting

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.270 
getting bubbles the alignment getting
messed<00:02:36.959> up<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.470> on<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.799> think<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.099> just

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
messed up and so on I think this just

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.190 
messed up and so on I think this just
makes<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.730> much<00:02:38.939> simpler<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:39.689> very<00:02:39.959> easy

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
makes it so much simpler it's very easy

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.960 
makes it so much simpler it's very easy
and<00:02:40.470> quick<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.739> get<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.129> installed<00:02:41.400> on<00:02:41.760> there

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
and quick to get it installed on there

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.509 
and quick to get it installed on there
and<00:02:42.120> just<00:02:43.049> let<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.709> guys<00:02:43.829> take<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.129> look<00:02:44.340> for

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
and just let you guys take a look for

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.250 
and just let you guys take a look for

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
yourself this really reminds her of the

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.020 
yourself this really reminds her of the
product<00:02:46.650> called<00:02:46.799> keoki<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.639> guys<00:02:47.790> didn't

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
product called keoki you guys didn't

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.610 
product called keoki you guys didn't
know<00:02:48.090> about<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.359> I<00:02:48.750> think<00:02:49.139> it's<00:02:49.260> like<00:02:49.379> about

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
know about that I think it's like about

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.080 
know about that I think it's like about
a<00:02:49.650> year<00:02:49.950> ago<00:02:49.980> back<00:02:50.430> then<00:02:50.639> when<00:02:50.760> they<00:02:50.849> had<00:02:50.969> their

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
a year ago back then when they had their

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.759 
a year ago back then when they had their
Kickstarter<00:02:51.629> campaign<00:02:52.019> where<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.319> also<00:02:52.590> had<00:02:52.739> a

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
Kickstarter campaign where it also had a

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.800 
Kickstarter campaign where it also had a
perfect<00:02:53.189> lyman<00:02:53.549> but<00:02:54.120> unfortunately<00:02:54.780> that

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
perfect lyman but unfortunately that

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.839 
perfect lyman but unfortunately that
product<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.470> its<00:02:55.620> company<00:02:55.980> eventually<00:02:56.280> fell

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
product and its company eventually fell

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.129 
product and its company eventually fell
so<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:57.599> is<00:02:57.629> definitely<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:58.019> great

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
so this is definitely a great

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.229 
so this is definitely a great
alternative<00:02:58.319> ever<00:02:58.980> since<00:02:59.340> I've<00:02:59.669> been<00:02:59.970> waiting

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.899 
for a product like this to come out and
especially<00:03:02.040> because<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.609> fact<00:03:02.790> that

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
especially because of the fact that

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.550
