turning in his math homework and I am
very<00:02:04.759> concerned<00:02:04.970> that<00:02:05.360> you<00:02:05.420> feel<00:02:05.630> like<00:02:05.660> he

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
very concerned that you feel like he

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.300 
very concerned that you feel like he
might<00:02:06.050> be<00:02:06.080> resisting<00:02:06.710> to<00:02:06.860> do<00:02:06.979> his<00:02:07.130> math

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
might be resisting to do his math

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.580 
might be resisting to do his math
homework<00:02:07.520> because<00:02:07.940> he's<00:02:08.320> frustrated<00:02:09.320> at<00:02:09.440> not

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
homework because he's frustrated at not

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.250 
homework because he's frustrated at not
understanding<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.399> completely<00:02:10.880> I<00:02:11.120> think<00:02:11.930> what

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
understanding it completely I think what

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.870 
understanding it completely I think what
I'll<00:02:12.380> do<00:02:12.590> with<00:02:12.770> some<00:02:12.950> extra<00:02:13.250> testing<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.700> see

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
I'll do with some extra testing to see

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.100 
I'll do with some extra testing to see
what<00:02:14.000> kind<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.180> problems<00:02:14.570> Billy<00:02:14.780> might<00:02:14.990> be

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
what kind of problems Billy might be

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.620 
what kind of problems Billy might be
having<00:02:15.440> with<00:02:15.560> his<00:02:15.740> math<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:17.150> way<00:02:17.300> I<00:02:17.330> can

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
having with his math that way I can

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.809 
having with his math that way I can
adjust<00:02:17.960> his<00:02:18.110> homework<00:02:18.410> assignments<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.190> also

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
adjust his homework assignments I also

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.700 
adjust his homework assignments I also
think<00:02:20.150> we<00:02:20.240> might<00:02:20.420> try<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.690> mirror<00:02:21.050> achievement

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
think we might try a mirror achievement

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.130 
think we might try a mirror achievement
award<00:02:22.010> system<00:02:22.270> with<00:02:23.270> Billy<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.750> would<00:02:23.930> be<00:02:24.110> a

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
award system with Billy it would be a

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.680 
award system with Billy it would be a
like<00:02:24.710> a<00:02:24.740> daily<00:02:25.130> report<00:02:25.280> card<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:26.330> he<00:02:26.510> would

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
like a daily report card and he would

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.000 
like a daily report card and he would
take<00:02:26.840> home<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.350> would<00:02:27.470> initial<00:02:27.890> ate

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
take home and you would initial ate

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.100 
take home and you would initial ate
every<00:02:28.280> night<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.610> he<00:02:28.730> did<00:02:29.210> his<00:02:29.360> homework<00:02:29.569> I

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
every night that he did his homework I

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.740 
every night that he did his homework I
don't<00:02:31.100> know<00:02:31.280> Billy<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.090> really<00:02:32.450> hard<00:02:32.690> to

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
don't know Billy is really hard to

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.690 
don't know Billy is really hard to
motivate<00:02:32.990> but<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:33.830> guess<00:02:34.069> we<00:02:34.220> could<00:02:34.340> give<00:02:34.520> it<00:02:34.610> a

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
motivate but I guess we could give it a

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.559 
motivate but I guess we could give it a
try

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.380 

step<00:02:38.569> 4<00:02:38.950> intervention<00:02:39.970> carrying<00:02:40.970> out<00:02:41.150> the

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
step 4 intervention carrying out the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.130 
step 4 intervention carrying out the
planned<00:02:41.660> intervention<00:02:43.240> this<00:02:44.240> is<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.660> daily

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
planned intervention this is the daily

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.320 
planned intervention this is the daily
report<00:02:45.230> card<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:45.950> what<00:02:46.100> it<00:02:46.190> looks<00:02:46.340> like<00:02:46.520> um

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
report card so what it looks like um

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.540 
report card so what it looks like um
Billy<00:02:48.080> would<00:02:48.319> when<00:02:48.800> Billy<00:02:49.010> does<00:02:49.220> his<00:02:49.400> homework

Billy would when Billy does his homework
you<00:02:49.819> just<00:02:50.030> initial<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.569> and<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:51.020> turn

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
you just initial it and you turn

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
Billy's been doing

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.860 
Billy's been doing
Billy's<00:03:32.890> great<00:03:33.280> he's<00:03:33.670> doing<00:03:34.000> his<00:03:34.120> homework<00:03:34.150> I

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
Billy's great he's doing his homework I

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.750 
Billy's great he's doing his homework I
have<00:03:34.990> to<00:03:35.230> keep<00:03:35.380> reminding<00:03:35.590> him<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.130> do<00:03:36.310> it<00:03:36.460> but

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
have to keep reminding him to do it but

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.430 
have to keep reminding him to do it but
the<00:03:36.910> goal<00:03:37.060> of<00:03:37.090> tickets<00:03:37.480> are<00:03:37.600> really<00:03:37.630> helping<00:03:38.290> I

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
the goal of tickets are really helping I

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.410 
the goal of tickets are really helping I
think<00:03:39.190> he<00:03:39.280> still<00:03:39.490> has<00:03:39.550> a<00:03:39.670> lot<00:03:39.940> more<00:03:40.120> trouble

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
think he still has a lot more trouble

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.350 
think he still has a lot more trouble
with<00:03:40.960> math<00:03:41.410> than<00:03:41.800> other<00:03:41.980> things<00:03:42.310> but<00:03:43.090> he's<00:03:43.180> got

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
with math than other things but he's got

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.300 
with math than other things but he's got
a<00:03:43.390> better<00:03:43.660> attitude<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:44.470> think<00:03:44.830> he<00:03:45.130> has<00:03:45.280> more

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
a better attitude I think he has more

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.850 
a better attitude I think he has more
