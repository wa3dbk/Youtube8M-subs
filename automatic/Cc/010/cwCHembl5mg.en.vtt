00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.120 
decent bastard sword should be I really
like<00:05:28.030> the<00:05:28.210> way<00:05:28.419> the<00:05:28.690> blade<00:05:29.020> is<00:05:29.260> a<00:05:29.620> little<00:05:29.979> bit

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
like the way the blade is a little bit

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.840 
like the way the blade is a little bit
damaged<00:05:30.760> like<00:05:31.570> it<00:05:31.900> has<00:05:32.340> seasoned<00:05:33.340> use<00:05:33.580> already

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
damaged like it has seasoned use already

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.210 
damaged like it has seasoned use already
I<00:05:34.419> think<00:05:35.020> that's<00:05:35.169> that's<00:05:35.650> really<00:05:35.770> cool

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
I think that's that's really cool

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.909 
I think that's that's really cool
because<00:05:36.460> most<00:05:37.060> blades<00:05:37.479> are<00:05:37.810> just<00:05:38.229> as<00:05:38.410> shiny<00:05:38.800> as

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
because most blades are just as shiny as

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.520 
because most blades are just as shiny as
they<00:05:39.220> are<00:05:39.400> right<00:05:39.669> from<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:39.910> start<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:40.660> this

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
they are right from the start and this

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.409 
they are right from the start and this
one<00:05:41.740> looks<00:05:42.070> more<00:05:42.160> like<00:05:42.669> you<00:05:42.940> have<00:05:43.060> fought<00:05:43.390> a

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
one looks more like you have fought a

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:56.710 
one looks more like you have fought a
few<00:05:43.690> battles<00:05:43.930> with<00:05:44.290> it

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720

here you can see the difference between

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.260 
here you can see the difference between
the<00:05:59.670> 100<00:06:00.270> and<00:06:00.450> 200<00:06:00.720> sword<00:06:01.320> and<00:06:01.740> as<00:06:02.370> you<00:06:02.700> notice
