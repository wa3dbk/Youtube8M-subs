00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.200 
coming soon to xbox and ps3 for GTA 5
now<00:00:10.380> this<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.740> once<00:00:11.219> again<00:00:11.309> leaked<00:00:11.700> but<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.059> was

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
now this is once again leaked but it was

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.509 
now this is once again leaked but it was
through<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.599> game<00:00:12.840> marketplace<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.099> xbox

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
through the game marketplace on the xbox

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.730 
through the game marketplace on the xbox
so<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.360> was<00:00:15.570> how<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.750> was<00:00:16.109> found<00:00:16.320> out<00:00:16.560> last

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
so on this was how it was found out last

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.170 
so on this was how it was found out last
time<00:00:16.920> with<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.310> I'm<00:00:17.400> not<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> hipster<00:00:17.789> update

time with that I'm not a hipster update

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.120 
time with that I'm not a hipster update
so<00:00:18.420> most<00:00:18.930> likely<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.380> will<00:00:19.529> be<00:00:19.650> real<00:00:19.830> but<00:00:20.039> I'm

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
so most likely this will be real but I'm

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.439

not<00:00:20.250> going<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.400> say<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.580> for<00:00:20.850> sure<00:00:20.880> anyways

another thing that sounds really cool is
the<00:01:33.930> monster<00:01:34.170> truck<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.710> think<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.250> would

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the monster truck I think that it would

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.429 
the monster truck I think that it would
be<00:01:35.520> sweet<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.119> know<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.509> dub<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.020> six<00:01:37.229> by<00:01:37.380> six

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
be sweet I know that dub so six by six

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.170 
be sweet I know that dub so six by six
pretty<00:01:37.979> sweet<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.700> know<00:01:38.790> two

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
pretty sweet but if it's you know two

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.880 
pretty sweet but if it's you know two
three<00:01:39.390> times<00:01:39.540> bigger<00:01:39.720> than<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.740> would

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
three times bigger than that that would

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.310 
three times bigger than that that would
be<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.400> fucking<00:01:42.090> cool<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.869> him<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.140> game

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
be so fucking cool to have him the game

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.319 
be so fucking cool to have him the game
an<00:01:44.070> hour<00:01:44.189> cool<00:01:44.399> thing<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.640> would<00:01:44.790> void<00:01:44.880> think<00:01:45.180> is

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
an hour cool thing I would void think is

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.780 
an hour cool thing I would void think is
very<00:01:45.570> very<00:01:45.810> unique<00:01:46.049> maybe<00:01:47.009> not<00:01:47.220> for<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> good

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
very very unique maybe not for the good

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.340 
very very unique maybe not for the good
you<00:01:48.149> know<00:01:48.240> good<00:01:48.479> portion<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> game<00:01:49.200> but

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
you know good portion of the game but

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.929 
you know good portion of the game but
for<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.590> bad<00:01:49.740> portion<00:01:50.250> or<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.670> know<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
for the bad portion or you know the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.030 
for the bad portion or you know the
needs<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.570> be<00:01:51.630> improved<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.710> actual

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
needs to be improved on is the actual

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.100 
needs to be improved on is the actual
musket<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.759> think<00:01:54.240> that's<00:01:54.329> going<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.689> way

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
musket I think that's going to be way

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.289 
musket I think that's going to be way
underpowered<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.640> shot<00:01:56.909> unless

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
underpowered with just one shot unless

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.240 
underpowered with just one shot unless
it's<00:01:57.509> some<00:01:57.600> kind<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.899> repeating<00:01:58.320> musket<00:01:59.040> or

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
it's some kind of repeating musket or

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.709 
it's some kind of repeating musket or
some<00:01:59.430> i'm<00:01:59.700> not<00:02:00.090> sure<00:02:00.210> what<00:02:00.299> they'll<00:02:00.450> do<00:02:00.540> there

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
some i'm not sure what they'll do there

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.209 
some i'm not sure what they'll do there
but<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.049> know<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.229> could<00:02:01.469> be<00:02:01.680> cool<00:02:01.950> and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
but you know that could be cool and

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.219 
but you know that could be cool and
finally<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.149> thing<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.420> boy<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
finally the thing I boy like is the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.690 
finally the thing I boy like is the
rocket<00:02:04.590> launcher<00:02:04.619> if<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.579> an

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
rocket launcher if it's like an

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.760 
rocket launcher if it's like an
automatic<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.509> know<00:02:06.600> somewhat<00:02:06.990> between<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
automatic you know somewhat between the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.889 
automatic you know somewhat between the
grenade<00:02:08.039> launcher<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.759> RPG<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.420> think

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
grenade launcher and the RPG I think

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.449 
grenade launcher and the RPG I think
that<00:02:10.020> will<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.319> best<00:02:10.530> addition<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.190> fight

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
that will be the best addition to fight

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.460 
that will be the best addition to fight
