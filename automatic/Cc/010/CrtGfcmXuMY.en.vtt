video schedules in all that cell but
here<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.519> completely<00:00:27.000> expandable<00:00:27.689> up<00:00:27.779> to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
here it is completely expandable up to

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.929 
here it is completely expandable up to
build<00:00:28.140> limits<00:00:28.560> I'll<00:00:29.279> keep<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.670> mind<00:00:29.849> that

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
build limits I'll keep in mind that

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.999 
build limits I'll keep in mind that
anvils<00:00:30.390> do<00:00:30.570> take<00:00:30.779> fall<00:00:31.019> damage<00:00:31.170> not<00:00:31.710> every

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009

anvils do take fall damage not every
time<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.690> they<00:00:33.690> do<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:34.800> no<00:00:35.160> fall<00:00:35.370> damage

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
time but they do that one no fall damage

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.869 
time but they do that one no fall damage
um<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.590> yeah<00:00:37.739> they<00:00:37.950> take<00:00:38.160> damage<00:00:38.340> they<00:00:38.700> take

um but yeah they take damage they take
damage<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.329> like<00:00:39.450> if<00:00:39.570> they're<00:00:39.719> being<00:00:39.899> used<00:00:40.260> I

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
damage just like if they're being used I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.250 
damage just like if they're being used I
had<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> couple<00:00:42.120> complications<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
had a couple complications with it

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.080 
had a couple complications with it
though<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.040> activating<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> bud<00:00:44.910> switch

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
though it was activating the bud switch

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.520 
though it was activating the bud switch
when<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.450> broke<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.840> then<00:00:46.020> when<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.230> landed

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
when it broke and then when it landed

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.229 
when it broke and then when it landed
was<00:00:46.710> activating<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> bud<00:00:47.579> switch<00:00:47.700> again<00:00:48.030> so

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
was activating the bud switch again so

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.940 
was activating the bud switch again so
you<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.629> two<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.469> threw<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.829> this

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
you have like two so I threw in this

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.260 
you have like two so I threw in this
little<00:00:50.160> timer<00:00:50.370> took<00:00:50.670> me<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> while<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> figure

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
little timer took me a while to figure

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.910 
little timer took me a while to figure
that<00:00:51.420> out<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.870> lock<00:00:52.050> up<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> torch<00:00:52.620> tower

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
that out just to lock up the torch tower

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.650 
that out just to lock up the torch tower
um<00:00:53.850> all<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.020> works<00:00:55.170> well<00:00:56.449> happy<00:00:57.449> within

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.029 
um all in all it works well happy within
it's<00:00:57.960> simple<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.530> could<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.739> been<00:00:58.829> one

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
it's simple and it could have been one

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.529 
it's simple and it could have been one
white<00:00:59.250> except<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.030> took<00:01:00.180> me<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.390> while<00:01:00.480> to

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
white except I this took me a while to

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.840 
white except I this took me a while to
figure<00:01:00.840> now<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.440> didn't<00:01:01.859> even<00:01:01.949> bother<00:01:02.370> do<00:01:02.730> it

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
figure now so I didn't even bother do it

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
with the bud switch as you're building

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.820 
with the bud switch as you're building
this<00:01:15.780> thing<00:01:15.840> okay<00:01:16.110> because<00:01:16.409> every<00:01:16.560> time<00:01:16.590> you

do something you know next to that

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.080 
do something you know next to that
piston<00:01:19.369> it's<00:01:20.369> gonna<00:01:20.490> activate<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.880> bud

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
piston it's gonna activate the bud

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.640 
piston it's gonna activate the bud
switch<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.509> yeah<00:01:21.659> I'm<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:21.930> that's<00:01:22.170> where<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
switch so yeah I'm so that's where the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.490 
switch so yeah I'm so that's where the
anvil<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> go<00:01:23.939> right<00:01:24.299> there<00:01:24.570> all

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
anvil is going to go right there all

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.140 
anvil is going to go right there all
right<00:01:25.880> redstone<00:01:26.880> torch<00:01:27.710> dust<00:01:28.710> dust<00:01:29.310> then

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
right redstone torch dust dust then

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.310 
right redstone torch dust dust then
we're<00:01:30.240> going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.420> go<00:01:30.509> block<00:01:30.900> block<00:01:31.200> block

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
we're going to go block block block

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.770 
we're going to go block block block
block<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:33.200> dust<00:01:34.200> us<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:35.090> go<00:01:36.090> glowstone

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
block like that dust us I go glowstone

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.010 
block like that dust us I go glowstone
here<00:01:38.210> block<00:01:39.210> block<00:01:40.250> dust<00:01:41.540> dust<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.840> a

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
here block block dust dust and a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.530 
here block block dust dust and a
repeater<00:01:43.320> here<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.740> three<00:01:44.159> tix<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.880> was<00:01:45.329> doing

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
repeater here on three tix I was doing

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.940 
repeater here on three tix I was doing
the<00:01:45.630> TKE<00:01:45.840> earlier<00:01:46.259> actually<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.829> was

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the TKE earlier actually and it was

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.410 
the TKE earlier actually and it was
freaking<00:01:47.280> out<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.610> then<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.820> figured<00:01:48.149> out<00:01:48.240> that

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
freaking out and then I figured out that

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.510 
freaking out and then I figured out that
this<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:48.899> needed<00:01:49.649> for<00:01:49.890> ticks<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.280> don't<00:01:50.460> know

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
this one needed for ticks I don't know

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520 
this one needed for ticks I don't know
maybe<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.970> chunk<00:01:51.270> base<00:01:51.479> deal<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.380> some

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
maybe it's a chunk base deal so for some

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.899 
maybe it's a chunk base deal so for some
reason<00:01:52.560> you're<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.130> never<00:01:53.250> again<00:01:53.729> I

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
reason you're like it's never again I

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.609 
reason you're like it's never again I
don't<00:01:54.270> know<00:01:54.360> put<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.899> for<00:01:55.170> ticks<00:01:55.409> or

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
don't know put this on for ticks or

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.069 
don't know put this on for ticks or
something<00:01:55.920> guys<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.549> yeah<00:01:56.759> definitely<00:01:57.270> was

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
something guys but yeah definitely was

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.929 
something guys but yeah definitely was
the<00:01:58.229> issue<00:01:58.320> with<00:01:58.680> when<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.219> was<00:01:59.369> building<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.759> on

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
the issue with when I was building it on

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.940 
the issue with when I was building it on
the<00:02:00.540> last<00:02:00.719> take<00:02:00.930> i<00:02:01.049> did<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.469> obviously<00:02:01.860> i

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the last take i did so obviously i

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.310 
the last take i did so obviously i
deleted<00:02:02.340> i<00:02:02.549> started<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> new<00:02:03.030> one<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:04.290> i

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
deleted i started a new one but i

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.389 
deleted i started a new one but i
figured<00:02:04.590> i'd<00:02:04.680> bring<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:05.009> up<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.280> might

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
figured i'd bring that up it might

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.980 
figured i'd bring that up it might
happen<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:05.909> one<00:02:06.090> though<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.450> i'll<00:02:06.689> put<00:02:06.869> it

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
happen on this one though so i'll put it

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.419 
happen on this one though so i'll put it
to<00:02:07.110> three<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.500> then<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.860> freaks<00:02:08.069> out<00:02:08.220> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
to three and then if it freaks out and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.830 
to three and then if it freaks out and
also<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.849> four<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.330> should<00:02:09.539> likely

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
also at the four and that should likely

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.580 
also at the four and that should likely
fix<00:02:10.289> it

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
fix it

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.850 
fix it
so<00:02:11.190> then<00:02:11.340> from<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:11.760> torch<00:02:12.330> right<00:02:12.900> here<00:02:13.379> right

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
so then from this torch right here right

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.470 
so then from this torch right here right
here<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.160> see<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.489> right<00:02:14.670> there<00:02:14.760> we're

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
here you see that right there we're

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.619 
here you see that right there we're
going<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.660> put<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.840> redstone<00:02:16.260> desk<00:02:17.629> redstone

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
going to put a redstone desk redstone

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:19.670 
going to put a redstone desk redstone
torch<00:02:18.900> like<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.260> we're<00:02:19.349> going<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.530> come

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
torch like so we're going to come

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.160 
torch like so we're going to come
underneath<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.190> block<00:02:20.489> like<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.300> then

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
underneath this block like this and then

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.589 
underneath this block like this and then
like<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:22.860> like<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:25.230> then<00:02:25.440> dust<00:02:25.739> dust

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
like this like this and then dust dust

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.100 
like this like this and then dust dust
we're<00:02:27.599> gonna<00:02:27.720> go<00:02:27.930> up<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.709> so<00:02:30.110> underneath

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
we're gonna go up like so underneath

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.570 
we're gonna go up like so underneath
that<00:02:31.290> once<00:02:31.440> we<00:02:31.620> need<00:02:31.739> an<00:02:31.860> upside-down<00:02:32.190> half

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
that once we need an upside-down half

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.369 
that once we need an upside-down half
slab<00:02:32.790> basically<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.269> top<00:02:33.510> portion<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:34.230> that

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
slab basically the top portion of that

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.820 
slab basically the top portion of that
being<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.769> slab<00:02:35.269> I'm<00:02:36.269> sure<00:02:36.599> redstone<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.680> mean

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
being a slab I'm sure redstone I mean

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.259 
being a slab I'm sure redstone I mean
close<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.220> what<00:02:38.370> also<00:02:38.519> work<00:02:38.790> but<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.150> know

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
dust here so then just do this for

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.150 
dust here so then just do this for
repeaters<00:04:03.720> on<00:04:03.900> for<00:04:04.230> ticks<00:04:05.150> like<00:04:06.150> that's<00:04:07.160> like

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
repeaters on for ticks like that's like

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.430 
repeaters on for ticks like that's like
that<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:09.330> like<00:04:09.360> that<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:10.560> now<00:04:10.680> we<00:04:10.740> break<00:04:11.130> it

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
that and like that so now we break it

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.860 
that and like that so now we break it
comes<00:04:13.440> our<00:04:13.710> anvil<00:04:14.360> again<00:04:15.360> it<00:04:15.510> would<00:04:15.780> have

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
comes our anvil again it would have

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.020 
comes our anvil again it would have
normally<00:04:16.110> done<00:04:16.380> another<00:04:16.800> anvil<00:04:17.310> but<00:04:17.520> we<00:04:17.880> have

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
normally done another anvil but we have
