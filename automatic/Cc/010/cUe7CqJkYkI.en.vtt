00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
hunger system tutorial now to start with

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.950 
hunger system tutorial now to start with
I'm<00:00:04.380> gonna<00:00:04.500> make<00:00:04.650> this<00:00:04.770> look<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:05.040> bit<00:00:05.190> more

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:05.960 
I'm gonna make this look a bit more

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.810 
I'm gonna make this look a bit more
tightly<00:00:06.960> so<00:00:07.200> we<00:00:07.290> can<00:00:07.440> follow<00:00:08.099> it<00:00:08.280> easier<00:00:08.550> so

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
tightly so we can follow it easier so

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.030 
tightly so we can follow it easier so
we'll<00:00:08.940> right-click<00:00:09.179> add<00:00:09.929> comment<00:00:10.530> let's

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
we'll right-click add comment let's

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.259 
we'll right-click add comment let's
change<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.519> hunger<00:00:12.480> system<00:00:14.150> we're<00:00:15.150> gonna

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
change this to hunger system we're gonna

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.840 
change this to hunger system we're gonna
move<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.900> over<00:00:15.990> here<00:00:16.320> now<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.220> can<00:00:17.460> drag<00:00:17.640> these

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
move it over here now we can drag these

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.790 
move it over here now we can drag these
over<00:00:18.650> here

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
over here

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.730 
over here
so<00:00:21.400> I<00:00:21.430> note<00:00:21.760> that<00:00:21.790> inside<00:00:22.420> of<00:00:22.450> it<00:00:22.690> so<00:00:23.560> it<00:00:23.620> looks

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
so I note that inside of it so it looks

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.220 
so I note that inside of it so it looks
a<00:00:23.830> bit<00:00:23.860> more<00:00:24.070> neat<00:00:24.310> now<00:00:25.210> to<00:00:25.270> begin<00:00:25.450> with<00:00:25.750> let's

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
a bit more neat now to begin with let's

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.070 
a bit more neat now to begin with let's
go<00:00:26.350> to<00:00:26.440> volumes<00:00:26.860> we'll<00:00:27.640> scroll<00:00:27.940> down<00:00:28.210> we'll

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
go to volumes we'll scroll down we'll

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.159 
go to volumes we'll scroll down we'll
drag<00:00:29.260> out<00:00:29.440> a<00:00:29.470> post-process<00:00:30.310> volume<00:00:31.169> it's

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
drag out a post-process volume it's

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.390 
drag out a post-process volume it's
going<00:00:32.320> to<00:00:32.380> scale<00:00:32.650> that<00:00:32.800> up<00:00:32.860> so<00:00:33.100> our<00:00:33.220> players

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
going to scale that up so our players

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.680 
going to scale that up so our players
inside<00:00:33.850> it

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.300 

and<00:00:38.200> we<00:00:38.320> want<00:00:38.470> to<00:00:38.530> change<00:00:38.680> it<00:00:38.920> to<00:00:39.010> black<00:00:39.280> and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
and we want to change it to black and

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.010 
and we want to change it to black and
white<00:00:39.670> and<00:00:40.600> I'll<00:00:40.720> show<00:00:40.930> you<00:00:40.960> why<00:00:41.200> in<00:00:41.440> a<00:00:41.530> second

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.480 

and<00:01:09.490> we're<00:01:09.610> gonna<00:01:09.700> leave<00:01:09.939> it<00:01:10.060> unchecked<00:01:10.420> so

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
and we're gonna leave it unchecked so

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.160 
and we're gonna leave it unchecked so
we<00:01:13.000> don't<00:01:13.180> have<00:01:13.300> any<00:01:13.450> black-and-white<00:01:13.930> going

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
we don't have any black-and-white going

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.350 
we don't have any black-and-white going
on<00:01:14.260> when<00:01:14.410> we<00:01:14.440> jump<00:01:14.740> in<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:14.920> game

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
on when we jump in the game

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.260 
on when we jump in the game
okay<00:01:17.110> so<00:01:17.170> let's<00:01:17.440> say<00:01:17.560> we<00:01:17.710> hit<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:17.950> value<00:01:18.400> of<00:01:18.550> 95

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
okay so let's say we hit the value of 95

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.030 
okay so let's say we hit the value of 95
and<00:01:19.540> we<00:01:20.020> want<00:01:20.200> this<00:01:20.320> black<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.770> white<00:01:20.830> to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
and we want this black and white to

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.920 
and we want this black and white to
enable<00:01:21.430> so<00:01:21.580> it's<00:01:21.730> like<00:01:21.850> showing<00:01:22.180> us<00:01:22.420> that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
enable so it's like showing us that

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.070 
enable so it's like showing us that
we're<00:01:23.080> hungry<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:25.120> do<00:01:25.300> this<00:01:25.510> we<00:01:25.690> can<00:01:25.870> drag

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
we're hungry so to do this we can drag

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.250 
we're hungry so to do this we can drag
out<00:01:26.200> hunger<00:01:26.740> or<00:01:27.400> click<00:01:27.610> get<00:01:27.900> drag<00:01:28.900> this<00:01:29.050> out

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
out hunger or click get drag this out

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.500 
out hunger or click get drag this out
and<00:01:29.440> type<00:01:29.800> in<00:01:30.040> comm<00:01:30.640> pair

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.510 

and<00:01:34.810> now<00:01:35.790> we'll<00:01:36.790> compare<00:01:37.270> with<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.840> value<00:01:37.870> of

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
and now we'll compare with the value of

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.820 
and now we'll compare with the value of
95

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.180 

so<00:01:43.430> these<00:01:43.910> execution<00:01:44.900> outputs<00:01:45.350> that's<00:01:45.950> four

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
so these execution outputs that's four

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.770 
so these execution outputs that's four
over<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.700> value<00:01:46.970> of<00:01:47.060> 95

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
over the value of 95

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.840 
over the value of 95
that's<00:01:48.020> equals<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.770> value<00:01:49.010> of<00:01:49.100> 95<00:01:49.640> and

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
that's equals to the value of 95 and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.609 
that's equals to the value of 95 and
that's<00:01:50.390> below<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.900> value<00:01:51.080> of<00:01:51.350> 95

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
that's below the value of 95

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.770 
that's below the value of 95
so<00:01:54.250> let's<00:01:54.520> drag<00:01:54.789> this<00:01:55.000> one<00:01:55.179> out<00:01:55.299> here<00:01:55.509> and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
so let's drag this one out here and

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.090 
so let's drag this one out here and
let's<00:01:55.990> change<00:01:56.530> this<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.799> a<00:01:56.979> sequence

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.610 

because<00:02:01.670> we<00:02:01.790> want<00:02:01.970> to<00:02:02.030> fire<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.540> events<00:02:03.470> of

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
because we want to fire to events of

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.210 
because we want to fire to events of
this<00:02:04.190> tick<00:02:05.260> so<00:02:06.260> if<00:02:06.350> we<00:02:06.440> click<00:02:06.530> simulate<00:02:07.040> now

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
this tick so if we click simulate now

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.550 
this tick so if we click simulate now
we<00:02:08.760> can<00:02:08.910> see<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.510> this<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.840> constantly

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
we can see that this is constantly

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.610 
we can see that this is constantly
checking<00:02:10.950> for<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.640> value<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.090> 95<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:13.080> our

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
checking for the value of 95 in our

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.760 
checking for the value of 95 in our
hunger

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.900 

so<00:02:17.310> let's<00:02:17.490> say<00:02:17.610> we<00:02:17.790> want<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.090> change<00:02:18.870> this

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
so let's say we want to change this

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.220 
so let's say we want to change this
enable<00:02:20.910> black<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.270> white<00:02:21.390> sorry<00:02:21.630> when<00:02:22.110> we

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
enable black and white sorry when we

the<00:02:47.150> value<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.450> 95

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
the value of 95

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.910 
the value of 95
okay<00:02:50.480> we're<00:02:50.599> gonna<00:02:50.719> finish<00:02:50.930> up<00:02:51.170> in<00:02:51.379> part<00:02:51.620> three

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
okay we're gonna finish up in part three

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
where we can show you how we have an

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.319 
where we can show you how we have an
object<00:02:54.379> and<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:55.219> can<00:02:55.310> react<00:02:55.549> like<00:02:55.700> food<00:02:56.000> so<00:02:56.209> we

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
object and it can react like food so we

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.479 
object and it can react like food so we
pick<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.629> up<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.019> then<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:57.739> increases<00:02:57.950> our

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
pick it up and then it increases our

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.610 
pick it up and then it increases our
value<00:02:58.819> of<00:02:58.909> the<00:02:59.000> hunger<00:02:59.329> again<00:02:59.569> but<00:03:00.319> once<00:03:00.469> we've

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
value of the hunger again but once we've

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.559 
value of the hunger again but once we've
picked<00:03:00.799> it<00:03:00.920> up<00:03:01.040> our<00:03:01.310> hunger<00:03:01.730> value<00:03:01.969> will<00:03:02.269> still

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
picked it up our hunger value will still

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.240 
picked it up our hunger value will still
decrease<00:03:03.109> so<00:03:03.469> I'll<00:03:03.560> see<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:03.769> guys<00:03:03.890> over<00:03:04.129> and
