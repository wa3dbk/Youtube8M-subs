00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 hi guys today we will go 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:09.300
 shock absorbers and forks here we look 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.980
 all disassembled put this 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.990
 sequences so that later it is easier 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.059
 it was to collect and then somehow did not have to 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.539
 deal with shock absorber analysis and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.789
 forks here look at the fork with the fork 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.580
 everything is fine here 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.920
 all the time from 8 6 years nothing 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.019
 it only remains for us to throw 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.320
 oil seals we have original 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.059
 seals Czechoslovak and collect but with 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.270
 shock absorbers already have some problems 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.579
 But look at all here disassembled in 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.160
 Basically, but these supports 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.870
 here you see time shat shat shat should not 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.480
 be here we just need to go up 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.829
 turners pull out so same 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.739
 a thing so she sat tight and then there will be 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.210
 I still want to miss garbage 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.750
 say we try on the wheel 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.300
 put not 23 bearings just here 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.309
 take the sleeve and cut to the width 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.810
 bearing and put 3 here look 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.810
 we have the original ok 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.670
 original we have bearing so 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.180
 here are three all three good all three should 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.850
 work work well so let's 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.409
 now let's go show you the wheels 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.259
 here we kicked the wheel it arched 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.149
 here all the wheels were inside we are all 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.789
 kicked out aluminum light wheels 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.789
 good cars us okay too 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.520
 but it is so look our cylinders 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.569
 bored it already for 3 repairs all with them 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.429
 OK 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.979
 our engine but it's a motorcycle here 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:52.929
 parts weight lies and look 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.549
 pay attention we all painted lights 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.170
 Faro rather 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.640
 it is on the fork painted shock absorber 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.649
 details painted 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.200
 and here are a couple of details such 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.049
 additional all painted only here 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.310
 look now at the spotlight there is one minus 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:13.269
 there is a nuance here see a little bit 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.269
 ugly it turns out because in 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:19.430
 the previous owner apparently fell bad and 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.850
 the headlamp is still intact at all 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.500
 motorcycle on this very many fell 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.799
 know guys went to the barn day 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.799
 look at trying this one just 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.450
 I had to go from her and so 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.880
 such a feeling immediately fuck 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.739
 Straight make faster this bike already 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.769
 switch to that for some reason 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.680
 try it here and I like it better 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.350
 here is some Soviet one preserved 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.239

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.670

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.109
 will we about the analysis of the engine will whom 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.000

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.769
