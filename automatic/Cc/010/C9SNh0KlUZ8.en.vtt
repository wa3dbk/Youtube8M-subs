00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
pretty cheap upgrade to get a little

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.990 
pretty cheap upgrade to get a little
lower<00:03:53.690> for<00:03:53.810> performance<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:55.580> also<00:03:55.850> something

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
lower for performance and also something

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.640 
lower for performance and also something
to<00:03:56.150> point<00:03:56.390> out<00:03:56.540> what<00:03:56.930> these<00:03:57.110> cars<00:03:57.380> over<00:03:57.590> here

different performance upgrades and

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.449 
different performance upgrades and
comparison<00:04:03.260> like<00:04:03.410> their<00:04:03.650> regular<00:04:04.040> models

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
comparison like their regular models

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.960

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
categorized in the code to be a

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.810 
categorized in the code to be a
completely<00:04:17.419> different<00:04:17.810> car<00:04:18.340> yeah<00:04:19.340> that's

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
completely different car yeah that's

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.759 
completely different car yeah that's
pretty<00:04:20.209> much<00:04:20.329> sums<00:04:20.660> up<00:04:20.870> rivals<00:04:21.290> cars<00:04:21.530> in<00:04:21.709> a

cars<00:04:25.729> even<00:04:25.910> though<00:04:26.090> they<00:04:26.210> look<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.450> same<00:04:26.630> but

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
cars even though they look the same but

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.620 
cars even though they look the same but
with<00:04:27.020> really<00:04:27.350> weird<00:04:27.620> decals<00:04:28.180> so<00:04:29.180> yeah<00:04:29.330> I

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
with really weird decals so yeah I

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.960
