00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.279
 or the section of the channel that is called 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.980
 doubts of the community and good for what 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.080
 is this section or good is this part 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.410
 of the good channel is more than anything 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.870
 answer questions from the community 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.420
 ok asks us Alejandro colorado in 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.540
 the reb forum and if it is possible to create 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.660
 annotations in 3-d the answer is good 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.489
 yes yes you can have a lot 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.040
 careful when creating them but if 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.540
 you can let's see how it's done 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.640
 we can go directly to the file 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.549
 note and we can select the dimension 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.699
 aligned for example if I want to narrow 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:03.489
 the distance in these columns 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.930
 let's say face to face we can 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.590
 select here we will select 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.510
 faces of the wall and we're going to select the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.350
 face of this from this column in this 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.300
 Case is the face 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.820
 here he does not let himself select 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.890
 well I will turn a little bit the view and 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.370
 here where it starts to complicate we're going 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.680
 try to select this face 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.920
 and for example I can select now 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.710
 all these faces but if you realize 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.070
 it does not let me select the faces that I 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.230
 I want it is like the program is 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.110
 in a 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.150
 constant conflict because for example 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.580
 let's see what it cost 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.660
 if I turn this view I can tell 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:54.590
 that here I take my face from here and the 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:57.590
 face here and in this case the truth 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.780
 he said I have one what I understand the 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.260
 width of the face column from here to 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.080
 the face on this side ok let's see for 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.979
 what's happening is good first of all 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.590
 we have to define a plane 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:16.310
 to be able to draw them 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.920
 if I want to narrow these faces this 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.030
 face that I have here I have to define a 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.209
 plane that is perpendicular to this face 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.030
 okay 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.700
 In other words, if I select 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.280
 this is like a plane all my 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.110
 contributions of these of these faces go 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.540
 to be perpendicular to the plane because 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.370
 I'm going to have a line like that and the other one is going to 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.340
 be perpendicular ok I hope I 'm 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.780
 understanding ok then for that what 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.090
 first thing I have to do before 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.640
 to limit will be to go to architecture and 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.019
 I'm going to define a plane in this case 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.239
 we can see that the plane that was 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.720
 defined was the one here, that's why 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.120
 I 'm just going to show him the 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.780
 be defined this plane josh let's say 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.690
 this plane x I will go to the view 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.280
 top we can see here the plane at 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.319
 be defined the plane has been 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.140
 horizontal I could only narrow down 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.000
 vertical way ok in this sense now 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.670
 what I need is that this plane 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.030
 be in this vertical direction for 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.980
 can limit horizontally 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.580
 so that's why I want to limit 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.540
 this scale I need to turn my plane 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.120
 so for that we're going to go to 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.250
 define let's select a plane you 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.740
 we are going to give to accept and we are going now to 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.660
 touch this here then with this 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.910
 flechita we can expand our plane 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.220
 as you see now our plane has changed 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.160
 now if we can go to the scoring tab 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.440
 aligned and it will allow us 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.050
 select all these faces by 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.819
 example I can select this face the 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.370
 face that I have behind and he tells me that he has 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:52.209
 35 centimeters I can select this 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.610
 face this face and so on go 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.440
 selecting all the faces all the 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.130
 faces that are perpendicular to that 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:03.310
 flat is going to let me narrow the ok let's go 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.050
 to suppose that this and this one then 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.650
 it simply remains for me to place it 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.410
 where I need it so much upwards 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:16.040
 down and let's assume that I 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.230
 they like it here ok i 'm going to give is that for 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.660
 end the coma not if I need 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.210
 narrow other parts we can do it 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.370
 Now there is the only problem that 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.710
 let's have good the question of 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.720
 perspective ok if I modify my 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.210
 perspective for example these 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.350
 annotations are going to look different if I 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.630
 edited them and for example I change their 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.560
 reading convention 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.510
 up and right they will change ok 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.270
 you just have to have a lot 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.190
 be careful how we are placing them 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.650
 preference I will recommend you a 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.260
 once they have the 3d view they want 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.240
 check them again and put them 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.560
 horizontal so that they remain 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.690
 correctly 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.010
 ok once we have finished this 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.590
 let's go to architecture and let's 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.690
 put to pay our work plan and 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.110
 we can continue shortening everything 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.570
 we need good and good 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.070
 basically if we limit in 3-d I hope 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.920
 that you liked this video and that 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.510
 serve them for future projects if 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.150
 have some doubt do not forget to leave her 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.070
 down here this section opens with 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.320
 this video that doubts the community 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.520
 number 1 see you in the next 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.520
 chapter ay
