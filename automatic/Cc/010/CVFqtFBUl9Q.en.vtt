 hand and also to prepare that not 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.870
 be boring that not love you 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.870
 stop during the process by saying 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.790
 well this is very simple but 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.400
 this section we want to tell people 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.470

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.540
 but not very square itself as 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.770
 healthy possible especially because 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.260
 comes the weekend and we all 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.300

 that we are going to prepare the dishes here 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.020
 is the time they are going to take 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.450
 long 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.010
 we have tomato and tomato ball in the 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.250
 we have it in the supermarket 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.990

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.460
 Exactly thin water with your fingers 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.860

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.730
 dani alves is paramount that does not use the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.530
 word now we before the products 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.270
 are washed is all hygiene 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.760

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.660
 working with me the production is already 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.480
 formed thanks 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.520
 you're not going to leave but perfect we're going to 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.500
 continue with the salad when with 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.630
 any of the two tomato boxes 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.050
 is interspersing them justly if 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.080
 tomato cheese, oaxaca and tomato 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.240
 tomato cheese that exactly 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.180
 it's just the way to sweetie and here 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.510
 follow him with Oaxaca cheese is 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.390
 the salad finished on this side and 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.400
 we continue with this is the same tomato that 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.820
 that this only taste or wait 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.620
 clear in the markets also 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.630
 they make it especially for the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.150
 restaurant is a fresh cheese too 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.800
 very rich or it can be panela cheese or 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.810
 you buy in that area 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.700
 any restaurant does not recommend 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.370
 is the one that has recommended is the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.380
 restaurant not exactly there in the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.840
 Street near the corner of Tonala sheets 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.390
 local artisan mexican cuisine 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.770
 gourmet to be able to highlight this part 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.140
 of the flavors and that the real people 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.330
 I appreciate the flavor Roma colonia perfect 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.940
 We already have the two salads here 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.320
 you tell us we cut the tomato that 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.720
 you are taking the measure as 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.650
 like cheese, cheese, oaxaca and cheese 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.860
 fresh humus 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.049
 it's the part of the strange center but you're going 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.879
 to see the mango flavor with tomatoes 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.430
 actively you will see the taste that what 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.790
 Rich gives you that sweet part of the mango 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.540
 and the tomato the cheese that have another 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.430
 type of flavors 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.829
 the contrast to me I like to have a little 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.750
 of contrast in the flavors and this 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:47.109
 good side from half a 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.459
 avocado let's handle the avocado with 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.680
 greater speed because this one gets to 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.920
 oxidize if we do not put a few drops of 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.390
 lemon we make some cuts of the center without 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.340
 touch the outside part and only 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.970
 we plan osiel today in charge of catherine 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.829
 design and accommodate it and all this be the 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.480
 Saucer decoration is very 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.459
 important because surely for the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.109
 people that will accompany us the view 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.810
 will give you to pose for the restaurant 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:12.760
 but one in your house before you realize that 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.189
 just the cut that I made is the most 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.780
 simple mango cubes tried 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.459
 also to invite them that part where they do not 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.380
 say good is that who knows how he did 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.139
 this part of the cut and did not understand it 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.370
 there is an oil here that I have 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.070
 prepared, you can have it 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.240
 olive oil with fine herbs 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.340
 oregano laurel 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.349
 but that will give you a perfume and also 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.960
 will hydrate and will give that oil to 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:37.000
 the to the two salads for 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.880
 just accompany them just the 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.099
 let's mix this way 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.440
 touches and touches and cough nothing more torn 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.990
 who is watching in what way if 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.910
 I would like more more seasoning and this serves 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.400
 for snack and now this weekend 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.500
 that there may be football may have 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.330
 different events on TV or see one 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.400
 film even instead of 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.610
 Fatty popcorn is what it poses 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.990
 we are clear is 45 seconds then 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.690
 well I think about three minutes , the 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.130
 shapes the popcorn in the oven and this 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.620
 We've been three minutes and we're almost there 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.940
 finishing the dishes you know a 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.740
 little pepper than what the 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.250
 taste 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.900
 pepper the touch exactly and you 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.759
 would like a little salt each one to 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.789
 I love her like me too at the time 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:24.400
