00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.780
 welcome to this maya tutorial 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.470
 where we will see how to create the material 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.600
 dielectric material 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.450
 first we have to go to our hyper 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.700
 chain that is in windows rendering 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.550
 hyper shape editor 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.390
 not only in our hype in this 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.930
 part the metal rain the last option of 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.790
 below it's called legacy materials 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.890
 We have a list of materials and 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.870
 we will use the electric day 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.120
 material 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.070
 good this material 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.920
 in the previous versions of maya 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.160
 it worked different now you have to 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.430
 apply it in another way for example 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:59.130
 formerly the material was created 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:02.280
 and applied directly to the object 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.430
 but this time it's not like that anymore and it does not work 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.430
 correctly 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.840
 Now what you do what you do 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.000
 now 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.030
 is 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.850
 create the material as we created it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.970
 and then apply it 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.710
 and then go to the options forgive the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:29.130
 attributes of our object and look for the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.170
 electric material tab 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:37.869
 here we have the grow garden 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.890
 of our object and this is where 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.960
 we will apply our material 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.310
 as we apply it we have to 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.960
 drag it here for it 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.790
 we press the button in the center of the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.720
 mouse that is the wheel we keep 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.490
 pressed and dragged up surface 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.490
 material in our garden grow 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.799
 and now we have applied the material 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.990
 to our object and the attributes of 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.259
 our object has created another 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.720
 more tab with the attributes of the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.130
 material to be able to modify them to 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.580
 our taste 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.940
 this is a way to create this material 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.350
 of applying this material to the object 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.990
 if we do a render 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.990
 we will see that if a senate correctly 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.770
 very good as we see the material works 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.560
 very well and correctly 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.290
 now what would have happened if not 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.560
 We have done what we did in 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.930
 drag the material to this part 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.930
 well let's undo a little 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.590
 leave our object without the material 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.439
 and now if we had created the material 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.239
 we would have applied it as it was done 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:06.939
 formerly well and we render 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:10.930
 we will see that it is most likely that the 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:13.439
 pump does not appear even down here we 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.439
 gives an error 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.190
 as we see the cup does not appear so 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.820
 that's why we have to go to 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.890
 the attributes look for the electric tab 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.280
 material that has been applied that has 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.460
 created after applying material to 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.900
 our object 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:40.530
 and then go to surface material and 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.650
 drag our material to surface 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.800
 material and the material is applied in 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.050
 attributes of our object creates a 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.270
 second tab called dielectric 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.910
 material 1 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.300
 with the attributes to modify the 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.300
 material 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.090
 and that's it until the next tutorial
