00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
a great display piece of course some

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.770 
a great display piece of course some
people<00:03:03.130> have<00:03:03.430> complained<00:03:03.820> that<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.480> doesn't

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
people have complained that it doesn't

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.140 
people have complained that it doesn't
come<00:03:04.900> with<00:03:05.019> a<00:03:05.080> gun<00:03:05.310> which<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.850> know<00:03:06.970> I

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
come with a gun which you know I

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.699 
come with a gun which you know I
understand<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.260> would<00:03:08.380> have<00:03:08.470> been<00:03:08.590> great

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
understand and it would have been great

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.910 
understand and it would have been great
if<00:03:08.980> he<00:03:09.070> had<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.220> gun<00:03:09.430> but<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:10.900> mean<00:03:11.769> of<00:03:11.890> course

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
if he had a gun but I mean of course

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.370 
if he had a gun but I mean of course
that<00:03:12.250> would<00:03:12.340> raise<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.330> cost<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.750> lot<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.230> then

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
that would raise the cost a lot and then

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.100 
that would raise the cost a lot and then
also<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:14.860> think<00:03:14.950> is<00:03:15.910> that<00:03:16.000> they're<00:03:16.840> going<00:03:17.019> to

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
also I think is that they're going to

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.580 
also I think is that they're going to
try<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:18.269> market<00:03:19.269> this<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.450> lot<00:03:19.690> towards<00:03:19.930> little

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590

up<00:04:49.680> on<00:04:49.950> these<00:04:50.130> but<00:04:50.400> like<00:04:51.240> i<00:04:51.360> said<00:04:51.420> when<00:04:51.750> i

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
up on these but like i said when i

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.660 
up on these but like i said when i
pre-ordered<00:04:52.050> this<00:04:52.470> I<00:04:52.680> had<00:04:52.860> lots<00:04:53.160> of<00:04:53.340> reward

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
pre-ordered this I had lots of reward

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.790 
pre-ordered this I had lots of reward
points<00:04:53.940> so<00:04:54.300> I<00:04:54.590> was<00:04:55.590> unlucky<00:04:56.010> in<00:04:56.250> that<00:04:56.460> sense

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
points so I was unlucky in that sense

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.410 
points so I was unlucky in that sense
and<00:05:00.680> you<00:05:01.680> know<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:02.430> cost<00:05:02.670> in<00:05:02.880> these<00:05:03.030> I<00:05:03.210> think

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
and you know the cost in these I think

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.630 
and you know the cost in these I think
Toys<00:05:03.780> R<00:05:03.840> Us<00:05:04.020> sells<00:05:04.290> them<00:05:04.470> and<00:05:04.620> they<00:05:05.280> have<00:05:05.430> gone

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
Toys R Us sells them and they have gone

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.620 
Toys R Us sells them and they have gone
up<00:05:05.850> I<00:05:06.030> think<00:05:06.240> it's<00:05:06.360> like<00:05:06.650> 300<00:05:07.650> or<00:05:07.770> so<00:05:07.950> and<00:05:08.630> some

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
up I think it's like 300 or so and some

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.950 
up I think it's like 300 or so and some
places<00:05:09.840> I<00:05:10.050> had<00:05:10.620> been<00:05:11.180> if<00:05:12.180> you're<00:05:12.360> a<00:05:12.450> fan<00:05:12.720> of<00:05:12.750> the
