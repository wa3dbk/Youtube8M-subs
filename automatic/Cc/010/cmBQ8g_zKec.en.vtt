on<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.380> idea<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.440> actually<00:02:43.620> change

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
on this idea and you can actually change

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.300 
on this idea and you can actually change
how<00:02:46.970> m110<00:02:47.970> city<00:02:48.239> you<00:02:48.420> want<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.620> one<00:02:49.830> as<00:02:50.100> an

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
how m110 city you want so this one as an

how m110 city you want so this one as an
easy<00:02:50.489> one<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:51.000> one's<00:02:51.270> like<00:02:51.480> flat<00:02:51.840> road<00:02:52.080> this

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
easy one this one's like flat road this

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.060 
easy one this one's like flat road this
one<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.580> slightly<00:02:54.000> harder<00:02:54.540> than<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> road<00:02:55.070> m

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
one is slightly harder than the road m

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.130 
one is slightly harder than the road m
is<00:02:56.340> called<00:02:56.520> em<00:02:56.700> table<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.209> NS<00:02:57.840> ones<00:02:58.049> the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
is called em table and NS ones the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.310 
is called em table and NS ones the
hardest<00:02:58.530> which<00:02:58.970> should<00:02:59.970> replicate<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.750> house

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
hardest which should replicate a house

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.970 
hardest which should replicate a house
and<00:03:01.590> stuff<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:03.630> do<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.989> just<00:03:04.140> tell

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
and stuff and to do that you just tell

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.920 
and stuff and to do that you just tell
mess<00:03:05.160> back<00:03:05.340> here<00:03:05.480> basically<00:03:06.480> in<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.630> clicks

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
mess back here basically in it clicks

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.810 
mess back here basically in it clicks

click it and two different possessions

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.699 
click it and two different possessions
and<00:03:35.820> there<00:03:36.780> are<00:03:36.900> different<00:03:37.170> positions<00:03:37.560> and

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
and there are different positions and

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.160 
and there are different positions and
stuff<00:03:37.860> anyway<00:03:38.700> that's<00:03:38.910> one<00:03:39.060> works<00:03:39.299> em<00:03:39.570> it's<00:03:39.930> a

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
stuff anyway that's one works em it's a

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.280 
stuff anyway that's one works em it's a
bug<00:03:40.350> magnets<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.489> side<00:03:41.850> here<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.180> it's<00:03:42.989> that

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
bug magnets and side here and it's that

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.170 
bug magnets and side here and it's that
attach<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.799> spring<00:03:44.040> so<00:03:44.370> when<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:44.730> change<00:03:45.030> the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
attach the spring so when you change the

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.020 
attach the spring so when you change the
intensity<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:46.380> gets<00:03:46.709> hard<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.100> obviously<00:03:47.370> so

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
intensity it gets hard that obviously so

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.630 
intensity it gets hard that obviously so
