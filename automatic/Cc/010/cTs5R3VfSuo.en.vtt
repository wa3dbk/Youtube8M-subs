00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
it's running Windows 8 with Metro so I'm

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.400 
it's running Windows 8 with Metro so I'm
not<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.829> focus<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.160> much<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.700> but

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
not going to focus that much on it but

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.490 
not going to focus that much on it but
it<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.559> actually<00:00:40.710> quite<00:00:41.040> cool<00:00:41.660> ok<00:00:42.660> seems<00:00:43.260> like

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
it is actually quite cool ok seems like

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.910 
it is actually quite cool ok seems like
nothing<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.250> happening<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.739> should

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
nothing is happening here so it should

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.810 
nothing is happening here so it should
be<00:00:47.039> quite<00:00:47.190> snappy<00:00:47.489> actually<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:49.730> on<00:00:50.730> this

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
be quite snappy actually on this on this

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.670 
be quite snappy actually on this on this
particular<00:00:53.449> on<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.510> particular<00:00:55.110> hardware

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
particular on this particular hardware

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.380 
particular on this particular hardware
but<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.100> don't<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.579> should<00:00:56.760> see<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
but I don't we should see so this is a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.569 
but I don't we should see so this is a
10-point<00:00:57.840> multi-touch<00:00:58.320> screen<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.370> said

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
10-point multi-touch screen like I said

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.510 
10-point multi-touch screen like I said
the<00:00:59.789> 11.6<00:01:00.449> inch<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:01.079> diagonal<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.219> Full<00:01:02.489> HD

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the 11.6 inch in diagonal and Full HD

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.969 
the 11.6 inch in diagonal and Full HD
resolution<00:01:02.870> now<00:01:03.870> overall<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> device<00:01:04.619> feels

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
resolution now overall the device feels

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.140 
resolution now overall the device feels
alright<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:05.880> really<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:08.150> that

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
alright it's not really that that that

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.910 
alright it's not really that that that
light<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.689> can't<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.049> say<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.320> sure<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.710> i

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
light I can't really say for sure but i

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.399 
light I can't really say for sure but i
think<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.430> about<00:01:11.490> 800<00:01:12.299> grams<00:01:12.540> that's<00:01:13.229> how

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
think it's about 800 grams that's how

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.560 
think it's about 800 grams that's how
how<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.340> feels<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.760> me<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.509> about

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
how have it feels to me and it's about

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.240 
how have it feels to me and it's about
12<00:01:15.960> millimeters<00:01:16.439> same<00:01:16.619> thickness<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.130> can

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
12 millimeters same thickness you can

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.190 
12 millimeters same thickness you can
see<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.610> has<00:01:17.640> straight<00:01:18.240> edges<00:01:18.630> slightly

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
see that it has straight edges slightly

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.929 
see that it has straight edges slightly
rounder<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.979> around<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.460> towards<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> bottom

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
rounder to around it towards the bottom

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.640 
rounder to around it towards the bottom
so<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.299> will<00:01:21.540> be<00:01:21.570> able<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:22.080> call<00:01:22.320> them

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
so you will be able to call them

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.649 
so you will be able to call them
comfortably<00:01:23.159> although<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.970> sharp<00:01:24.390> edges

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
comfortably although this sharp edges

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.540 
comfortably although this sharp edges
there<00:01:24.990> might<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.320> little<00:01:25.530> bit<00:01:25.740> annoying

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
there might be a little bit annoying

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.580 
there might be a little bit annoying
I<00:01:26.610> don't<00:01:27.030> know<00:01:27.090> okay<00:01:27.660> so<00:01:27.720> let's<00:01:28.260> have<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.410> quick

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
I don't know okay so let's have a quick

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.100 
I don't know okay so let's have a quick
look<00:01:28.620> on<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> bottom<00:01:30.270> as<00:01:30.420> well<00:01:30.480> you

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
look on the on the bottom as well you

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.750 
look on the on the bottom as well you
have<00:01:31.230> a<00:01:31.260> plastic<00:01:31.560> strip<00:01:32.010> here<00:01:32.220> covering<00:01:32.580> the

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
have a plastic strip here covering the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.520 
have a plastic strip here covering the
wireless<00:01:33.090> antennas<00:01:33.510> and<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.930> natural

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
wireless antennas and you have natural

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.290 
wireless antennas and you have natural
here<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.100> feels<00:01:35.280> solid<00:01:35.700> definitely<00:01:36.120> feels

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
here so it feels solid definitely feels

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.450 
here so it feels solid definitely feels
solid<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:37.170> good<00:01:37.410> have<00:01:37.980> a<00:01:38.010> 5<00:01:38.310> megapixel

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
solid it's good have a 5 megapixel

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.850 
solid it's good have a 5 megapixel
camera<00:01:39.120> on<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.300> back<00:01:39.390> no<00:01:39.840> flash<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.410> there's

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
camera on the back no flash and there's

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.400 
camera on the back no flash and there's
a<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.190> believe<00:01:41.550> it<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.760> 1.3<00:01:42.510> megapixel<00:01:43.080> camera

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
a I believe it to 1.3 megapixel camera

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.140 
a I believe it to 1.3 megapixel camera
on<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.650> front<00:01:43.920> for<00:01:44.310> video<00:01:44.490> calls<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.060> stuff

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
on the front for video calls and stuff

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.200 
on the front for video calls and stuff
like<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.900> have<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.050> windows<00:01:46.760> button<00:01:47.760> here

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
like this we have a windows button here
