looks and the cover flap is stitched
across<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.930> foot<00:00:59.140> so<00:00:59.620> if<00:00:59.680> you<00:00:59.769> set<00:00:59.979> the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
across the foot so if you set the

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.979 
across the foot so if you set the
buckles<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:00.610> a<00:01:00.640> looser<00:01:01.000> setting<00:01:01.449> there's<00:01:01.930> a

buckles to a looser setting there's a

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.810

gap created between the cover flap and
the<00:01:04.210> upper<00:01:04.600> so<00:01:04.839> these<00:01:04.960> buckles<00:01:05.320> are<00:01:05.500> obviously

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
the upper so these buckles are obviously

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.010

not an adjustment feature this is

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.120 
not an adjustment feature this is
definitely<00:01:08.229> not<00:01:08.409> a<00:01:08.470> deal<00:01:08.680> breaker<00:01:08.710> though

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130
