still<00:03:01.680> get<00:03:01.830> fairly<00:03:02.040> good<00:03:02.220> idea<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.670> events

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
still get fairly good idea of the events

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.150 
still get fairly good idea of the events
that<00:03:03.120> will<00:03:03.210> unfold<00:03:03.360> during<00:03:04.020> this<00:03:04.290> movie<00:03:04.500> which

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
that will unfold during this movie which

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.950 
that will unfold during this movie which
I<00:03:05.280> guess<00:03:05.460> makes<00:03:05.490> this<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.030> successful<00:03:06.630> trailer

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
with the dev scenes now when I first

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.260

reboot<00:04:41.690> I<00:04:41.870> was<00:04:42.230> just<00:04:42.470> expecting<00:04:42.800> to<00:04:43.100> see

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
reboot I was just expecting to see

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.640 
reboot I was just expecting to see
another<00:04:43.460> tied<00:04:43.820> remake<00:04:44.240> so<00:04:44.690> I<00:04:44.960> pretty<00:04:45.530> much

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
another tied remake so I pretty much

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.560 
another tied remake so I pretty much
ignored<00:04:46.040> everything<00:04:46.280> about<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.790> turns<00:04:47.390> out

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
ignored everything about it turns out

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.660 
ignored everything about it turns out
that<00:04:47.870> was<00:04:48.230> a<00:04:48.290> mistake<00:04:48.440> as<00:04:48.980> this<00:04:49.190> looks<00:04:49.490> like

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
that was a mistake as this looks like

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.070 
that was a mistake as this looks like
it's<00:04:49.850> going<00:04:49.940> to<00:04:50.030> go<00:04:50.090> back<00:04:50.300> to<00:04:50.450> how<00:04:50.540> Chuckie<00:04:50.930> was
