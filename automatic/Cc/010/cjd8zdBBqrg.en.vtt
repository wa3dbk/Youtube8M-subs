 good evening good evening mich then 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.620
 tell us during this festival however 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.750
 which is at least original 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.930
 what was your short film 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.119
 favorite I've had several who have 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.430
 been my favorite one who had big 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.140
 price called my quarter hour and 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.210
 repeat and repeat 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.410
 among those who are there actually and there 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.989
 had two more that was doing 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.430
 a lot of laughs but who do not have 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.320
 convinced of price and why these two 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.010
 short films have marked your 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.510
 attention because they surprised me my 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.510
 quarter of an hour that surprised me because 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.079
 I found them very damn well and who 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.769
 used the words of the festival of 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:55.280
 mobile movie to make like a dream of 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.420
 kids or two young men and who who 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.859
 overrated every time on every 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.870
 possible pitfalls of miserabilism and and 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.730
 that finally who are drawn super well 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.840
 what I thought was great and repeated 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.740
 and repeat because I think it's a 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.440
 great game thing it's the same 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.880

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.610
 pleasure yes that is to say that I find 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.500
 great with a small medium like 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.570

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.400

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.600
