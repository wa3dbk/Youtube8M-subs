something<00:00:21.090> that's<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:21.900> close<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.860> need<00:00:23.010> to

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
something that's so close you need to

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.279 
something that's so close you need to
test<00:00:23.520> it<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.030> timings<00:00:24.510> are<00:00:24.630> subtle<00:00:25.080> and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
test it and the timings are subtle and

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.640 
test it and the timings are subtle and
that's<00:00:25.770> what<00:00:25.980> really<00:00:26.010> hard<00:00:26.730> stuff<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.270> if

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
that that that would not be a strategy

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.420 
that that that would not be a strategy
game<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.560> would<00:00:40.739> be<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> guess<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.370> check

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
game that would be a guess and check

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.729 
game that would be a guess and check
game<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.060> know<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.329> would<00:00:42.600> not<00:00:42.810> be<00:00:42.840> fun<00:00:43.440> at

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
game you know that would not be fun at

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.340 
game you know that would not be fun at
all<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.910> lot<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.270> these<00:00:45.450> things<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
all so a lot of these things and the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.639 
all so a lot of these things and the
greater<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.670> more<00:00:48.140> depth<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
greater it is the the more depth of the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.319 
greater it is the the more depth of the
strategy<00:00:50.160> there<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.820> these<00:00:50.910> things<00:00:51.210> you

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
strategy there is so these things you

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.030

feel<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> army<00:00:54.750> might<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> little<00:00:55.260> bit

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
feel like the army might be a little bit

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.370 
feel like the army might be a little bit
small<00:00:55.950> but<00:00:56.300> storm<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.480> feedback<00:00:57.780> are<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.200> so

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
small but storm and feedback are just so

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.490 
small but storm and feedback are just so
damn<00:00:58.410> good<00:00:59.000> but<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> lot<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.570> gas<00:01:01.230> to

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
damn good but that is a lot of gas to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.889 
damn good but that is a lot of gas to
spend<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.010> storm<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:03.270> well<00:01:03.570> as<00:01:03.750> the
