00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.730
 Solis was right in one thing 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.730
 we define the desire to overcome our limitations 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:11.549
 is innate 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.129
 we were cold and we discovered the fire 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.949
 we were real estate and we created tools 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.380
 Whenever we encounter any obstacle we use creativity and 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.079
 ingenuity to overcome it 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.810
 it is a cycle and inevitable 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.810
 but it is always positive 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.280
 I guess that depends on the point of view 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.080
 in recent months they face many challenges 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.780
 but often 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.660
 I have tried to take into account 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.660
 that my actions did not have to harm others 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.340
 the weathered 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.850
 temptation to use the power 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.850
 speeches 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.530
 since the beginning of this month 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.600
 - looking for quick solutions transitions among others 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.040
 and if we do not have to feel happy 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.480
 we have plans 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.420
 and if the way of the English allows us to approach values â€‹â€‹more 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.710
 raised as a wholesaler 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.400
 at least so far 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.850
 for the first time in history 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.850
 we had a week of progress in the very good things 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.850
 that resigns at that height stop pursuing a future in which the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.150
 technology 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.560
 thanks to the uniqueness 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.560
 would be tantamount to denying the essence of who we are 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.510
 He said it will be a difficult road 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.410
 and many people suffered 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.410
 but it's not worth making that sacrifice 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.550
 we can turn them into the gods we always wanted in January 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.570
 and we better do it better 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:25.039
 stop worrying morgan everything has a solution while there is time I have to 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:26.419
 leave it has already arrived 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:30.219
 We are still exploring the remains, maybe there is something that will help us 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.239
 initiative flourish forward 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.900
 Doctor Ruiz, we are glad that she has decided to collaborate what else 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.719
 I do not complain quality as it is nothing said desire before entering the 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.719
 the minotaur's labyrinth always forward without witnesses 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.340
 our project that can be very interesting your audience 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.709
 according to Iranian television press tv 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.139
 it is difficult to follow that sense more pointedly 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.959
 hilton in the 90s 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.209
