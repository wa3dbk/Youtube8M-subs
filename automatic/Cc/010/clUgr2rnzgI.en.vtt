lightweight as well the Sun is very

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.310 
lightweight as well the Sun is very
subtle<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.400> not<00:01:38.610> an<00:01:38.759> overpowering<00:01:39.479> scent<00:01:40.020> so

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
subtle it's not an overpowering scent so

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.319 
subtle it's not an overpowering scent so
if<00:01:40.500> you're<00:01:40.650> looking<00:01:40.770> for<00:01:41.159> something<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:42.150> wear

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
if you're looking for something to wear

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.420 
if you're looking for something to wear
after<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.960> work<00:01:43.110> out<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.470> gym<00:01:43.500> or<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.250> need

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
after you work out in a gym or you need

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.160 
after you work out in a gym or you need
something<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.820> cover<00:01:45.030> up<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.600> probably

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
something to cover up this is probably

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.330 
something to cover up this is probably
not<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.590> stick<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.399> you

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
not the stick for you

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.279 
not the stick for you
I<00:01:48.399> think<00:01:49.090> it's<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.299> very<00:01:49.509> nice<00:01:49.750> lightweight

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
I think it's a very nice lightweight

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.289 
I think it's a very nice lightweight
scent<00:01:50.859> that<00:01:51.009> you<00:01:51.100> can<00:01:51.280> wear<00:01:51.490> after<00:01:51.939> a<00:01:51.969> shower

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
scent that you can wear after a shower

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.639 
scent that you can wear after a shower
before<00:01:52.719> you're<00:01:52.990> going<00:01:53.109> to<00:01:53.170> go<00:01:53.289> ahead<00:01:53.350> out

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
before you're going to go ahead out

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.950 
before you're going to go ahead out
somewhere<00:01:54.130> it's<00:01:54.429> very<00:01:55.030> very<00:01:55.240> subtle<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.810> all

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
somewhere it's very very subtle and all

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.230 
somewhere it's very very subtle and all
the<00:01:56.109> sons<00:01:56.380> are<00:01:56.530> not<00:01:57.060> overpowering<00:01:58.060> they're

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
the sons are not overpowering they're

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.260 
the sons are not overpowering they're
very<00:01:58.450> very<00:01:58.569> simple<00:01:59.200> refreshing<00:01:59.859> sense<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
very very simple refreshing sense the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.270 
very very simple refreshing sense the
only<00:02:01.479> scent<00:02:01.750> that<00:02:01.929> I<00:02:01.990> can<00:02:02.229> truly<00:02:02.409> identify<00:02:03.009> is

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
only scent that I can truly identify is

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.550 
only scent that I can truly identify is
the<00:02:03.310> middle<00:02:04.210> yellow<00:02:04.600> one<00:02:04.929> actually<00:02:05.409> has<00:02:05.530> a

the middle yellow one actually has a

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.130 
the middle yellow one actually has a
baby<00:02:05.890> powder<00:02:06.219> smell<00:02:06.579> and<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.630> all<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.990> other

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
baby powder smell and the all the other

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.680 
baby powder smell and the all the other
colors<00:02:08.649> have<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:09.160> very<00:02:09.580> subtle<00:02:09.910> floral<00:02:10.299> scent

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
colors have a very subtle floral scent

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.809 
colors have a very subtle floral scent
to<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:10.929> my<00:02:11.379> favorite<00:02:11.769> is<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.129> pink<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.580> green

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
to it my favorite is a pink and green

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.550 
to it my favorite is a pink and green
one<00:02:13.060> there<00:02:13.540> really<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:13.900> no<00:02:14.049> way<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.230> describe

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
one there really is no way to describe

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.710 
one there really is no way to describe
it<00:02:14.830> other<00:02:14.950> than<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.250> very<00:02:15.519> light<00:02:15.879> mix<00:02:16.239> floral

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
it other than a very light mix floral

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.500 
it other than a very light mix floral
scent<00:02:17.019> I<00:02:17.319> would<00:02:18.250> say<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.580> overall<00:02:19.239> best

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
scent I would say the overall best

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.360 
scent I would say the overall best
quality<00:02:20.019> of<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.200> product<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.769> packaging

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
quality of the product is the packaging

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.130 
quality of the product is the packaging
if<00:02:21.579> it<00:02:21.760> wasn't<00:02:22.180> for<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.390> packaging<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.049> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
if it wasn't for the packaging and the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.720 
if it wasn't for the packaging and the
cute<00:02:23.410> little<00:02:23.590> bunnies<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.099> probably<00:02:24.370> wouldn't

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
cute little bunnies I probably wouldn't

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.400 
cute little bunnies I probably wouldn't

about this product in the first place

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.220 
about this product in the first place
but<00:02:27.130> it's<00:02:27.370> still<00:02:27.610> overall<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.569> pretty<00:02:28.930> okay

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
but it's still overall is pretty okay

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.020
