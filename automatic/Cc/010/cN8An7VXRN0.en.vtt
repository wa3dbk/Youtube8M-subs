00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
it's expired or if you can keep it a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.630 
it's expired or if you can keep it a
little<00:00:24.480> bit<00:00:24.660> longer<00:00:25.039> first<00:00:26.039> sign<00:00:26.369> is

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
little bit longer first sign is

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.939 
little bit longer first sign is
obviously<00:00:27.119> check<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.630> expiration<00:00:28.350> date<00:00:28.650> if

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
obviously check the expiration date if

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.529 
obviously check the expiration date if
there's<00:00:29.160> no<00:00:29.400> expiration<00:00:29.850> date<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.300> the
