today<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.289> I've<00:00:16.710> provided<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.279> link<00:00:17.310> below<00:00:17.699> to

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
today and I've provided a link below to

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.000 
today and I've provided a link below to
a<00:00:18.119> sample<00:00:18.630> we're<00:00:18.750> gonna<00:00:18.840> go<00:00:19.050> over<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.230> page<00:00:19.380> 24

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
a sample we're gonna go over a page 24

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.160 
a sample we're gonna go over a page 24
and<00:00:20.340> before<00:00:21.030> we<00:00:21.150> get<00:00:21.240> started<00:00:21.450> this<00:00:21.750> book<00:00:21.930> has

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
and before we get started this book has

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.950 
and before we get started this book has
over<00:00:22.470> 300<00:00:23.010> drum<00:00:23.250> fills<00:00:23.520> and<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.480> organized

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
over 300 drum fills and it's organized

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.779 
over 300 drum fills and it's organized
sequentially<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.100> starts<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.490> more

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
sequentially so it starts with more

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.300 
sequentially so it starts with more
basic<00:00:27.210> concepts<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.080> then<00:00:28.619> builds<00:00:29.070> on<00:00:29.190> those

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
basic concepts and then builds on those

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.710 
basic concepts and then builds on those
concepts<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.090> when<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.300> go<00:00:30.390> through<00:00:30.420> this

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
concepts so when you go through this

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.330 
concepts so when you go through this
book<00:00:30.990> you're<00:00:31.350> not<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.710> playing<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.039> bunch<00:00:32.189> of

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
book you're not just playing a bunch of

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.950 
book you're not just playing a bunch of
random<00:00:32.609> drum<00:00:33.059> fills<00:00:33.329> you're<00:00:33.600> actually

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
random drum fills you're actually

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.900 
random drum fills you're actually
starting<00:00:34.140> at<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.770> beginning<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.460> working

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
starting at the beginning and working

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.819 
starting at the beginning and working
your<00:00:36.030> way<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.210> more<00:00:36.510> advanced<00:00:36.989> also<00:00:37.530> Don

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
your way to more advanced also Don

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
organized this book into topics so

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.229 
organized this book into topics so
you're<00:00:41.010> not<00:00:41.069> just<00:00:41.339> going<00:00:41.729> beginning<00:00:42.120> to

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
you're not just going beginning to

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.270 
you're not just going beginning to
advance<00:00:42.569> you're<00:00:42.809> also<00:00:42.960> learning<00:00:43.319> how<00:00:43.859> to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
advance you're also learning how to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.099 
advance you're also learning how to
apply<00:00:44.879> these<00:00:44.940> techniques<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.780> learning<00:00:46.019> what

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
apply these techniques and learning what

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:47.660 
apply these techniques and learning what
these<00:00:46.260> techniques<00:00:46.679> are<00:00:46.859> called<00:00:47.069> and<00:00:47.460> how

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
these techniques are called and how

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.520 
these techniques are called and how
they're<00:00:47.819> used<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.389> I've<00:00:48.659> used<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.170> already

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
they're used and I've used this already

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.919 
they're used and I've used this already
with<00:00:49.769> a<00:00:49.799> few<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.069> my<00:00:50.100> students<00:00:50.639> and<00:00:50.789> they've

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929 
with a few of my students and they've

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.910 
with a few of my students and they've
noted<00:00:51.929> that<00:00:52.019> it's<00:00:52.170> driving<00:00:52.379> along<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.769> car

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
noted that it's driving along in the car

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.259 
noted that it's driving along in the car
listening<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.249> songs<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.819> they're<00:00:53.940> able<00:00:54.210> to

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
listening to songs and they're able to

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.180 
listening to songs and they're able to
identify<00:00:54.870> these<00:00:54.929> drum<00:00:55.379> fill<00:00:55.589> techniques<00:00:56.010> that

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
identify these drum fill techniques that

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.039 
identify these drum fill techniques that
are<00:00:56.219> used<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:57.179> check<00:00:57.359> out<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> preview<00:00:57.929> of

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.049 
are used so check out the preview of

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:00.709 
are used so check out the preview of
page<00:00:58.229> 24<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.489> I'll<00:00:59.609> start<00:00:59.879> by<00:00:59.969> playing<00:01:00.479> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
page 24 so I'll start by playing the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.449 
page 24 so I'll start by playing the
first<00:01:00.959> fill<00:01:01.530> which<00:01:01.769> is<00:01:01.889> the<00:01:02.010> fill<00:01:02.190> into<00:01:02.339> the

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:02.459 
first fill which is the fill into the

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:16.550 
first fill which is the fill into the
chorus<00:01:02.850> 1<00:01:03.179> &amp;<00:01:03.389> 2<00:01:03.569> it's<00:01:03.749> used<00:01:03.899> twice<00:01:15.560> you'll

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
chorus 1 &amp; 2 it's used twice you'll

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.740 
chorus 1 &amp; 2 it's used twice you'll
notice<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:16.980> Don<00:01:17.360> provides<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.480> a<00:01:18.510> little

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
notice that Don provides you a little

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.480 
notice that Don provides you a little
bit<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.930> context<00:01:19.500> for<00:01:19.650> each<00:01:19.710> fill<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.400> not

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
bit of context for each fill so it's not

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.310 
bit of context for each fill so it's not
just<00:01:20.760> isolating<00:01:21.480> the<00:01:21.570> fill<00:01:21.750> by<00:01:21.930> itself

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
just isolating the fill by itself

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.410 
just isolating the fill by itself
because<00:01:23.190> it's<00:01:23.340> cool<00:01:23.760> to<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:23.970> able<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.180> just

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
because it's cool to be able to just

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.960 
because it's cool to be able to just
play<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> fill<00:01:24.960> but<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.620> also<00:01:25.800> know<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.670> beats

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
play the fill but to also know the beats

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.210 
play the fill but to also know the beats
and<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> context<00:01:27.990> around<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.710> fill<00:01:28.950> is

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and the context around the fill is

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.650 
and the context around the fill is
really<00:01:29.610> helpful<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.120> learning<00:01:30.270> how<00:01:30.480> to

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
really helpful in learning how to

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.750 
really helpful in learning how to
appropriately<00:01:31.350> place<00:01:32.010> fills<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:32.580> choose

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
appropriately place fills or choose

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.820 
appropriately place fills or choose
fills<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.720> next<00:01:33.990> fill<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.230> the<00:01:34.320> sample<00:01:34.650> page

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
fills the next fill on the sample page

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.980 
fills the next fill on the sample page
is<00:01:35.010> the<00:01:35.130> breakdown<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.450> cool<00:01:36.690> I'll<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:36.900> it

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
is the breakdown this is cool I'll do it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.710 
is the breakdown this is cool I'll do it
slowly<00:01:37.260> at<00:01:37.620> first<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.760> repeats<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.570> we

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
slowly at first and that repeats is we

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.540 
slowly at first and that repeats is we
got<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> repeat<00:01:43.200> sign<00:01:43.440> and<00:01:43.710> at<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.370> end

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
got the repeat sign and at the end

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.770 
got the repeat sign and at the end
there's<00:01:44.760> a<00:01:44.850> buzz<00:01:45.060> roll<00:01:47.150> I'll<00:01:48.150> play<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.570> for

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
there's a buzz roll I'll play that for

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.760 
there's a buzz roll I'll play that for
you

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.230 

so<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:55.890> careful<00:01:56.070> there<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.670> three<00:01:56.939> and

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
so be careful there with that three and

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.910 
so be careful there with that three and
uh<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> for<00:01:57.990> Enda<00:01:58.229> you've<00:01:58.409> got<00:01:58.530> some<00:01:58.680> left

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
uh and the for Enda you've got some left
