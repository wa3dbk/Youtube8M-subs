Hello, dear iPhonedo viewers!

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.920
Today, I'm here to review, Hybrid crystal film set!

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.180

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.720
You may wonder what's so special about this Hybrid crystal film set.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.020
This film is actually a combination of tempered glass and resin. Which makes it flexible and bendable.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.580
And it is scratch resistant. Yes. But, how much resistant?

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.020
9H! Look. I know you're asking, what is 9H. 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.320
Let me explain how resistant 9H is.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.880
9H is of course much better than 8H... which of course is a lot better than 7H.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.060
Also the thickness of this film is 0.25mm

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:02.100
The film set I love to use, the antiglare one, has a grain effect and you can see it while looking at the white area on your screen

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.920
But this Hybrid crystal has no effect on the screen. So if you can see your retina display as if there is no film applied.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.560
Also it is anti fingerprint!

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:23.480
Let's look at the box. Here it shows iPhone 5s, iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.500
And here they mention the GB for those who has no idea about iPhones.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.800
And on the back there are explanations and that's pretty much it.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.180
It says pull this to open it but I'm gonna open it like this. Just because I want to.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.500
It comes in a foam protector.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.240
Opens like a window. This is the microfiber cloth that comes with all Power Support films. Very helpful!

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.220
Let's take this off gently and open it up.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:05.100
They advise you to use this piece to remove your film from your device. Because tapes don't stick on the surface of this film.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.080
This sticker is to remove dust on your device. Right before you apply the film stick this on your device and wax off the dust.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.120
Now let's take a look at the film. It is really thin. 0.25mm!

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.880
Quite flexible!

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.980
Now let's apply this to our device and see what it is like!

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.540
I have the AntiGlare installed on my phone right now.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.080
I like the antiglare a lot. I'm going to remove it now.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.160
Actually let's use that thing to remove the film. And it looks like this and I guess this is how it is used.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.900
Let's clean it up.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.060
Microfiber wipes the dust away very successfully. 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.580
You may find a lot of different techniques to apply the film on your phone but my favorite is to bend the top off.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.000
Let me align nicely

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.940
I think it is perfectly aligned.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.920
You can see, it has no effect on the display, no grain at all. totally invisible.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:47.240
On some other review videos they say the film gets damaged at the points where you put the removing piece in.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.800
Actually that's not permanent damage, you can fix that by applying reasonably pressure with your nail. and it is gone!

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.680
Yes, friends we're at the end of another episode.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:30.660
What do you think about the Hybrid crystal film set? Would you like to use it? Do you use similar products? What do you use?

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:38.960
I've been an AntiGlare guy since the beginning. I don't like glare. Don't you shine on me crazy diamond, I punch you!

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.900
Joking aside, I'm really impressed by Hybrid crystal film set.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.620

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.280
By the way, congratulations to Turkish Government for removing the ban on YouTube. (Sarcastic clap)

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.660

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.940

I know why you're here!

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.860
You have a lot of questions about the release date for Q&amp;A3. I know.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.240
I'm going to give the exact date for the release

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.220
The release date of Q&amp;A3 is... Look! Look! Let me tell you something!

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.220
Why are you making that face! I know you're making a face at me!

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.740
Yes you!

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.060
I saw what you did! Look!

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.740
