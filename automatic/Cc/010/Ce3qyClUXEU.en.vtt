stuck here this is to alter the triggers
the<00:01:52.890> trigger<00:01:53.130> stops<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:54.210> that's<00:01:54.390> nice<00:01:54.630> and

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
the trigger stops so that's nice and

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.899 
the trigger stops so that's nice and
securely<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.829> there<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.280> you'll<00:01:56.399> see<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.640> as

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
securely in there and you'll see that as

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.330 
securely in there and you'll see that as
soon<00:01:57.030> as<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.270> open<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> box<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.310> onto<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
soon as you open the box and onto the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.440 
soon as you open the box and onto the
controller<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:01.350> get<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.729> actual<00:02:02.729> your<00:02:03.090> speed

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
controller you get the actual your speed

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.289 
controller you get the actual your speed
to<00:02:03.719> controller<00:02:04.680> connector<00:02:05.299> already

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
to controller connector already

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.389 
to controller connector already
unplugged<00:02:06.600> from<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.960> controller<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.799> then

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
unplugged from the controller and then

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.430 
unplugged from the controller and then
obviously<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.209> only<00:02:09.479> thing<00:02:09.690> left<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> box

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
obviously the only thing left in the box

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.410 
obviously the only thing left in the box
after<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.430> actual<00:02:11.700> controller<00:02:12.090> I

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
after that is the actual controller I

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.830 
after that is the actual controller I
mean<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.470> you've<00:02:13.650> got

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
mean so you've got

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.140 
mean so you've got
the<00:02:13.930> M<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.590> got<00:02:14.709> your<00:02:14.980> controller<00:02:15.849> wire

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
the M you got your controller wire

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.479 
the M you got your controller wire
obviously<00:02:16.900> existed<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.410> wide<00:02:17.620> control<00:02:18.099> exact

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
obviously existed a wide control exact

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.740
