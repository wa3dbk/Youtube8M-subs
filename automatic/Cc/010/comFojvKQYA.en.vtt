00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:05.029
 world continuity because let's assume that the dream of a study now 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:10.209
 think that you created proex 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.740
 then those varying minima only using an image of the movie that will do 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:16.720
 finally in the world 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.510
 I researched a ps image but what did you say, young man, alvalade too 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.599
 bet on a story so brotherly that www 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.199
 so bet I'll put a name 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.679
 I saved 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.170
 let's go then to the druid 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.250
 stopped in the middle of the year for you would be an image you'll get what I am then 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.770
 It's there smaller image Inter has more people srs 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.140
 he goes to get 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 that one automatically kicking a kick in the chin 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.310
 there within my position if you do not have the seal looking for discount or year 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.950
 next 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.530
 www agenda 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.570
 the course 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.230
 so can course images is also 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.350
 win in image that cap 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.570
 selected and two clicks 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.130
 the show fly back here to my page I'm building for no 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.030
 update 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.420
 seven times champion in May by default personal oo milan already defined 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.290
 as the border of your image here to one side 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.030
 left in our view looking at monitors now if we come back here to 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.260
 people can also align this image here to the right side so what 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.730
 you do within the mg sc then the image after the quotation mark you will put 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.800
 so bad 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.330
 mayte 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.560
 which leads then 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.560
 align the right side for you 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.350
 and if I want to line up here to stop downtown I shoot 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.960
 and if I think it's here, let's say I want the line too, my 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.070
 title so I can not use an html final which is simple if you come here 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.720
 O 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.720
 ever 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.130
 and below here we put 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.700
 then I opened a html carving 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.349
 and what I want centralized in 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.769
 inside of all this task what you bring here the design course 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.090
 centered my image of the doll then after that I went to dinner 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.559
 one hundred percent then I had it in here 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:21.939
 your carton 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.939
 Let's save control here. 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:30.139
 centralized tequila in our image this he mentions weeks to be more 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.009
 so very big is done inside the duo mg sc team 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:35.340
 after the blade 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.069
 here you will see that no one says 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.639
 you can set 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.709
 that this one wrong here she is dumb in the case that put the sport 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.359
 I speak here to guglielmo automatically the fallacious and more than 300 pixels 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.099
 the height 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.189
 Author had 390 so I'll leave here 190 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.299
 then it is width that 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:06.839
 fiction would be a fixed height of 6 90 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.889
 Let's save 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.889
 and we will authorize by postage 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.989
 resize and that is my image as the staff the museums to this noise 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.739
 and I believe that you can therefore running here with what is the colorados that you 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.689
 wanting adding house I left it in a width of 100 claude miller 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.689
 that a little more our income in heights 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:35.069
 so there were only 5 he's going to change the ratio you wish they find 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.810
 better than here 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.810
 let's use all your personal resizing 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.409
 So what did we learn in saviola? 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:48.299
 centering there are images that we saw alignment to adjust the image so bad 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.309
 and the rest for you to adjust with size and on your site 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.869
 finally insert the image 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:59.189
 on your site 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:01.620
 I'm better or staying here a big hug
