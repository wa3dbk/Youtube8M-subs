00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
an D but it's th so I might just be

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.699 
an D but it's th so I might just be
really<00:03:11.000> dumb<00:03:11.120> but<00:03:11.359> it's<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:12.019> really<00:03:12.320> pretty

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
really dumb but it's a really pretty

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.030 
really dumb but it's a really pretty
orange<00:03:13.519> and<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:14.060> kind<00:03:14.329> of<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:15.010> peachy<00:03:16.010> orange

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
orange and it's kind of a peachy orange

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.729 
orange and it's kind of a peachy orange
I<00:03:16.670> have<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:17.150> orange<00:03:17.750> color<00:03:17.959> but<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.200> never<00:03:18.440> really

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
I have a orange color but I never really

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.710 
I have a orange color but I never really
wear<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.070> because<00:03:19.190> orange<00:03:20.060> just<00:03:20.329> isn't<00:03:20.570> really

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
wear it because orange just isn't really

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.080 
wear it because orange just isn't really
my<00:03:20.750> color<00:03:21.109> but<00:03:21.739> with<00:03:22.190> this<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.579> looks<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.060> good

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
my color but with this it looks so good

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.090 
my color but with this it looks so good
because<00:03:23.510> it's<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.930> bit<00:03:24.290> more<00:03:24.440> peachy<00:03:24.829> and<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:24.980> bit

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
because it's a bit more peachy and a bit

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.309 
because it's a bit more peachy and a bit
more<00:03:25.220> pink<00:03:25.549> so<00:03:25.940> it's<00:03:26.329> not<00:03:26.450> too<00:03:26.870> orange<00:03:27.109> does

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
more pink so it's not too orange does

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.509 
more pink so it's not too orange does
that<00:03:27.440> make<00:03:27.560> sense<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.920> just<00:03:28.190> think<00:03:28.280> it's<00:03:28.430> really

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
that make sense I just think it's really

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.460 
that make sense I just think it's really
cute<00:03:28.850> going<00:03:29.510> along<00:03:29.720> with<00:03:29.900> that<00:03:29.989> nail<00:03:30.200> polish

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470

and that same orange family this one is
called<00:03:32.989> tansy<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.709> it's<00:03:33.890> super<00:03:34.280> pretty

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
called tansy and it's super pretty

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.280 
called tansy and it's super pretty
because<00:03:34.819> it's<00:03:34.970> an<00:03:35.090> orange<00:03:35.420> II<00:03:35.569> kind<00:03:36.170> of

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
because it's an orange II kind of

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.830

gold<00:03:39.380> shimmer<00:03:39.680> in<00:03:39.859> it<00:03:39.980> so<00:03:40.310> this<00:03:40.489> looks<00:03:40.639> so<00:03:40.970> good

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
gold shimmer in it so this looks so good
