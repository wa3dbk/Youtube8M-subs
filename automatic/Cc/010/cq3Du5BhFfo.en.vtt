00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
better movement out of it for doing so

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.760

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
going to move forward one they're going

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.840 
going to move forward one they're going
to<00:02:31.250> turn<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:31.700> move

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
to turn and move

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.430 
to turn and move

this direction and move forward one and

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.690 
this direction and move forward one and
then<00:02:33.530> they<00:02:33.620> can<00:02:33.770> choose<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.130> face<00:02:34.250> either<00:02:34.460> this

tile<00:02:35.000> or<00:02:35.210> this<00:02:35.630> tile<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.650> so<00:02:36.860> maybe<00:02:37.100> they'll

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
tile or this tile and so maybe they'll

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.160 
tile or this tile and so maybe they'll
choose<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.730> face<00:02:37.850> this<00:02:38.120> way<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.540> their<00:02:38.930> turn

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
is done this card would get discarded

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.980 
is done this card would get discarded
they<00:02:40.700> would<00:02:40.850> draw<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.060> new<00:02:41.270> card<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.660> their<00:02:41.780> hand

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
they would draw a new card to their hand

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.020 
they would draw a new card to their hand
then<00:02:42.590> we<00:02:42.740> would<00:02:42.830> go<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.010> 24<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.730> this<00:02:43.820> player

maybe they just go straight forward they
and<00:03:02.060> their<00:03:02.180> turn<00:03:02.360> right<00:03:02.540> there<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:02.780> they're

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
and their turn right there and they're

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.160 
and their turn right there and they're
done<00:03:03.530> they<00:03:03.830> draw<00:03:04.070> another<00:03:04.280> card<00:03:04.810> if<00:03:05.810> at<00:03:05.990> any

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
done they draw another card if at any

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.140 
done they draw another card if at any
time<00:03:06.260> your<00:03:06.710> duck<00:03:06.950> hits<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.400> end<00:03:07.550> of<00:03:07.790> edge<00:03:07.940> of

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
time your duck hits the end of edge of

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.520 
time your duck hits the end of edge of
the<00:03:08.210> board<00:03:08.390> maybe<00:03:08.600> you<00:03:08.780> move<00:03:08.960> forward<00:03:09.200> several

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
the board maybe you move forward several

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.990 
the board maybe you move forward several
times<00:03:09.830> you<00:03:10.010> have<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:10.250> move<00:03:10.400> forward<00:03:10.670> again<00:03:10.730> but

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
times you have to move forward again but

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.460 
times you have to move forward again but
you<00:03:11.120> can't<00:03:11.390> you're<00:03:11.510> going<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:11.840> stop<00:03:12.080> your<00:03:12.260> turn

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
you can't you're going to stop your turn

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.140 
you can't you're going to stop your turn
and<00:03:12.710> turn<00:03:12.860> right<00:03:13.070> back<00:03:13.130> around<00:03:13.310> finishing

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
and turn right back around finishing

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.110 
and turn right back around finishing
your<00:03:14.270> turn<00:03:14.510> like<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:14.900> if<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:16.730> were<00:03:16.820> to<00:03:16.940> run

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
your turn like that if you were to run

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.550 
your turn like that if you were to run
into<00:03:17.360> another<00:03:17.540> duck<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.080> same<00:03:18.290> thing<00:03:18.500> would

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
into another duck the same thing would

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.470 
into another duck the same thing would
happen<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:18.950> maybe<00:03:19.130> somehow<00:03:19.490> this<00:03:19.850> duck<00:03:20.180> moves

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
happen so maybe somehow this duck moves

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.030 
happen so maybe somehow this duck moves
forward<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:20.960> hits<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.290> stuff<00:03:21.590> he's<00:03:21.770> going<00:03:21.950> to

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
forward and hits the stuff he's going to

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.800 
forward and hits the stuff he's going to
turn<00:03:22.190> around<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.610> stop<00:03:22.880> right<00:03:23.450> in<00:03:23.480> front<00:03:23.600> of

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
turn around and stop right in front of

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.870 
turn around and stop right in front of
the<00:03:23.900> other<00:03:23.930> duck<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.980> same<00:03:25.220> is<00:03:25.400> true<00:03:25.430> for<00:03:25.640> the

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
the other duck the same is true for the

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.820 
the other duck the same is true for the

you end your turn on a buoy you get to

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.350 
you end your turn on a buoy you get to
play<00:03:46.100> another<00:03:46.370> card<00:03:46.460> immediately<00:03:46.940> and

can<00:04:26.360> flip<00:04:26.600> these<00:04:26.750> ones<00:04:27.050> over<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:27.410> the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
can flip these ones over and the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.770 
can flip these ones over and the
position<00:04:28.010> of<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.130> buoys<00:04:28.520> will<00:04:28.730> move<00:04:28.910> and<00:04:29.570> then

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
position of the buoys will move and then

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.380 
position of the buoys will move and then
on<00:04:29.900> top<00:04:30.110> of<00:04:30.170> that<00:04:30.350> there<00:04:30.680> are<00:04:30.800> some<00:04:31.390> advanced

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
on top of that there are some advanced

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.990 
on top of that there are some advanced
variance<00:04:32.870> using<00:04:33.080> some<00:04:33.950> action<00:04:34.460> cards<00:04:34.820> and

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
variance using some action cards and

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.390 
variance using some action cards and
what's<00:04:35.180> called<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.510> bird<00:04:35.900> dog<00:04:36.320> so<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:37.280> have

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
what's called the bird dog so you have

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.800 
what's called the bird dog so you have
some<00:04:37.520> action<00:04:37.910> tokens<00:04:38.300> here<00:04:38.450> that<00:04:38.600> when<00:04:38.720> you

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
some action tokens here that when you

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.180 
some action tokens here that when you
cross<00:04:39.080> over<00:04:39.350> one<00:04:39.560> of<00:04:39.650> these<00:04:39.680> buoys<00:04:39.950> you're

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
cross over one of these buoys you're

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.650 
cross over one of these buoys you're
going<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.430> get<00:04:40.520> a<00:04:40.550> special<00:04:40.910> action<00:04:41.270> token<00:04:41.570> and

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
going to get a special action token and

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.510 
going to get a special action token and
they<00:04:41.750> do<00:04:41.810> different<00:04:42.260> things<00:04:42.320> so<00:04:42.740> you<00:04:42.950> can<00:04:43.220> use

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
they do different things so you can use

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.130 
they do different things so you can use
this<00:04:43.669> one<00:04:43.910> to<00:04:43.940> change<00:04:44.240> your<00:04:44.390> facing<00:04:44.930> on<00:04:45.020> the

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
ducks you can get the gameplay is a

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.100 
ducks you can get the gameplay is a
little<00:06:16.610> bit<00:06:16.730> chaotic<00:06:16.970> you<00:06:17.390> have<00:06:17.540> a<00:06:17.570> choice<00:06:17.900> of

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
little bit chaotic you have a choice of

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.050 
little bit chaotic you have a choice of
three<00:06:18.170> cards<00:06:18.710> and<00:06:19.010> through<00:06:19.550> some<00:06:19.760> pretty<00:06:19.880> good

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
three cards and through some pretty good

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.700 
three cards and through some pretty good
planning<00:06:20.450> you<00:06:20.540> can<00:06:20.570> negate<00:06:21.230> some<00:06:21.290> of<00:06:21.620> that

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
planning you can negate some of that

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.920 
planning you can negate some of that
chaos<00:06:21.920> but<00:06:22.280> you<00:06:22.700> are<00:06:22.880> limited<00:06:23.360> by<00:06:23.480> the<00:06:23.540> cards

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
chaos but you are limited by the cards

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.850 
chaos but you are limited by the cards
that<00:06:24.080> you<00:06:24.200> draw<00:06:24.440> so<00:06:24.710> there<00:06:24.860> is<00:06:24.980> that<00:06:25.010> aspect

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
that you draw so there is that aspect

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.840 
that you draw so there is that aspect
overall<00:06:27.860> I<00:06:27.890> think<00:06:28.040> it's<00:06:28.220> a<00:06:28.280> pretty<00:06:28.400> good<00:06:28.640> game

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:28.850 
overall I think it's a pretty good game

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.570 
overall I think it's a pretty good game
for<00:06:29.210> for<00:06:29.840> lighter<00:06:30.410> gamers<00:06:30.920> and<00:06:31.100> for<00:06:31.370> kids

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
for for lighter gamers and for kids

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.130 
for for lighter gamers and for kids
definitely<00:06:31.910> it's<00:06:32.690> not<00:06:32.810> something<00:06:32.990> that's

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
definitely it's not something that's

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.300 
definitely it's not something that's
going<00:06:33.350> to<00:06:33.410> stay<00:06:33.590> in<00:06:33.620> my<00:06:33.740> collection<00:06:33.920> not

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
going to stay in my collection not

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.650 
going to stay in my collection not
because<00:06:34.550> it's<00:06:34.670> not<00:06:34.790> a<00:06:34.850> good<00:06:35.060> game<00:06:35.300> but<00:06:35.540> it's

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
because it's not a good game but it's

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.240 
because it's not a good game but it's
because<00:06:35.930> it's<00:06:36.230> something<00:06:36.470> that<00:06:36.680> won't<00:06:36.890> hit<00:06:37.100> my

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
because it's something that won't hit my

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.060 
because it's something that won't hit my
table<00:06:37.610> very<00:06:37.790> often<00:06:38.120> but<00:06:38.960> I<00:06:39.200> think<00:06:39.800> it<00:06:39.920> does

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
table very often but I think it does

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.410 
table very often but I think it does
have<00:06:40.250> a<00:06:40.310> place<00:06:40.490> in<00:06:40.520> a<00:06:40.670> lot<00:06:40.880> of<00:06:41.060> players

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420 
have a place in a lot of players

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.970 
have a place in a lot of players
collections<00:06:41.990> and<00:06:42.170> I<00:06:42.200> think<00:06:42.470> it's<00:06:42.590> done<00:06:42.710> very

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:42.980 
collections and I think it's done very

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.640 
collections and I think it's done very
well<00:06:43.040> so<00:06:43.400> far<00:06:43.430> in<00:06:43.700> terms<00:06:43.850> of<00:06:44.060> sales<00:06:44.330> so<00:06:45.140> overall

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
well so far in terms of sales so overall

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.070 
well so far in terms of sales so overall
