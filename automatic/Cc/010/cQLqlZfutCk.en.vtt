00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.370
 hello very good everyone here at church 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.979
 that 's some very special video worth 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.690
 two little things in one and well the first one goes 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.940
 to deal with the altruistic code that 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.580
 you have already seen in the title 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.800
 in the helicopter directing me to then to 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.480
 this town to the tourist not many people 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.760
 know that there are tourists here in 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.370
 this game but few people know what 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.090
 means that of altruism not because the 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.530
 tourism is one as a way of good 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.300
 you can understand how you will go for example 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.640
 someone who believes is worth for example me 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.100
 I have a plate of food and there are two 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.839
 people who can not eat that 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.609
 day not then I have a plate of 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:39.469
 food where my plate can eat two 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.510
 people calmly then it would be 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.489
 a sacrifice of mine to carry that plate 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.199
 to those two people and that those two 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.999
 people eat and I was left without food 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.519
 that then this would be a sacrifice 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:52.249
 personal for the benefit of others to 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.470
 sacrifice me so you can eat 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:56.570
 so it's good he was here 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.970
 the east town of the people go down to this 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.040
 that I said and well here I do not know here 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.660
 I did not know much about the reflection but it looks 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.730
 perfectly that is a silhouette with the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.010
 uncle of the jetpack that many will already know 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.980
 the channeling is done but good 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.680
 first time I come here I thought 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.870
 interesting to teach it so good that 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.190
 what came to talk to you was about the 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.770
 altruistic code that will do later 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.060
 I will show you on the mobile which page is 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.310
 you just have to look at the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.520
 altruistic seeker that would be altruism 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.590
 in English it's worth I'll look for it on my mobile 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.290
 leave a page with a morse code one 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.150
 morse code is a code because it does not 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.729
 can read with normal letters worth a 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.800
 morse code is with wii points and hyphens 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.330
 good if you know morse code what 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.550
 you will understand perfectly but as not 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.320
 you know morse code the biggest and assured 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.970
 that you will not know Morse code because I 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.290
 I come here to translate in that code 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.810
 because I find it interesting and I have not 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.759
 I've seen many videos about this 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.590
 but I find it interesting basically 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.530
 I wanted to have it on my channel here as 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.970
 You see I was with a clover here watching the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.229
 populated east that the truth that in loves 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.909
 that had come two or three times the 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.740
 campaign mode and I found it interesting 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.740
 here I found myself a very uncle 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.180
 and very special an old man here with everything 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.959
 air that gives equal 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.729
 these people would be pasotism and I would 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.430
 I sacrifice for you these people will have 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.020
 donated clothes to people who do not know I do not know 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.569
 here they are capped on balls in 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.349
 underpants but good as said 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.780
 they are a town of crazy altruists and 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.090
 well what I came to tell you will be about 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.060
 the altruistic code is worth it is a 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.310
 website that is simply we have 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.190
 what to look for in the altruistic browser 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.940
 good to 3 I do not know what it was then 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.250
 I'm going to put it 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.069
 'will be the twist I believe altruism let's go 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.780
 basically and it gives us the first page 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.580
 I will in a rare language as has 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.670
 said in Morse code and I'm going to 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.280
 translate some of what it says in 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.470
 some of his phrases that are what 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.750
 these people think, well, she is 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.819
 they think that the revolution 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.709
 industrial vale has been a disaster for 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.200
 the entire human race not for the 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.380
 stability of the human race that is 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:09.080
 criticism the industrial revolution 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:11.680
 almost all almost all or I would say 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.110
 from anyone who focuses their 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.240
 personality to superiority is worth the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.430
 superiority for more generations 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.130
 young people or that is believed superior will give 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.510
 place to a catastrophe is already worth an end 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.070
 of our civilization as I said 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.750
 these people are more now also says 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.100
 that man is a nocturnal animal by 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.510
 nature to go I go here 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.850
 killing people I say that these people are 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.050
 bigger I started reading this code and 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.330
 I say go man and get him for ass 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.520
 he killed them acts good time then 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.380
 also tells us that those that exist the 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.450
 industrial society does not suffer from 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.910
 psychological problems be these people what 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.000
 Critics entire industrial society 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.230
 and so I'm going to leave this in 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.200
 the description seems very interesting 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.400
 made of the altruists and that what 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.190
 leave the description well read the most 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.810
 important is also worth it too and this 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.459
 because of the clothes that prohibit clothes 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.430
 prohibit lies forbid deception 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.970
 prohibits eating baby meat is to drink 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.130
 blood or whatever altruism 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.950
 it's good so well they're a little 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.480
 more expensive and now I'm going to show you 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.670
 I think a little more 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.199
 interesting that it's about the superhero 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.030
 of the saints 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:19.889
 Wake up says curiosity not so 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.380
 it's about a comic book store that 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.840
 will tell the exact location so that 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.380
 let's see the superhero who protects the 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.210
 saints we do not have a superman to batman 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.740
 spiderman to a bunch of superheroes 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.750
 but this is the one of the saints the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.300
 authentic good as you see here is a 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.880
 comic store here I found myself then 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.949
 emirati stock the way it has is 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.410
 I really was not a bit freaked out 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:47.430
 I say good, I will keep in mind that it is a 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.380
 rocket there we have one maybe the robberies 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.720
 this and look here I already say what more 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:56.370
 big and I say this has to be a joke 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.360
 this is a penis worth a penis but let's go 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.720
 I waited 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.940
 lol because I do not know what that comes in there and 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.759
 well this is the superhero is worth the 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.470
 superhero is yellow and look where 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.800
 let's find look is up here 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.919
 on the balcony and look is looking at the 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.310
 heaven will not be waiting for a light 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.630
 an image of being told come to 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.490
 save us because look is in the 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.300
 window and it looks like a normal person I think 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.400
 which is flashing 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.690
 but then you shoot him and as if not 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.370
 I was or it seems to me very 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.289
 interesting I do not know if it will be a doll 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.180
 I know if it will be a person but I thought 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.419
 quite interesting and the truth is that 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.879
 it seems he is the superhero of the 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.319
 saints so well I hope there's 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:39.509
 liked the video I tried to put two 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.960
 little things in one to make you more 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.080
 enjoyable 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.419
 more curious two curious little things I hope 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.720
 that you liked a greeting and we 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:57.130
 we see the next goodbye 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:57.130
 [Music]
