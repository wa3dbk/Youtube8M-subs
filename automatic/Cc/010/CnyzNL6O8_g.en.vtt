00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.190
 round bulging 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:21.029
 through which all things seem to be a hundred 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.939
 times more than they really are if 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.960
 through him look at a drop of water 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.740
 taken somewhere from the pond 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.609
 then you will see thousands of outlandish 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.040
 animals 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.480
 which is never seen in the water 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.730
 although they are there of course you look at 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.540
 a drop of such water 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.210
 squad you but neither give nor take 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.989
 a whole plate of live shrimp which 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.340
 jump crawling bothering 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.460

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.070
 leg back then there is a corner there 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.750
 tip and at the same time rejoice having fun 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.420
 in his own way there was an old man whom 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.330
 everybody called Kopun the bother 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.119
 well he had a name like that forever 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.760
 rummaged and bothered every thing 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.490
 wanting to get everything out of it 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.900
 it was generally impossible to achieve 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.560
 of this simple way then he resorted 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.990
 witchcraft here is sitting at you before watching 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.040
 through a magnifying glass to drop 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.670
 water taken straight from the puddle of my fathers 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.180
 how these little creatures swarmed and fussed 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.100
 there were thousands of them and they all jumped 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.380
 galloping biting stinging 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.270
 and devoured each other but this 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.490
 disgustingly met old kopun 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.840
 a bother did not take somehow 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.320
 to pacify 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.720
 introduce their order so that everyone knows 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.330
 your place and your rights 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.320
 thought thought old man and everything is nothing 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:06.570
 could not come up had to resort 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:09.210
 witchcraft need to paint them so they 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.820
 more conspicuous he said and 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.620
 slightly dripped some liquid on them 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.590
 like red wine 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.700
 but it was not the witchâ€™s fault 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.650
 blood of the very first grade all 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.160
 strange little animals suddenly took 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.860
 reddish tint and a drop of water can 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:34.080
 was now taken for the whole city 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:37.140
 swarming with naked savages what have you got here 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.900
 asked the old man another sorcerer without a name 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.590
 by this he was just different but 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.770
 guess 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.560
 said kopun busybody I guess 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.830
 I'll give you this thing but guess not 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.610
 easy if you don't know what the sorcerer is 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.150
 no name 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.730
 looked into a magnifying glass right 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.209
 before him was a whole city swarming 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.600
 people but they all ran naked 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.130
 fear that such and even worse was the fact that the 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.320
 they 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.050
 mercilessly pushed and afraid to bite 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.769
 and tore each other to shreds who was 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.110
 down below 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.640
 sure to get out who was 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.700
 upstairs fell down 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.600
 look he looks at that leg longer than mine 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.480
 gave her but this tiny bump for 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.209
 ear is a tiny innocent bump but to him from 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.330
 she will be more painful so 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.670
 they bit the poor man tore to pieces and 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.060
 devoured for having tiny 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.250
 the cone is watching somebody sit yourself 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.390
 quietly how a red maiden nobody 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.570
 touch would not touch him so no come on 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.799

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.450
 funny 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.910
 said a sorcerer without a name 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.220
 so you can guess 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:04.540
 Kopun asked the bastard 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:08.709
 Well, then you guess anything immediately clear 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.209
 replied that this is popingagin or another 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.300
 some big city 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:17.760
 they are all like one another 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.760
 this is a big city 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:25.800
