actually<00:00:45.660> retracting<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.770> covered<00:00:47.129> it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
actually retracting it just covered it

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.760 
actually retracting it just covered it
up<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.610> then<00:00:48.120> shortly<00:00:48.360> after<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.350> pulling

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
up and then shortly after it is pulling

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.049 
up and then shortly after it is pulling
it<00:00:49.860> back<00:00:49.980> off<00:00:50.190> because<00:00:50.460> they<00:00:50.730> have<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.030> a

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
it back off because they have it on a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.939 
it back off because they have it on a
timer<00:00:51.360> which<00:00:51.750> makes<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.140> thing<00:00:52.530> really

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
awesome as far as automation goes you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.990 
awesome as far as automation goes you
can<00:00:55.140> also<00:00:55.260> manually<00:00:55.949> hand<00:00:56.280> crank<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.699> if<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
can also manually hand crank it if you

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.209 
can also manually hand crank it if you
don't<00:00:57.149> want<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> use<00:00:57.570> their<00:00:58.079> auto<00:00:58.320> kit<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:59.190> I

and you're going to get a greenhouse

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.090 
and you're going to get a greenhouse
like<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.359> totally<00:01:03.629> worth<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.920> base

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
like this it's totally worth it the base

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.210 
like this it's totally worth it the base
of<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.640> 12<00:01:06.210> feet<00:01:06.479> by<00:01:06.780> 20<00:01:07.680> feet<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
of it is 12 feet by 20 feet on the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.550 
of it is 12 feet by 20 feet on the
inside<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.180> also<00:01:09.360> expand<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> add

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
inside you can also expand that and add

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.890 
inside you can also expand that and add
units<00:01:10.920> onto<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.790> go<00:01:11.880> 12<00:01:12.210> by<00:01:12.330> 20<00:01:12.659> 12

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
units onto it so you can go 12 by 20 12

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.719 
units onto it so you can go 12 by 20 12
by<00:01:13.049> 20<00:01:13.350> all<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> way<00:01:13.979> down<00:01:14.159> until<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.670> a

trying to get multiple harvesters in one

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.670 
trying to get multiple harvesters in one
season<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.549> not<00:01:33.150> grow<00:01:33.390> long<00:01:33.720> crops<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
season and not grow long crops so the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.560 
season and not grow long crops so the
plants<00:01:34.950> probably<00:01:35.220> won't<00:01:35.340> get<00:01:35.490> too<00:01:35.700> big<00:01:35.939> but<00:01:36.180> it

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
plants probably won't get too big but it

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
plants probably won't get too big but it
still<00:01:36.780> would<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:36.990> been<00:01:37.079> nice<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.530> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
still would have been nice to have a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.069 
still would have been nice to have a
little<00:01:37.740> bit<00:01:37.950> taller<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.549> an<00:01:38.640> option<00:01:39.000> as<00:01:39.180> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
little bit taller of an option as you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.230 
little bit taller of an option as you
can<00:01:40.259> see<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.710> rolling<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.579> all<00:01:41.700> up<00:01:41.909> right

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
can see it's rolling it all up right

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.450 
can see it's rolling it all up right

have a really nice durable shade cloth
on<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> greenhouse<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.409> your<00:01:49.530> plants<00:01:49.740> won't

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
on the greenhouse so your plants won't

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.340 
on the greenhouse so your plants won't
get<00:01:50.130> too<00:01:50.310> hot<00:01:50.520> or<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:51.360> beat<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.630> by<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.110> that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
get too hot or get beat up by that that

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.469 
get too hot or get beat up by that that
scalding<00:01:52.950> Sun<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> harvest

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
scalding Sun so this is the harvest
