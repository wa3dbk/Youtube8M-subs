00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.640 
risen what I did is I added the yeast to
the<00:03:39.850> water<00:03:40.270> that<00:03:40.600> the<00:03:40.780> recipe<00:03:41.200> calls<00:03:41.470> for

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
the water that the recipe calls for

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.790 
the water that the recipe calls for
which<00:03:42.070> is<00:03:42.280> 3/4<00:03:42.850> of<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.090> cup<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.630> it<00:03:44.230> also<00:03:44.410> calls

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
which is 3/4 of a cup and it also calls

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.940 
which is 3/4 of a cup and it also calls
for<00:03:44.950> four<00:03:45.400> tablespoons<00:03:46.090> of<00:03:46.510> sweetener<00:03:47.320> so<00:03:47.920> I

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
for four tablespoons of sweetener so I

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.580 
for four tablespoons of sweetener so I
add<00:03:48.340> four<00:03:48.640> tablespoons<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:49.240> sugar<00:03:49.510> so<00:03:50.230> I<00:03:50.260> did

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
add four tablespoons of sugar so I did

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.650 
add four tablespoons of sugar so I did
this<00:03:50.800> about<00:03:51.700> ten<00:03:51.970> minutes<00:03:52.120> ago<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:52.450> you<00:03:52.600> can

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
this about ten minutes ago and you can

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.930 
this about ten minutes ago and you can
see<00:03:52.810> it's<00:03:53.230> already<00:03:53.440> proof<00:03:54.250> is<00:03:54.550> what<00:03:54.760> it's

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
see it's already proof is what it's

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.940 
see it's already proof is what it's
called<00:03:55.120> that<00:03:55.330> way<00:03:55.450> you<00:03:55.510> know<00:03:55.840> that<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.710> yeast

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
called that way you know that the yeast

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.810 
called that way you know that the yeast
is<00:03:57.250> good

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
is good

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.390 
is good
so<00:03:58.570> let's<00:03:58.750> stir<00:03:59.050> that<00:03:59.290> down<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.890> add<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.280> all

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
so let's stir that down and add it all

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.490 
so let's stir that down and add it all
in<00:04:00.670> so<00:04:00.850> that's<00:04:01.000> my<00:04:01.210> liquid<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:01.840> one<00:04:02.050> of<00:04:02.290> my

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
in so that's my liquid and one of my

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.980
