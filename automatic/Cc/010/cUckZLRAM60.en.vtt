00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
was about 19 years old I've been doing

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.220 
was about 19 years old I've been doing
that<00:02:28.380> now<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:28.590> about<00:02:28.920> 10<00:02:29.340> years<00:02:29.810> solid<00:02:30.810> but

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
that now for about 10 years solid but

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.420 
that now for about 10 years solid but

elizabethtown area probably 23 24 years
I<00:02:35.520> think<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.180> best<00:02:36.360> part<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.170> take<00:02:37.350> in

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
I think the best part is to take in

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.320 
I think the best part is to take in
taking<00:02:38.100> somebody<00:02:38.430> whether<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.850> child<00:02:39.120> or
