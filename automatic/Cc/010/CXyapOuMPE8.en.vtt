guys<00:02:30.770> can<00:02:31.040> take<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.250> look<00:02:31.340> listen<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:32.330> how<00:02:32.510> it

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
guys can take a look listen of how it

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.390 
guys can take a look listen of how it
sounds<00:02:33.050> in<00:02:33.170> all<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.590> different<00:02:33.920> modes<00:02:34.100> and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
sounds in all the different modes and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.770 
sounds in all the different modes and
also<00:02:34.550> how<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.730> picture<00:02:35.060> quality<00:02:35.150> looks<00:02:35.600> like

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
also how the picture quality looks like

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.020 
also how the picture quality looks like
when<00:02:36.020> it's<00:02:36.140> in<00:02:36.320> stand<00:02:36.980> mode<00:02:37.280> tent<00:02:37.760> mode

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
when it's in stand mode tent mode

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.150 
when it's in stand mode tent mode
whatever<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.080> case<00:02:39.290> may<00:02:39.500> be<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:39.920> get<00:02:40.130> a

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
whatever the case may be so you get a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.490 
whatever the case may be so you get a
good<00:02:40.430> good<00:02:40.760> idea<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.360> what<00:02:41.660> it<00:02:41.780> actually<00:02:41.959> does

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
good good idea of what it actually does

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.530 
good good idea of what it actually does
now<00:02:43.190> in<00:02:43.400> terms<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.760> processing<00:02:44.360> and

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
now in terms of processing and

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.199 
now in terms of processing and
performance<00:02:45.140> like<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.350> said<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:46.850> know<00:02:47.000> when

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
performance like I said you know when

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.030 
performance like I said you know when
you're<00:02:47.300> doing<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.600> basic<00:02:47.930> tasks<00:02:48.200> it's<00:02:48.650> fine

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
you're doing the basic tasks it's fine

00:02:49.040 --> 00:04:00.729 
you're doing the basic tasks it's fine
with<00:02:49.340> this<00:03:57.790> so<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:58.850> saw<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.180> the<00:04:00.170> speakers

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
with this so you saw that the speakers

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.310 
with this so you saw that the speakers
are<00:04:00.890> actually<00:04:01.250> pretty<00:04:01.610> nice<00:04:01.880> good<00:04:02.600> volume<00:04:03.079> and

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
are actually pretty nice good volume and

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.920 
are actually pretty nice good volume and
also<00:04:03.709> visually<00:04:04.579> the<00:04:04.880> screen<00:04:05.299> looks<00:04:05.600> pretty

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
also visually the screen looks pretty

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.930 
also visually the screen looks pretty
pretty<00:04:06.320> good<00:04:06.530> so<00:04:06.739> you<00:04:06.799> can<00:04:06.890> get<00:04:07.160> good<00:04:07.579> visual

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
pretty good so you can get good visual

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.569 
pretty good so you can get good visual
experience<00:04:08.420> while<00:04:08.989> watching<00:04:09.350> your<00:04:09.680> videos<00:04:10.190> as

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
experience while watching your videos as

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.610 
experience while watching your videos as
well<00:04:10.760> as<00:04:10.970> using<00:04:11.150> this

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
well as using this

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.160 
well as using this
laptop<00:04:13.370> available<00:04:14.000> in<00:04:14.329> whichever<00:04:14.840> way<00:04:15.110> you

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
laptop available in whichever way you

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.810 
laptop available in whichever way you
choose<00:04:15.319> now

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
choose now

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.270 
choose now
the<00:04:17.259> thing<00:04:18.259> that<00:04:18.470> I<00:04:18.530> want<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.739> actually<00:04:18.859> point

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
the thing that I want to actually point

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.189 
the thing that I want to actually point
out<00:04:19.400> is<00:04:19.579> actually<00:04:19.729> back<00:04:20.690> to<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.900> performance

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
out is actually back to the performance

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.770 
out is actually back to the performance
here<00:04:21.560> again<00:04:21.889> so<00:04:22.190> in<00:04:22.610> terms<00:04:22.970> of<00:04:23.180> actually<00:04:23.570> using

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
here again so in terms of actually using

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.659 
here again so in terms of actually using
this<00:04:24.050> it<00:04:24.229> does<00:04:24.500> heat<00:04:24.770> up<00:04:24.889> a<00:04:25.009> little<00:04:25.130> bit<00:04:25.340> not<00:04:25.520> as

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
this it does heat up a little bit not as

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.060 
this it does heat up a little bit not as
bad<00:04:25.880> as<00:04:26.000> some<00:04:26.120> other<00:04:26.240> devices<00:04:26.770> so<00:04:27.770> that's<00:04:27.949> also

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
bad as some other devices so that's also

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.680 
bad as some other devices so that's also
pretty<00:04:28.280> good<00:04:28.550> you've<00:04:28.789> also<00:04:28.970> got<00:04:29.210> that<00:04:29.240> nice

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
pretty good you've also got that nice

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.800 
pretty good you've also got that nice
portable<00:04:30.380> travel<00:04:30.830> charger<00:04:31.370> that's<00:04:32.360> not<00:04:32.600> too

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
portable travel charger that's not too

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.180 
portable travel charger that's not too
large<00:04:33.020> that<00:04:33.470> actually<00:04:33.800> will<00:04:33.919> fully<00:04:34.100> charge

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
large that actually will fully charge

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.189 
large that actually will fully charge
your<00:04:34.520> device<00:04:34.759> for<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:35.479> you<00:04:35.539> have<00:04:35.630> a<00:04:35.870> very

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
your device for you so you have a very

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.219 
your device for you so you have a very
good<00:04:36.320> experience<00:04:36.740> I<00:04:37.009> do<00:04:37.430> like<00:04:37.789> it<00:04:38.110> problem<00:04:39.110> is

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
good experience I do like it problem is

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.689 
good experience I do like it problem is
I<00:04:39.259> think<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.740> should<00:04:39.919> be<00:04:39.949> priced<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.400> little<00:04:40.430> bit

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
I think it should be priced a little bit

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.490 
I think it should be priced a little bit
cheaper<00:04:40.940> another<00:04:41.539> standard<00:04:41.810> price<00:04:41.990> is<00:04:42.139> $6.99

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
cheaper another standard price is $6.99

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.310
