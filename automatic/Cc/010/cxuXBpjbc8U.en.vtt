00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
nine thousand five hundred ninety

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.110 
nine thousand five hundred ninety
dollars<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:46.670> car<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.750> same<00:00:48.780> type<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.700> four

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
dollars a car of the same type is four

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.139 
dollars a car of the same type is four
years<00:00:51.300> old<00:00:51.600> usually<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.829> about<00:00:53.489> half<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
years old usually is about half the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.099 
years old usually is about half the
price<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:55.379> what<00:00:55.559> should<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.219> forth<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.449> 1/2

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
price so what should it so forth so 1/2

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:06.250 
price so what should it so forth so 1/2
times<00:00:59.809> twenty<00:01:00.809> nine<00:01:01.820> five<00:01:02.820> ninety<00:01:04.400> over<00:01:05.400> one

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
times twenty nine five ninety over one

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.149 
times twenty nine five ninety over one
so<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.380> can<00:01:07.530> divide<00:01:07.799> each<00:01:08.010> side<00:01:08.040> by<00:01:08.280> 2<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:09.000> 1<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
so we can divide each side by 2 is 1 and

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:18.820 
so we can divide each side by 2 is 1 and
goes<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:12.140> that<00:01:13.140> goes<00:01:13.350> four<00:01:15.170> seven<00:01:16.640> nine<00:01:17.689> five

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
goes one that goes four seven nine five

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:28.280 
goes one that goes four seven nine five
so<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> answer<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:25.670> fourteen<00:01:26.670> thousand<00:01:27.299> seven

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
so the answer is fourteen thousand seven

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.380 
so the answer is fourteen thousand seven
hundred<00:01:28.409> ninety<00:01:28.920> five<00:01:29.070> dollars<00:01:29.329> for<00:01:30.329> a
