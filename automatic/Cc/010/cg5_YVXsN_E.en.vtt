00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.340
 whiskey punkt.de meeting point fine 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.170
 spirits welcome to whiskey 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.269
 store the meeting place full of spirits and 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.190
 Today we are back at the men's 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.260
 Distillers have the distillery distillery 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.289
 I've ever shot a video 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.439
 I visit very nice little ones 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.500
 Distillery on the island of the same name 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.670
 and I have very quiet 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.580
 playlist what I do of it all 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.190
 So I tried really many 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.430
 including a whiskey without 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.379
 age indication with the name robert burns 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.559
 great drunk bottle yes that 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.690
 dedicated to Scottish national poet 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.129
 no age indication no for the flowers 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.809
 already a few years on the market 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.690
 in the equipment improved by 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:01:01.390
 this successful great bottle and now 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:03.969
 All in all, 2014 comes at 3 pm 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.490
 14 percent what should the new now have 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.870
 So we are 2 1 in the classic 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:14.530
 Men's fashion the other in a something 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.060
 better presentation of the home looks what 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.890
 is there because different and so I have 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:23.950
 Looked and comparison of the flavors 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.960
 after paper form yes already 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.150
 bit different 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.400
 both are not dyed from the look of 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.280
 the color comparatively even if that 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.680
 shop picture because a bit brighter shows 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.090
 You can use the bottles with the same 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.490
 Exposure photography works 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.290
 somehow not like that 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.080
 then i found out a cool 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.170
 Filtering this one has 43 minutes 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.240
 percent and ne is guided cool 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.080
 and the other 30 percent did not 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.680
 filtered 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.480
 so if it points to that drink 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.330
 Yes the drinkers are drinking on ice 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.610
 then enjoy the ice cream without ice 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.850
 so if we know this on ice 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.840
 So it should cloud a bit 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.610
 Alone if you are here a bit 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.040
 he deserves to be clouded 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.610
 So that happens already and now 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.360
 stands here beautiful 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.890
 Balanced citrus and light 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:25.750
 ateliers with a burst of apples and 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:30.280
 Delicate maritime notes a fresh one 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:34.180
 character of our home to the island 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.180
 college of law franz a 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.290
 and now the question is 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:50.360
 In terms of price, the prince hat is also involved 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.280
 this one but which is why i should 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.560
 which we can really accept 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.120
 just say I do not just know it 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.580
 pleasant I tasted the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.660
 world exchanges have been here for so long 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.800
 now the bottling already 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.060
 have changed a bit again because 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.769
 there are always bad tolerances 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:14.000
 of course not so much off 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:15.880
 is easy was drinkable so now 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.690
 Let's just try that again 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.019
 want to know the differences 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.670
 but both for sure if it is 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.910
 really give so many differences 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.130
 can one say then yes this 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.900
 here has a higher share of and 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.540
 but that would be the case 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.200
 Information has my ear somehow 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.720
 not reached the one is just there 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.140
 to honor Robert Burns and therefore 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.940
 should the distillery and the home of the 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.940
 whiskeys viz. the community of lufthansa 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:57.019
 no smoke but from Schweinfurt the 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:59.459
 community is proud of being his 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:06.680
 The crazy you do not have to find 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.680
 I think this is marketing so 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:23.560
 very nice citrus character and 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:23.560
 behind it already violently aromatic 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.050
 next to this very typical citrus fruit 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.270
 aroma and now any satisfied 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.600
 become for yourself in the light fresh 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.620
 Fruits, therefore, only something is found 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.360
 heavier she is a little stronger and 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:47.320
 that was called old furniture burns 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:50.740
 cedar wood and here is a certain 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.740
 aromatic note 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.330
 would assign the span to a resin 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.770
 even if the security in 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.479
 oak barrels did not mature 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.229
 of course, not where should she have been 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:08.200
 come here 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:11.300
 in hardwood very nice fruity 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:31.160
 she paints whiskey with something more with something 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:33.800
 more island character a bit more intense yes 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:40.520
 there is now more islands character 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:44.330
 with something sweet in it but already 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:49.430
 neat and so really maritime 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:53.139
 notes one can say it is woman 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:57.470
 not but it is insanely automatic 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:59.750
 In any case, not only that 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.840
 three years 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:06.650
 this called many European 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:09.440
 So oak barrels more short now 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:14.630
 to tender bitterness 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:18.830
 lengerich had her mouth closed 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:20.120
 There is a difference between the two 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.470
 But then from robert burns 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:27.020
 I clearly see the relationship there 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:30.560
 slightly heavier that lead 43 percent 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.960
 without age indication million only these 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:37.820
 A bit more intensive in the departure of the 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:41.630
 that does not fit more to the aroma that 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.370
 is like me sometimes like blenz 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.470
 they taste that too too much 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.700
 dieter riders have perhaps earlier 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.229
 once pushed back on the terrain ski 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:53.060
 meanwhile this leads to the 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:55.630
 oak barrels used x times 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.630
 back 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:03.610
 matured amazingly for his money 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:06.080
 be amazing in it already 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:10.150
 shopsystem after the robert burns in the 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:13.569
 moment I think now late autumn 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:16.189
 2014 not available again 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:17.449
 Maybe that's not your replacement 

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:19.849
 clue though I and my name robert 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:25.750
 plants we whiskey bottle go let it 

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:25.750
 Thank you very much for watching
