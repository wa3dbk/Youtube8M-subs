00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
to do is wrap the cord around the body

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.170 
to do is wrap the cord around the body
of<00:01:51.930> your<00:01:52.500> appliance<00:01:53.430> because<00:01:53.850> what<00:01:54.060> it's

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
of your appliance because what it's

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.310 
of your appliance because what it's
going<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.689> going<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.930> break<00:01:55.110> down<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
going to do it's going to break down the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.469 
going to do it's going to break down the
cord<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:56.280> going<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.549> tangle<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.939> cord<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
cord it's going to tangle the cord and

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.200 
cord it's going to tangle the cord and
over<00:01:58.229> time<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.619> electricity<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.000> have

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
over time the electricity that you have

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.910 
over time the electricity that you have
in<00:02:00.329> your<00:02:00.450> house<00:02:00.689> your<00:02:01.140> home<00:02:01.320> your<00:02:01.560> salon

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
in your house your home your salon

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.520 
in your house your home your salon
whatever<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.689> going<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> hard<00:02:04.350> time

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
whatever is going to have a hard time

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.469 
whatever is going to have a hard time
getting<00:02:04.710> through<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.159> cord<00:02:05.670> it'll<00:02:06.270> just

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
getting through this cord it'll just

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.150 
getting through this cord it'll just
eventually<00:02:06.689> weaken<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.710> last<00:02:07.890> thing<00:02:08.039> you

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
eventually weaken so the last thing you

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.219 
eventually weaken so the last thing you
want<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.369> do<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.729> wrap<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.179> around<00:02:09.270> if<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:10.050> do

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
want to do is wrap it around if you do

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.140 
want to do is wrap it around if you do
need<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.500> store<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.039> it's<00:02:11.370> best<00:02:11.700> to

you need a glove now these plates are

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.289 
you need a glove now these plates are
actually<00:02:35.010> what<00:02:35.129> you<00:02:35.220> call<00:02:35.489> floating<00:02:36.120> floating

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
actually what you call floating floating

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.869 
actually what you call floating floating
plates<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.930> allow<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.470> get<00:02:37.859> very<00:02:38.579> deep

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
plates that allow you to get very deep

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.390 
plates that allow you to get very deep
into<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.359> route<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:40.560> basically<00:02:40.769> the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
into the route and you basically the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.119 
into the route and you basically the
best<00:02:41.489> way<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.730> use<00:02:41.909> it<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.420> curve<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.140> the

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
best way to use it is to curve it in the

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.160 
best way to use it is to curve it in the
formation<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.879> your<00:02:45.000> head<00:02:45.299> shape<00:02:45.690> for<00:02:45.989> best

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
formation of your head shape for best

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.440 
formation of your head shape for best
results<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.799> your<00:02:46.920> hair<00:02:47.129> lays<00:02:47.760> naturally

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
results so your hair lays naturally

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.050 
results so your hair lays naturally
against<00:02:48.989> your<00:02:49.200> head<00:02:49.440> now<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.310> prefer<00:02:50.819> the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
against your head now I prefer the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.640 
against your head now I prefer the
smaller<00:02:51.389> tools<00:02:51.720> like<00:02:52.109> I<00:02:52.200> said<00:02:52.379> this<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
smaller tools like I said this is the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.140 
smaller tools like I said this is the
1-inch<00:02:53.099> and<00:02:53.250> also<00:02:53.459> comes<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.819> one<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.090> a

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
1-inch and also comes in a one and a

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.780 
1-inch and also comes in a one and a
half<00:02:54.389> inch<00:02:55.040> does<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.159> take<00:02:56.310> more<00:02:56.430> time<00:02:56.609> not

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
half inch does it take more time not

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.520 
half inch does it take more time not
necessarily<00:02:57.480> but<00:02:57.629> I<00:02:57.720> think<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.170> smaller

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
necessarily but I think that the smaller

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.490 
necessarily but I think that the smaller
plates<00:02:58.950> allow<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.819> to<00:03:00.090> get<00:03:00.269> in<00:03:00.510> closer<00:03:00.959> to

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
plates allow you to get in closer to

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.129 
plates allow you to get in closer to
your<00:03:01.680> head<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.310> also<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.569> amount<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.900> hair

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
your head and also the amount of hair

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:05.629 
your head and also the amount of hair
that<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.349> feed<00:03:04.680> into<00:03:04.889> the<00:03:04.980> iron<00:03:05.159> I<00:03:05.340> think<00:03:05.549> you

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
that you feed into the iron I think you

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.759 
that you feed into the iron I think you
get<00:03:05.819> straighter<00:03:06.269> hair<00:03:06.569> if<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.049> feed<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.319> bit<00:03:07.590> at

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
get straighter hair if you feed a bit at

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.250 
get straighter hair if you feed a bit at
a<00:03:07.799> time<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.430> always<00:03:08.879> like<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.180> clip<00:03:09.480> my<00:03:09.659> hair<00:03:10.049> up

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
a time I always like to clip my hair up

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.780 
a time I always like to clip my hair up
and<00:03:10.470> start<00:03:10.769> from<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.069> bottom<00:03:11.189> and<00:03:11.519> then<00:03:11.609> work

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
and start from the bottom and then work

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.819 
and start from the bottom and then work
my<00:03:11.819> way<00:03:12.030> up<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.480> top<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:13.379> I<00:03:13.439> get<00:03:13.680> an

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
my way up to the top so I get an

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.890 
my way up to the top so I get an
all-over<00:03:14.040> straight<00:03:14.970> result<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.480> last<00:03:15.629> thing

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
all-over straight result the last thing

all-over straight result the last thing
you<00:03:16.019> want<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.319> do<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.769> completely<00:03:17.310> burn<00:03:17.549> off<00:03:17.730> or
