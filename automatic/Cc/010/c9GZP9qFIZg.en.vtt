opinion but I have to do this I have a
strong<00:00:12.389> opinion<00:00:12.599> about<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.559> know<00:00:13.650> iOS<00:00:14.130> 5<00:00:14.429> and

strong opinion about you know iOS 5 and
jailbreaking<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.199> how<00:00:16.470> Apple<00:00:17.039> has<00:00:17.190> tried<00:00:17.520> to

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
jailbreaking and how Apple has tried to

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.769 
jailbreaking and how Apple has tried to
effectively<00:00:19.550> discourage<00:00:20.550> ones<00:00:20.820> from<00:00:21.119> jail

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779

weeks directly into iOS 5 itself so

good<00:00:42.870> ideas<00:00:43.320> from<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.770> jailbreak<00:00:44.129> community

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
good ideas from the jailbreak community

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.610 
good ideas from the jailbreak community
because<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.969> only<00:00:45.090> makes<00:00:45.300> sense<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:46.230> know<00:00:46.260> if

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
because it only makes sense you know if

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.920 
because it only makes sense you know if
obviously<00:00:47.250> these<00:00:47.760> things<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.180> popular<00:00:48.660> and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
obviously these things are popular and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.569 
obviously these things are popular and
people<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.530> them<00:00:49.770> then<00:00:49.950> why<00:00:50.129> not<00:00:50.309> why<00:00:50.550> not

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
people like them then why not why not

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.150 
people like them then why not why not
bake<00:00:50.969> them<00:00:51.149> into<00:00:51.449> iOS<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.500> don't<00:00:52.620> fault<00:00:53.010> them

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
bake them into iOS so I don't fault them

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.029 
bake them into iOS so I don't fault them
for<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.600> want<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.020> address<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.829> fact

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
for that I just want to address the fact

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.459 
for that I just want to address the fact
that<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.850> they<00:00:57.539> think<00:00:57.600> that's<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.230> stop

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
that if they think that's going to stop

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.410 
that if they think that's going to stop
people<00:00:59.100> from<00:00:59.430> wanting<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.820> jailbreak<00:01:00.300> their

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
people from wanting to jailbreak their

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.479 
people from wanting to jailbreak their
devices<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.960> think<00:01:01.170> they're<00:01:01.320> mistaken<00:01:01.649> number

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
devices I think they're mistaken number

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.240 
devices I think they're mistaken number
one<00:01:02.640> reason<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.090> because<00:01:03.270> iOS<00:01:04.140> 5<00:01:04.559> has<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> lot<00:01:05.220> of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
one reason is because iOS 5 has a lot of

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.490 
one reason is because iOS 5 has a lot of
new<00:01:05.460> features<00:01:05.640> okay<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:07.110> lot<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.320> those

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
new features okay and a lot of those

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.560 
new features okay and a lot of those
features<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:09.000> know<00:01:09.090> are<00:01:09.240> going<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.479> be

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
features you know are going to be

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.260 
features you know are going to be
limited<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:10.110> some<00:01:10.320> way<00:01:10.860> shape<00:01:10.890> or<00:01:11.340> form<00:01:11.400> so

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
limited in some way shape or form so

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.530 
limited in some way shape or form so
that<00:01:13.070> provides<00:01:14.070> even<00:01:14.280> more<00:01:14.430> incentive<00:01:14.909> from

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
that provides even more incentive from

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.330 
that provides even more incentive from
ones<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.049> want<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.530> jailbreak<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:17.009> want<00:01:17.189> to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
ones to want to jailbreak we want to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.370 
ones to want to jailbreak we want to
create<00:01:17.520> different<00:01:18.509> tweaks<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.020> things<00:01:19.200> that

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
create different tweaks and things that

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.080 
create different tweaks and things that
take<00:01:19.590> advantage<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.369> these<00:01:20.490> new<00:01:20.549> features

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
take advantage of these new features

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.719 
take advantage of these new features
that<00:01:21.540> we're<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.380> an<00:01:22.619> iOS<00:01:22.979> 5<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that we're going to see an iOS 5 the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.850 
that we're going to see an iOS 5 the
biggie<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.390> comes<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.750> my<00:01:24.869> mind<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.560> cloud

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
biggie that comes to my mind is I cloud

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.640 
biggie that comes to my mind is I cloud
in<00:01:26.100> general<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.600> see<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.020> much<00:01:28.200> potential

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
in general I just see so much potential

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.800 
in general I just see so much potential
with<00:01:29.369> different<00:01:29.820> jailbreak<00:01:30.240> apps<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.720> tweaks

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
with different jailbreak apps and tweaks

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.499 
with different jailbreak apps and tweaks
that<00:01:31.200> actually<00:01:32.070> use<00:01:32.369> iCloud<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.180> some<00:01:33.390> way

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
that actually use iCloud in some way

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.960 
that actually use iCloud in some way
shape<00:01:33.540> or<00:01:33.900> form<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.979> tons<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.610> potential

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
shape or form I see tons of potential

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.819 
shape or form I see tons of potential
there<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.869> think<00:01:37.110> that's<00:01:37.320> where<00:01:37.470> Apple's

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
there and I think that's where Apple's

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.069 
there and I think that's where Apple's
kind<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.070> miscalculating<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.000> because<00:01:39.720> with

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
kind of miscalculating this because with

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.539 
kind of miscalculating this because with
all<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.380> new<00:01:40.470> improvements<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.220> come

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
all the new improvements that have come

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.580 
all the new improvements that have come
down<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.850> pipeline<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.420> iOS<00:01:42.750> 5<00:01:42.990> there's

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
down the pipeline with iOS 5 there's

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.160 
down the pipeline with iOS 5 there's
also<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.100> ton<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.670> opportunity<00:01:45.479> there<00:01:45.509> for<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
also a ton of opportunity there for the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.350 
also a ton of opportunity there for the
jailbreak<00:01:46.560> community<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:48.329> instance

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
jailbreak community so for instance

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480 
jailbreak community so for instance
here's<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.079> here's<00:01:49.110> an<00:01:49.439> example<00:01:49.770> what<00:01:50.399> about

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
here's and here's an example what about

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.240 
here's and here's an example what about
a<00:01:50.790> tweak<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:51.659> app<00:01:51.930> like<00:01:52.170> package<00:01:52.649> back<00:01:52.829> up<00:01:53.070> that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
a tweak or app like package back up that

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.100 
a tweak or app like package back up that
backs<00:01:53.460> up<00:01:53.610> all<00:01:53.820> your<00:01:54.030> jailbreak<00:01:54.540> apps<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
backs up all your jailbreak apps and

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.980 
backs up all your jailbreak apps and
tweaks<00:01:55.229> well<00:01:55.979> currently<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.640> it's<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.240> bit<00:01:57.689> I

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
tweaks well currently it's it's a bit I

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.139 
tweaks well currently it's it's a bit I
don't<00:01:58.829> want<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.009> say<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.310> difficult<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.030> it

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
don't want to say it's difficult but it

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.420 
don't want to say it's difficult but it
does<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> higher<00:02:01.229> learning<00:02:01.590> curve<00:02:02.040> than<00:02:02.399> a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
does have a higher learning curve than a

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.609 
does have a higher learning curve than a
lot<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.909> absent<00:02:03.390> weeks<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.259> what<00:02:04.439> I'm<00:02:04.590> thinking

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
lot of absent weeks so what I'm thinking

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.160 
lot of absent weeks so what I'm thinking
is<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.850> creator's<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> package<00:02:06.750> backup

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
is that the creator's a package backup

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.070 
is that the creator's a package backup
or<00:02:07.290> any<00:02:07.439> other<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:08.129> know<00:02:08.160> jailbreak

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
or any other you know jailbreak

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.050 
or any other you know jailbreak
developer<00:02:10.080> they<00:02:10.619> could<00:02:10.860> actually<00:02:11.099> create<00:02:11.670> a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
developer they could actually create a

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.840 
developer they could actually create a
tweak<00:02:12.930> or<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.260> nap

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
tweak or a nap

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.840 
tweak or a nap
that<00:02:14.330> utilizes<00:02:15.260> iCloud<00:02:15.740> so<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.310> can<00:02:16.610> backup

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
that utilizes iCloud so you can backup

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.400 
that utilizes iCloud so you can backup
all<00:02:17.180> your<00:02:17.240> jailbreak<00:02:17.870> apps<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.350> tweaks

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
all your jailbreak apps and tweaks

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.070 
all your jailbreak apps and tweaks
directly<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.370> iCloud<00:02:19.820> so<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.810> right<00:02:21.020> there

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
directly to iCloud so that right there

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.710 
directly to iCloud so that right there
the<00:02:21.500> fact<00:02:21.710> that<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:21.920> cloud<00:02:22.280> is<00:02:22.640> baked<00:02:23.090> into<00:02:23.300> iOS

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
the fact that I cloud is baked into iOS

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.140 
the fact that I cloud is baked into iOS
5<00:02:24.050> that<00:02:24.320> right<00:02:24.440> there<00:02:24.620> is<00:02:24.650> an<00:02:24.800> opportunity<00:02:25.370> to

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
5 that right there is an opportunity to

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.050 
5 that right there is an opportunity to
make<00:02:26.990> new<00:02:27.020> things<00:02:27.610> with<00:02:28.610> regard<00:02:29.000> to

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
make new things with regard to

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.210 
make new things with regard to
jailbreaking<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.990> jailbreak<00:02:30.710> tweaks<00:02:30.980> and

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
jailbreaking and jailbreak tweaks and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.070 
jailbreaking and jailbreak tweaks and
apps<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.730> things<00:02:31.820> like<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:32.300> I<00:02:32.690> just

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
apps and things like that so I just

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.750 
apps and things like that so I just
think<00:02:33.260> that<00:02:33.440> Apple<00:02:33.860> they're<00:02:34.160> there<00:02:34.400> they're

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
think that Apple they're there they're

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.040 
think that Apple they're there they're
not<00:02:34.940> considering<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.510> fact<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.840> there's

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
not considering the fact that there's

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.200 
not considering the fact that there's
tons<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.740> new<00:02:36.920> features<00:02:37.130> in<00:02:37.460> iOS<00:02:37.550> 5<00:02:38.000> well

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
tons of new features in iOS 5 well

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.030 
tons of new features in iOS 5 well
that's<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.960> squaw<00:02:39.320> mean<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.800> there's<00:02:39.950> a

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
that's that squaw mean that there's a

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.770 
that's that squaw mean that there's a
ton<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.460> different<00:02:40.730> things<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.690> know

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
ton of different things that you know

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.000 
ton of different things that you know
people<00:02:41.810> are<00:02:42.230> going<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:42.440> want<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.710> do<00:02:42.830> with

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
people are going to want to do with

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.050 
people are going to want to do with
their<00:02:43.130> devices<00:02:43.430> that<00:02:43.730> they<00:02:43.850> otherwise

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
their devices that they otherwise

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.900 
their devices that they otherwise
couldn't<00:02:44.630> do<00:02:44.980> without<00:02:45.980> jailbreaking<00:02:46.700> their

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
couldn't do without jailbreaking their

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.390 
couldn't do without jailbreaking their
device<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:47.450> I'd<00:02:48.080> look<00:02:48.410> forward<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:48.920> what<00:02:49.190> the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
device so I'd look forward to what the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.860 
device so I'd look forward to what the
jailbreak<00:02:49.970> community<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.420> going<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.600> come<00:02:50.750> up

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
jailbreak community is going to come up

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.450 
jailbreak community is going to come up
with<00:02:51.050> what<00:02:51.380> are<00:02:51.530> some<00:02:51.740> of<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.920> tweaks<00:02:52.190> and

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
with what are some of the tweaks and

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.810 
with what are some of the tweaks and
things<00:02:53.000> that<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:53.510> want<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.440> see<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:54.860> iOS<00:02:55.190> 5<00:02:55.520> you

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
things that you want to see in iOS 5 you

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.220 
things that you want to see in iOS 5 you
know<00:02:55.910> maybe<00:02:56.180> some<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.540> new<00:02:56.720> features<00:02:56.750> in

know maybe some of the new features in

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.350 
know maybe some of the new features in
iOS<00:02:57.320> 5<00:02:57.770> like<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.280> notification<00:02:58.640> center<00:02:59.210> for

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
iOS 5 like a notification center for

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.730 
iOS 5 like a notification center for
instance<00:02:59.690> I<00:02:59.840> think<00:03:00.260> there's<00:03:00.410> going<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.620> be<00:03:00.650> a

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
instance I think there's going to be a

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.590 
instance I think there's going to be a
ton<00:03:01.160> of<00:03:01.190> different<00:03:01.550> things<00:03:01.910> we<00:03:02.090> already<00:03:02.360> see

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
ton of different things we already see

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.780 
ton of different things we already see
it<00:03:02.720> we<00:03:03.200> already<00:03:03.320> see<00:03:03.560> plenty<00:03:03.890> of<00:03:04.070> notification

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
it we already see plenty of notification

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.880 
it we already see plenty of notification
center<00:03:05.060> tweaks<00:03:05.630> right<00:03:06.080> now<00:03:06.260> for<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.740> beta

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
center tweaks right now for the beta

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.130 
center tweaks right now for the beta
versions<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.400> iOS<00:03:07.580> 5<00:03:08.000> but<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.600> just<00:03:08.840> think<00:03:09.050> that

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
versions of iOS 5 but I just think that

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.040 
versions of iOS 5 but I just think that
there's<00:03:09.620> gonna<00:03:09.770> be<00:03:09.920> even<00:03:10.190> more<00:03:10.460> and<00:03:11.050> it's

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
there's gonna be even more and it's

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.500 
there's gonna be even more and it's
going<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.260> be<00:03:12.350> exciting<00:03:12.650> once<00:03:13.130> iOS<00:03:13.640> 5<00:03:13.820> drops<00:03:14.150> I

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
going to be exciting once iOS 5 drops I

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.180 
going to be exciting once iOS 5 drops I
think<00:03:15.080> you're<00:03:15.230> going<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.440> see<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.650> lot<00:03:16.160> of

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
think you're going to see a lot of

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.580 
think you're going to see a lot of
different<00:03:16.730> innovative<00:03:17.570> jailbreak<00:03:18.110> apps<00:03:18.320> and

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
different innovative jailbreak apps and

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.830 
different innovative jailbreak apps and
tweaks<00:03:18.740> hit<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.550> pipeline<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.240> it's<00:03:20.690> not

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
tweaks hit the pipeline and it's not

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.690 
tweaks hit the pipeline and it's not
going<00:03:20.990> to<00:03:21.080> slow<00:03:21.230> down<00:03:21.380> at<00:03:21.590> all<00:03:21.740> I<00:03:21.980> think<00:03:22.550> if

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
going to slow down at all I think if

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.940 
going to slow down at all I think if
anything<00:03:23.320> jailbreaking<00:03:24.320> is<00:03:24.590> going<00:03:24.740> to<00:03:24.800> be

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
anything jailbreaking is going to be

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.000 
anything jailbreaking is going to be
even<00:03:25.910> more<00:03:26.240> popular<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:26.990> it<00:03:27.470> can<00:03:27.680> be<00:03:27.860> even

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010
