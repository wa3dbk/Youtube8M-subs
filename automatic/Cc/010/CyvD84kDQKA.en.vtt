where the two quarters my job it's not
too<00:00:24.420> bad<00:00:24.630> actually<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> lot<00:00:25.590> less<00:00:25.860> worse

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
too bad actually it's a lot less worse

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.909 
too bad actually it's a lot less worse
than<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.520> thought<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.820> was<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.919> that

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
than I thought it was going to be that

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.920 
than I thought it was going to be that
bit<00:00:29.070> up<00:00:29.160> there's<00:00:29.369> currently<00:00:29.759> drying<00:00:30.090> because

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
bit up there's currently drying because

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.870 
bit up there's currently drying because
you<00:00:31.349> need<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.680> wait<00:00:31.860> it<00:00:32.040> down<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.460> stop<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.790> from

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
you need to wait it down to stop it from

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.540 
you need to wait it down to stop it from
warping<00:00:33.200> however<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.980> basic<00:00:35.370> layout

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
warping however this is the basic layout

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.210 
warping however this is the basic layout
so<00:00:36.030> far<00:00:36.390> we've<00:00:36.630> got<00:00:36.750> like<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> lot<00:00:37.649> forward

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
so far we've got like a lot forward

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
trench leading all the way across a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.380 
trench leading all the way across a
bunker<00:00:44.970> gear<00:00:45.000> which<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.690> cleared<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.290> position

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
bunker gear which is cleared in position

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.330 
bunker gear which is cleared in position
and<00:00:48.390> when<00:00:48.840> L<00:00:48.960> said<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.290> got<00:00:49.470> supposed<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.160> put<00:00:50.310> a

and when L said we got supposed to put a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.360 
and when L said we got supposed to put a
bit<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.670> scenery<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.300> here<00:00:51.540> and<00:00:51.780> there<00:00:51.990> and

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
bit of scenery in here and there and

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.420 
bit of scenery in here and there and
we've<00:00:53.370> done<00:00:53.490> a<00:00:53.550> lot<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.970> the<00:00:54.510> planking<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
we've done a lot of the planking for the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.830 
we've done a lot of the planking for the
trench<00:00:56.700> system<00:00:57.240> here<00:00:58.730> this<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.750> be

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
trench system here this is going to be

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.720 
trench system here this is going to be
somewhat<00:01:01.170> broken<00:01:01.410> up<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.340> will<00:01:02.489> have

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
somewhat broken up but you will have

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.149 
somewhat broken up but you will have
some<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.120> texture<00:01:03.690> here<00:01:03.900> and<00:01:04.170> then<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.920> have

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
some like texture here and then you have

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.249 
some like texture here and then you have
a<00:01:05.930> ramp<00:01:06.930> here<00:01:08.030> which<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.450> allow<00:01:09.720> people<00:01:10.020> to

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
a ramp here which is to allow people to

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.310 
a ramp here which is to allow people to
come<00:01:10.530> from<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.979> fortress<00:01:11.869> driving<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:13.020> here

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
come from the fortress driving up here

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.670 
come from the fortress driving up here
and<00:01:14.600> drive<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.780> onto<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.200> bit<00:01:16.440> I'm<00:01:16.560> gonna

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
and drive up onto this bit I'm gonna

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.590 
and drive up onto this bit I'm gonna
have<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.860> little<00:01:17.010> breach<00:01:17.370> sort<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.120> farrier

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
have a little breach sort of a farrier

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.770 
have a little breach sort of a farrier
over<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> top<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:20.240> trench<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.540> that

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
over the top of that trench so that

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.469 
over the top of that trench so that
should<00:01:21.960> look<00:01:22.080> pretty<00:01:22.380> cool<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:24.030> once<00:01:24.300> that's

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
should look pretty cool and once that's

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.260 
should look pretty cool and once that's
dried<00:01:24.900> I'll<00:01:25.890> do<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> rest<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> planking

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
dried I'll do the rest of the planking

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.780 
dried I'll do the rest of the planking
and<00:01:27.450> then<00:01:27.930> that'll<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.290> being<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.070> cool<00:01:29.340> flesh

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
and then that'll be being the cool flesh

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.760 
and then that'll be being the cool flesh
popped<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.510> so<00:01:30.810> then<00:01:30.990> what<00:01:31.170> I'll<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.500> do

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
popped on so then what I'll have to do

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.170 
popped on so then what I'll have to do
then<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.979> think<00:01:35.190> most<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.790> planking

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
then is you think most of the planking

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.420 
then is you think most of the planking
yeah<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.840> then<00:01:37.260> I'm<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.620> to<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.190> raise

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
yeah and then I'm going to have to raise

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.980 
yeah and then I'm going to have to raise
these<00:01:38.760> areas<00:01:39.240> because<00:01:39.330> I<00:01:39.540> said<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
these areas because I said in the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.750 
these areas because I said in the
previous<00:01:40.200> video<00:01:40.560> they're<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.040> little<00:01:41.280> bit<00:01:41.549> too

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
previous video they're a little bit too

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.480 
previous video they're a little bit too
low<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.150> my<00:01:42.299> liking<00:01:42.510> but<00:01:43.070> I'll<00:01:44.070> get<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> main

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
low for my liking but I'll get the main

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.420 
low for my liking but I'll get the main
flesh<00:01:44.820> done<00:01:45.119> first<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.900> then<00:01:46.710> I'll<00:01:46.979> look<00:01:47.220> at

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
flesh done first and then I'll look at

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.460 
flesh done first and then I'll look at
how<00:01:47.610> I'm<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.119> actually<00:01:48.659> raise<00:01:49.140> those
