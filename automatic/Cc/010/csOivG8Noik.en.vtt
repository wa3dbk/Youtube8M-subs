00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
an SMD camera folding type it's

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.860 
an SMD camera folding type it's
basically<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.949> flash<00:00:32.250> bar<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.149> unlike

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
it the great thing about this with SMD

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.910 
it the great thing about this with SMD
is<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.759> can<00:01:59.880> use<00:02:00.030> 600<00:02:00.659> type<00:02:01.590> film

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
is that you can use 600 type film

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.770 
is that you can use 600 type film
without<00:02:02.520> an<00:02:02.700> ND<00:02:02.939> filter<00:02:02.969> if<00:02:03.390> you're<00:02:03.479> using<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
without an ND filter if you're using the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.429 
without an ND filter if you're using the
flash<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.350> will<00:02:04.469> compensate<00:02:05.009> for<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:06.439> that

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
flash it will compensate for that that

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.400 
flash it will compensate for that that
thing<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.270> ya<00:02:09.270> don't<00:02:09.539> have<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.750> have<00:02:10.110> an<00:02:10.229> ND

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
thing and ya don't have to have an ND

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.559 
thing and ya don't have to have an ND
filter<00:02:10.440> if<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.950> if<00:02:11.940> you're<00:02:12.120> gonna<00:02:12.239> use<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
filter if you if you're gonna use the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.460 
filter if you if you're gonna use the
flash

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470

it<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.870> nothing<00:02:24.870> much<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.770> it's<00:02:26.460> black<00:02:27.170> this

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
it is nothing much to it it's black this

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.140 
it is nothing much to it it's black this
is<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.860> contact<00:02:29.160> point<00:02:29.430> for<00:02:29.520> where<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.940> stick

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
is the contact point for where you stick

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.810 
is the contact point for where you stick
it<00:02:30.240> into<00:02:30.360> your<00:02:30.510> camera<00:02:31.970> in<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.060> back<00:02:34.820> again

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
it into your camera in the back again

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.630 
it into your camera in the back again
just<00:02:36.510> really<00:02:36.780> simple<00:02:37.170> what<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.190> need<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.460> know

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
just really simple what you need to know

just really simple what you need to know
is<00:02:38.790> just<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:41.280> settings<00:02:41.550> on<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.850> back

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
is just the the settings on the back

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.810 
is just the the settings on the back
here<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.810> on/off<00:02:43.140> switch<00:02:43.200> so

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
here this is the on/off switch so

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.590 
here this is the on/off switch so
there's<00:02:44.820> half<00:02:45.090> power

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
there's half power

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.630 
there's half power
that's<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.870> semicircle<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.800> there's<00:02:47.430> full

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
that's a semicircle and there's full

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.540 
that's a semicircle and there's full
power<00:02:47.820> so<00:02:48.770> depending<00:02:49.770> on<00:02:49.860> where<00:02:50.070> your<00:02:50.190> subject

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
power so depending on where your subject

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.940 
power so depending on where your subject
is<00:02:50.790> how<00:02:51.000> far<00:02:51.210> from<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.870> what<00:02:52.560> film<00:02:52.800> you

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
is how far from you and what film you

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.270 
is how far from you and what film you
use<00:02:53.160> you're<00:02:53.340> going<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.520> use<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:54.770> either<00:02:55.770> full

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
use you're going to use a either full

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.170 
use you're going to use a either full
power<00:02:56.490> half<00:02:56.850> power<00:02:58.670> right<00:02:59.670> underneath<00:02:59.880> there

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
power half power right underneath there

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.950 
power half power right underneath there
this<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:02.760> firing<00:03:03.150> button<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.720> test

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
this is the the firing button to test

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.590 
this is the the firing button to test
fire<00:03:04.230> your<00:03:04.500> flash<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:07.770> then<00:03:08.130> two<00:03:09.030> LEDs<00:03:09.450> here

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
fire your flash and then two LEDs here

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.300 
fire your flash and then two LEDs here
the<00:03:09.990> green<00:03:10.200> LED<00:03:10.590> means<00:03:11.460> it's<00:03:11.790> charging<00:03:13.310> blue

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
the green LED means it's charging blue

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.610 
the green LED means it's charging blue
means<00:03:14.880> it's<00:03:15.060> ready<00:03:15.210> to<00:03:15.300> fire<00:03:15.540> when<00:03:16.500> it's

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
means it's ready to fire when it's

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.940 
means it's ready to fire when it's
flashing<00:03:16.800> green<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.520> means<00:03:18.680> you're<00:03:19.680> running

flashing green it means you're running

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.290 
flashing green it means you're running
low<00:03:20.220> on<00:03:20.250> battery<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:20.790> switch<00:03:21.060> out<00:03:21.209> the

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
low on battery so switch out the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.170 
low on battery so switch out the
batteries<00:03:21.600> it<00:03:22.470> uses<00:03:22.800> two<00:03:22.980> triple<00:03:23.250> a's<00:03:23.340> on<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
batteries it uses two triple a's on the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.870 
batteries it uses two triple a's on the
side<00:03:24.590> here<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.739> if<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:26.010> can<00:03:26.100> see<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.550> there<00:03:26.790> it

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
side here and if you can see it there it

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.750 
side here and if you can see it there it
is<00:03:26.970> pop<00:03:27.390> that<00:03:27.600> off<00:03:27.830> from<00:03:28.830> two<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.400> triple<00:03:29.670> a's

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
is pop that off from two to triple a's

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.760 
is pop that off from two to triple a's
and<00:03:29.910> you're<00:03:30.060> good<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.270> go<00:03:30.300> so<00:03:30.720> if<00:03:31.530> we<00:03:31.650> press

this<00:03:32.280> thing<00:03:32.640> here<00:03:32.910> they'll<00:03:33.450> fire

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
this thing here they'll fire

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.090 
this thing here they'll fire
so<00:03:34.320> that's<00:03:34.470> fire<00:03:34.680> oh<00:03:36.620> that's<00:03:37.620> pretty<00:03:37.770> bright

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
so that's fire oh that's pretty bright

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.800 
so that's fire oh that's pretty bright
okay<00:03:39.080> so<00:03:40.670> yeah<00:03:41.670> really<00:03:41.820> nice<00:03:42.090> simple<00:03:42.510> it's

okay so yeah really nice simple it's

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.630 
okay so yeah really nice simple it's
pocketable<00:03:43.440> nice<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.100> small<00:03:44.280> that's<00:03:44.489> why<00:03:44.550> I

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
pocketable nice and small that's why I

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.640 
pocketable nice and small that's why I
like<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.820> so<00:03:45.180> let's<00:03:45.720> see<00:03:45.989> how<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:46.200> fits<00:03:46.320> on<00:03:46.470> to

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
like it so let's see how it fits on to

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.540 
like it so let's see how it fits on to
in<00:03:46.709> sx-70<00:03:48.260> so<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.350> just<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:49.620> happens<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.130> have<00:03:50.160> an

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
in sx-70 so it just so happens I have an

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.440 
in sx-70 so it just so happens I have an
access<00:03:50.970> 70<00:03:51.570> there<00:03:52.040> so<00:03:53.040> let's<00:03:53.160> fold<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.489> up<00:03:56.450> okay

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
access 70 there so let's fold it up okay

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.259 
access 70 there so let's fold it up okay
so<00:03:58.320> sx-70<00:03:59.070> you<00:03:59.130> should<00:03:59.370> already<00:03:59.519> know<00:03:59.640> what

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
so sx-70 you should already know what

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.759 
so sx-70 you should already know what
this<00:04:00.390> camera<00:04:00.750> looks<00:04:00.930> like<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.380> on<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.590> top

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
this camera looks like and on the top

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.199 
this camera looks like and on the top
part<00:04:02.010> there's<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.280> little<00:04:02.459> black<00:04:02.610> strip<00:04:03.000> here

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
part there's a little black strip here

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.830 
part there's a little black strip here
this<00:04:04.140> is<00:04:04.320> where<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.680> flash<00:04:05.519> attaches<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:06.780> I'm

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
this is where the flash attaches so I'm

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.060 
this is where the flash attaches so I'm
just<00:04:06.959> gonna<00:04:07.050> stick<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.320> on<00:04:07.410> there<00:04:07.560> look

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
just gonna stick it on there look

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.620 
just gonna stick it on there look
 green<00:04:08.760> means<00:04:09.150> they<00:04:09.239> change<00:04:09.510> the

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
 green means they change the

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.370 
 green means they change the
battery<00:04:09.900> I'm<00:04:10.709> lazy

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
battery I'm lazy

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.410 
battery I'm lazy
before<00:04:13.380> what<00:04:13.739> looks<00:04:14.370> like<00:04:14.519> Tripoli's<00:04:15.300> you

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
before what looks like Tripoli's you

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.979 
before what looks like Tripoli's you
should<00:04:15.600> get<00:04:15.720> like<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:16.430> lease<00:04:17.780> should<00:04:18.780> get<00:04:18.900> like

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
should get like a lease should get like

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.200 
should get like a lease should get like
at<00:04:19.320> least<00:04:19.500> 10<00:04:19.980> to<00:04:20.519> 15<00:04:20.930> shots<00:04:21.930> off<00:04:22.880> maybe<00:04:23.880> more

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
at least 10 to 15 shots off maybe more

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.809 
at least 10 to 15 shots off maybe more
or<00:04:24.479> less

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:25.819 
or less

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.589 
or less
but<00:04:26.389> around<00:04:26.599> there<00:04:27.759> definitely<00:04:28.759> is<00:04:29.120> not<00:04:29.360> gonna

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
but around there definitely is not gonna

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.390 
but around there definitely is not gonna
flash<00:04:30.530> takes<00:04:30.740> a<00:04:30.800> lot<00:04:30.889> batteries<00:04:31.189> so<00:04:31.280> you're

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
flash takes a lot batteries so you're

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.800 
flash takes a lot batteries so you're
not<00:04:31.490> going<00:04:31.610> to<00:04:31.699> be<00:04:31.759> getting<00:04:31.909> tons<00:04:32.270> of<00:04:32.449> use<00:04:32.659> out

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
not going to be getting tons of use out

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.020 
not going to be getting tons of use out
of<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:33.139> battery<00:04:33.800> but<00:04:33.949> least<00:04:34.189> it's<00:04:34.310> it's<00:04:34.849> a

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
of it battery but least it's it's a

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.770 
of it battery but least it's it's a
reusable<00:04:35.620> unlike<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.710> old<00:04:36.860> ones<00:04:37.069> so<00:04:37.689> this<00:04:38.689> is
