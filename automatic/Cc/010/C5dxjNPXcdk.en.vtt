00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
checked little busters actually which

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.960 
checked little busters actually which
we've<00:00:19.020> actually<00:00:19.199> never<00:00:19.699> well<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:20.820> haven't

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
we've actually never well we haven't

we've actually never well we haven't
opened<00:00:21.270> for<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> long<00:00:21.630> time<00:00:22.039> so<00:00:23.039> it's<00:00:23.070> got<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
opened for a long time so it's got the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.080 
opened for a long time so it's got the
the<00:00:24.060> evolution<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.810> squirtle<00:00:25.680> they're<00:00:26.160> all

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
the evolution of squirtle they're all

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.670 
the evolution of squirtle they're all
the<00:00:27.300> best<00:00:27.480> voice<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.960> evolution<00:00:28.439> until

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the best voice and evolution until

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.950 
the best voice and evolution until
territory<00:00:29.099> Busta<00:00:29.369> listen<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.699> their<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.240> so

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
territory Busta listen to their and so

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.590 
territory Busta listen to their and so
will<00:00:31.320> alternate<00:00:31.769> between<00:00:31.800> them<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.189> guess<00:00:32.600> we

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
will alternate between them I guess we

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.680 
will alternate between them I guess we
have<00:00:33.750> open<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.110> before<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:35.329> once<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.480> think

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
have open this before just once I think

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.470 
have open this before just once I think
I<00:00:36.960> can't<00:00:37.440> really<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.890> other<00:00:38.010> one<00:00:38.129> there

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
I can't really that the other one there

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.910 
I can't really that the other one there
yeah<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:39.780> been<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.960> while<00:00:40.170> still<00:00:40.440> open<00:00:40.710> call

there<00:00:46.320> from<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.620> unleashed<00:00:47.010> set<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
there from the unleashed set and the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.150 
there from the unleashed set and the
blastoise<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.780> an<00:00:48.899> exclusive<00:00:49.260> charlotta

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
blastoise is an exclusive charlotta

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.080

version<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.649> think<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.090> rare

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
version of the the the I think the rare

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.910 
version of the the the I think the rare
I<00:00:54.360> think<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.930> rare<00:00:55.110> normally<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
I think it's a rare normally not a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.799 
I think it's a rare normally not a
holographic<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.760> Marshall<00:00:57.090> actually<00:00:57.750> is

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
holographic and Marshall actually is

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.150 
holographic and Marshall actually is
probably<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.079> lot<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.289> effort<00:00:58.590> I've<00:00:58.770> got<00:00:58.920> number

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
probably a lot of effort I've got number

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.430 
probably a lot of effort I've got number
in<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> while<00:00:59.820> as<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.600> tell<00:01:00.660> alright<00:01:01.230> so
