I use insulin to get his numbers down
close<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.380> normal<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.190> protocol<00:02:48.580> they<00:02:48.700> call

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
close to normal and a protocol they call

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.120 
close to normal and a protocol they call
tight<00:02:49.090> regulation<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.050> then<00:02:50.680> once<00:02:50.890> his

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
tight regulation and then once his

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.580 
tight regulation and then once his
numbers<00:02:51.520> got<00:02:51.910> down<00:02:52.150> near<00:02:52.450> normal<00:02:52.780> several

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
numbers got down near normal several

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.890 
numbers got down near normal several
times<00:02:53.860> his<00:02:54.340> pancreas<00:02:54.610> took<00:02:54.970> over<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.630> now
