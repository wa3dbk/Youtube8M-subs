00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
in such a small car so there's massive

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.550 
in such a small car so there's massive
tool<00:02:56.000> where<00:02:56.269> doesn't<00:02:56.599> it<00:02:56.629> for<00:02:56.750> about<00:02:56.840> 2,000

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
tool where doesn't it for about 2,000

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.500 
tool where doesn't it for about 2,000
ribs<00:02:57.709> right<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.159> way<00:02:58.310> out<00:02:58.430> yeah<00:02:58.730> yeah<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.329> so

ribs right the way out yeah yeah and so

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.330 
ribs right the way out yeah yeah and so
you<00:02:59.569> can<00:02:59.750> feel<00:02:59.989> that<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:00.379> a<00:03:00.620> actually<00:03:01.069> really

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
you can feel that and a actually really

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.459

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:03.469 
hear the turbo so much but until you

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:05.259 
hear the turbo so much but until you
think<00:03:04.040> Jensen<00:03:04.280> said<00:03:04.549> in<00:03:04.609> the<00:03:04.670> video<00:03:04.819> there's<00:03:05.180> a

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
think Jensen said in the video there's a

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.789 
think Jensen said in the video there's a
little<00:03:05.390> bit<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.569> a<00:03:05.689> while<00:03:05.900> they<00:03:06.379> forget<00:03:06.650> the

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
little bit of a while they forget the

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.649 
little bit of a while they forget the
power<00:03:07.069> in<00:03:07.250> a<00:03:07.280> salon<00:03:07.579> southern<00:03:08.269> rep<00:03:08.450> but<00:03:08.599> i

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
power in a salon southern rep but i

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.569 
power in a salon southern rep but i
think<00:03:08.840> it's<00:03:08.930> about<00:03:09.049> six<00:03:09.349> to<00:03:09.500> seven<00:03:09.530> it's<00:03:10.370> got

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
think it's about six to seven it's got

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.140 
think it's about six to seven it's got
this<00:03:10.700> Paul<00:03:11.230> sounds<00:03:12.230> yeah

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
it sounds pretty cool in a new partner

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.649 
it sounds pretty cool in a new partner

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
then the twin-clutch gearbox the paddle

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.089 
then the twin-clutch gearbox the paddle
shift<00:03:16.959> had<00:03:17.170> in<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.349> lap<00:03:17.560> work<00:03:17.799> with<00:03:18.010> the

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
shift had in the lap work with the

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.670 
shift had in the lap work with the
operation<00:03:18.579> smooth<00:03:18.909> as<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.180> expected

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
operation smooth as you expected

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.860 
operation smooth as you expected
and<00:03:20.799> smooth<00:03:21.040> one<00:03:21.819> cai<00:03:22.000> luong<00:03:22.390> cars<00:03:22.689> a<00:03:22.750> little

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
and smooth one cai luong cars a little

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.559 
and smooth one cai luong cars a little
bit<00:03:23.099> jayden<00:03:24.099> it's<00:03:24.370> not<00:03:24.519> smooth<00:03:24.730> enough<00:03:24.760> so

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
bit jayden it's not smooth enough so

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.759 
bit jayden it's not smooth enough so
maybe<00:03:25.750> we<00:03:25.900> need<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.049> give<00:03:26.349> some<00:03:26.379> information

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
maybe we need to give some information

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.890 
maybe we need to give some information
back<00:03:27.189> to<00:03:27.219> the<00:03:27.340> how<00:03:28.060> was<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.390> field<00:03:28.659> to<00:03:28.870> the
