00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello to everything today i'm going to you 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.010
 present how to paint slabs 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.179
 straw on your nails so I realized 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.219
 this is the stop on the basis of a 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.049
 holographic gradient with varnishes 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.049
 space for the brand in cosmetics 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.619
 so the first step for this is where 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.809
 it's the degrade to the fly so I 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.000
 laid a silver varnish in base and I 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.190
 will take a strip of blue polish and 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.420
 a basic silver varnish strip on 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.370
 a plastic support 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.170
 I will take the color with a 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.970
 foam and I'm going to apply this 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.860
 color by tapping on my name that I have 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.839
 previously surrounded by masking tape 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:56.589
 to avoid having too much cleaning at 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:58.089
 do I go now to the 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.470
 making flowers so I'm going 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.570
 take a drop of acrylic paint 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.119
 white is there work with my 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.590
 fine brush here to a ruble of time and to 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.930
 the end I'm going to fine- tune my brush 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.580
 to be able to make a trace be fine and 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.020
 delicate 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.670
 I realize now the petals of the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.040
 farms so these are petals in 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.420
 almond to his ends so I'm going in 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.280
 make different sizes 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.049
 all around the same center and you 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.420
 will see later that I will realize 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.900
 finer petals between the most 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.900
 large petals 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.259
 for its petals you see that 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.450
 I only use the tip of my 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.310
 brush and some flowers where we go 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.259
 use the brush body crushing 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.729
 plus his brush but here I will put 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.710
 can do it because the petals are 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.429
 very fine and skin that movement 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.429
 be mastered 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.430
 I 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.420
 I will then realize a small breeding 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.430
 in the corner so I realize a one 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.659
 petal quite long then I sell to do 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.640
 on each side so it's a little bit 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.200
 the principle of flora in the corner and 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.580
 then I will add some smaller ones 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.580
 petals between these long petals 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.150
 I will then take some paint 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.830
 golden acrylic and using a 2 thing 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.270
 to the eil I'm going to realize two everything 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.270
 peas in the center of my flora 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.180
 1 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.910
 as for all nail art and in 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.230
 especially what we do with 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.790
 acrylic paint it is very important 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.680
 to apply a layer of top coat 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.660
 not to mention the slice of the nail for 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.300
 prevent water from seeping in and 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.500
 as well as other nail art longer 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.240
