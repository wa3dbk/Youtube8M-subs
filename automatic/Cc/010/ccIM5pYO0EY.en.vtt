00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.260 
want to do is valve off the hot and cold
inlets<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.829> if<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:41.760> an<00:00:41.850> isolation

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270

valve on the mixed outlet that works out
really<00:00:44.070> well<00:00:44.160> too<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.149> then<00:00:45.750> once

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
really well too for you and then once

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.690 
really well too for you and then once
you<00:00:46.079> get<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.289> valve<00:00:46.530> off<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.100> take

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
you get that valve off you can take

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.930 
you get that valve off you can take
apart<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.239> unions<00:00:48.950> that<00:00:49.950> connect<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.579> piping

apart the unions that connect the piping

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.560 
apart the unions that connect the piping
to<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.390> body<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> mixing<00:00:52.770> valve<00:00:56.480> once<00:00:57.480> you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
to the body of the mixing valve once you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.569 
to the body of the mixing valve once you
get<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.780> mixing<00:00:58.109> valve<00:00:58.289> body<00:00:58.770> out<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.070> there

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
get that mixing valve body out of there

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.510 
get that mixing valve body out of there
it<00:00:59.789> can<00:01:00.149> actually<00:01:00.359> be<00:01:00.570> soaked<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.829> vinegar

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
it can actually be soaked in a vinegar
