symbols the Japanese has panel lining as

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.979 
symbols the Japanese has panel lining as
you<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.770> see<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> claws<00:00:44.570> these<00:00:45.570> claws

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
you can see on the claws these claws

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.340

have<00:00:46.410> no<00:00:46.649> panel<00:00:47.160> lining<00:00:47.870> but<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.170> pan

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
have no panel lining but the pan

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.080 
have no panel lining but the pan
aligning<00:00:49.680> really<00:00:49.950> makes<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.280> stand<00:00:50.399> out<00:00:50.850> it

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
aligning really makes it stand out it

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.400 
aligning really makes it stand out it
also<00:00:51.239> has<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:52.020> slight<00:00:52.860> shine<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.199> that<00:00:55.199> they

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
also has a slight shine to it that they

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.200 
also has a slight shine to it that they
probably<00:00:55.739> go<00:00:56.010> over<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.730> keep<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.030> pan

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
probably go over it to keep the pan

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.410 
probably go over it to keep the pan
lining<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.870> or<00:00:58.109> something<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:59.420> it's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420

mobile<00:01:45.090> suit<00:01:45.270> has<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.350> double<00:01:46.710> joint<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.189> here

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
mobile suit has a double joint in here

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.380 
mobile suit has a double joint in here
so<00:01:48.140> this<00:01:49.140> one<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.530> joint<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.880> one's<00:01:51.210> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
so this one is a joint and this one's a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.520 
so this one is a joint and this one's a
joint<00:01:51.689> very<00:01:52.619> cool<00:01:52.860> cause<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.729> more

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
joint very cool cause it's more

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.260 
joint very cool cause it's more
flexibility<00:01:55.530> there<00:01:55.740> along<00:01:56.100> with<00:01:56.130> its<00:01:56.399> its<00:01:56.969> leg

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
flexibility there along with its its leg

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.940 
flexibility there along with its its leg
joints<00:01:58.880> it<00:01:59.880> has<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> model<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.649> go<00:02:01.770> all

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
joints it has a model I that can go all

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.440 
joints it has a model I that can go all
the<00:02:01.979> way<00:02:02.100> around<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.700> doesn't<00:02:03.000> actually<00:02:03.090> move

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the way around it doesn't actually move

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.840 
the way around it doesn't actually move
but<00:02:03.840> no<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.290> there<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.860> got<00:02:05.070> laser<00:02:05.399> built

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
but no it's there it's got laser built

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.650 
but no it's there it's got laser built
in<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:07.110> got<00:02:07.290> lasers<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.569> in<00:02:09.569> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
in here it's got lasers here and in the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.180 
in here it's got lasers here and in the
back<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.080> there's<00:02:10.229> no<00:02:10.319> super<00:02:10.679> fire<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.069> its

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
back so there's no super fire in its

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.220 
back so there's no super fire in its
front<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.670> its<00:02:12.330> backs<00:02:12.569> really<00:02:12.959> hard
