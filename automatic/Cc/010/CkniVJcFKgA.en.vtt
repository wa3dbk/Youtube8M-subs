going to answer that for you today see

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.790 
going to answer that for you today see
the<00:00:16.440> manufacturer<00:00:17.340> has<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> really<00:00:18.390> tough<00:00:18.630> job

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
designing the stock clutch and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.779 
designing the stock clutch and
calibrations<00:00:21.689> for<00:00:21.810> their<00:00:22.050> machines<00:00:22.670> it's<00:00:23.670> a

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
calibrations for their machines it's a

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.310 
calibrations for their machines it's a
tough<00:00:24.029> job<00:00:24.060> because<00:00:24.720> they<00:00:24.869> know<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.050> that

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
tough job because they know that that

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.710 
tough job because they know that that
machine<00:00:25.740> might<00:00:26.010> be<00:00:26.039> purchased<00:00:26.640> by<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> farmer

where<00:00:48.780> epi<00:00:49.140> comes<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:50.489> design<00:00:50.820> our<00:00:50.850> clutch

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
where epi comes in we design our clutch

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.209 
where epi comes in we design our clutch
gets<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.780> perform<00:00:51.930> really<00:00:52.469> well<00:00:52.620> under

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219

and<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:56.610> accommodate<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.719> most<00:00:57.930> common

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
and to accommodate the most common

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.680 
and to accommodate the most common
changes<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:58.949> make<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.309> our<00:00:59.340> machines<00:00:59.789> so

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
changes that we make to our machines so

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.049 
changes that we make to our machines so
let's<00:01:00.840> talk<00:01:00.989> about<00:01:01.199> some<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.590> those<00:01:01.680> changes

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
let's talk about some of those changes

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.369 
let's talk about some of those changes
ok<00:01:03.059> what's<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> number<00:01:03.750> one<00:01:03.780> thing<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.229> we

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
ok what's the number one thing that we

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.039 
ok what's the number one thing that we
all<00:01:04.589> change<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.100> our<00:01:05.220> machine<00:01:05.689> we<00:01:06.689> put<00:01:06.930> on

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
all change in our machine we put on

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.100 
all change in our machine we put on
larger<00:01:07.470> more<00:01:07.680> aggressive<00:01:07.770> tires<00:01:08.780> we<00:01:09.780> all<00:01:09.900> love

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
larger more aggressive tires we all love

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.190 
larger more aggressive tires we all love
them<00:01:10.260> save<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.830> our<00:01:10.950> money<00:01:11.540> we<00:01:12.540> bolt<00:01:12.869> them<00:01:13.049> on

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
them save up our money we bolt them on

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.990 
them save up our money we bolt them on
and<00:01:13.500> what<00:01:14.070> we've<00:01:14.220> done<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.670> we've<00:01:14.850> added

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and what we've done is we've added

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.060 
and what we've done is we've added
weight<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:16.200> we've<00:01:16.500> added<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.830> lot<00:01:17.009> of

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
weight and we've added a lot of

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.120 
weight and we've added a lot of
resistance<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.030> clutching<00:01:18.390> system<00:01:19.130> stop

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
resistance in the clutching system stop

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.710 
resistance in the clutching system stop
clutching<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.700> not<00:01:20.850> set<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.299> deal<00:01:21.659> with

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
clutching is not set up to deal with

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.320 
clutching is not set up to deal with
tires<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.340> end<00:01:23.490> result<00:01:23.700> is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
tires like this so the end result is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.030 
tires like this so the end result is
you're<00:01:24.720> going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.049> create<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.530> lot<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.710> belt

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you're going to create a lot of belt

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.819 
you're going to create a lot of belt
slip<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.360> equates<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.350> lot<00:01:28.680> of

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
slip and that equates to a lot of

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.649 
slip and that equates to a lot of
additional<00:01:29.040> heat<00:01:29.520> under<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.939> clutch<00:01:30.360> cover

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
additional heat under this clutch cover

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.539 
additional heat under this clutch cover
the<00:01:31.200> belt<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.710> our<00:01:31.799> clutches<00:01:32.009> are<00:01:32.280> running

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
the belt and our clutches are running

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.319 
the belt and our clutches are running
way<00:01:32.850> hotter<00:01:33.180> than<00:01:33.450> they're<00:01:33.659> supposed<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:35.329> how

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
way hotter than they're supposed to how

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.020 
way hotter than they're supposed to how
it<00:01:36.509> feels<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.229> us<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.590> we're<00:01:37.740> riding<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.909> may

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
it feels to us as we're riding is it may

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.300 
it feels to us as we're riding is it may
feel<00:01:39.210> kind<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.540> sluggish<00:01:40.100> especially<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.220> you

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
feel kind of sluggish especially if you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.929 
feel kind of sluggish especially if you
get<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.610> some<00:01:41.850> thick<00:01:42.570> deep<00:01:42.930> mud<00:01:43.700> it<00:01:44.700> isn't

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
get in some thick deep mud it isn't

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.460 
get in some thick deep mud it isn't
going<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.119> turn<00:01:45.299> these<00:01:45.540> tires<00:01:45.780> away<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.200> should

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
going to turn these tires away it should

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.039 
going to turn these tires away it should
they<00:01:47.189> may<00:01:47.340> not<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.180> belt<00:01:48.420> will<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.659> slipping

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
they may not the belt will be slipping

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.889 
they may not the belt will be slipping
too<00:01:49.229> much<00:01:49.970> ok<00:01:50.970> what's<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.240> number<00:01:51.479> 2<00:01:51.659> thing

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
too much ok what's the number 2 thing

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.560 
too much ok what's the number 2 thing
that<00:01:52.079> we<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.759> we<00:01:53.759> spend<00:01:54.000> letting<00:01:54.299> out<00:01:54.390> more

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
that we do we spend letting out more

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.679 
that we do we spend letting out more
power<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.439> lot<00:01:55.710> more<00:01:55.740> power<00:01:56.149> we<00:01:57.149> do<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.509> we

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
power and a lot more power we do that we

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.700
