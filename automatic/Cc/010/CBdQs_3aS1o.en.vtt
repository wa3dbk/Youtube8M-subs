00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
number is eight right now because they

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.639 
number is eight right now because they
did<00:00:36.510> get<00:00:36.630> cheated<00:00:36.930> from<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.290> Seahawks

did get cheated from the Seahawks
football<00:00:38.040> game<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.640> they're<00:00:38.760> also<00:00:38.969> losing

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
football game but they're also losing

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.150 
football game but they're also losing
games<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.020> they<00:00:40.140> normally<00:00:40.559> would<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:40.860> lose

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
games that they normally would not lose

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.700 
games that they normally would not lose
so<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:42.000> don't<00:00:42.329> know<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.750> offense<00:00:43.230> 27

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
so I don't know if it's the offense 27

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.619 
so I don't know if it's the offense 27
problems<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.399> other<00:00:44.489> than<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.760> defense<00:00:45.450> is

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
problems but other than that defense is

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.000 
problems but other than that defense is
giving<00:00:45.840> up<00:00:46.050> too<00:00:46.230> many<00:00:46.350> points<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.920> they're

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
giving up too many points and they're

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.430 
giving up too many points and they're
giving<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> an<00:00:48.300> alarming<00:00:49.050> rate<00:00:49.079> they're

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
giving it up to an alarming rate they're

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.319 
giving it up to an alarming rate they're
struggling<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.160> packers<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.700> last<00:00:51.000> year

pose too many threats to the Packers I

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.060 
pose too many threats to the Packers I
understand<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.260> they<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.590> potent

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
understand that they have a potent

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.010 
understand that they have a potent
offense<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.610> green<00:01:11.820> bay<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.479> they<00:01:12.600> also<00:01:12.810> have

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
offense in green bay but they also have

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.990 
offense in green bay but they also have
a<00:01:13.080> potent<00:01:13.530> offense<00:01:13.860> down<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.280> Houston<00:01:14.640> Texans

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
a potent offense down in Houston Texans

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.899 
a potent offense down in Houston Texans
the<00:01:15.229> Texans<00:01:16.229> also<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> defense<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.580> match

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the Texans also have a defense to match

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.940 
the Texans also have a defense to match
their<00:01:18.210> potent<00:01:18.509> offense<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.229> they<00:01:19.470> can<00:01:19.650> score

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
their potent offense that they can score

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.740 
their potent offense that they can score
a<00:01:20.009> high<00:01:20.189> volume<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.790> they<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.240> also<00:01:21.450> play

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
a high volume and they can also play

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.109 
a high volume and they can also play
defense<00:01:22.200> at<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> high<00:01:22.500> volume<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.759> think<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
defense at a high volume and I think the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.429 
defense at a high volume and I think the
difference<00:01:24.479> that's<00:01:24.630> gonna<00:01:24.840> come<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.320> this

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
difference that's gonna come in this

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.289 
difference that's gonna come in this
football<00:01:25.830> game<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.220> going<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.430> be<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.820> Texans

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
football game is going to be the Texans

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.810 
football game is going to be the Texans
special<00:01:28.110> teams<00:01:28.320> ability<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.979> think<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.670> if

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
special teams ability I think that if

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.700
