exist in this in this world they're

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.890 
exist in this in this world they're
they're<00:00:13.349> kind<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.679> like<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.860> cross<00:00:14.219> between

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
week of just tripping balls and he'll

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.819 
week of just tripping balls and he'll
have<00:00:51.270> yellow<00:00:51.570> eyes<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.170> then<00:00:52.649> he'll<00:00:52.800> have

like cat-like reflexes and so they

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.470 
like cat-like reflexes and so they
trained<00:00:55.260> him<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.620> monster<00:00:55.860> slayer<00:00:56.480> but

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
trained him to be a monster slayer but

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.939 
trained him to be a monster slayer but
it's<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.960> monster<00:00:58.140> slayer<00:00:58.530> witches

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
it's not just a monster slayer witches

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.279 
it's not just a monster slayer witches
