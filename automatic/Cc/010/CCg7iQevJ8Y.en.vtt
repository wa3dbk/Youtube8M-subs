many<00:03:38.180> seconds<00:03:38.599> lose<00:03:38.959> eight<00:03:39.260> seconds<00:03:39.709> eight

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
many seconds lose eight seconds eight

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.589 
many seconds lose eight seconds eight
seconds<00:03:40.669> seconds<00:03:41.090> are<00:03:41.209> people<00:03:41.450> yourself

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599

riding<00:03:42.019> pretty<00:03:42.950> rarely<00:03:43.370> does<00:03:43.519> a<00:03:43.549> lot<00:03:43.669> of

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
riding pretty rarely does a lot of

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.670 
riding pretty rarely does a lot of
damage<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.269> boat<00:03:44.450> oh<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:44.989> does<00:03:45.139> I'm<00:03:45.440> to<00:03:45.560> do

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
damage to the boat oh it does I'm to do

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.319 
damage to the boat oh it does I'm to do
that<00:03:45.859> oh<00:03:45.980> you're<00:03:46.190> not<00:03:46.280> designed<00:03:46.700> but<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:47.090> can

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
that oh you're not designed but it can

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.899 
that oh you're not designed but it can
withstand<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.989> right<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:48.500> see<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.400> that's<00:03:49.610> and

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
withstand it right I see and that's and

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.140 
withstand it right I see and that's and
that's<00:03:50.060> probably<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.390> reasons<00:03:50.689> for<00:03:50.750> the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
that's probably the reasons for the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.539 
that's probably the reasons for the
the<00:03:51.239> seatbelts<00:03:51.780> right<00:03:51.959> absolutely<00:03:52.709> and<00:03:53.069> these

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
the seatbelts right absolutely and these

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.410 
the seatbelts right absolutely and these
also<00:03:53.730> go<00:03:53.939> out<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.750> know<00:03:54.870> we<00:03:55.200> can<00:03:55.319> go<00:03:55.470> out<00:03:55.590> and

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
also go out you know we can go out and

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.809 
also go out you know we can go out and
run<00:03:57.420> case<00:03:57.629> as<00:03:57.840> far<00:03:58.019> as<00:03:58.079> 50<00:03:58.349> miles<00:03:58.530> offshore

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
run case as far as 50 miles offshore

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.250 
run case as far as 50 miles offshore
also<00:03:59.819> so<00:04:00.180> this<00:04:00.269> gives<00:04:00.540> some<00:04:00.629> comfort<00:04:01.019> for<00:04:01.170> the

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
look how they're sturdy that there's

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.860 
look how they're sturdy that there's
this<00:05:16.410> is<00:05:16.620> a<00:05:16.860> hundred<00:05:17.490> percent<00:05:17.630> aluminum<00:05:18.630> there

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
this is a hundred percent aluminum there

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.710 
this is a hundred percent aluminum there
is<00:05:18.900> no<00:05:19.260> wood<00:05:19.740> in<00:05:20.010> here<00:05:20.370> at<00:05:20.520> all<00:05:20.640> yeah<00:05:21.030> this<00:05:21.480> was

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
is no wood in here at all yeah this was

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.090 
is no wood in here at all yeah this was
this<00:05:21.870> is<00:05:21.930> one<00:05:22.230> of<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.350> first<00:05:22.500> Coast<00:05:22.890> Guard

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
this is one of the first Coast Guard

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.540 
this is one of the first Coast Guard
boats<00:05:23.280> we<00:05:23.490> make<00:05:24.530> gonna<00:05:25.530> last<00:05:25.800> forever

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
boats we make gonna last forever

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.300 
boats we make gonna last forever
so<00:05:27.090> now<00:05:27.240> lightweight<00:05:27.990> probably<00:05:28.590> makes<00:05:28.740> it<00:05:28.890> how

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
so now lightweight probably makes it how

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.310 
so now lightweight probably makes it how
fast<00:05:29.610> what<00:05:30.000> is<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.180> cruising<00:05:30.750> speed<00:05:30.780> or<00:05:31.170> what

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
fast what is the cruising speed or what

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.630 
fast what is the cruising speed or what
only<00:05:31.500> six<00:05:31.770> knots<00:05:32.010> cruising<00:05:35.990> but<00:05:36.990> they're<00:05:37.170> very

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
only six knots cruising but they're very

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.590 
only six knots cruising but they're very
buoyant<00:05:38.640> doesn't<00:05:39.000> make<00:05:39.090> for<00:05:39.210> a<00:05:39.300> very<00:05:39.330> nice

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
buoyant doesn't make for a very nice

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.720 
buoyant doesn't make for a very nice
ride<00:05:40.160> all<00:05:41.160> right<00:05:41.720> all<00:05:42.720> the<00:05:42.840> way<00:05:42.930> back<00:05:43.730> all
