middle so yeah I think I'm going to keep
it<00:00:45.800> there<00:00:46.870> I'm<00:00:47.870> going<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:48.170> just<00:00:50.620> use<00:00:51.620> a<00:00:51.650> hair

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
it there I'm going to just use a hair

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.120 
it there I'm going to just use a hair
band<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.640> tie<00:00:53.330> this<00:00:53.440> part<00:00:54.440> of<00:00:54.560> the<00:00:54.650> hair<00:00:54.920> away

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
band to tie this part of the hair away

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.070 
band to tie this part of the hair away
so<00:00:55.460> it<00:00:55.820> doesn't<00:00:55.880> interfere<00:00:56.180> with<00:00:56.570> my<00:00:56.750> flat
