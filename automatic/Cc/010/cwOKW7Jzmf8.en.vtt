matter if it's aluminum or steel the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.030 
matter if it's aluminum or steel the
process<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> same<00:00:36.809> well<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.739> first<00:00:37.980> step

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
process is the same well the first step

so if you want it to weld it as well
you're<00:05:28.199> more<00:05:28.590> than<00:05:28.740> capable<00:05:28.949> of<00:05:29.370> doing<00:05:29.669> it

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
you're more than capable of doing it

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.240 
you're more than capable of doing it
with<00:05:29.940> it<00:05:30.090> for<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.110> extra<00:05:31.440> 10<00:05:31.650> seconds<00:05:32.160> it

with it for the extra 10 seconds it

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.070 
with it for the extra 10 seconds it
takes<00:05:32.490> to<00:05:32.639> go<00:05:32.759> over<00:05:32.970> it<00:05:33.060> twice<00:05:33.300> and<00:05:33.720> just<00:05:33.810> make

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
takes to go over it twice and just make

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.260 
takes to go over it twice and just make
sure<00:05:34.110> that<00:05:34.500> this<00:05:34.680> thing<00:05:34.889> doesn't<00:05:35.270> especially

more bead around the door frame edge
we're<00:06:12.610> just<00:06:12.789> going<00:06:12.910> to<00:06:12.940> make<00:06:13.120> sure<00:06:13.360> that<00:06:13.539> we

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
we're just going to make sure that we

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.629 
we're just going to make sure that we
got<00:06:13.840> a<00:06:14.580> nice<00:06:15.580> bead<00:06:15.910> along<00:06:16.180> here<00:06:16.599> just<00:06:17.610> so<00:06:18.610> we

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
got a nice bead along here just so we

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:23.930 
got a nice bead along here just so we
have<00:06:18.759> some<00:06:19.120> clamping<00:06:19.569> pressure

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:31.070

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
all right we're ready to go so now we've

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.980 
all right we're ready to go so now we've
got<00:06:31.290> some<00:06:31.500> time<00:06:31.740> but<00:06:32.160> you<00:06:32.280> can't<00:06:32.930> apply<00:06:33.930> it

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
got some time but you can't apply it

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.780 
got some time but you can't apply it
twice<00:06:34.320> you<00:06:34.650> can<00:06:34.800> move<00:06:35.070> it<00:06:35.220> around<00:06:35.340> but<00:06:35.700> you

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
twice you can move it around but you

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.260 
twice you can move it around but you
can't<00:06:36.060> lift<00:06:36.420> it<00:06:36.600> and<00:06:36.750> break<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.140> bond<00:06:38.270> so

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
can't lift it and break the bond so

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:53.030 
can't lift it and break the bond so
we're<00:06:39.390> gonna<00:06:39.480> grab<00:06:39.750> the<00:06:39.960> panel<00:06:51.950> we're<00:06:52.950> gonna

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
we're gonna grab the panel we're gonna

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.730 
we're gonna grab the panel we're gonna
just<00:06:53.250> put<00:06:53.460> the<00:06:53.550> clothes<00:06:54.000> in<00:06:54.380> we'll<00:06:55.380> use<00:06:55.560> that

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
just put the clothes in we'll use that

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.370 
just put the clothes in we'll use that
to<00:06:55.800> hold<00:06:56.220> it<00:06:56.430> initially<00:06:57.030> once<00:06:57.720> all<00:06:57.870> the<00:06:57.990> clecos

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
to hold it initially once all the clecos

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:05.790 
clamp but it's got glass beads in it

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:19.320 
clamp but it's got glass beads in it
that<00:07:06.000> keep<00:07:06.180> it<00:07:06.300> at<00:07:06.420> the<00:07:06.510> correct<00:07:06.840> distance

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.330 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.210 

what<00:07:19.930> you're<00:07:20.020> gonna<00:07:20.110> do<00:07:20.349> is<00:07:20.470> wipe<00:07:20.740> off<00:07:20.979> the

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:21.220 
what you're gonna do is wipe off the

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.939 
what you're gonna do is wipe off the
excess<00:07:21.669> because<00:07:22.360> the<00:07:22.599> excess<00:07:23.080> will<00:07:23.289> never<00:07:23.650> get

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:23.949 
excess because the excess will never get

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:26.909 
excess because the excess will never get
hard<00:07:24.400> the<00:07:24.849> only<00:07:25.060> time<00:07:25.389> it<00:07:25.569> bonds<00:07:26.169> is<00:07:26.560> that<00:07:26.770> when

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 
hard the only time it bonds is that when

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:29.730 
hard the only time it bonds is that when
it's<00:07:27.039> between<00:07:27.490> two<00:07:27.870> pieces<00:07:28.870> of<00:07:29.110> metal<00:07:29.379> that

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:29.740 
it's between two pieces of metal that

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.920 
it's between two pieces of metal that
have<00:07:30.099> been<00:07:30.280> sanded<00:07:30.759> you<00:07:31.479> know<00:07:31.539> somewhere

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930 
have been sanded you know somewhere

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.520 
have been sanded you know somewhere
between<00:07:32.050> 30<00:07:32.650> and<00:07:32.770> 80<00:07:32.979> grit<00:07:33.900> so<00:07:34.900> if<00:07:35.020> the<00:07:35.139> edges

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:35.530 
between 30 and 80 grit so if the edges

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:41.100 
between 30 and 80 grit so if the edges
aren't<00:07:37.229> 100%<00:07:38.229> dry<00:07:39.129> after<00:07:39.759> you<00:07:40.689> know<00:07:40.810> a<00:07:40.840> couple

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.110 
aren't 100% dry after you know a couple

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.719 
aren't 100% dry after you know a couple
hours<00:07:41.500> then<00:07:41.740> don't<00:07:42.159> worry<00:07:42.340> about<00:07:42.460> it<00:07:42.699> just

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:42.729 
hours then don't worry about it just

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:45.209 
hours then don't worry about it just
wipe<00:07:43.090> off<00:07:43.300> the<00:07:43.509> excess<00:07:43.900> and<00:07:44.169> the<00:07:44.770> important

00:07:45.209 --> 00:07:45.219 
wipe off the excess and the important

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:46.740 
wipe off the excess and the important
part<00:07:45.490> is<00:07:45.580> in<00:07:45.729> between<00:07:45.849> the<00:07:46.180> two<00:07:46.210> pieces<00:07:46.569> of

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:46.750 
part is in between the two pieces of

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:53.230 
part is in between the two pieces of
metal<00:07:47.280> it's<00:07:48.280> rock<00:07:48.669> solid

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:53.240 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.570 

so<00:07:54.199> after<00:07:54.530> an<00:07:54.620> hour<00:07:54.710> and<00:07:54.889> a<00:07:54.919> half<00:07:55.100> you<00:07:55.250> can<00:07:55.370> take

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:55.580 
so after an hour and a half you can take

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.520 
so after an hour and a half you can take
off<00:07:55.759> the<00:07:55.789> clamps<00:07:56.330> after<00:07:56.690> eight<00:07:56.960> hours<00:07:56.990> it's

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:57.530 
off the clamps after eight hours it's

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.100 
off the clamps after eight hours it's
fully<00:07:57.770> cured<00:07:58.130> that's<00:07:58.729> best<00:07:59.180> practices<00:07:59.870> for

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:00.110 
fully cured that's best practices for

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.770 
fully cured that's best practices for
metal<00:08:00.380> bonding
