00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 do not 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.130
 I'm back from the fresh market 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.650
 guest that we are seeing in danger 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.690
 my regime jorge lang lang was manager 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.060
 general of pies paulista who has 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:22.250
 come here has provided a bit of everything 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:24.170
 so that I can not have a 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.760
 appetizer as a message that also 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.490
 roberto thank you very much for the invitation 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.830
 and here we are and as well development in 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.110
 this concept of empanada paulista that 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.790
 actually it has then forwards you 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.789
 immediate sao paulo with everything that 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.930
 implies and it seems to me that it enters into a 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:43.400
 item in which there is an offer 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.890
 decidedly in the local market but 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.610
 little offer I reiterate and still if in 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.860
 actually both my partner and I have 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.290
 had the opportunity to travel through 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.590
 X work motives that is 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:01.940
 familiarly to neighboring countries type 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.640
 argentina brasil chile uruguay paraguay 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:11.320
 the same bolivia in which the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.320
 empanadas are part of their of their 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.790
 his usual word and I would say of d 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.930
 of the important part of your choice 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.760
 culinary and without having the options that 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.650
 we have in the country ar 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.610
 and we have the wealth 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.490
 gastronomic and the dishes to get 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.670
 so good that they come from grandma 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.869
 for example I do not know if they happen to us with 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.869
 jaime sagan who is my partner 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.020
 develop this business because we saw 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.250
 an opportunity initially because the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.750
 empanada item here is not very 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.810
 development that we say or was not very 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.729
 developed and what normally exists 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.270
 in the market or existed in the market 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:04.330
 it was the famous meat pie of 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.930
 chicken but with very little filling much 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.690
 onion and raisins 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.290
 basically or take two meals 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.110
 basically with here in our case 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.900
 We said why not venture to a 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.459
 business we see a niche 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.340
 very important taking advantage of the boom that 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.560
 Is living 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:32.650
 in the country and in the world the gastronomy 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:35.140
 Peruvian and having so much variety of 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.270
 typical Peruvian dishes 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.370
 and of each Peruvian typical dish 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.810
 they put on ballad at the end that is a 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:47.540
 call is to fill something that is very 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:51.890
 nice nice for the audience 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.079
 in a dough if actually the pie 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.939
 It supports you plenty of room for 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.859
 gastronomic creativity and we are 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:00.709
 watching you website 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.090
 empanadas paulistas and the different 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.400
 flavors that follow them selected in 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.040
 Peruvian and international exact good 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.530
 One of the important points here is that 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.900
 with jaime we said that inside the 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.060
 opportunities we had necessarily 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.060
 to differentiate ourselves from the competition 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.579
 when we talk about the info of 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:28.140
 differentiate we touch for example the 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:31.079
 fill theme we our 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.969
 empanadas are totally stuffed to 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.750
 difference from those that existed 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:38.280
 traditionally not with inputs of 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.810
 first quality 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.910
 and to that we add 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.770
 the pairing with the sauces that is 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.250
 change the habit of customers 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:52.930
 regulars who ate them with onions and 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.660
 that added to the diversity of flavors of 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.590
 two that existed traditionally is a 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.560
 chicken meat we are offering between 12 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.400
 and 14 usually we are varying 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.300
 from time to time not and we have achieved 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.459
 change in a relatively short time 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:16.060
 the 80 percent that was sold before 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.820
 our offer between chicken and beef 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:23.139
 turn into 20 we have taken to 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:27.160
 convert the market or satisfaction 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:31.600
 of the client in diversifying the product 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:35.680
 and try different flavors and which 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.900
 are the main ones there are thousands what 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.270
 we are using right now 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:44.919
 they are mainly anticuchos boy 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:47.680
 northern 30 guayana chili 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.450
 now we are launching the black pudding 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.260
 which is basically the northern bloodshed 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.000
 we have the chicken that is the 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.880
 traditional corn with cheese 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.770
 in a small one not like that we can 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.010
 throw themselves so that I put example 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:07.360
 Well you can carapulcra could have 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:10.810
 also from that rice with chicken and the 2000 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.840
 and of quality what you can use the 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.639
 empanada like input finally of 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.600
 exhibition of our flavors and how 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.090
 well you say no 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.130
 Of course there are countries where the culture 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.110
 Argentina for example is much more 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.510
 frequent to get him a plate in the background 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.400
 only in reality but the 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.250
 variety is scarce 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.260
 exactly very reduction and as good 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.420
 are already with four stores not having 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.560
 local and two modes and that's a subject 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:42.740
 it's worth mentioning us 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.620
 we started in the year 2009 we constituted the 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.010
 company in May with a local san 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.010
 isidro 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.480
 we took a big step so 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.100
 We consider the key date for our 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.400
 Product in September of the second year 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.340
 because we wanted to democratize our 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.010
 product not even though I had a 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.170
 price or has a relatively price 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.260
 because everything is relatively relative 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.150
 high compared to traditional lot 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.330
 people told us we want them to be in 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:17.900
 this site and I pay them because their 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.060
 empanada is worth what you charge and 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:23.090
 final is a cattle and we went to the cone 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.880
 north and the response was immediate in 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.060
 this moment we have four local three 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:32.600
 of which are in the north elbow one 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.250
 in san isidro and the sale is very even and 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.160
 it's the same product with the same 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.970
 quality and price but now this year 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.550
 we plan to open between four and 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.870
 six additional dollars interesting not 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.130
 expand savings to the capital 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.740
 eventually because not inside the 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.740
 country also exactly initially in 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.520
 the center in the country's capital because 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.440
 There is so much to do 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.900
 and that's it 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.210
 step by step and the next would be you can 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.360
 go to the province of Jorge we are to go 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.250
 already before he comes first to wed 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.170
 then comes in a squad with samuel 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.970
 rivera and his war and so that nobody 

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.430
 take the empanadas and what better to stay 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.800
 here and we continue to see the 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.570
 empanadas paulistas and here as a team 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.910
 of production thank you Jorge for the 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.960
 status and success because thank you very much and 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.670
 thanks to you to reign has 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.020
 accompanied then I leave with honey and 

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.020
 empty points was ok
