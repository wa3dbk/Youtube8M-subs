00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
naive is actually one of the ones I

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.240 
naive is actually one of the ones I
don't<00:04:38.470> remember<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:40.590> let<00:04:41.590> me<00:04:41.620> look<00:04:41.860> at<00:04:41.979> up<00:04:42.099> real

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
don't remember so let me look at up real

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.210 
don't remember so let me look at up real
quick<00:04:42.490> that<00:04:42.820> looks<00:04:43.030> like<00:04:43.180> it's<00:04:43.389> going<00:04:43.630> to<00:04:43.690> be

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
quick that looks like it's going to be

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.740 
quick that looks like it's going to be
plus<00:04:45.240> speed-<00:04:46.240> special<00:04:46.870> defense<00:04:47.729> so<00:04:48.729> that<00:04:49.360> is

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
plus speed- special defense so that is

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.839 
plus speed- special defense so that is
pretty<00:04:50.650> interesting<00:04:51.070> I<00:04:51.430> think<00:04:51.490> that's

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
pretty interesting I think that's

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:55.260 
pretty interesting I think that's
actually<00:04:52.060> decent<00:04:52.919> spinarak<00:04:53.919> itself<00:04:54.460> has<00:04:54.789> a

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
actually decent spinarak itself has a

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.100 
actually decent spinarak itself has a
pretty<00:04:55.690> low<00:04:55.900> speed<00:04:56.259> actually<00:04:57.240> so<00:04:58.240> that<00:04:58.960> might

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
pretty low speed actually so that might

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.610 
pretty low speed actually so that might
not<00:04:59.139> be<00:04:59.259> the<00:04:59.380> best<00:04:59.710> nature<00:05:00.130> after<00:05:00.699> all<00:05:01.590> let<00:05:02.590> me

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
not be the best nature after all let me

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.469 
not be the best nature after all let me
look<00:05:02.830> up<00:05:02.979> ariados<00:05:03.460> di<00:05:03.669> ariados<00:05:04.090> is<00:05:04.240> really

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
look up ariados di ariados is really

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.149 
look up ariados di ariados is really
slow<00:05:04.690> so<00:05:04.720> that's<00:05:05.050> a<00:05:05.110> pretty<00:05:05.229> bad<00:05:05.409> nature<00:05:05.770> but

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
slow so that's a pretty bad nature but

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:09.029
