00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
to just teleport back here so let's go

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.389 
to just teleport back here so let's go
ahead<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.300> see<00:00:39.510> how<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.629> build<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> first

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
ahead and see how to build this so first

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.100 
ahead and see how to build this so first
things<00:00:41.670> first<00:00:41.760> you're<00:00:42.510> gonna<00:00:42.660> need<00:00:42.870> something

things first you're gonna need something

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.110 
things first you're gonna need something
set<00:00:43.440> up<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.920> you're<00:00:44.789> going<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.969> need<00:00:45.030> a

set up like this you're going to need a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.600 
set up like this you're going to need a
hopper<00:00:45.570> timer<00:00:45.780> with<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.260> item<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
hopper timer with one item in it to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.549 
hopper timer with one item in it to
comparator<00:00:48.149> command<00:00:48.629> block<00:00:48.870> then<00:00:49.320> another

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
comparator command block then another

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.170 
comparator command block then another
comparator<00:00:50.070> into<00:00:50.370> another<00:00:50.610> command<00:00:50.969> block

comparator into another command block

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.779 
comparator into another command block
and<00:00:51.360> then<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.770> off<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.550> first

and then in this off of this first

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.069 
and then in this off of this first
command<00:00:54.090> block<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.420> want<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.629> comparator

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
command block you want to comparator

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.689 
command block you want to comparator
into<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> repeater<00:00:55.739> into<00:00:56.100> another<00:00:56.340> command

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
into a repeater into another command

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.229 
into a repeater into another command
block<00:00:58.129> all<00:00:59.129> these<00:00:59.309> commands<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.969> I'm<00:01:00.090> gonna

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
block all these commands that I'm gonna

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.599 
block all these commands that I'm gonna
be<00:01:00.359> using<00:01:00.590> there's<00:01:01.590> gonna<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> link<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
be using there's gonna be a link to a

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.390 
be using there's gonna be a link to a
paste<00:01:02.940> bin<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:03.359> them<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.690> them<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:05.339> you

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
paste bin with them in them so if you

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.560 
paste bin with them in them so if you
don't<00:01:05.580> want<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> type<00:01:05.880> all<00:01:06.030> these<00:01:06.180> out<00:01:06.330> go

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
don't want to type all these out go

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.440 
don't want to type all these out go
ahead<00:01:06.689> copy<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.320> put<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.220> here<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.030> labeled

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
ahead copy it put in here and I labeled

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.969 
ahead copy it put in here and I labeled
which<00:01:09.659> commands<00:01:10.020> go<00:01:10.229> where<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:10.890> your

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
which commands go where just for your

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.609 
which commands go where just for your
convenience<00:01:11.600> but<00:01:12.600> first<00:01:12.840> things<00:01:13.020> first

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
convenience but first things first

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.440 
convenience but first things first
you're<00:01:13.890> gonna<00:01:14.010> want<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.400> copy<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.299> first

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
you're gonna want to copy the first

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.499 
you're gonna want to copy the first
command<00:01:16.040> which<00:01:17.040> let<00:01:17.610> me<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.000> ready<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
command which let me get that ready and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.260 
command which let me get that ready and
this<00:01:19.020> creates<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:20.490> scoreboard<00:01:21.000> objective

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
this creates the scoreboard objective

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.649 
this creates the scoreboard objective
for<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.070> I'm<00:01:23.610> calling<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.119> objective

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
for this so I'm calling this objective

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.710 
for this so I'm calling this objective
wood<00:01:25.110> uses<00:01:25.590> because<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.000> wooden<00:01:27.390> shovel

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
wood uses because it's a wooden shovel

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.170

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
ahead and add that so now this is fully

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.950 
ahead and add that so now this is fully
functional<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.210> course<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.540> already<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
functional of course I already have the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.480 
functional of course I already have the
commands<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.409> here<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.829> let's<00:01:50.009> go<00:01:50.130> ahead<00:01:50.220> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
commands in here so let's go ahead and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.749 
commands in here so let's go ahead and
look<00:01:50.850> at<00:01:50.970> these<00:01:51.119> commands<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.860> teleport

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
look at these commands so this teleport

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.450 
look at these commands so this teleport
to<00:01:53.850> anyone<00:01:54.149> who<00:01:54.329> has<00:01:54.509> what<00:01:54.869> uses<00:01:55.159> higher<00:01:56.159> than

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
to anyone who has what uses higher than

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.330

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
teleported to and then once this is

teleported to and then once this is
triggered<00:02:06.060> both<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.479> these<00:02:06.570> will<00:02:06.840> be

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
triggered both of these will be

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.559 
triggered both of these will be
triggered<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.700> this<00:02:08.700> one<00:02:08.879> will<00:02:09.060> go<00:02:09.149> off<00:02:09.330> first

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
triggered and this one will go off first

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.040 
triggered and this one will go off first
one<00:02:09.929> tick<00:02:10.459> before<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.670> one<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.660> just

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
one tick before that one and this just

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.700 
one tick before that one and this just
gives

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
gives

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.030 
gives
everyone<00:02:14.370> who<00:02:14.670> has<00:02:14.940> again<00:02:15.510> equal<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:16.040> or

greater than wood uses a wooden shovel

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.050 
greater than wood uses a wooden shovel
so<00:02:21.330> 269<00:02:21.780> again<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.680> will<00:02:22.830> break<00:02:23.100> after<00:02:23.880> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
so 269 again that will break after the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.930 
so 269 again that will break after the
first<00:02:24.300> use<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.320> then<00:02:26.040> display<00:02:26.400> name<00:02:26.610> is

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
first use and then display name is

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.850 
first use and then display name is
teleport<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.690> spawn<00:02:27.960> so<00:02:29.150> like<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.330> one<00:02:30.540> and

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
teleport to spawn so like this one and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.040 
teleport to spawn so like this one and
then<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.640> third<00:02:32.670> command<00:02:33.240> or<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.720> second

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
then the third command or the second

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.500 
then the third command or the second
command<00:02:34.290> we<00:02:34.410> have<00:02:34.590> here<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:35.010> going<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:36.150> be

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
command we have here is going to be

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.770 
command we have here is going to be
scoreboard<00:02:37.170> players<00:02:37.800> set<00:02:38.310> everyone<00:02:39.300> who<00:02:39.600> has

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
it greater than or equal to two it'll

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.920 
it greater than or equal to two it'll
set<00:02:43.980> them<00:02:44.070> back<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.430> one<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.510> then<00:02:45.660> they<00:02:45.780> won't

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
set them back to one so then they won't

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.660 
set them back to one so then they won't
keep<00:02:46.230> getting<00:02:46.500> teleported<00:02:46.770> over<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.520> over

lemon sunshine 42 their what uses two

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.830 
lemon sunshine 42 their what uses two
one<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:13.550> now<00:03:14.550> if<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.030> go<00:03:15.060> ahead<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.510> set<00:03:15.660> up<00:03:15.690> a

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
one and now if I go ahead and set up a

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.180 
one and now if I go ahead and set up a
pillar<00:03:16.080> go<00:03:16.590> into<00:03:16.830> game-mode<00:03:17.580> 0<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:19.410> if<00:03:20.070> I

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
pillar go into game-mode 0 and if I

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.810 
pillar go into game-mode 0 and if I
break<00:03:20.430> it

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
break it

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.270 
break it
I<00:03:21.140> get<00:03:22.140> teleported<00:03:22.380> onto<00:03:22.800> these<00:03:22.920> emerald

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
I get teleported onto these emerald

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.610 
I get teleported onto these emerald
blocks<00:03:23.550> so<00:03:24.360> as<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.540> can<00:03:24.660> see<00:03:24.720> this<00:03:24.960> works<00:03:25.260> and

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
blocks so as you can see this works and

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.310 
blocks so as you can see this works and
this<00:03:26.580> will<00:03:26.730> work<00:03:26.880> for<00:03:27.150> multiple<00:03:27.390> people<00:03:27.810> which

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
this will work for multiple people which

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.360 
this will work for multiple people which
is<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.470> main<00:03:28.710> use<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.900> if<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.370> for

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
is the main use of it and if you for

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.270 
is the main use of it and if you for
some<00:03:32.490> reason<00:03:32.550> have<00:03:33.530> everyone<00:03:34.530> opt<00:03:34.740> on<00:03:35.070> your

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
some reason have everyone opt on your

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.540 
some reason have everyone opt on your
server<00:03:36.530> if<00:03:37.530> it's<00:03:37.740> like<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.920> very<00:03:38.220> private

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
server if it's like a very private

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.580 
server if it's like a very private
server<00:03:38.880> with<00:03:39.120> just<00:03:39.300> a<00:03:39.360> couple<00:03:39.540> people<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.110> you

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
server with just a couple people and you

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.960 
server with just a couple people and you
want<00:03:40.770> this<00:03:40.890> still<00:03:41.160> maybe<00:03:41.520> you<00:03:41.640> want<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.850> add

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
want this still maybe you want to add

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.600 
want this still maybe you want to add
some<00:03:42.210> tell<00:03:42.480> Rock<00:03:42.780> commands<00:03:43.260> instead<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.430> this

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
some tell Rock commands instead of this

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.660 
some tell Rock commands instead of this
TP<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.480> then<00:03:46.290> they<00:03:46.740> can<00:03:46.920> maybe<00:03:47.100> choose<00:03:47.460> where

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
TP and then they can maybe choose where

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.430 
TP and then they can maybe choose where
they<00:03:47.790> want<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.000> teleport<00:03:48.270> if<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:49.050> want<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.320> go

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
they want to teleport if you want to go

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.900 
they want to teleport if you want to go
that<00:03:49.620> route<00:03:49.830> but<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.220> course<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.640> need<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:50.820> be

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
that route but of course you need to be

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.970 
that route but of course you need to be
opted<00:03:51.210> for<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.660> tell<00:03:51.840> raw<00:03:52.020> to<00:03:52.080> work<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.830> that's

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
opted for the tell raw to work so that's

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.410 
opted for the tell raw to work so that's
