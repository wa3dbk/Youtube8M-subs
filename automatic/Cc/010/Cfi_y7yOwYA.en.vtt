to<00:01:10.049> kind<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.229> do<00:01:10.320> an<00:01:10.409> upstroke<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.549> gonna

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
to kind of do an upstroke so it's gonna

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.999 
to kind of do an upstroke so it's gonna
sound<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.530> quick<00:01:16.770> note

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
sound like this so it's a quick note

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.310 
sound like this so it's a quick note
before<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.549> change<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.630> more<00:01:18.869> advanced

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
before you change and a more advanced

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.590 
before you change and a more advanced
technique<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.580> hit<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
technique is that you can hit on the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.899 
technique is that you can hit on the
beat<00:01:21.810> kind<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.860> muted<00:01:23.189> sound<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> guitar

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
beat kind of a muted sound on the guitar

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:34.690 
beat kind of a muted sound on the guitar
so<00:01:24.119> one<00:01:25.790> one<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:27.119> four<00:01:27.869> six

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.969 

and<00:01:35.390> that's<00:01:35.960> when<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:36.439> get<00:01:36.590> more<00:01:36.740> in<00:01:36.860> the

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
and that's when you get more in the

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.950 
and that's when you get more in the
groove<00:01:37.189> so<00:01:37.759> if<00:01:37.909> you<00:01:38.000> want<00:01:38.149> to<00:01:38.210> add<00:01:38.299> chords<00:01:38.780> to

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
groove so if you want to add chords to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.600 
groove so if you want to add chords to
this<00:01:39.140> then<00:01:39.890> what<00:01:40.039> you<00:01:40.130> would<00:01:40.219> do

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.630 
on the B string and 6th fret on the high
E<00:02:01.219> string<00:02:01.429> that's<00:02:02.329> a<00:02:02.569> minor<00:02:02.780> E<00:02:03.049> flat<00:02:03.829> minor

E string that's a minor E flat minor

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.779 
E string that's a minor E flat minor
chord<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:05.830> we<00:02:06.830> use<00:02:06.979> that<00:02:07.130> on<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.280> first<00:02:07.549> chord

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
chord so we use that on the first chord

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.800 
chord so we use that on the first chord
then<00:02:07.939> we<00:02:08.030> go<00:02:08.179> down<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.390> this<00:02:09.549> this<00:02:10.549> is<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:11.030> B<00:02:11.599> flat

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
then we go down to this this is a B flat

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.520 
then we go down to this this is a B flat
chord<00:02:12.349> and<00:02:12.530> we'll<00:02:12.650> do<00:02:12.769> use<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.950> B<00:02:13.190> flat<00:02:13.340> minor<00:02:14.530> so

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
chord and we'll do use a B flat minor so

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.360 
chord and we'll do use a B flat minor so
it's<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.709> barre<00:02:15.920> chord

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
it's a barre chord

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.650 
it's a barre chord
but<00:02:16.519> you<00:02:16.579> lift<00:02:16.790> up<00:02:16.940> your<00:02:17.090> middle<00:02:17.299> finger<00:02:17.540> this

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
but you lift up your middle finger this

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.150 
but you lift up your middle finger this
time<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.110> it's<00:02:18.260> 6th<00:02:18.829> fret<00:02:19.069> 8th<00:02:20.000> fret<00:02:20.079> 8th<00:02:21.079> fret

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
time so it's 6th fret 8th fret 8th fret

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.319 
time so it's 6th fret 8th fret 8th fret
sixth<00:02:22.160> fret<00:02:22.190> 6<00:02:22.819> 6<00:02:23.540> 5<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.000> just<00:02:26.150> go<00:02:26.299> in

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
sixth fret 6 6 5 and you just go in

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:35.589 
sixth fret 6 6 5 and you just go in
between<00:02:26.690> each<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:34.489> I'm<00:02:34.730> kind<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.180> strumming

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
between each and I'm kind of strumming

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.360 
between each and I'm kind of strumming
on<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.780> chord<00:02:36.110> when<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.769> would<00:02:36.890> hit<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.160> beat

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
on the chord when you would hit the beat

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.599 
on the chord when you would hit the beat
or<00:02:37.760> mute<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.599> these<00:02:38.720> are<00:02:38.870> all<00:02:39.609> little

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
or mute it so these are all little

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.150 
or mute it so these are all little
techniques<00:02:41.109> you<00:02:42.109> make<00:02:42.319> it<00:02:42.470> more<00:02:42.680> intermediate

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
techniques you make it more intermediate

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.580 
techniques you make it more intermediate
but<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:44.000> bassline<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:44.600> real<00:02:44.900> simple<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:48.230> then

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
but the bassline is real simple and then

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.890 
but the bassline is real simple and then
let's<00:02:48.829> move<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.280> cool<00:02:49.459> string<00:02:49.790> part<00:02:50.030> it

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
let's move to the cool string part it

00:02:50.900 --> 00:03:02.410 
let's move to the cool string part it
sounds<00:02:51.200> like<00:02:51.290> this

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.730 

so<00:03:03.420> we're<00:03:03.570> starting<00:03:03.660> here<00:03:03.930> at<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.320> 6th<00:03:04.590> fret

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
so we're starting here at the 6th fret

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.740 
so we're starting here at the 6th fret
of<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.920> high<00:03:04.980> E<00:03:07.280> then<00:03:08.280> 9th<00:03:09.120> fret<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
of the high E then 9th fret of the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.060 
of the high E then 9th fret of the
b-string<00:03:10.580> you<00:03:11.580> can<00:03:11.700> hit<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:11.940> twice<00:03:12.320> and<00:03:13.320> the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
b-string you can hit that twice and the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.290 
b-string you can hit that twice and the
second<00:03:14.400> time<00:03:14.430> you're<00:03:14.640> going<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.820> do<00:03:14.880> pull<00:03:15.150> off

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
second time you're going to do pull off

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.290 
second time you're going to do pull off
on<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.660> 7th<00:03:15.990> fret<00:03:16.850> so<00:03:17.850> let's<00:03:18.090> put<00:03:18.210> that

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
on the 7th fret so let's put that

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.890 
on the 7th fret so let's put that
together<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:24.180> then<00:03:24.450> you're<00:03:24.600> just<00:03:24.690> going<00:03:24.840> to

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
together and then you're just going to

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.700 
together and then you're just going to
land<00:03:25.110> on<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.290> 8th<00:03:25.530> fret<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.490> g<00:03:26.820> string<00:03:27.710> hit

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
land on the 8th fret of the g string hit

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.130 
land on the 8th fret of the g string hit
then<00:03:28.860> twice<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.660> then<00:03:30.660> you're<00:03:30.780> gonna<00:03:30.900> walk

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
then twice and then you're gonna walk

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.370 
then twice and then you're gonna walk
back<00:03:31.380> up<00:03:31.650> on<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:32.280> 6th<00:03:32.700> fret<00:03:33.110> of<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.170> g<00:03:34.350> string

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
back up on the 6th fret of the g string

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.130 
back up on the 6th fret of the g string
8th<00:03:35.160> fret<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:36.480> g<00:03:36.690> string<00:03:38.090> 7th<00:03:39.090> fret<00:03:39.150> B

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
8th fret of the g string 7th fret B

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.390 
8th fret of the g string 7th fret B
string<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.800> 9th<00:03:41.760> fret<00:03:42.290> of<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.350> B<00:03:43.590> string<00:03:43.620> back

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
string and 9th fret of the B string back

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:56.990 
string and 9th fret of the B string back
up<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:45.020> 6<00:03:46.020> fret<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:46.440> all<00:03:46.590> together<00:03:46.680> is

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.550 

so<00:03:58.000> keep<00:03:58.690> doing<00:03:58.960> that<00:03:59.050> and<00:03:59.290> then<00:03:59.380> more

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
so keep doing that and then more

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.600 
so keep doing that and then more
advanced<00:03:59.950> technique<00:04:00.280> as<00:04:00.400> you<00:04:00.550> can<00:04:00.700> go<00:04:00.820> you<00:04:02.610> can

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
advanced technique as you can go you can

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:13.590 
advanced technique as you can go you can
kind<00:04:04.060> of<00:04:04.120> do<00:04:09.600> or<00:04:10.600> you<00:04:10.840> could<00:04:10.960> just<00:04:11.110> go<00:04:12.510> but<00:04:13.510> if

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
kind of do or you could just go but if

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.910 
kind of do or you could just go but if
you<00:04:13.690> want<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:13.870> add<00:04:13.960> a<00:04:13.990> little<00:04:14.140> bluesy<00:04:14.560> feel<00:04:14.590> you

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
you want to add a little bluesy feel you

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.800 
you want to add a little bluesy feel you
can<00:04:15.040> start<00:04:15.250> on<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.400> tenth<00:04:15.610> fret<00:04:18.720> instead<00:04:19.720> of

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
can start on the tenth fret instead of

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.120 
can start on the tenth fret instead of
hitting<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.079> ninth<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.440> can<00:04:20.590> kind<00:04:20.859> of<00:04:20.920> go<00:04:21.100> on

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
hitting the ninth you can kind of go on

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.520 
hitting the ninth you can kind of go on
the<00:04:21.280> tenth<00:04:21.459> fret<00:04:21.640> and<00:04:22.030> slide<00:04:22.390> on<00:04:22.540> down<00:04:22.660> but

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
the tenth fret and slide on down but

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.880 
the tenth fret and slide on down but
that<00:04:23.710> is<00:04:23.920> the<00:04:24.190> high<00:04:24.490> string<00:04:25.390> part<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:25.990> that

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
that is the high string part and that

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.980 
that is the high string part and that
plays<00:04:27.490> over<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.790> bass<00:04:28.000> line<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:30.990> that's

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
plays over the bass line and that's

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.050 
plays over the bass line and that's
basically<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.980> whole<00:04:33.190> song<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.700> repeats

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
basically the whole song and repeats

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.750 
basically the whole song and repeats
over<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.690> over<00:04:34.930> again<00:04:35.380> so<00:04:35.770> good<00:04:36.400> luck<00:04:36.550> guys
