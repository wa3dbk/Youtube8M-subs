00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:05.779
 do not 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.790
 Today we are going to show you how to get out 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.010
 party to your lips 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.440
 We will make two makeups in this 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.170
 very fast area I think that what is 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.180
 can do at home a nude and then one 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.160
 it's a lot in trend this season a 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:27.730
 raspberry color let's see how 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:30.340
 we do to make the effect nude or 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.769
 missing a profiler light tone skin tone 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.920
 tone makeup and then in duration a 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:38.430
 lip gloss or a neutral color or 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.269
 well a pink but very soft tone 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.269
 we start with the profiler 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.220
 marking all the outer contour of 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.220
 your lip 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.059
 ah 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.540
 ah 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.140
 once we have outlined all our 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.089
 outline let's fill the entire lip 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.810
 the lip of the same color that will do 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.450
 that with the passage of time we do not have 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.270
 inequalities when they leave us labial 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.729
 with the passing of the hours once 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.790
 we have applied the profiler we take a 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.390
 natural lip gloss killa ge 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.780
 and we directly apply the brightness over 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.780
 the lip 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.150
 the second look that we are going to propose 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.840
 is a very trendy look a lip in 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.910
 raspberry pink color and a profiler 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.590
 also to the game to combine with the 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.330
 clothes of the season you will see what 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.890
 fast and you are going to see how easy you are going to 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.820
 be able to do at home we will begin 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.820
 profiling the lip 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.370
 first marking the angles of the lip 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.120
 so that they remain symmetrical and the 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.120
 bottom part 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.980
 once they have marked up and down 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.980
 we started from the corner 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.460
 until joining the little piquito we have 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.640
 marked and with the other side exactly 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.640
 the same 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.690
 Ideally, apply the lipstick with 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.210
 a brush 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.870
 you will see that it is distributed with greater 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.430
 ease 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.430
 you will get longer duration 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.570
 and also more tone 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.420
 we take with the help of the brush because more 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.220
 amount of pigment 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.480
 we mark the angle that previously 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.480
 we mark with the profiler 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:54.260
 and we take it to the corner as 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.910
 You see the two lip tricks that you 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.550
 we have taught today are super simple 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.830
 I hope you dare and play with the 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.830
 colors see you in the next trick
