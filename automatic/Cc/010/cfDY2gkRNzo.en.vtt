00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.890 
don't think but um let's jump right in
alright<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:29.820> when<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.240> comes<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.630> training

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
alright so when it comes to training

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.030 
alright so when it comes to training
your<00:00:31.170> forearms<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:32.700> grip<00:00:33.600> has<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.380> lot<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.620> do

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
your forearms a grip has a lot to do

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.569 
your forearms a grip has a lot to do
with<00:00:35.070> it

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
with it

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.900 
with it
alright<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:36.570> also<00:00:36.899> whenever<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:38.309> are<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
alright but also whenever we are in a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.170 
alright but also whenever we are in a
pronated<00:00:39.420> position<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.980> are<00:00:41.180> going

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
pronated position and we are going

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.080 
pronated position and we are going
against<00:00:42.719> resistance<00:00:43.219> we<00:00:44.219> are<00:00:44.460> going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.879> put<00:00:45.059> a

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
against resistance we are going to put a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.270 
against resistance we are going to put a
lot<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.450> tension<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.200> upper<00:00:46.559> forearm

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
lot of tension on the upper forearm

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.970 
lot of tension on the upper forearm
okay<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.320> two<00:00:49.320> things<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.710> need<00:00:49.860> to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
okay so two things you need to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.660 
okay so two things you need to
understand<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.469> handle<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.340> lot

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
understand is one we can handle a lot

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.240 
understand is one we can handle a lot
heavier<00:00:54.239> weight<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> supinated<00:00:55.949> grip

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
heavier weight with a supinated grip

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.979 
heavier weight with a supinated grip
when<00:00:56.789> we're<00:00:56.969> curling<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.809> why<00:00:57.930> you

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
when we're curling and this is why you

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.400 
when we're curling and this is why you
can<00:00:58.460> supinated<00:00:59.460> curl<00:01:00.149> more<00:01:00.780> weight<00:01:01.050> than<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
can supinated curl more weight than you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.780 
can supinated curl more weight than you
can<00:01:01.680> reverse<00:01:02.219> curl<00:01:02.640> right<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:04.189> second<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.580> can

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
can reverse curl right and second we can

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.609 
can reverse curl right and second we can
handle<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.510> lot<00:01:06.840> more<00:01:07.110> weight<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
handle a lot more weight on the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.130 
handle a lot more weight on the
eccentric<00:01:08.490> portion<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.299> negative<00:01:09.540> than

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
eccentric portion or the negative than

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.100 
eccentric portion or the negative than
we<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.070> concentric<00:01:11.820> all<00:01:12.450> right<00:01:12.780> so

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
we can on the concentric all right so

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.830 
we can on the concentric all right so
here<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.189> how<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.490> are<00:01:14.820> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.210> build<00:01:15.390> your

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
here is how you are going to build your

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.240 
here is how you are going to build your
biceps<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.619> well<00:01:16.830> as<00:01:17.100> train<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.390> upper<00:01:18.750> form

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
biceps as well as train the upper form

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.950 
biceps as well as train the upper form
pretty<00:01:20.250> effectively<00:01:20.820> are<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.540> going<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.780> take

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
pretty effectively are you going to take

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.899 
pretty effectively are you going to take
a<00:01:22.170> weight<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.830> moderate<00:01:23.400> weight<00:01:23.580> something

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
a weight a moderate weight something

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.060 
a weight a moderate weight something
that<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.540> typically<00:01:25.229> use<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
that you can typically use on a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.580 
that you can typically use on a
supinated<00:01:26.790> curl<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.509> you're<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.320> start

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
supinated curl and you're going to start

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.859 
supinated curl and you're going to start
off<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:29.340> regular<00:01:29.700> curl<00:01:30.000> right<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:30.840> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
off with a regular curl right with a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.980 
off with a regular curl right with a
supinated<00:01:31.320> position<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.400> when<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.479> bring<00:01:33.780> it

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
supinated position and when you bring it

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.300 
supinated position and when you bring it
up<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:35.369> fully<00:01:35.700> contract<00:01:36.360> before<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.560> go

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
up and you fully contract before you go

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.760 
up and you fully contract before you go
ahead<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.390> perform<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> eccentric<00:01:40.560> and

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
ahead and and perform the eccentric and

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.770 
ahead and and perform the eccentric and
come<00:01:40.979> down<00:01:41.250> what<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.820> want<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.509> is

come down what I want you to do is

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.240 
come down what I want you to do is
rotate<00:01:43.200> into<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:44.640> pronated<00:01:45.450> position<00:01:46.009> right<00:01:47.009> so

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
rotate into a pronated position right so

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.730 
rotate into a pronated position right so
your<00:01:47.399> palms<00:01:47.610> facing<00:01:48.000> down<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.869> bring<00:01:49.560> it

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
your palms facing down now and bring it

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.480 
your palms facing down now and bring it
down<00:01:50.210> that<00:01:51.210> way<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.229> once<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.829> reach<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
down that way and once you reach the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.179 
down that way and once you reach the
bottom<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.119> you're<00:01:54.750> completely<00:01:55.560> straight

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
bottom and you're completely straight

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.069 
bottom and you're completely straight
then<00:01:57.000> supinate<00:01:57.719> again<00:01:58.280> bring<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.310> up<00:01:59.840> at<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
then supinate again bring it up at the

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.450 
then supinate again bring it up at the
top<00:02:01.320> at<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> contraction<00:02:02.570> pronate<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.460> bring

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
top at the contraction pronate and bring

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.660 
top at the contraction pronate and bring
it<00:02:05.610> down<00:02:05.820> again<00:02:05.850> now<00:02:06.829> not<00:02:07.829> only<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.399> going

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
it down again now not only is this going

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
it down again now not only is this going
to<00:02:08.879> involve<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.509> lot<00:02:09.869> more

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
to involve a lot more

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.470 
to involve a lot more
of<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.590> forearms<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.430> allow<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.240> use<00:02:13.330> a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
of the forearms and allow you to use a

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.660 
of the forearms and allow you to use a
heavier<00:02:14.140> weight<00:02:14.350> than<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.740> would<00:02:14.950> with<00:02:15.400> a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
heavier weight than you would with a

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.690 
heavier weight than you would with a
reverse<00:02:16.210> curl<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:17.500> also<00:02:17.950> going<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.340> perform

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
reverse curl it is also going to perform

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.610 
reverse curl it is also going to perform
one<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.150> main<00:02:19.360> functions<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.350> form
