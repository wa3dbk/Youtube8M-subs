brought it back in three years it was

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.830 
brought it back in three years it was
four<00:03:47.530> but<00:03:48.070> it<00:03:48.220> started<00:03:48.730> this<00:03:48.970> game<00:03:49.210> I<00:03:49.630> think

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
four but it started this game I think

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.950 
four but it started this game I think
was<00:03:50.080> introduced<00:03:51.120> we<00:03:52.120> can<00:03:52.300> always<00:03:52.630> think<00:03:52.810> of

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
was introduced we can always think of

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.590 
was introduced we can always think of
new<00:03:53.080> stuff<00:03:56.520> so<00:03:57.520> basically<00:03:57.850> we<00:03:58.120> want<00:03:58.360> to<00:03:58.450> go

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
new stuff so basically we want to go

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.320 
new stuff so basically we want to go
first<00:03:59.200> because<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.310> have<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.520> best<00:04:00.730> odds

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
first because you have the best odds

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.510 
first because you have the best odds
I<00:04:01.480> have<00:04:02.350> strategy<00:04:02.950> we'll<00:04:03.130> see<00:04:03.280> if<00:04:03.400> it

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
I have strategy we'll see if it

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.270 
I have strategy we'll see if it
backfires<00:04:03.700> where<00:04:04.390> if<00:04:04.840> somebody<00:04:05.200> clicks<00:04:05.650> one<00:04:05.950> I

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
backfires where if somebody clicks one I

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.340 
backfires where if somebody clicks one I
never<00:04:06.700> do<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.090> next<00:04:07.330> one<00:04:07.480> over<00:04:07.630> and<00:04:07.900> I<00:04:08.020> always

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
never do the next one over and I always

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:17.520 
never do the next one over and I always
do<00:04:08.530> like<00:04:08.709> then<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.400> second<00:04:09.820> one<00:04:10.360> over<00:04:10.390> so<00:04:16.530> see

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
do like then the second one over so see

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.690 
do like then the second one over so see
strategy<00:04:18.340> works

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
strategy works

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.789 
strategy works
Ritchie<00:04:19.090> I<00:04:19.390> would<00:04:19.720> suggest<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:20.320> get<00:04:20.440> a<00:04:20.500> silver

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
Ritchie I would suggest you get a silver

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.100 
Ritchie I would suggest you get a silver
one<00:04:21.040> and<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.370> was<00:04:21.489> approve<00:04:21.910> of<00:04:22.060> my<00:04:22.210> strategy

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.980 

see<00:04:26.110> it's<00:04:26.620> other<00:04:26.800> words<00:04:27.130> I<00:04:27.340> really<00:04:28.330> think<00:04:28.750> that

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
see it's other words I really think that

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.210 
see it's other words I really think that
there<00:04:29.350> might<00:04:29.530> be<00:04:29.560> something<00:04:29.919> to<00:04:30.040> that

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
there might be something to that

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.340 
there might be something to that
strategy<00:04:30.520> as<00:04:31.030> I've<00:04:31.240> used<00:04:31.600> it<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.020> it<00:04:32.140> always

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
strategy as I've used it and it always

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.370 
strategy as I've used it and it always
works<00:04:32.770> watch

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.740 

so<00:04:35.770> like<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.520> said<00:04:36.580> my<00:04:36.790> strategy<00:04:37.419> to<00:04:37.540> win<00:04:37.570> this

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
so like I said my strategy to win this

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.950 
so like I said my strategy to win this
game<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:38.020> I've<00:04:38.140> never<00:04:38.200> told<00:04:38.380> anybody<00:04:38.650> this<00:04:38.830> is

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
game and I've never told anybody this is

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.930 
game and I've never told anybody this is
