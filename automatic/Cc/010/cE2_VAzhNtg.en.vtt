involves activating the EGR valve with
the<00:00:46.020> factory<00:00:46.560> scan<00:00:46.800> tool<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.760> problem<00:00:48.180> is

the factory scan tool the problem is
that<00:00:48.510> most<00:00:48.660> technicians<00:00:49.290> do<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.980> the

what now after looking through the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.910 
what now after looking through the
repairs<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.790> identify<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:58.200> have<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.380> 98%

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
repairs on identify we have a 98%

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.730 
repairs on identify we have a 98%
probability<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.390> EGR<00:01:00.840> valve<00:01:01.170> needs<00:01:01.470> to<00:01:01.650> be

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740 
probability the EGR valve needs to be

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.950 
probability the EGR valve needs to be
replaced<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.970> it<00:01:03.090> would<00:01:03.180> still<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.510> nice<00:01:03.780> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
replaced but it would still be nice to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.600 
replaced but it would still be nice to
know<00:01:04.080> if<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> part<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.680> defective<00:01:05.040> before

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
know if the part is defective before

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.450 
know if the part is defective before
replacing<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:07.200> decided<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.740> activate<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
replacing it we decided to activate the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.240 
replacing it we decided to activate the
EGR<00:01:08.759> solenoid<00:01:09.390> manually<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.080> scope<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.920> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
EGR solenoid manually and scope it to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.830 
EGR solenoid manually and scope it to
try<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.580> find<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.909> problem<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.600> pinout

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
try and find the problem the pinout

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.480 
try and find the problem the pinout
looks<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.939> pins<00:01:14.939> 2<00:01:15.299> 3<00:01:15.990> &amp;<00:01:16.259> 4<00:01:16.619> are<00:01:16.890> power

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
looks like this pins 2 3 &amp; 4 are power

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.139 
looks like this pins 2 3 &amp; 4 are power
and<00:01:17.640> grounds<00:01:18.149> pin<00:01:19.079> 6<00:01:19.499> the<00:01:20.189> activation<00:01:20.789> control

and grounds pin 6 the activation control

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.849 
and grounds pin 6 the activation control
and<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.829> EGR<00:01:23.159> signal<00:01:24.560> we<00:01:25.560> first

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
and in one is the EGR signal we first

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:27.889 
and in one is the EGR signal we first
check<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.100> power<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.609> grounds<00:01:27.030> they<00:01:27.840> were

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
check the power and grounds they were

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.020 
check the power and grounds they were
all<00:01:28.399> 4.9<00:01:29.399> 5<00:01:29.789> volts<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.929> looks<00:01:31.200> good<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.469> far

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
all 4.9 5 volts this looks good so far

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.999 
all 4.9 5 volts this looks good so far
then<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.149> connected<00:01:33.569> the<00:01:33.719> red<00:01:33.899> trace<00:01:34.289> of<00:01:34.530> the

then we connected the red trace of the
scope<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.759> number<00:01:35.969> 6<00:01:36.240> pin<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.990> EGR

then tapped a grounded jumper wire to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.379 
then tapped a grounded jumper wire to

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
solenoid look at the resulting scope

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.739 
solenoid look at the resulting scope
pattern<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.429> a<00:01:56.609> nice<00:01:56.850> digital<00:01:57.270> pattern

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:57.749 
pattern we have a nice digital pattern

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:59.660 
pattern we have a nice digital pattern
showing<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.380> activation<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> red<00:01:59.369> trace

of the yellow tray signal which should
also<00:02:02.520> look<00:02:02.909> digital<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.740> uneven<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.889> broken

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
also look digital is uneven and broken

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.910 
also look digital is uneven and broken
this<00:02:06.119> was<00:02:06.359> done<00:02:06.539> on<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> warm<00:02:07.020> engine<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.649> now

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
this was done on a warm engine and now

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.010 
this was done on a warm engine and now
proves<00:02:08.340> we<00:02:08.880> do<00:02:09.060> have<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.360> problem<00:02:09.630> with<00:02:09.899> the
