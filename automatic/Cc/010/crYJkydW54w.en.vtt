not<00:02:19.940> really<00:02:20.300> having<00:02:20.540> another<00:02:21.110> teammate<00:02:21.590> out

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
not really having another teammate out

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.190 
not really having another teammate out
there<00:02:22.069> who<00:02:22.430> could<00:02:22.640> get<00:02:22.910> buckets<00:02:23.510> for<00:02:23.720> his<00:02:23.930> team

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
there who could get buckets for his team

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.740 
there who could get buckets for his team
and<00:02:24.560> I'm<00:02:24.860> not<00:02:25.190> sure<00:02:25.580> what<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.120> actually<00:02:26.540> going

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
and I'm not sure what is actually going

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.790 
and I'm not sure what is actually going
on<00:02:26.930> with<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.230> Golden<00:02:27.560> State<00:02:27.650> Warriors

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
on with the Golden State Warriors

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.339 
on with the Golden State Warriors
because<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.760> thought<00:02:29.030> they<00:02:29.540> were<00:02:29.870> going<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.170> be

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
because I thought they were going to be

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.920 
because I thought they were going to be
a<00:02:30.379> deadly<00:02:31.099> team<00:02:31.400> now<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.299> they<00:02:32.480> have<00:02:32.629> Mike

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
a deadly team now that they have Mike

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.750 
a deadly team now that they have Mike
Conley<00:02:33.379> and<00:02:33.410> Ed<00:02:33.650> Davis<00:02:33.950> down<00:02:34.310> low<00:02:34.549> in<00:02:34.730> the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
Conley and Ed Davis down low in the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.880 
Conley and Ed Davis down low in the
paint<00:02:35.110> basically<00:02:36.110> an<00:02:36.230> improvement<00:02:36.620> on

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
paint basically an improvement on

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.860 
paint basically an improvement on
defense<00:02:37.519> and<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:37.910> think<00:02:37.940> they<00:02:38.480> should<00:02:38.510> be

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
defense and I think they should be

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.050 
defense and I think they should be
pretty<00:02:39.170> much<00:02:39.470> equal<00:02:40.129> when<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.549> comes<00:02:40.790> to

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
pretty much equal when it comes to

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.390 
pretty much equal when it comes to
offense<00:02:41.569> I<00:02:41.780> mean<00:02:41.959> Steph<00:02:42.230> Curry<00:02:42.530> he<00:02:42.980> wasn't

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
offense I mean Steph Curry he wasn't

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.880 
offense I mean Steph Curry he wasn't
really<00:02:43.580> average<00:02:44.060> in<00:02:44.239> 30<00:02:44.540> points<00:02:44.989> per<00:02:45.049> game<00:02:45.200> it

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
really average in 30 points per game it

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.640 
really average in 30 points per game it
was<00:02:46.099> more<00:02:46.370> around<00:02:46.630> 23<00:02:47.630> points<00:02:48.079> per<00:02:48.230> game<00:02:48.260> if

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
was more around 23 points per game if

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.890 
was more around 23 points per game if
I'm<00:02:48.829> not<00:02:49.040> mistaken<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:49.970> klay<00:02:50.329> Thompson

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
I'm not mistaken and klay Thompson

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.170 
I'm not mistaken and klay Thompson
efforts<00:02:51.319> and<00:02:51.500> above<00:02:51.769> 30<00:02:52.099> points<00:02:52.549> per<00:02:52.730> game<00:02:52.760> and

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
efforts and above 30 points per game and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.449 
efforts and above 30 points per game and
I<00:02:53.450> mean<00:02:53.630> Mike<00:02:53.870> Conley<00:02:54.380> he<00:02:54.590> got<00:02:54.769> around<00:02:55.010> 18

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
I mean Mike Conley he got around 18

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.119 
I mean Mike Conley he got around 18
points<00:02:55.819> per<00:02:55.849> game<00:02:56.150> so<00:02:56.180> yeah<00:02:57.079> in<00:02:57.260> my<00:02:57.440> opinion<00:02:57.980> I

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
points per game so yeah in my opinion I

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.920 
points per game so yeah in my opinion I
thought<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.670> these<00:02:58.849> Golden<00:02:59.269> State<00:02:59.480> Warriors

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
thought that these Golden State Warriors

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.740 
thought that these Golden State Warriors
were<00:03:00.230> going<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.680> remain<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.280> deadly<00:03:01.879> team<00:03:02.239> but

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
were going to remain a deadly team but

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.470 
were going to remain a deadly team but
for<00:03:02.989> some<00:03:03.200> odd<00:03:03.379> reason<00:03:03.410> Mike<00:03:04.400> Conley<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.239> Ed

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
for some odd reason Mike Conley and Ed

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.809 
for some odd reason Mike Conley and Ed
Davis<00:03:05.780> they<00:03:06.470> were<00:03:06.530> just<00:03:07.040> not<00:03:07.250> getting<00:03:07.640> any

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
Davis they were just not getting any

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.750 
Davis they were just not getting any
minutes<00:03:08.360> he's<00:03:08.989> rarely<00:03:09.319> seen<00:03:10.010> them<00:03:10.310> out<00:03:10.459> there

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
minutes he's rarely seen them out there

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.699 
minutes he's rarely seen them out there
on<00:03:10.879> the<00:03:11.000> court<00:03:11.239> with<00:03:11.390> us<00:03:11.599> tonight<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.410> that<00:03:12.560> is

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
on the court with us tonight and that is

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.920 
on the court with us tonight and that is
something<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.280> didn't<00:03:13.790> expect<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.360> see<00:03:14.450> at<00:03:14.750> all

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
something I didn't expect to see at all

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.440 
something I didn't expect to see at all
but<00:03:15.500> on<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.799> note<00:03:16.099> let's<00:03:16.670> finally<00:03:17.120> get<00:03:17.329> into

but on that note let's finally get into

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.180 
but on that note let's finally get into
