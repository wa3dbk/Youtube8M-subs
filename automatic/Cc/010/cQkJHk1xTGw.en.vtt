00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.120
 Hello, I want to show you what 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.340
 I have indoor plants 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:12.090
 there are not so many of them because the places are not 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.509
 allow you to plant a garden but I really love 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.100
 flowers and those who grow these 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.180
 have they in the living room right 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.670
 near the window stand and a large window and 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.760
 Chinese rose bush here this already 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.289
 I grew up when he was transported 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.130
 little little right i don't know 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.090
 broke and that 's the same grows but 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.390
 for some reason he is gone now that 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.570
 happened do not know before somehow bloomed 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.969
 plentiful and often here is a dollar 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.070
 the tree also bought a small one 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.350
 Bush already transplanted their big pots 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.770
 Here is such a big growth 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:58.070
 on my ng does not grow here such 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.570
 huge already 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.090
 Chlorophytum is even here a sprig 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.299
 I threw out the arrow I tied it on 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.090
 this is not tied secured so he 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:17.729
 such a nice stand there 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:20.630
 my money tree grows 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.220
 scientifically and remember too small 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.270
 transplanted because it was big 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:31.590
 otvetochku broke off and planted not very 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.869
 so long so small so here is my 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.310
 bay leaf grows which i 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.030
 reanimated and filmed the video that he told me 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.430
 a little sick here I was treating one 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.659
 the girl told me how to do it 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:53.909
 do what means to poison him 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.600
 now if anyone interested can write 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:02.119
 I'll answer you here he already had two trunks 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.640
 now here is one bolt barrel left 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.040
 little green 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.420
 also strengthened so that he frost here 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.600
 see green so 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:19.080
 gets well so on me there 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:24.090
 balcony objects seedlings growing. Further 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.640
 go to the kitchen here on my wall too 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.820
 Chlorophytum is already 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:35.630
 arrow threw stuck so 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:41.100
 whether I am here too 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.790
 flowers grow Lara Fitu and also from 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.150
 vodka 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.660
 we take birch as it is called in a scientific way 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.400
 I also don't know what's called 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:57.000
 so here is the bottom 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.070
 Benjamin Ficus is small but 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.170
 fluffy will tell the cube I'm behind it 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.180
 I take care too bought right 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.050
 the bag and the trees were just not 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.870
 did take off they set as leaves 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.730
 fell fell straight it was a pity then 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.130
 I saw on the Internet as needed for him 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.570
 take care of it I now have here is such a 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.040
 pretty thick show later this 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.410
 also the tree I do not know what is called 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.690
 just saw it in the store weeks 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.940
 some small shrub 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:35.120
 I liked the greens and so I bought it 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:38.850
 and this is already a bum and grew furry further 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.860
 further we move in the kitchen 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.420
 I also saw about my kitchen 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.180
 saw what flowers to me too 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.080
 Chlorophytum here it is birch 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.930
 raised such 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.120
 zara already several times its final 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.130
 scissors cut because she 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.460
 grows and grows and leaves and flowers 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.470
 here, too, chlorophytum why a lot 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.650
 chlorophytum because it cleans the air 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:10.870
 as you know all the pollution so i 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:14.280
 somehow we all grow carps like that 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.840
 here, too, some flowers 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.330
 I searched the internet I didnâ€™t find it bad 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.140
 I sought and the time was not much here 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:29.340
 such here, too, they have long been with me 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:33.070
 long in all pots at the joints so on 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:37.420
 so now go to the window 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.990
 I have a spathiphyllum here with him 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.420
 I will tell you another story too 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.950
 so stand me on the window on the kitchen 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.310
 window 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:52.060
 I have him called him here too 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:55.600
 grapes in the store came in stands in the lobby 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:59.730
 big big such a bush i 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.650
 quietly tore off a little twig 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:08.380
 I also have such a bush 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:12.010
 grew huge stretches he seems like like 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.669
 birch leaves only what they 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:19.390
 grapes only small in size 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:24.580
 so I called I call it 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:27.220
 grapes are decorative because we, too 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.780
 I do not know the Internet probably if anyone 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:33.580
 Interesting look here, too, flower 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:37.000
 probably not well visible because the sun 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.640
 side and paints early sun if here 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.820
 such too this here geranium me i 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.710
 showed the video how to root 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.880
 to plant at the cottage here it is I recently 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:54.610
 I did some water here costs and to 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:59.740
 rooted roots now i'm now 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:04.330
 go to another room and show that I 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.250
 I do and a bunch of Benjamin so here's another 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.160
 I have a bedroom on the dresser 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.550
 orchid see it still does not bloom 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:15.100
 why doesn't it bloom because I'm on time 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.200
 flowering she is also a lilac 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:21.220
 large 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:23.860
 decent flowers she has something to me on 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.890
 these didn't like her roots here 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.830
 so she for the bitches was black 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:32.950
 Only this I already made holes 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.530
 did more transplant her and during 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.020
 flowering time transplanted her because 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:42.220
 what seemed like bottom roots 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:45.370
 how to raise something straight you could see 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.500
 did not wait for it to bloom and after 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:52.720
 transplant she just dropped me everything 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:59.040
 flowers that's all well now not now 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:07:08.470
 it is clear that the leaves were scrubbing hard 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:12.220
 a little bedroom is here but alive 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:16.960
 these green little ones are worth 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:19.120
 I think that will bloom here so here 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.220
 I have one bedroom room standing alone 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.490
 orchid you will have no flowers because 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:28.350
 somehow the bedroom does not recommend much 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:28.350
 place flowers like this
