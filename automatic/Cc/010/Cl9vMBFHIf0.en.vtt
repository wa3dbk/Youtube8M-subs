because<00:05:26.569> let's<00:05:26.750> look<00:05:26.870> at<00:05:26.960> that<00:05:27.050> question<00:05:27.229> how

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
because let's look at that question how

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.350 
because let's look at that question how
many<00:05:28.069> times<00:05:28.339> do<00:05:28.819> you<00:05:28.849> go<00:05:28.939> to<00:05:29.029> the<00:05:29.120> movies<00:05:29.330> a

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
many times do you go to the movies a

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.329 
many times do you go to the movies a
month<00:05:29.569> and<00:05:29.810> then<00:05:30.349> here's<00:05:30.620> a<00:05:30.800> bunch<00:05:31.129> of

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:31.339 
month and then here's a bunch of

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:33.429 
month and then here's a bunch of
different<00:05:31.610> ranges<00:05:31.749> well<00:05:32.749> the<00:05:33.169> difference

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:33.439 
different ranges well the difference

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:35.920 
different ranges well the difference
between<00:05:33.560> zero<00:05:33.770> times<00:05:34.610> a<00:05:34.729> month<00:05:34.849> and<00:05:35.089> once<00:05:35.810> a

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
between zero times a month and once a

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.860 
between zero times a month and once a
month<00:05:36.080> is<00:05:36.430> actually<00:05:37.430> huge<00:05:38.000> right<00:05:38.449> if<00:05:38.569> I<00:05:38.629> go<00:05:38.750> the

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
month is actually huge right if I go the

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.379 
month is actually huge right if I go the
movies<00:05:39.110> zero<00:05:39.439> times<00:05:39.770> a<00:05:39.949> month<00:05:40.099> I<00:05:40.370> never<00:05:41.150> go<00:05:41.360> to

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
movies zero times a month I never go to

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.619 
movies zero times a month I never go to
the<00:05:41.479> movies<00:05:41.569> ever<00:05:41.990> so<00:05:42.889> why<00:05:43.550> is<00:05:43.610> that<00:05:43.789> you<00:05:44.569> know

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:44.629 
the movies ever so why is that you know

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:45.909 
the movies ever so why is that you know
why<00:05:44.810> don't<00:05:44.870> you<00:05:45.050> ever<00:05:45.199> go<00:05:45.319> to<00:05:45.349> the<00:05:45.439> movies<00:05:45.620> you

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
why don't you ever go to the movies you

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.800 
why don't you ever go to the movies you
wouldn't<00:05:46.460> know<00:05:46.550> because<00:05:46.729> I<00:05:47.120> could<00:05:47.449> also<00:05:47.569> go<00:05:47.750> to

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
wouldn't know because I could also go to

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.869 
wouldn't know because I could also go to
movies<00:05:48.020> twice<00:05:48.169> a<00:05:48.199> month<00:05:48.349> and<00:05:48.649> that<00:05:49.250> those<00:05:49.699> two

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:49.879 
movies twice a month and that those two

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.070 
movies twice a month and that those two
different<00:05:50.120> people<00:05:50.210> are<00:05:50.479> very<00:05:50.810> different

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
different people are very different

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.559 
different people are very different
types<00:05:51.289> of<00:05:51.379> people<00:05:51.879> another<00:05:52.879> big<00:05:53.089> problem<00:05:53.270> is

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 
types of people another big problem is

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:55.450 
types of people another big problem is
your<00:05:53.870> segmenting<00:05:54.409> people<00:05:54.680> into<00:05:55.069> these<00:05:55.219> stages

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
your segmenting people into these stages

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.730 
your segmenting people into these stages
and<00:05:55.789> you<00:05:56.089> know<00:05:56.210> like<00:05:56.389> the<00:05:57.169> difference<00:05:57.439> between

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
and you know like the difference between

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.610 
and you know like the difference between
I<00:05:57.919> go<00:05:58.189> to<00:05:58.279> the<00:05:58.370> movies<00:05:59.229> three<00:06:00.229> times<00:06:00.469> a<00:06:00.589> month

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
and eight times a month is huge goes

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.679 
and eight times a month is huge goes
from<00:06:04.069> like<00:06:04.219> I<00:06:04.370> go<00:06:04.610> like<00:06:04.819> almost<00:06:05.060> every<00:06:05.300> week<00:06:05.449> to
