00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.850
 to our dear keyboards we spent 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.210
 hours writing throwing things at him 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.490
 we drop food we drop soda 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.970
 that if not a can of cola that if a 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:21.130
 cup of coffee the sticky keys are finished 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.460
 you try to squeeze and they do not go up 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.660
 you turn it like that 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.060
 and you hear how he has like rum 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.160
 over time our loved ones and 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.540
 beautiful gleaming keyboards when 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.050
 we buy they end up turning into 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.600
 messes of crap and you have to wash them 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.840
 you have to clean them and the best way to 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.510
 clean them is not only with a cloth 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.540
 clean the part that is seen but is that 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.580
 It is easy to clean not advisable 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.180
 for hygiene because all this is full 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.160
 of mites and dirt, at least in my case 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.180
 and sure in the bone they will also make us 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.360
 the neat thing is to raise all and 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.000
 each of the keys clean them 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.160
 clean the background remove all the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.470
 what a mess there is and reassemble it 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.390
 what happens that there are people who do not know the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.119
 memory keyboard how is it so what 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.490
 more comfortable it is to take a camera give 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.450
 a photo to what is the disposition of 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.729
 the keys keep it clear 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.070
 Scrub the structure the base of the keyboard 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.000
 and put them back to have our 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.670
 shiny and brand new keyboard 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.650
 go for it 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.830
 taking out the keys is very simple only 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.710
 we need a screwdriver or a cutter 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.299
 something that can be used to pry 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.100
 you just have to on most keyboards 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.259
 is if you see that when you press it does not jump 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.020
 key do not follow because maybe it has 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.479
 another anchoring system and this serves us 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.990
 same you stay without pretty and dirty 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.369
 keyboard 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.680
 put something to leverage and pull 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.080
 the keys will jump to the fifth pine but 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.430
 you who are nimble take it and the 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.290
 you keep 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.750
 there was already the amount of things he has 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.580
 this 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.340
 gross 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.250
 One by one , all the 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.420
 keys agreed to do the photo if not 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.420
 you know the memory keyboard 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.489
 to the popcorn 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.829
 everything has this 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.610
 from my 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:43.050
 it's important there's a bus key the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.760
 dust from there that is this is corn there is a 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.350
 pair of keys that maybe are a bit 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.670
 different from the rest that are the space 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.980
 intro and may that backspace and capitals 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.080
 the inss he 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.000
 those that are longer I say it because 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.040
 they may have a piece of metal that 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.290
 I do not remember if he has it or does not go to 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.709
 be alike 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.709
 It is the best 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.620
 a screwdriver or a fatter cutter 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.820
 if we take the space 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.670
 we will see that they have a metal bar 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:26.019
 this bar is simply so that the 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.939
 key do not jump bounce nor should I 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.769
 terrorism as simple as we put the 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:33.730
 piece of metal in its place we fit it 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.730
 here in these two pieces 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.810
 Highlights I see it there 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.420
 and now we press down 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.870
 putting them is as easy as removing them 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.330
 you just have to put it in the 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.010
 hole with the piece of plastic itself 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.250
 place the good position do not put it 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.410
 through leveled she would be weird and 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.790
 press down 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.810
 you can put the one you want where 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.030
 you want but put them in control right here 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.490
 we would bet and there it stays fixed 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.840
 no problem then how can I not 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.900
 disassemble the entire keyboard in this 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.850
 video since I've removed a few 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.370
 record is a piece of advice the best for not 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.290
 be with a cloth cleaning one by one 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.460
 each of the keys that is a roll 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.240
 it is best to take a bucket fill it with 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.150
 Water 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.410
 a little ammonia a tad and a little 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:38.740
 of detergent so that one creates a 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.569
 a liquid that removes fat or also 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.949
 you can use every h7 that already as you will see 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.900
 but I say it because it's easier than 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.660
 be removing one of the keys with the 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.120
 rag if you put all the keys all the 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.919
 tec mind choose in this liquid you 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.610
 you turn with your hand during a good 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.280
 little while 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.630
 all that dirt dissolving and ends 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.460
 more comfortable than being cleaning and 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.930
 rubbing with the rag 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.050
 then you make them well and turn them to 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.659
 place once we have all the keys 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.539
 clean what you have to do is scrub 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:08.889
 the bottom of the keyboard that the same thing 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.990
 know this yes you had to use a 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.580
 rag and be very careful with doing this with 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.930
 the keyboard connected I have it 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.650
 connected right now but because I'm not going 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.750
 to mix any kind of 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.520
 liquid while it's on because if 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.199
 you can not short circuit the plate 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.020
 keyboard and you stay with a keyboard 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:28.530
 burnt and dirty 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.389
 so remember to remove the caps from 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.330
 the keys forgiveness scrub well the bottom 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.250
 of the keyboard the exterior also you put 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.360
 all the keys as you want or in a 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.830
 bucket or rub with a dampened cloth if 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.560
 you give him alcohol better because 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.120
 apart from that it remains without scab 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.759
 disinfects you already know how much 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.009
 microbes that has this and then already just 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:53.009
 Nothing remains then once it is clean and 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:56.180
 important dry you put back the 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.180
 keys on your site 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.500
 how to remove a few and then 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.580
 I will dedicate myself to the interested in depth 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:10.740
 but for now, as it's good for me, I'll go 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.740
 riding this puzzle to another
