00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 before the game starts, he has become consistent 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.720
 above all , he and stadium are gathered 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.760
 so-called scene-aware policemen 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.139
 explore the situation fans and police officers 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.670
 have known each other for a long time 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.590
 the situation before the game is 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.360
 is relatively relaxed seen 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.960
 calmer punishments have an effect 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.520
 shown 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.699
 the hooligan scene generally in 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.539
 Germany is losing more and more 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.210
 the punishment is so high and b are 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.849
 many boys are in their late twenties 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.380
 at the beginning of 30 family and then goes customer 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.270
 if you have 2000 matthias in mind 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.739
 on you already noticed household cash and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.610
 to be recommended because I do not want more 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.829
 the scene used to be that for the scene 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.510
 glued police frame as well as podium 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.399
 got the head but the thing is and 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.739
 today today is a worldwide 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.250
 Concept of 800 mark upwards 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.449
 fines up to thousands 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.100
 it will be critical later 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.020
 weird with the clasp fans 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.550
 pass the bistro, the police here 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.140
 which actually many officials used 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.270
 the randale about hopefully too 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.219
 thinking what is inevitable earlier 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.100
 Randale leads today is unproblematic 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.930
 the police lock up 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.430
 earlier the police initially times 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.869
 stood aside because they are the hooligans 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.790
 even so did not recognize 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.770
 Today the hooligans are the biggest 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.630
 part of all recognized and we can stop 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.430
 the colleagues exactly on the special 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.869
 persons point out that too 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.470
 special people included 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.470
 become 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.990
 in the stadium, the Cologne people echoed the wooden block 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.189
 14 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.899
 and yet you can be the fans of 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.149
 respective guest team in view 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.140
 keep the lower piece below 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.909
 follow the stage 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.250
 your look for the game but only for 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.500
 the fans have the employed officials 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.909
 in case of doubt, they are immediately to 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.350
 location 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.479
 I think that the violence is in 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.280
 football stadiums tended to decline 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.890
 and here in cologne we do the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.420
 experience that fewer and fewer crimes 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.259
 in connection with football 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.469
 events or 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.609
 sporting events are recorded 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.500
 michael schmidt has his own today 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:00.270
 block 4 under control though the ex e 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.520
 miserable, what I play on the mood 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.079
 the fans always negative affects except 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.819
 little beating does not happen 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.859
 serious are the police officers 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.649
 vigilantly stifling your presence alone 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:12.840
 RANDAL JUSTES BEFORE PLAYING THE 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.620
 Schalke fans celebrate the 2 0 victory of their 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.629
 team 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.980
 the block 4 holst already have 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.280
 frustrated on her way home 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.560
 again no chance on vandal before 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.239
 Stadium police still watch the hat 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.910
 after steffens the once before 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.140
 dreaded his rate of the season 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.519
 opposite side is without any incident 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.519
 gone over the stage
