00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.740
 Dima on voice today fourth place 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.080
 everyone planned it was very cool 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.160
 the race you showed yourself very well on 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.580
 tell me about this car 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.070
 it all started terribly awful yesterday 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.019
 training began 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:27.000
 Here I drove there I do not know 6m races and what 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.179
 we lost some clutch failure 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.670
 gone before the clutch started gone 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.030
 look for what happened to go shopping 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:39.300
 changes everything did not help had 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.629
 the machine as in logoysk turned on its side 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.950
 they remove the box well, and it turned out that our 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:48.360
 very good grip which is not us 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.879
 should have let you down let down 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.289
 that we have friends drifters who 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.680
 myself also the same clutch kit 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.920
 bought hungry well did not have time to put 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.010
 they brought here late yesterday 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.080
 Well, this morning we set and with the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.150
 clutch figured out not what we love you 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.270
 10 mm and here we say as we were told that 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.340
 you are very cool cat yesterday here to 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.700
 Unfortunately I'm always in training ride 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.150
 cool and on the day of the competition I somehow 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.080
 drive cool why does this happen 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.230
 probably probably seems to me that 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.520
 don't worry 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.030
 We will write off the fact that the car 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.970
 breaks you know still waiting for you were 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.280
 my questions with electric power yes yes 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.340
 that is , we have all started to crumble 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:41.580
 I have my way even today 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:45.270
 went broke loose everything therefore 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.270
 please show there 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:56.450
 have made come off called boots 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.100
 Here we go half an hour ride gone 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.979
 power which after logoyskom and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.840
 replaced by electric, we promised to do 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.899
 we replaced it completely with electro and 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.140
 he shouldn't have let him down 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.720

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.450
 father went started checking

 front suspension ball bearings began 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.269
 and tighten the bolt busted and that I oms 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.940
 personally saw it was a chance but a spare 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.000
 found because we replaced them too 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.549

 began to engage in drag racing due 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.829
 10 years ago and in principle I drive we 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.230
 we go on competitions germany 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.560

 together here's the whole team me and my father 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.230
 no appliances would be anyone else but 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.540
 Today we are everywhere there chest and shipish 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.480
 girls guys on the roofs here you are yours 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.709
 track is a photo center photo centers 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.920
 laser staff when they decided to go 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.680
 support here about the mechanics of us in the drift 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.530
 we are helped by our good friends bye 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.510
 performance here they always help us 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.709
 today we are by the way right away in the top 16 friend 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.180
 on a friend and got we already talked to yuri 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.390
 invest to respond to your cooperation 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.879
 and yes we know that you are together right here 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.579
 so I understand 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:58.010
 dim say you're next year 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:02.180
 you will be on another car but you need already 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.970
 because it's machines frankly say 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.950
 probably one of the worst here even 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.370
 Belarusian cars seriously that is 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.829
 good motor in it, I thought that 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.220
 clutch 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:18.889
 Here it is a bit not suitable for drift 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:23.090
 not very short base here it is 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:28.070
 sharp on her hard to drive and turn 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:30.500
 all my they are precisely because of this and plus 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.880
 I do not have unfortunately for this how to 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.120
 there is no such mass 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.139
 a set of eversion to make a good 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.680
 eversion at my at my all friends 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:44.800
 then I have 50 degrees there and this is very 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.330
 important this angles are completely different 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.550
 this smoke is completely different because it 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.849
 less opportunity to turn around yes if 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.279
 made a mistake the wheel turned out and drove 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.900
 further here are such constructive 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:00.819
 features that are easier for you and 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.169
 passed on and and put up and just 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.969
 dramatically change 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.680
 car but so everything is right on 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:07.569
 this car with suspension nothing to 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.520
 Unfortunately, it is impossible to decide this is very important 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.219
 in the drift and how did you choose such 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.949
 cars 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:17.259
 train ride don't be afraid like this 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.539
 here do somebody god or 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:23.050
 somewhere somewhere bale but you don't 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.969
 afraid of leaving that is 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.710
 look at the future as little as you 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:28.599
 think what kind of car it could be 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.389
 it is most likely to be nissan 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:34.120
 again from there on but this is the best car 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:38.999
 considered to be drift while performance on 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:41.919
 BMW twist but I do not want to disagree 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:44.139
 but we understand what did you take 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.339
 fourth place again you were in 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:50.379
 top 4 but from progress winter pit true 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:53.219
 probably okay probably progress 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:55.839
 progress by the way after your interview 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:58.589
 my friends called me and said and 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:02.199
 asked you are really looking for a couple 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:04.479
 a couple of drift to drift this drift 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.089
 train nobody called you 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.610
 serious name but today you are not 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:12.580
 saw the Grodno residents did not see 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.039
 saw guys who write on the forums about 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.219
 the fact that there are such people here 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:20.349
 get out of the underground is associated with Dima I 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:21.159
 don't get into frame 1 moment occurs 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:24.069
 worth asking 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:26.740
 and let you go all your 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:30.430
 teams and well look 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:32.919
 mob his friends with you today was Dima 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.699
 foraging fourth place almost stopped 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:40.580
 and but he promises us to grow of course 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:40.580
 yes Dim cool drift that I show you right now
