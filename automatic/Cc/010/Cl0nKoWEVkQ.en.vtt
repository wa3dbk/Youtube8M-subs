this<00:03:55.120> crap<00:03:55.450> I<00:03:55.690> don't<00:03:55.960> think<00:03:56.020> they<00:03:56.260> would<00:03:56.410> be

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
this crap I don't think they would be

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.440 
this crap I don't think they would be
testing<00:03:57.100> it<00:03:57.220> in<00:03:57.370> front<00:03:57.730> of<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:57.940> mass<00:03:58.120> public

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
testing it in front of the mass public

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.480 
testing it in front of the mass public
where<00:03:58.810> thousands<00:03:59.350> of<00:03:59.500> people<00:03:59.560> could<00:04:00.010> see<00:04:00.340> it

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
where thousands of people could see it

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.250 
where thousands of people could see it
so<00:04:00.700> that's<00:04:00.940> what<00:04:01.180> makes<00:04:01.630> me<00:04:01.750> believe<00:04:02.050> that

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
so that's what makes me believe that

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.570 
so that's what makes me believe that
this<00:04:02.770> is<00:04:02.980> indeed<00:04:03.570> ET<00:04:04.570> technology<00:04:05.350> okay<00:04:06.280> that's

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
this is indeed ET technology okay that's

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.790 
this is indeed ET technology okay that's
ability<00:04:07.180> very<00:04:07.690> possible<00:04:08.230> unless<00:04:08.470> the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
ability very possible unless the

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.560 
ability very possible unless the
scenario<00:04:09.310> like<00:04:09.520> one<00:04:09.760> of<00:04:09.790> our<00:04:10.000> viewers<00:04:10.150> that

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
scenario like one of our viewers that

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.690 
scenario like one of our viewers that
you're<00:04:11.050> setting<00:04:11.440> us<00:04:11.560> up<00:04:11.740> with<00:04:12.100> a<00:04:12.130> fake<00:04:12.430> one

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
you're setting us up with a fake one

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.580 
you're setting us up with a fake one
okay<00:04:13.150> so<00:04:13.450> that<00:04:13.660> they<00:04:13.810> could<00:04:13.990> attack<00:04:14.080> us<00:04:14.320> so

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
okay so that they could attack us so

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.349 
okay so that they could attack us so
that<00:04:14.890> we<00:04:14.920> could<00:04:15.130> go<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.340> war<00:04:15.610> but<00:04:15.850> this<00:04:16.060> is<00:04:16.209> in

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
that we could go to war but this is in

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.880 
that we could go to war but this is in
China<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:16.930> I<00:04:17.019> don't<00:04:17.200> know<00:04:17.320> if<00:04:17.410> they<00:04:17.530> think<00:04:17.770> the

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
China and I don't know if they think the

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.090 
China and I don't know if they think the
same<00:04:18.100> way<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.730> we<00:04:18.910> do<00:04:19.060> in<00:04:19.209> America<00:04:19.299> so<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:20.650> got

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
same way that we do in America so I got

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.000 
same way that we do in America so I got
over<00:04:21.370> here<00:04:21.790> but<00:04:22.390> I'm<00:04:22.900> very<00:04:23.230> interesting<00:04:23.890> and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
over here but I'm very interesting and

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.260 
over here but I'm very interesting and
you<00:04:24.190> know<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.460> way<00:04:24.550> they<00:04:24.700> scream<00:04:25.000> things

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
went into like a hiding sort of for a

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.399 
went into like a hiding sort of for a
while<00:05:20.080> there<00:05:20.350> and<00:05:20.530> i<00:05:20.710> think

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
while there and i think

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.679 
while there and i think
in<00:05:22.619> this<00:05:22.830> case<00:05:23.099> we<00:05:23.819> found<00:05:24.059> out<00:05:24.239> that<00:05:24.269> most<00:05:24.569> of

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:24.689 
in this case we found out that most of

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:26.829 
in this case we found out that most of
them<00:05:24.839> were<00:05:24.929> freemasons<00:05:25.619> so<00:05:26.309> they<00:05:26.459> probably

00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:26.839 
them were freemasons so they probably

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:29.600 
them were freemasons so they probably
somewhat<00:05:27.839> knew<00:05:28.019> what<00:05:28.169> to<00:05:28.319> expect<00:05:28.439> and<00:05:28.860> some<00:05:29.459> of

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
somewhat knew what to expect and some of

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.909 
somewhat knew what to expect and some of
them<00:05:29.699> maybe<00:05:29.849> their<00:05:30.119> consciousness<00:05:30.919> like

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
them maybe their consciousness like

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.769 
them maybe their consciousness like
Mitchell<00:05:32.339> was<00:05:32.550> affected<00:05:33.089> by<00:05:33.119> this<00:05:33.300> but

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:33.779 
Mitchell was affected by this but

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:36.439 
Mitchell was affected by this but

couldn't do anything during the time to

he didn't even check to see he say it
could<00:06:43.019> be<00:06:43.139> a<00:06:43.169> satellite<00:06:43.679> what<00:06:43.860> a<00:06:43.889> fool<00:06:44.129> he

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:44.159 
could be a satellite what a fool he

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:46.040 
could be a satellite what a fool he
looks<00:06:44.459> like<00:06:44.610> because<00:06:44.879> he<00:06:45.599> didn't<00:06:45.809> even<00:06:45.899> look

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:01.289 
all the astronauts who have been on the

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:02.869 
all the astronauts who have been on the
moon<00:07:01.469> know<00:07:01.739> about<00:07:02.069> this<00:07:02.309> it's<00:07:02.639> just

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:02.879 
moon know about this it's just

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.790 
moon know about this it's just
unfortunate<00:07:03.269> that<00:07:03.629> most<00:07:04.050> of<00:07:04.199> them<00:07:04.349> are<00:07:04.529> or<00:07:04.769> i

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
unfortunate that most of them are or i

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.189 
unfortunate that most of them are or i
heard<00:07:05.369> half<00:07:05.610> the<00:07:05.819> astronauts<00:07:06.360> or<00:07:06.539> freemason

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 
heard half the astronauts or freemason

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:09.350 
heard half the astronauts or freemason
so<00:07:07.469> a<00:07:07.499> lot<00:07:07.769> of<00:07:07.800> people<00:07:07.919> cannot<00:07:08.610> talk<00:07:09.059> about

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 
so a lot of people cannot talk about
