just want to give a quick update to this
Taiwan<00:00:04.500> plane<00:00:04.890> crash<00:00:05.279> that<00:00:05.730> happened<00:00:05.879> I've

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
Taiwan plane crash that happened I've

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.360 
Taiwan plane crash that happened I've
been<00:00:06.540> hearing<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.839> lot<00:00:06.870> about<00:00:07.140> it<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.440> some

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
been hearing a lot about it and some

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.700 
been hearing a lot about it and some
people<00:00:08.639> who<00:00:08.760> think<00:00:09.210> it's<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.570> hoax<00:00:10.050> some<00:00:10.440> people

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
people who think it's a hoax some people

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.459 
people who think it's a hoax some people
think<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.099> actually<00:00:11.429> happened<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.719> figured<00:00:13.320> I'd

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
think it actually happened I figured I'd

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.980 
think it actually happened I figured I'd
go<00:00:13.710> ahead<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.190> give<00:00:14.370> my<00:00:14.580> spin<00:00:14.969> on<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.809> in

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
go ahead and give my spin on it just in

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.830 
go ahead and give my spin on it just in
case<00:00:16.230> because<00:00:16.910> you<00:00:17.910> know<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.570> have

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
case because you know I do I have

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.450 
case because you know I do I have
mentioned<00:00:19.289> before<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.980> have<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> little

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
mentioned before that I have a little

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.359 
mentioned before that I have a little
bit<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.820> flight<00:00:21.359> experience<00:00:22.320> myself<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:23.160> I

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
bit of flight experience myself so I

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.070 
bit of flight experience myself so I
figured<00:00:23.939> I'd<00:00:24.060> go<00:00:24.210> ahead<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.539> give<00:00:24.630> my<00:00:24.810> take

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
figured I'd go ahead and give my take

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.550 
figured I'd go ahead and give my take
now<00:00:25.289> originally<00:00:26.099> my<00:00:26.369> first<00:00:26.820> thought<00:00:27.330> when<00:00:28.230> I

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
now originally my first thought when I

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.420 
now originally my first thought when I
very<00:00:28.619> first<00:00:29.160> saw<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.179> video<00:00:30.349> was<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:32.070> was

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
very first saw the video was that it was

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.150 
very first saw the video was that it was
fake<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.910> mean<00:00:33.420> when<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.600> first<00:00:33.989> saw<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.469> video

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
fake I mean when I first saw this video

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.110 
fake I mean when I first saw this video
it<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.579> looked<00:00:35.790> completely<00:00:36.780> fake<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.230> me<00:00:37.260> and

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
it just looked completely fake to me and

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
it just looked completely fake to me and
part<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> reason<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.570> wanted<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.899> make<00:00:40.020> this

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
part of the reason I wanted to make this

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.740 
part of the reason I wanted to make this
video<00:00:40.290> was<00:00:40.649> because<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.760> wanted<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.420> point<00:00:42.600> out

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
video was because I wanted to point out

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.110 
video was because I wanted to point out
some<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> flaws<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.739> now<00:00:44.070> some<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
some of the flaws in it now some of the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.440 
some of the flaws in it now some of the
people<00:00:45.860> Dabu<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.280> particular<00:00:47.910> has<00:00:48.149> mentioned

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
people Dabu in particular has mentioned

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.139 
people Dabu in particular has mentioned
that<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.680> reason<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> plane<00:00:50.250> crashed<00:00:50.700> was

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that the reason the plane crashed was

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.290 
that the reason the plane crashed was
due<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:52.020> prop<00:00:52.710> failure<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.489> that's

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
due to prop failure and that's

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
due to prop failure and that's
completely<00:00:54.660> ludicrous<00:00:55.260> if<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> look<00:00:56.039> at<00:00:56.160> how

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
completely ludicrous if you look at how

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.910 
completely ludicrous if you look at how
the<00:00:56.340> plane<00:00:56.640> operated<00:00:56.850> as<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.079> planes

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the plane operated as in the planes

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.330 
the plane operated as in the planes
flight<00:00:59.460> trajectory<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:01.050> things<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:01.739> some

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
flight trajectory and things but some

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.979 
flight trajectory and things but some
people<00:01:02.640> said<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.149> both<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.660> engines

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
people said that both of the engines

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.469 
people said that both of the engines
failed<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.860> know<00:01:05.010> there's<00:01:05.939> all<00:01:06.180> kinds<00:01:06.450> of

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
failed you know there's all kinds of

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.679 
failed you know there's all kinds of
conflicting<00:01:06.990> stories<00:01:07.830> about<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:09.540> other

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
conflicting stories about this the other

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.270 
conflicting stories about this the other
thing<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.650> weird<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.070> that

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
thing that was really weird is that

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.330 
thing that was really weird is that
there<00:01:11.909> was<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.770> bunch<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.830> people<00:01:14.070> who<00:01:14.189> actually

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
there was a bunch of people who actually

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
there was a bunch of people who actually
survived<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.180> thing<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:18.270> know

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
survived this thing and so you know

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.240 
survived this thing and so you know
typically<00:01:19.170> people<00:01:19.409> don't<00:01:19.619> survive<00:01:19.830> plane

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
typically people don't survive plane

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.170 
typically people don't survive plane
crashes<00:01:21.200> especially<00:01:22.200> one<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:23.030> violent<00:01:24.030> as

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
crashes especially one as violent as

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.219 
crashes especially one as violent as
this<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:25.580> you<00:01:26.580> know<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.880> was<00:01:27.030> 58<00:01:27.750> people<00:01:27.960> on

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
this so you know that was 58 people on

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.620 
this so you know that was 58 people on
board<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.680> only<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:29.579> nine<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.060> them<00:01:30.180> died<00:01:30.390> or

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
board and only like nine of them died or

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.080 
board and only like nine of them died or
12<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.990> them<00:01:31.110> died<00:01:31.320> or<00:01:31.500> something<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:31.890> that

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
12 of them died or something like that

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.450 
12 of them died or something like that
that's<00:01:33.090> pretty<00:01:33.360> incredible<00:01:33.509> cuz<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:35.340> know<00:01:35.430> a

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
that's pretty incredible cuz you know a

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.359 
that's pretty incredible cuz you know a
twin<00:01:35.759> prop<00:01:36.030> airplane<00:01:36.390> like<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:37.220> even<00:01:38.220> right

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
twin prop airplane like that even right

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.950 
twin prop airplane like that even right
after<00:01:38.430> takeoff<00:01:39.150> still<00:01:39.479> must<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:39.689> been<00:01:39.840> going

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
after takeoff still must have been going

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.480 
after takeoff still must have been going
at<00:01:40.200> least<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.829> hundred<00:01:41.100> miles<00:01:41.250> an<00:01:41.430> hour

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
at least a hundred miles an hour

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.649 
at least a hundred miles an hour
probably<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.509> know<00:01:42.630> 150<00:01:43.140> maybe<00:01:43.890> 200<00:01:44.479> miles<00:01:45.479> an

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
probably you know 150 maybe 200 miles an

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.039 
probably you know 150 maybe 200 miles an
hour<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.640> for<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.180> fall<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
hour so for it to just fall out of the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.649 
hour so for it to just fall out of the
sky<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.950> would<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:51.060> imagined

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
sky like that I would have imagined

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.380 
sky like that I would have imagined
would<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.899> killed<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.229> lot<00:01:52.259> more<00:01:52.530> people<00:01:53.390> but

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
would have killed a lot more people but

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.539 
would have killed a lot more people but
here's<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> thing<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.560> one<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.070> don't<00:01:56.219> know

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
here's the thing for one I don't know

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.660 
here's the thing for one I don't know
why<00:01:57.000> they<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.140> fake<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.649> story<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.219> mean<00:01:59.520> it

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
why they would fake this story I mean it

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.010 
why they would fake this story I mean it
doesn't<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.210> know<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.540> not<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:00.840> not<00:02:00.960> like

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
doesn't you know it's not it's not like

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.580 
doesn't you know it's not it's not like
the<00:02:01.680> Malaysia<00:02:02.070> airline<00:02:03.140> 370<00:02:04.140> or<00:02:04.170> whatever

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
the Malaysia airline 370 or whatever

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.319 
the Malaysia airline 370 or whatever
it's<00:02:05.159> not<00:02:05.219> like<00:02:05.430> there's<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.670> clear<00:02:06.060> objective

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
it's not like there's a clear objective

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.169 
it's not like there's a clear objective
behind<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.310> other<00:02:08.429> thing<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.000> don't

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
behind it and the other thing is I don't

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.210 
behind it and the other thing is I don't
know<00:02:09.360> how<00:02:09.599> they<00:02:09.840> would<00:02:10.110> have<00:02:10.410> accomplished

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
know how they would have accomplished

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.770 
know how they would have accomplished
faking<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:12.000> they<00:02:12.180> would<00:02:12.360> have

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
faking this they would have

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.020 
faking this they would have
had<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.200> put<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.800> know<00:02:13.920> fake<00:02:14.190> airplane<00:02:14.730> parts

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
had to put you know fake airplane parts

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.290 
had to put you know fake airplane parts
in<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.870> middle<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.290> this<00:02:16.580> river<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
in the middle of this river in the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.290 
in the middle of this river in the
middle<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:18.690> highly<00:02:19.140> populated<00:02:20.040> area<00:02:20.300> so

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
middle of this highly populated area so

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.640 
middle of this highly populated area so
it<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.540> doesn't<00:02:21.780> make<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.900> lot<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.110> sense<00:02:22.470> in

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
it just doesn't make a lot of sense in

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.070 
it just doesn't make a lot of sense in
that<00:02:22.770> respect<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.520> seems<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:23.910> there's<00:02:24.150> way

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
that respect it seems like there's way

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.120 
that respect it seems like there's way
too<00:02:25.140> much<00:02:25.520> possible<00:02:26.520> error<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.230> wanted<00:02:29.040> to

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
too much possible error so I wanted to

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.990 
too much possible error so I wanted to
go<00:02:29.220> through<00:02:29.460> this<00:02:29.700> video<00:02:31.610> well<00:02:32.610> before<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:32.910> do

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
go through this video well before I do

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.260 
go through this video well before I do
that<00:02:33.140> actually<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.730> pulled<00:02:35.730> up<00:02:35.850> on<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.000> map

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
that actually I pulled up on the map

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.340 
that actually I pulled up on the map
where<00:02:36.990> this<00:02:37.280> took<00:02:38.280> place<00:02:38.750> they<00:02:39.750> said<00:02:40.050> that<00:02:40.230> the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
where this took place they said that the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.350 
where this took place they said that the
plane<00:02:40.530> took<00:02:40.860> off<00:02:41.040> at<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.430> capital<00:02:42.180> airport

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
plane took off at the capital airport

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.980 
plane took off at the capital airport
the<00:02:42.780> main<00:02:42.930> airport<00:02:43.140> here<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.300> went<00:02:45.300> down<00:02:45.600> at

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
the main airport here and went down at

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.860 
the main airport here and went down at
one<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.070> bridges<00:02:47.310> over<00:02:47.730> here<00:02:47.940> now<00:02:48.630> it's

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
one of the bridges over here now it's

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.510 
one of the bridges over here now it's
slightly<00:02:49.200> off<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:49.740> that<00:02:49.860> regard<00:02:50.990> for<00:02:51.990> one<00:02:52.520> prop

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
slightly off in that regard for one prop

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.010 
slightly off in that regard for one prop
airplanes<00:02:54.000> don't<00:02:54.150> usually<00:02:54.330> take<00:02:54.690> off<00:02:54.840> at

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
airplanes don't usually take off at

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.020 
airplanes don't usually take off at
major<00:02:55.170> airports<00:02:55.550> it<00:02:56.550> would<00:02:56.730> be<00:02:56.820> much<00:02:57.000> more

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
major airports it would be much more

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.480 
major airports it would be much more
reasonable<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:57.990> assume<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.950> took<00:02:59.130> off<00:02:59.310> at

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
reasonable to assume that it took off at

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.510 
reasonable to assume that it took off at
the<00:02:59.580> smaller<00:02:59.880> airport<00:03:00.390> here<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:04.400> when<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.430> was

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
the smaller airport here and when I was

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.970 
the smaller airport here and when I was
searching<00:03:05.850> for<00:03:06.030> where<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.600> actually<00:03:06.990> crashed

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
searching for where it actually crashed

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.280 
searching for where it actually crashed
it<00:03:08.310> looks<00:03:08.730> like<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.360> what<00:03:09.510> I've<00:03:09.630> been<00:03:09.900> able<00:03:09.990> to

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
it looks like and what I've been able to

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.100 
it looks like and what I've been able to
deduce<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:11.910> was<00:03:12.120> probably<00:03:12.510> the

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
deduce that this was probably the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.010 
deduce that this was probably the
closest<00:03:14.070> I<00:03:14.340> can<00:03:14.490> get<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:15.000> figuring<00:03:15.720> out<00:03:15.840> where

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
closest I can get to figuring out where

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.420 
closest I can get to figuring out where
it<00:03:16.110> was<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.470> looks<00:03:16.620> like<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.860> buildings<00:03:17.250> are

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
it was it looks like the buildings are

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.000 
it was it looks like the buildings are
fairly<00:03:17.700> similar<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.510> clip<00:03:18.930> looks<00:03:19.860> like

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
fairly similar to the clip looks like

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.920 
fairly similar to the clip looks like
the<00:03:20.130> roads<00:03:20.340> fairly<00:03:20.880> similar<00:03:21.300> at<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.540> divider

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
the roads fairly similar at the divider

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.440 
the roads fairly similar at the divider
and<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.010> think<00:03:23.130> this<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.459> probably<00:03:24.000> where<00:03:24.300> it

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
and so I think this is probably where it

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.140 
and so I think this is probably where it
happened<00:03:24.980> or<00:03:25.980> at<00:03:26.070> least<00:03:26.250> real<00:03:26.459> close<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.970> here

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
happened or at least real close to here

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.890 
happened or at least real close to here
so<00:03:28.050> that<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:29.430> gonna<00:03:29.670> be<00:03:29.910> kind<00:03:30.269> of<00:03:30.360> like<00:03:30.510> over<00:03:30.690> in

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
so that is gonna be kind of like over in

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.350 
so that is gonna be kind of like over in
this<00:03:30.989> area<00:03:31.050> like<00:03:31.650> right<00:03:31.860> here<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.280> as<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.239> can

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
this area like right here and as you can

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.070 
this area like right here and as you can
see<00:03:35.000> it's<00:03:36.000> pretty<00:03:36.090> close<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.660> airport

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
see it's pretty close to the airport

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.830 
see it's pretty close to the airport
it's<00:03:37.230> just<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.530> little<00:03:37.739> ways<00:03:37.890> off<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:41.660> would<00:03:42.660> have

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
it's just a little ways off I would have

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.900 
it's just a little ways off I would have
to<00:03:43.080> see<00:03:43.260> which<00:03:43.650> way<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:44.070> wind<00:03:44.100> was<00:03:44.400> blowing<00:03:44.430> in

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
to see which way the wind was blowing in

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.509 
to see which way the wind was blowing in
order<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.410> figure<00:03:46.410> out<00:03:46.530> if<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.100> plane<00:03:47.310> took

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
order to figure out if the plane took

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.030 
order to figure out if the plane took
off<00:03:47.670> this<00:03:48.030> way<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:48.720> turned<00:03:49.530> around<00:03:49.680> and

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
off this way and turned around and

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.440 
off this way and turned around and
started<00:03:50.310> heading<00:03:50.340> back<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.910> other<00:03:51.060> direction

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
started heading back the other direction

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.699 
started heading back the other direction
or<00:03:52.200> if<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.860> plane<00:03:53.040> took<00:03:53.220> off<00:03:53.400> this<00:03:53.700> way<00:03:54.000> and

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
or if the plane took off this way and

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.130 
or if the plane took off this way and
you<00:03:55.709> know<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:56.580> adjust<00:03:57.120> for<00:03:57.390> wind<00:03:57.630> started

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
you know to adjust for wind started

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.810 
you know to adjust for wind started
heading<00:03:58.290> this<00:03:58.440> way<00:03:58.500> or<00:03:58.830> maybe<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:59.220> even<00:03:59.489> if<00:03:59.670> the

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
heading this way or maybe it even if the

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.160 
heading this way or maybe it even if the
winds<00:04:00.030> were<00:04:00.209> really<00:04:00.480> strong<00:04:00.750> could<00:04:01.080> have

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
winds were really strong could have

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.170 
winds were really strong could have
blown<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.739> theoretically<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.730> far<00:04:02.970> but

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
blown it theoretically that far but

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.420 
blown it theoretically that far but
that's<00:04:03.330> kind<00:04:03.570> of<00:04:03.630> a<00:04:03.690> stretch<00:04:03.930> I<00:04:04.430> think

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
that's kind of a stretch I think

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.830 
that's kind of a stretch I think
probably<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.880> plane<00:04:06.150> took<00:04:06.269> off<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.690> looked

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
probably the plane took off and looked

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.199 
probably the plane took off and looked
around<00:04:06.989> but<00:04:08.209> then<00:04:09.209> I<00:04:09.299> started<00:04:11.150> looking<00:04:12.150> into

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
around but then I started looking into

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.729 
around but then I started looking into
the<00:04:12.390> actual<00:04:12.690> footage<00:04:13.080> let's<00:04:13.290> get<00:04:13.470> into<00:04:13.650> the

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
the actual footage let's get into the

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.550 
the actual footage let's get into the
actual<00:04:13.860> footage<00:04:14.220> here<00:04:15.109> because<00:04:16.109> I<00:04:16.169> wanted<00:04:16.440> to

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
actual footage here because I wanted to

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.939 
actual footage here because I wanted to
see

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
see

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.090 
see
if<00:04:18.949> the<00:04:19.310> plane<00:04:19.549> actually<00:04:20.079> if<00:04:21.079> it<00:04:21.410> was<00:04:21.560> CGI<00:04:21.949> or

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
if the plane actually if it was CGI or

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.390 
if the plane actually if it was CGI or
what<00:04:23.030> happened<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:24.560> I'm<00:04:24.740> going<00:04:25.040> through<00:04:25.070> and

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
what happened and I'm going through and

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.640 
what happened and I'm going through and
I'm<00:04:25.490> watching<00:04:25.669> this<00:04:25.910> clip<00:04:26.830> and<00:04:29.380> you<00:04:30.380> know<00:04:30.470> the

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
I'm watching this clip and you know the

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.909 
I'm watching this clip and you know the
first<00:04:30.860> time<00:04:31.040> I<00:04:31.070> saw<00:04:31.430> it<00:04:31.460> it<00:04:32.590> looks<00:04:33.590> totally

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
first time I saw it it looks totally

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.040 
first time I saw it it looks totally
fake<00:04:34.100> because<00:04:34.310> there<00:04:34.520> is<00:04:34.639> no<00:04:34.940> reason<00:04:35.930> that<00:04:35.960> I

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
fake because there is no reason that I

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.670 
fake because there is no reason that I
could<00:04:36.290> think<00:04:36.440> of<00:04:36.650> for<00:04:37.040> a<00:04:37.780> pilot<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:39.260> turn<00:04:39.620> the

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
could think of for a pilot to turn the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.370 
could think of for a pilot to turn the
plane<00:04:39.979> on<00:04:40.400> it's<00:04:40.550> on<00:04:41.060> its<00:04:41.360> side<00:04:41.600> like<00:04:41.840> that<00:04:41.870> that

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
plane on it's on its side like that that

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.290 
plane on it's on its side like that that
makes<00:04:42.710> absolutely<00:04:42.979> no<00:04:43.370> sense<00:04:43.520> even<00:04:44.150> with

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
makes absolutely no sense even with

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.370 
makes absolutely no sense even with
engine<00:04:44.660> failure<00:04:45.370> even<00:04:46.370> with<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:47.380> aileron

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
engine failure even with the aileron

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
engine failure even with the aileron
failure<00:04:49.870> because<00:04:50.870> uh<00:04:50.919> it<00:04:51.919> just<00:04:52.100> doesn't<00:04:52.340> make

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
failure because uh it just doesn't make

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.469 
failure because uh it just doesn't make
sense<00:04:52.460> for<00:04:52.820> something<00:04:52.970> to<00:04:53.120> happen<00:04:53.240> like<00:04:53.360> that

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
sense for something to happen like that

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.930 
sense for something to happen like that
but<00:04:54.440> then<00:04:54.560> if<00:04:54.710> we<00:04:54.800> watch<00:04:54.979> this<00:04:55.190> in<00:04:55.340> like<00:04:55.490> super

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
but then if we watch this in like super

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.460 
but then if we watch this in like super
slow<00:04:56.150> speed<00:04:56.510> you<00:04:56.660> can<00:04:56.810> actually<00:04:56.840> see<00:04:57.290> what

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
slow speed you can actually see what

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.860 
slow speed you can actually see what
happened<00:04:57.860> it's<00:04:58.010> it's<00:04:58.340> it's<00:04:59.270> pretty<00:04:59.360> clear<00:04:59.840> to

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
happened it's it's it's pretty clear to

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:09.520 
happened it's it's it's pretty clear to
me<00:05:05.470> if<00:05:06.470> you<00:05:06.560> just<00:05:06.740> watch<00:05:06.950> the<00:05:06.979> plane<00:05:07.490> here<00:05:08.530> you

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
me if you just watch the plane here you

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:16.360 
me if you just watch the plane here you
can<00:05:09.680> see<00:05:09.860> a<00:05:09.889> kind<00:05:10.250> of<00:05:10.460> drop<00:05:11.090> down<00:05:11.120> slightly<00:05:15.370> you

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
can see a kind of drop down slightly you

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.430 
can see a kind of drop down slightly you
see<00:05:16.580> kind<00:05:16.820> of<00:05:16.970> that<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.419> tail<00:05:17.840> of<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.199> plane

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
see kind of that the tail of the plane

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.379 
see kind of that the tail of the plane
is<00:05:18.680> dropping<00:05:19.190> down<00:05:19.220> in<00:05:19.669> the<00:05:19.760> nose<00:05:19.940> it's<00:05:20.180> kind

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
is dropping down in the nose it's kind

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.240 
is dropping down in the nose it's kind
of<00:05:20.479> lifting<00:05:20.870> up<00:05:22.000> and<00:05:23.000> then<00:05:23.710> it<00:05:24.710> just<00:05:24.830> all<00:05:25.070> of<00:05:25.220> a

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
of lifting up and then it just all of a

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.540 
of lifting up and then it just all of a
sudden<00:05:26.200> starts<00:05:27.200> to<00:05:27.350> fall<00:05:27.620> out<00:05:27.860> of<00:05:27.889> the<00:05:28.010> sky<00:05:28.280> and

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
sudden starts to fall out of the sky and

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.190 
sudden starts to fall out of the sky and
you<00:05:28.760> see<00:05:28.970> how<00:05:29.120> it's<00:05:29.350> losing<00:05:30.350> altitude

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
you see how it's losing altitude

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.380 
you see how it's losing altitude
what<00:05:32.800> is<00:05:32.890> happening<00:05:33.400> there<00:05:33.580> guys<00:05:33.790> is<00:05:34.060> that<00:05:34.210> the

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
what is happening there guys is that the

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.550 
what is happening there guys is that the
airplane<00:05:34.960> is<00:05:35.370> stalling<00:05:36.370> so<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:38.170> pilot

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
airplane is stalling so the pilot

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.700 
airplane is stalling so the pilot
probably<00:05:39.070> didn't<00:05:39.370> get<00:05:39.970> enough<00:05:40.440> speed<00:05:41.440> for

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
probably didn't get enough speed for

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.820 
probably didn't get enough speed for
whatever<00:05:42.220> reason<00:05:42.820> or<00:05:43.260> you<00:05:44.260> know<00:05:44.380> pulled<00:05:44.680> up

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
whatever reason or you know pulled up

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.000 
whatever reason or you know pulled up
too<00:05:45.010> quickly<00:05:45.810> you<00:05:46.810> know<00:05:46.930> at<00:05:47.050> higher<00:05:47.290> altitudes

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
too quickly you know at higher altitudes

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.390 
too quickly you know at higher altitudes
it's<00:05:48.250> relatively<00:05:48.670> easy<00:05:48.790> to<00:05:49.680> recover<00:05:50.680> from<00:05:51.250> a

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
it's relatively easy to recover from a

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.940 
it's relatively easy to recover from a
stall<00:05:51.670> but<00:05:52.540> at<00:05:52.660> low<00:05:52.870> altitudes<00:05:53.410> it's<00:05:53.680> almost

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
stall but at low altitudes it's almost

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.090 
stall but at low altitudes it's almost
always<00:05:54.250> a<00:05:54.670> crash<00:05:55.480> because<00:05:55.960> there's<00:05:56.740> no<00:05:56.920> room

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
always a crash because there's no room

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.640 
always a crash because there's no room
to<00:05:57.160> recover<00:05:57.580> and<00:05:57.940> to<00:05:58.840> me<00:05:58.930> it's<00:05:59.200> pretty<00:05:59.410> clear

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
to recover and to me it's pretty clear

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.610 
to recover and to me it's pretty clear
that<00:05:59.770> that's<00:05:59.890> what<00:06:00.130> happened<00:06:01.200> you<00:06:02.200> can<00:06:02.230> see

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
that that's what happened you can see

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.910 
that that's what happened you can see
like<00:06:03.310> I<00:06:03.430> said<00:06:03.640> the<00:06:03.790> nose<00:06:03.970> was<00:06:04.120> picking<00:06:04.450> up<00:06:04.920> and

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
like I said the nose was picking up and

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.150 
like I said the nose was picking up and
and<00:06:06.310> the<00:06:07.050> bottom<00:06:08.050> tail<00:06:08.260> is<00:06:08.440> just<00:06:08.500> dragging

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
and the bottom tail is just dragging

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:19.880 
and the bottom tail is just dragging
here<00:06:14.340> and<00:06:15.390> then<00:06:16.390> it<00:06:16.510> just<00:06:16.660> falls<00:06:16.930> out<00:06:17.140> this<00:06:17.380> guy

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:26.250 

so<00:06:21.510> yeah<00:06:22.510> guys<00:06:22.720> I<00:06:23.160> like<00:06:24.160> I<00:06:24.250> said<00:06:24.430> I<00:06:24.840> at<00:06:25.840> first<00:06:26.110> I

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
so yeah guys I like I said I at first I

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.080 
so yeah guys I like I said I at first I
thought<00:06:26.470> this<00:06:26.650> looked<00:06:26.950> CGI<00:06:27.340> and<00:06:27.760> I<00:06:27.820> kind<00:06:28.030> of

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
thought this looked CGI and I kind of

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.780 
thought this looked CGI and I kind of
got<00:06:28.270> on<00:06:28.450> here<00:06:28.690> to<00:06:29.100> confirm<00:06:30.100> the<00:06:30.280> fact<00:06:30.460> that<00:06:30.610> it

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
got on here to confirm the fact that it

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.540 
got on here to confirm the fact that it
was<00:06:30.910> probably<00:06:31.390> fake<00:06:31.660> but<00:06:32.200> the<00:06:32.890> more<00:06:33.100> I<00:06:33.130> started

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
was probably fake but the more I started

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.340 
was probably fake but the more I started
researching<00:06:34.270> into<00:06:34.660> this<00:06:34.810> and<00:06:36.840> after<00:06:37.840> I<00:06:37.870> really

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
researching into this and after I really

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.080 
researching into this and after I really
slowed<00:06:38.560> down<00:06:38.710> the<00:06:38.890> clip<00:06:39.130> and<00:06:39.340> examined<00:06:39.910> what

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
slowed down the clip and examined what

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.850 
slowed down the clip and examined what
actually<00:06:40.510> happened<00:06:40.960> it's<00:06:41.320> pretty<00:06:41.560> clear<00:06:41.830> that

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
actually happened it's pretty clear that

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.730 
actually happened it's pretty clear that
the<00:06:42.070> plane<00:06:42.310> just<00:06:42.490> stalled<00:06:42.850> and<00:06:43.600> crashed<00:06:43.740> that

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
the plane just stalled and crashed that

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.040 
the plane just stalled and crashed that
would<00:06:44.830> also<00:06:45.240> probably<00:06:46.240> explain<00:06:46.630> why<00:06:46.810> there

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
would also probably explain why there

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.530 
would also probably explain why there
were<00:06:47.140> so<00:06:47.170> many<00:06:47.530> survivors<00:06:48.460> because<00:06:49.150> the<00:06:49.330> plane

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
were so many survivors because the plane

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.210 
were so many survivors because the plane
you<00:06:50.170> know<00:06:50.200> in<00:06:50.440> a<00:06:50.500> stall<00:06:50.710> state<00:06:50.980> like<00:06:51.190> that

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
you know in a stall state like that

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.770 
you know in a stall state like that
would<00:06:51.550> have<00:06:51.670> been<00:06:51.790> going<00:06:51.880> relatively<00:06:52.540> pretty

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
would have been going relatively pretty

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.340 
would have been going relatively pretty
slow

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
slow

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.410 
slow
it<00:06:53.500> would<00:06:53.950> have<00:06:54.010> been<00:06:54.160> going<00:06:54.340> so<00:06:54.730> slow<00:06:55.150> that<00:06:55.180> it

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.420 
it would have been going so slow that it

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.790 
it would have been going so slow that it
wasn't<00:06:55.720> gaining<00:06:56.230> altitude

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
wasn't gaining altitude

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.580 
wasn't gaining altitude
you<00:06:57.250> know<00:06:57.370> it<00:06:58.060> wasn't<00:06:58.450> going<00:06:58.570> fast<00:06:58.870> fast

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
you know it wasn't going fast fast

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.940 
you know it wasn't going fast fast
enough<00:06:59.950> and<00:07:00.220> so<00:07:00.930> you<00:07:01.930> know<00:07:02.050> in<00:07:02.290> that<00:07:02.440> respect

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:02.950 
enough and so you know in that respect

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.320 
enough and so you know in that respect
could<00:07:03.190> have<00:07:03.280> it<00:07:03.610> could<00:07:03.850> have<00:07:03.940> very<00:07:04.240> easily

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
could have it could have very easily

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.260 
could have it could have very easily
only<00:07:04.870> been<00:07:05.020> going<00:07:05.490> maybe<00:07:06.490> 100<00:07:06.880> miles<00:07:07.000> an<00:07:07.180> hour

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 
only been going maybe 100 miles an hour

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.580 
only been going maybe 100 miles an hour
or<00:07:07.450> so<00:07:07.630> and<00:07:08.010> you<00:07:09.010> know<00:07:09.070> after<00:07:09.640> being<00:07:10.590> slowed

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
or so and you know after being slowed

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.360 
or so and you know after being slowed
down<00:07:11.620> by<00:07:11.860> the<00:07:12.190> bridge<00:07:12.550> here<00:07:13.110> and<00:07:14.220> landing<00:07:15.220> in

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.370 
down by the bridge here and landing in

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.220 
down by the bridge here and landing in
water<00:07:16.950> it<00:07:17.950> seems<00:07:18.250> reasonable<00:07:19.150> enough<00:07:19.690> to

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:20.230 
water it seems reasonable enough to

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.590 
water it seems reasonable enough to
assume<00:07:20.620> that<00:07:20.920> people<00:07:21.190> would<00:07:21.520> have<00:07:21.700> survived

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:22.600 
assume that people would have survived

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.970 
assume that people would have survived
that<00:07:23.140> crash<00:07:23.350> so<00:07:25.110> I'm<00:07:26.110> gonna<00:07:26.320> have<00:07:26.530> to<00:07:26.680> go<00:07:26.830> with

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:26.980 
that crash so I'm gonna have to go with

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.090 
that crash so I'm gonna have to go with
my<00:07:27.100> gut<00:07:27.310> on<00:07:27.340> this<00:07:27.640> and<00:07:27.850> say<00:07:27.970> that<00:07:28.120> this<00:07:28.330> one

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:29.100 
my gut on this and say that this one

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.850 
my gut on this and say that this one
appears<00:07:30.100> to<00:07:30.280> be<00:07:30.400> real<00:07:30.670> and<00:07:30.910> so<00:07:31.750> I<00:07:32.050> think<00:07:32.680> it's

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:32.860 
appears to be real and so I think it's

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.200 
appears to be real and so I think it's
important<00:07:33.310> that<00:07:33.340> we<00:07:33.610> pray<00:07:33.880> for<00:07:34.090> these

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:34.210 
important that we pray for these

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.550 
important that we pray for these
families<00:07:34.660> and<00:07:34.930> and<00:07:35.920> yeah<00:07:36.210> so<00:07:37.380> there<00:07:38.380> you<00:07:38.440> go
