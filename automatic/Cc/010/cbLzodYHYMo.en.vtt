00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:11.210
 I'm just trying to help! 

00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:13.346
 Just take them out, Elena, please. 

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:14.814
 Just take them out. 

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.315
 If you keep twisting 

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.784
 Maybe I feel bad for you. 

00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:33.199
 You've changed. 

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.869
 There is something different in you. 

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:41.407
 You are stronger Harder. 

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:48.481
 You are not the only one who has changed, Stefan. 

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.083
 All of us have done it too. 

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:55.388
 Good to Know. 

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:02.161
 There is something I have to tell you. 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.532
 Not because I feel guilty. 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.402
 It's because I feel guilty that you do not know. 

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:18.944
 I kissed Damon. 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.610
 Stefan ... 

00:02:15.013 --> 00:02:17.314
 say something. 

00:02:17.382 --> 00:02:19.617
 Please. 

00:02:19.685 --> 00:02:22.853
 I should not have kidnapped you. 

00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:28.526
 The car, the bridge, I went too far. 

00:02:30.195 --> 00:02:32.530
 Thank you. 

00:02:32.597 --> 00:02:34.365
 But you should not have lied to me today. 

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:36.534
 You can not leave and do things like that, Elena. 

00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:37.935
 Not while Klaus is still alive. 

00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:39.437
 I know. 

00:02:39.504 --> 00:02:43.040
 I just ... I wanted to give Bonnie 

00:02:43.108 --> 00:02:45.209
 a moment with his mother 

00:02:45.277 --> 00:02:48.813
 without anything else getting in his way. 

00:02:50.215 --> 00:02:52.717
 Without having me in the middle. 

00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:06.664
 I did not plan on kissing him. 

00:03:06.732 --> 00:03:10.000
 You're better than him, Elena. 

00:03:13.772 --> 00:03:16.107
 You are better than both.
