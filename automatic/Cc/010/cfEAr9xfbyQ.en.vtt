muscle<00:00:23.939> growth

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
muscle growth

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.859 
muscle growth
so<00:00:24.869> what<00:00:25.230> we're<00:00:25.349> at<00:00:25.499> here<00:00:26.089> first<00:00:27.089> off<00:00:27.300> whenever

cable curl for your upper arm is usually
by<00:00:36.780> your<00:00:36.990> sides<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.530> you're<00:00:37.800> curling<00:00:38.130> the<00:00:38.280> way

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
by your sides and you're curling the way

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.760 
by your sides and you're curling the way
up<00:00:38.670> that's<00:00:39.330> pretty<00:00:39.630> typical<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.380> pretty

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
up that's pretty typical with pretty

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.460 
up that's pretty typical with pretty
much<00:00:40.890> every<00:00:41.310> single<00:00:41.490> bicep<00:00:41.970> exercise<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:43.410> a

much every single bicep exercise but a

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.950 
much every single bicep exercise but a
little<00:00:43.710> trick<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.220> can<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.490> to<00:00:44.640> help

little trick that you can do to help

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.090 
little trick that you can do to help
change<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.200> way<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.500> your<00:00:46.620> muscles<00:00:46.950> get

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
change the way that your muscles get

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.800 
change the way that your muscles get
activated<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.790> help<00:00:48.210> spur<00:00:48.420> out<00:00:48.510> some<00:00:48.690> new

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
activated and help spur out some new

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.750 
activated and help spur out some new
growth<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.650> change<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.220> position<00:00:50.400> of<00:00:50.730> your

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
growth is to change the position of your

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.880 
growth is to change the position of your
arm<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.540> what<00:00:51.720> we're<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.290> is<00:00:52.650> an

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
arm so what we're going to do is an

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.570 
arm so what we're going to do is an
overhead<00:00:53.430> cable<00:00:54.150> curl<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.080> an<00:00:55.440> EZ<00:00:56.280> bar

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
overhead cable curl so I have an EZ bar

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.600 
overhead cable curl so I have an EZ bar
set<00:00:57.330> up<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.990> lat<00:00:58.140> pulldown<00:00:58.440> station<00:00:59.040> so

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
set up to the lat pulldown station so

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.400 
set up to the lat pulldown station so
I'm<00:00:59.700> going<00:00:59.880> to<00:00:59.910> be<00:01:00.060> curling<00:01:00.540> from<00:01:00.990> the<00:01:01.140> top

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
I'm going to be curling from the top

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.890 
I'm going to be curling from the top
that<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.400> this<00:01:02.940> which<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.360> arms<00:01:03.690> from<00:01:03.780> the

that and this which the arms from the
totally<00:01:04.259> different<00:01:04.320> position<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.129> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
totally different position and it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.800 
totally different position and it's
going<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.609> help<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.880> spur<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.149> some<00:01:06.450> new<00:01:06.600> growth

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
going to help to spur on some new growth

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.109 
going to help to spur on some new growth
trust<00:01:07.710> me<00:01:07.859> when<00:01:08.009> you<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.249> this<00:01:08.460> variation

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
you're going to feel your arms peak

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.550 
you're going to feel your arms peak
contract<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.570> different<00:01:12.960> type<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.079> way<00:01:13.289> than

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
contract in a different type of way than

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.010 
contract in a different type of way than
it<00:01:13.710> does<00:01:13.890> when<00:01:14.429> you're<00:01:14.520> doing<00:01:14.759> standing<00:01:15.179> curls

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.120 

you<00:01:20.020> don't<00:01:20.200> need<00:01:20.320> a<00:01:20.380> lot<00:01:20.590> of<00:01:20.620> link<00:01:20.890> when<00:01:21.010> you're

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
you don't need a lot of link when you're

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:41.260 
you don't need a lot of link when you're
starting<00:01:21.370> with<00:01:21.550> this<00:01:21.670> just<00:01:22.360> really<00:01:22.600> straight

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:02:04.220 

ah

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.680 

that<00:02:05.230> feels<00:02:05.520> different<00:02:06.520> then<00:02:06.730> regular<00:02:07.300> curls

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
that feels different then regular curls

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.380 
that feels different then regular curls
and<00:02:08.170> you'd<00:02:08.950> be<00:02:09.040> surprised<00:02:09.430> at<00:02:09.610> how<00:02:09.670> weak<00:02:10.119> your

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
and you'd be surprised at how weak your

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.240 
and you'd be surprised at how weak your
arms<00:02:10.720> are<00:02:10.899> with<00:02:11.140> your<00:02:11.260> curl<00:02:11.470> into<00:02:11.650> an<00:02:11.800> overhead

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
arms are with your curl into an overhead

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.310 
arms are with your curl into an overhead
but<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:12.970> really<00:02:13.150> gives<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.660> good<00:02:14.050> pump

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
but it really gives you a good pump

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.530 
but it really gives you a good pump
device

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.660 

so<00:02:18.170> with<00:02:18.409> this<00:02:18.530> one<00:02:18.739> just<00:02:18.769> slow<00:02:19.159> it<00:02:19.310> down<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.519> bit

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
so with this one just slow it down a bit

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.309 
so with this one just slow it down a bit
and<00:02:19.819> hold<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.360> peak<00:02:20.629> contraction<00:02:20.930> for<00:02:21.290> a

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
and hold that peak contraction for a

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.490 
and hold that peak contraction for a
split<00:02:21.620> second<00:02:22.040> at<00:02:22.129> the<00:02:22.250> top<00:02:22.280> there<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.299> go

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
split second at the top there you go

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.229 
split second at the top there you go
that<00:02:24.500> really<00:02:24.980> activates<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.700> biceps<00:02:26.090> you

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
that really activates the biceps you

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.449 
that really activates the biceps you
really<00:02:26.569> feel<00:02:26.750> them<00:02:26.930> cramp<00:02:27.319> and<00:02:27.560> contract

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
really feel them cramp and contract

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.880 
really feel them cramp and contract
fully<00:02:28.760> when<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.209> just<00:02:29.420> for<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:29.989> split<00:02:30.379> second

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
fully when you just for a split second

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.369 
fully when you just for a split second
just<00:02:30.920> pause<00:02:31.510> well<00:02:32.510> it's<00:02:32.689> technically<00:02:33.079> not<00:02:33.260> at

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
just pause well it's technically not at

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.330 
just pause well it's technically not at
the<00:02:33.470> top<00:02:33.650> because<00:02:33.890> we're<00:02:34.010> doing<00:02:34.099> it<00:02:34.220> in

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
the top because we're doing it in

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.190 
the top because we're doing it in
Reverse<00:02:34.579> we're<00:02:34.819> so<00:02:35.239> it's<00:02:35.390> at<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.629> bottom<00:02:35.989> here

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
Reverse we're so it's at the bottom here

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.780 
Reverse we're so it's at the bottom here
but<00:02:36.739> that's<00:02:36.829> when<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.099> biceps<00:02:37.459> are<00:02:37.579> fully

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
but that's when the biceps are fully

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.020 
but that's when the biceps are fully
contracted<00:02:39.159> alright<00:02:40.159> great<00:02:40.489> stuff<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.760> I

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
contracted alright great stuff and I

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.180 
contracted alright great stuff and I
find<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:44.420> EZ<00:02:44.629> curl<00:02:44.930> bar<00:02:45.049> makes<00:02:45.620> this<00:02:45.829> move<00:02:46.040> a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
find the EZ curl bar makes this move a

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.069 
find the EZ curl bar makes this move a
lot<00:02:46.370> more<00:02:46.640> comfortable<00:02:47.000> because<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.049> a

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
lot more comfortable because it is a

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.080 
lot more comfortable because it is a
little<00:02:48.319> bit<00:02:48.530> awkward<00:02:48.709> especially<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.909> first

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
little bit awkward especially the first

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.399 
little bit awkward especially the first
time<00:02:50.269> you<00:02:50.450> try<00:02:50.629> to<00:02:50.659> curl<00:02:50.900> behind<00:02:51.230> your<00:02:51.319> head

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
time you try to curl behind your head

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.080 
time you try to curl behind your head
like<00:02:51.560> this<00:02:51.739> because<00:02:52.489> you're<00:02:52.640> just<00:02:52.790> not<00:02:52.909> used

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
like this because you're just not used

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.569 
like this because you're just not used
to<00:02:53.180> moving<00:02:53.510> in<00:02:53.599> that<00:02:53.659> kind<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:53.959> position

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
to moving in that kind of position

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.610 
to moving in that kind of position
but<00:02:55.579> once<00:02:55.819> you<00:02:56.000> get<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.659> hang<00:02:56.690> of<00:02:56.959> it<00:02:57.079> it's<00:02:57.470> a

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
but once you get the hang of it it's a

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.819 
but once you get the hang of it it's a
great<00:02:58.040> exercise<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.879> really<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.620> great<00:03:00.620> peak

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
great exercise to really a great peak

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.770 
great exercise to really a great peak
contraction<00:03:01.190> move<00:03:01.609> for<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.849> biceps<00:03:02.269> so<00:03:02.690> we're

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
contraction move for the biceps so we're

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.300 
contraction move for the biceps so we're
going<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:02.930> move<00:03:03.049> on<00:03:03.230> now<00:03:03.379> and<00:03:03.500> do<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:03.950> similar

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
going to move on now and do a similar

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.149 
going to move on now and do a similar
exercise<00:03:04.970> for<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.569> triceps<00:03:05.799> does<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:06.950> same

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
exercise for the triceps does the same

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.530 
exercise for the triceps does the same
thing<00:03:07.400> applies<00:03:07.670> typically<00:03:08.239> when<00:03:08.420> you're

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
thing applies typically when you're

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.330 
thing applies typically when you're
doing<00:03:08.750> tricep<00:03:09.139> exercises<00:03:09.650> like<00:03:10.069> you're<00:03:10.250> in

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
doing tricep exercises like you're in

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.640 
doing tricep exercises like you're in
push<00:03:10.549> downs<00:03:10.879> or<00:03:11.239> things<00:03:11.420> like<00:03:11.510> that<00:03:11.599> your<00:03:12.379> up

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
push downs or things like that your up

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.160 
push downs or things like that your up
is<00:03:13.250> by<00:03:13.549> your<00:03:13.730> side<00:03:13.970> very<00:03:14.450> prayer<00:03:14.840> is<00:03:15.049> an

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
is by your side very prayer is an

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.570 
is by your side very prayer is an
overhead<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:16.370> what<00:03:16.519> we<00:03:16.609> want<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.849> do

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
overhead so what we want to do

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.480 
overhead so what we want to do
and<00:03:17.850> overhead<00:03:18.420> cable<00:03:19.230> extension<00:03:19.440> let<00:03:20.310> me<00:03:20.370> use

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
and overhead cable extension let me use

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.450 
and overhead cable extension let me use
the<00:03:20.730> rope<00:03:21.000> attachment<00:03:21.390> for<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:22.190> this<00:03:23.190> one's

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
the rope attachment for this this one's

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.190 
the rope attachment for this this one's
a<00:03:23.580> great<00:03:23.730> move<00:03:24.060> because<00:03:24.360> we're<00:03:24.900> we're<00:03:25.050> using

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
a great move because we're we're using

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.070 
a great move because we're we're using
cables<00:03:25.800> you<00:03:26.370> get<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:26.850> peak<00:03:27.240> contraction<00:03:27.630> at<00:03:27.960> the

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
cables you get a peak contraction at the

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.200 
cables you get a peak contraction at the
top<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.950> get<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.130> full<00:03:29.370> stretch<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:29.910> bottom

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
top and you get a full stretch of bottom

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.790 
top and you get a full stretch of bottom
so<00:03:30.270> you<00:03:30.360> get<00:03:30.480> detention<00:03:30.870> throughout<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
so you get detention throughout the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.040 
so you get detention throughout the
entire<00:03:32.160> range<00:03:32.460> of<00:03:32.610> motion<00:03:32.870> sometimes<00:03:33.870> when

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
entire range of motion sometimes when

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.900 
entire range of motion sometimes when
you're<00:03:34.170> using<00:03:34.200> free<00:03:34.770> weights<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.310> certain

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
you're using free weights and certain

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.820 
you're using free weights and certain
machines<00:03:36.210> you<00:03:36.840> can<00:03:36.870> kind<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.710> don't

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
machines you can kind of you don't

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.770 
machines you can kind of you don't
really<00:03:38.040> get<00:03:38.220> full<00:03:38.670> tension<00:03:39.150> throughout<00:03:39.660> the

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
really get full tension throughout the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.840 
really get full tension throughout the
entire<00:03:40.050> range<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.410> motion<00:03:40.770> but<00:03:41.190> with<00:03:41.370> cables

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
entire range of motion but with cables

00:03:41.850 --> 00:04:27.250 
entire range of motion but with cables
you<00:03:42.030> do<00:03:42.210> you<00:03:42.540> get<00:03:42.690> that<00:03:42.840> stays<00:03:43.170> detention

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.780 

really<00:04:28.260> feel<00:04:28.500> that<00:04:28.580> stretching<00:04:29.580> and

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
really feel that stretching and

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.030 
really feel that stretching and
contracting<00:04:30.390> the<00:04:30.420> triceps

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.440 

was<00:04:33.280> ahead

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.510 

hey<00:04:36.990> keep<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.590> rolling<00:04:38.010> Trisha<00:04:38.250> is<00:04:38.310> going<00:04:38.460> to

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
hey keep it rolling Trisha is going to

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.549 
hey keep it rolling Trisha is going to
do<00:04:38.610> a<00:04:38.640> set

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:41.559 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:45.700 

so

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.580 

there<00:04:46.010> we<00:04:46.130> go

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.250 

so<00:04:50.100> again<00:04:50.310> just<00:04:50.520> step<00:04:51.330> forward<00:04:51.360> until<00:04:52.050> you<00:04:52.139> get

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
so again just step forward until you get

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.920 
so again just step forward until you get
tension<00:04:52.500> in<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.830> cable<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:53.780> straddling<00:04:54.780> your

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
tension in the cable and straddling your

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.260 
tension in the cable and straddling your
feet<00:04:55.139> is<00:04:55.320> optional<00:04:56.040> but<00:04:56.220> I<00:04:56.280> prefer<00:04:56.790> to<00:04:57.000> do<00:04:57.120> it

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
feet is optional but I prefer to do it

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.370 
feet is optional but I prefer to do it
because<00:04:57.540> it<00:04:57.660> just<00:04:57.690> gives<00:04:58.139> you<00:04:58.260> a<00:04:58.290> better<00:04:58.680> base

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
because it just gives you a better base

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.540 
because it just gives you a better base
and<00:05:01.380> again<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:01.830> doesn't<00:05:01.980> matter<00:05:02.160> which<00:05:02.310> foot

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
and again it doesn't matter which foot

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.159 
and again it doesn't matter which foot
you<00:05:02.669> have<00:05:02.850> forward<00:05:03.150> whatever<00:05:03.720> one<00:05:03.960> feels

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
you have forward whatever one feels

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.460 
you have forward whatever one feels
comfortable

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:14.370 

there<00:05:08.070> you<00:05:08.250> go

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.120 

great<00:05:15.010> job<00:05:16.320> so<00:05:17.320> again<00:05:17.530> try<00:05:17.770> to<00:05:17.800> keep<00:05:18.010> your

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
great job so again try to keep your

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.250 
great job so again try to keep your
elbows<00:05:18.190> as<00:05:18.970> close<00:05:19.300> to<00:05:19.510> your<00:05:19.630> head<00:05:19.780> as<00:05:19.930> you<00:05:20.020> can

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
elbows as close to your head as you can

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.220 
elbows as close to your head as you can
with<00:05:21.010> both<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.610> tricep<00:05:22.210> extension<00:05:22.780> as<00:05:22.930> well

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.649 

Hey

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
Hey

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.499 
Hey
good<00:05:41.169> stuff<00:05:41.800> I'd<00:05:42.369> say<00:05:42.639> I<00:05:42.669> really<00:05:43.029> like<00:05:43.330> that

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
good stuff I'd say I really like that

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.260 
good stuff I'd say I really like that
move<00:05:43.749> that<00:05:44.349> one<00:05:44.559> there<00:05:44.740> because<00:05:45.639> it<00:05:46.059> is<00:05:46.119> a

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
move that one there because it is a

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.450 
move that one there because it is a
stretch<00:05:46.899> and<00:05:47.199> a<00:05:47.830> peak<00:05:48.069> contraction

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
stretch and a peak contraction

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.089 
stretch and a peak contraction
all-in-one<00:05:49.360> anytime<00:05:50.259> you<00:05:50.409> can<00:05:50.559> get<00:05:50.740> both<00:05:50.979> a

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
all-in-one anytime you can get both a

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:52.529 
all-in-one anytime you can get both a
stretch<00:05:51.399> and<00:05:51.550> key<00:05:51.699> contraction<00:05:52.240> you're<00:05:52.360> going

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
stretch and key contraction you're going

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.540 
stretch and key contraction you're going
to<00:05:52.599> get<00:05:52.689> really<00:05:53.020> good<00:05:53.139> helical<00:05:53.559> muscles<00:05:54.009> and

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
to get really good helical muscles and

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.739 
to get really good helical muscles and
that's<00:05:54.639> why<00:05:54.819> I<00:05:54.849> really<00:05:55.089> like<00:05:55.300> that<00:05:55.449> for<00:05:55.689> the

00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:55.749 
that's why I really like that for the

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:58.290 
that's why I really like that for the
tries<00:05:55.990> so<00:05:56.889> again<00:05:57.159> give<00:05:57.520> those<00:05:57.699> two<00:05:57.879> losses<00:05:58.119> a

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
tries so again give those two losses a

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.409 
tries so again give those two losses a
shot<00:05:58.839> the<00:05:59.319> overhead<00:05:59.889> cable<00:06:00.249> curl<00:06:00.429> the

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
shot the overhead cable curl the

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:04.230 
shot the overhead cable curl the
overhead<00:06:02.199> tricep<00:06:02.709> extension<00:06:03.279> what<00:06:04.209> I

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
overhead tricep extension what I

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.449 
overhead tricep extension what I
recommend<00:06:04.749> you<00:06:04.779> do<00:06:04.959> is<00:06:05.199> probably<00:06:05.409> start<00:06:06.309> off

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:06.459 
recommend you do is probably start off

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:09.119 
recommend you do is probably start off
with<00:06:06.969> a<00:06:07.240> couple<00:06:07.599> layer<00:06:08.169> warm-up<00:06:08.649> sets<00:06:08.889> just

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:09.129 
with a couple layer warm-up sets just

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:11.879 
with a couple layer warm-up sets just
used<00:06:09.459> to<00:06:09.639> them<00:06:09.729> and<00:06:09.909> then<00:06:10.599> gradually<00:06:11.589> work<00:06:11.740> up

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
used to them and then gradually work up

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:13.859 
used to them and then gradually work up
the<00:06:12.039> weight<00:06:12.219> and<00:06:12.429> do<00:06:12.520> three<00:06:12.909> to<00:06:13.119> four<00:06:13.360> heavier

00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:13.869 
the weight and do three to four heavier

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:16.350 
the weight and do three to four heavier
working<00:06:14.319> sets<00:06:14.559> keep<00:06:15.249> the<00:06:15.430> reps<00:06:15.639> in<00:06:15.879> the<00:06:15.999> 10<00:06:16.240> to

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
working sets keep the reps in the 10 to

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.350 
working sets keep the reps in the 10 to
15<00:06:16.719> rep<00:06:16.959> range<00:06:17.229> so<00:06:18.009> give<00:06:18.279> those<00:06:18.520> exercises<00:06:19.089> a

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
15 rep range so give those exercises a

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.449 
15 rep range so give those exercises a
