doing he's a dictator um of course I

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.229 
doing he's a dictator um of course I
think<00:03:39.139> the<00:03:40.139> same<00:03:40.379> should<00:03:40.680> be<00:03:40.739> fine<00:03:41.129> but<00:03:42.060> um

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
think the same should be fine but um

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.129 
think the same should be fine but um
just<00:03:43.230> for<00:03:43.440> they<00:03:44.069> just<00:03:44.639> for<00:03:44.790> knowing<00:03:44.970> but<00:03:45.810> it
