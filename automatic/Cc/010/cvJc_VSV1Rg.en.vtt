in this video I'm gonna be showing you
how<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:04.859> update<00:00:05.130> your<00:00:05.370> graphics<00:00:05.940> card<00:00:06.150> driver

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
how to update your graphics card driver

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.870 
how to update your graphics card driver
now<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.290> first<00:00:07.620> step<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:08.220> upgrading<00:00:08.730> your

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
now the first step to upgrading your

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.299 
now the first step to upgrading your
graphics<00:00:09.330> card<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.800> determining<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:11.010> brand

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
graphics card is determining the brand

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.129 
graphics card is determining the brand
that<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.670> currently<00:00:11.940> have<00:00:12.150> on<00:00:12.480> your<00:00:12.719> PC<00:00:13.110> now

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
that you currently have on your PC now

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.310 
that you currently have on your PC now
the<00:00:13.440> two<00:00:13.740> main<00:00:13.920> companies<00:00:14.130> are<00:00:14.610> either<00:00:15.080> AMD<00:00:16.080> or

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
the two main companies are either AMD or

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.950 
the two main companies are either AMD or
Nvidia<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.160> it's<00:00:17.340> either<00:00:17.670> one<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.210> those<00:00:18.480> cards

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
Nvidia so it's either one of those cards

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.410 
Nvidia so it's either one of those cards
that<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.289> have<00:00:19.340> now<00:00:20.340> there<00:00:20.670> are<00:00:20.730> two<00:00:20.880> ways<00:00:21.119> off

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
that you have now there are two ways off

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.620 
that you have now there are two ways off
the<00:00:21.600> top<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.930> my<00:00:22.050> head<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.500> can<00:00:22.740> think<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.160> a

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
the top of my head that I can think of a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.089 
the top of my head that I can think of a
figuring<00:00:24.630> which<00:00:25.019> graphics<00:00:25.439> card<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.890> you

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
figuring which graphics card that you

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.429 
figuring which graphics card that you
have<00:00:26.130> now<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.699> first<00:00:26.820> step<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.720> going<00:00:28.199> into

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
have now the first step is going into

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.240 
have now the first step is going into
your<00:00:28.590> control<00:00:28.949> panel

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
your control panel

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.330 
your control panel
so<00:00:32.250> I'm<00:00:32.309> gonna<00:00:32.460> head<00:00:32.610> under<00:00:32.850> my<00:00:33.000> control<00:00:33.210> panel

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
so I'm gonna head under my control panel

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.819 
so I'm gonna head under my control panel
and<00:00:35.450> then<00:00:36.450> I'm<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.840> view<00:00:37.410> by<00:00:37.559> large

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
and then I'm going to view by large

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.850 
and then I'm going to view by large
icons<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.640> go<00:00:38.940> into<00:00:39.120> device<00:00:39.570> manager<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
icons and go into device manager and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.430 
icons and go into device manager and
under<00:00:41.760> display<00:00:42.210> devices<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
under display devices you can see the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.350 
under display devices you can see the
brand<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.920> your<00:00:44.100> graphics<00:00:44.550> card<00:00:44.760> now<00:00:44.940> -<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
brand of your graphics card now - the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.700 
brand of your graphics card now - the
ATI<00:00:45.829> which<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.070> AMD<00:00:47.660> now<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:49.140> may<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:49.500> always

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
ATI which is AMD now this may not always

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.029 
ATI which is AMD now this may not always
work<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:51.030> may<00:00:51.180> see<00:00:51.239> unknown<00:00:51.870> devices<00:00:52.260> or<00:00:52.649> you

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
work you may see unknown devices or you

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.040 
work you may see unknown devices or you
may<00:00:53.190> not<00:00:53.370> even<00:00:53.550> see<00:00:53.879> I'll<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.570> play<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.899> after

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
may not even see I'll just play it after

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.490 
may not even see I'll just play it after
at<00:00:55.410> all<00:00:55.879> so<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.539> second<00:00:57.960> step<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.350> can

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
at all so the second step that I can

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.580 
at all so the second step that I can
think<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.250> looking<00:01:00.120> outside<00:01:00.359> your<00:01:00.899> PC<00:01:01.379> if

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
think of is looking outside your PC if

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.579 
think of is looking outside your PC if
you<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> laptop<00:01:02.280> right<00:01:02.969> next<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:04.140> your

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
you have a laptop right next to your

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.420 
you have a laptop right next to your
trackpad<00:01:05.369> you're<00:01:05.790> gonna<00:01:05.909> see<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> sticker<00:01:07.430> it

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
trackpad you're gonna see a sticker it

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.719 
trackpad you're gonna see a sticker it
either<00:01:08.700> says<00:01:09.030> premium<00:01:09.780> vision<00:01:10.140> AMD<00:01:10.680> or<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.580> may

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
either says premium vision AMD or it may

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.600 
either says premium vision AMD or it may
say<00:01:11.939> powered<00:01:12.420> by<00:01:12.570> Nvidia<00:01:13.229> now<00:01:13.890> that's<00:01:14.310> another

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
say powered by Nvidia now that's another

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.899 
say powered by Nvidia now that's another
way<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.150> determine<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:17.159> brand<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.759> your

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
way you can determine the brand of your

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.899 
way you can determine the brand of your
graphics<00:01:18.390> card<00:01:19.280> okay<00:01:20.280> now<00:01:20.490> once<00:01:20.729> you've

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
graphics card okay now once you've

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.820 
graphics card okay now once you've
determined<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.720> brand<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.229> graphics<00:01:22.619> card

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
determined the brand of graphics card

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.210 
determined the brand of graphics card
you<00:01:23.100> need<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.850> determine<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.750> model<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:26.070> order

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
you need to determine the model in order

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.550 
you need to determine the model in order
to<00:01:26.520> download<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> appropriate<00:01:27.119> driver<00:01:27.720> now

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
to download the appropriate driver now

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.830 
to download the appropriate driver now
what<00:01:28.799> some<00:01:28.979> people<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.790> go<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.329> web<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
what some people do is go on the web and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.710 
what some people do is go on the web and
search<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.350> their<00:01:32.009> model<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.880> find<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.450> driver

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
search up their model and find a driver

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.590 
search up their model and find a driver
but<00:01:34.110> that's<00:01:34.920> difficult<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:36.090> do<00:01:36.329> is

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
but that's difficult what you can do is

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.890 
but that's difficult what you can do is
basically<00:01:37.079> use<00:01:37.619> an<00:01:37.890> auto<00:01:38.640> detect<00:01:39.210> tool<00:01:39.570> that

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
basically use an auto detect tool that

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.039 
basically use an auto detect tool that
will<00:01:40.200> basically<00:01:40.650> scan<00:01:41.400> your<00:01:41.579> system<00:01:41.810> find<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
will basically scan your system find the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.620 
will basically scan your system find the
graphics<00:01:43.710> card<00:01:43.920> model<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.460> make<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.909> then

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
graphics card model and make and then

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.810 
graphics card model and make and then
it's<00:01:45.810> gonna<00:01:45.960> download<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.950> correct<00:01:47.250> driver

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
it's gonna download the correct driver

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.179 
it's gonna download the correct driver
now<00:01:48.689> I'm<00:01:48.780> gonna<00:01:48.960> go<00:01:49.110> through<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.560> Nvidia

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
now I'm gonna go through the Nvidia

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.359 
now I'm gonna go through the Nvidia
setup<00:01:50.520> first<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.210> let's<00:01:51.420> open<00:01:51.630> up<00:01:51.840> web<00:01:52.140> browser

graphics card you have what you can do

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.830 
graphics card you have what you can do
is<00:02:32.170> come<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.500> Nvidia<00:02:32.980> calm<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:34.000> scan<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.660> and

that<00:02:39.010> means<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:39.790> probably<00:02:40.000> have<00:02:40.530> AMD

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
that means that you probably have AMD

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.900 
that means that you probably have AMD
driver<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:44.440> as<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.709> can<00:02:44.830> see<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:45.040> don't<00:02:45.610> have<00:02:45.760> an
