her back but when it was missing is the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.260 
her back but when it was missing is the
brown<00:04:11.040> headed<00:04:11.250> one<00:04:11.460> has<00:04:11.610> one<00:04:11.880> spot<00:04:12.090> on<00:04:12.120> her

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
brown headed one has one spot on her

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.690 
brown headed one has one spot on her
back<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.780> she<00:04:12.920> was<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:14.250> way<00:04:14.430> I<00:04:14.460> don't<00:04:14.610> know

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
back and she was that way I don't know

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.620 
back and she was that way I don't know
if<00:04:14.760> y'all<00:04:14.910> can<00:04:15.000> see<00:04:15.090> those<00:04:15.210> chicken<00:04:15.510> houses

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
if y'all can see those chicken houses

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.750 
if y'all can see those chicken houses
over<00:04:15.990> there<00:04:16.020> but<00:04:16.920> she<00:04:17.130> was<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.340> little<00:04:17.640> further

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
over there but she was a little further

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.280 
over there but she was a little further
than<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.540> little<00:04:18.900> bit<00:04:19.049> over<00:04:19.260> that

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
than that a little bit over that

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.680 
than that a little bit over that
direction<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.340> I<00:04:20.520> guess<00:04:20.760> when<00:04:21.270> those<00:04:21.419> dogs

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
direction and I guess when those dogs

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.180 
direction and I guess when those dogs
had<00:04:21.900> scared<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.229> other<00:04:22.260> one<00:04:22.560> she<00:04:22.800> just<00:04:23.010> kept

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
had scared the other one she just kept

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.330 
had scared the other one she just kept
on<00:04:23.400> running<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.910> never<00:04:24.060> stopped

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
on running and never stopped

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.710 
on running and never stopped
so<00:04:25.460> a<00:04:25.490> nice<00:04:25.730> couple<00:04:26.090> over<00:04:26.180> there<00:04:26.300> had<00:04:26.480> caught

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
so a nice couple over there had caught

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.950 
so a nice couple over there had caught
her<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.280> had<00:04:28.280> her<00:04:28.310> in<00:04:28.550> a<00:04:28.610> pen<00:04:28.880> and<00:04:29.120> she<00:04:29.840> was

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
her and had her in a pen and she was

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.300 
her and had her in a pen and she was
drawn<00:04:30.230> down<00:04:30.440> for<00:04:30.650> being<00:04:30.800> chased<00:04:31.040> by<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.250> dog

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
drawn down for being chased by the dog

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.510 
drawn down for being chased by the dog
so<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:32.030> guess<00:04:32.389> it<00:04:32.540> was<00:04:32.720> two<00:04:33.110> days<00:04:33.260> ago<00:04:33.320> they<00:04:34.310> came

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
so I guess it was two days ago they came

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.010 
so I guess it was two days ago they came
by<00:04:34.700> said<00:04:34.760> hey<00:04:35.060> I<00:04:35.090> heard<00:04:35.330> you're<00:04:35.510> missing<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:35.870> go
