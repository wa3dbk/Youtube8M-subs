00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
got severe thunderstorms your flood

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.019 
got severe thunderstorms your flood
sighs<00:00:14.839> and<00:00:15.290> you've<00:00:15.950> also<00:00:16.070> got<00:00:16.279> heat<00:00:16.490> so

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029

starting<00:00:17.509> with<00:00:17.570> tropical<00:00:18.200> cyclones<00:00:18.710> there<00:00:19.610> of

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
starting with tropical cyclones there of

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.650 
starting with tropical cyclones there of
course<00:00:19.849> dangerous<00:00:20.329> they<00:00:20.480> produce

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
course dangerous they produce

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.749 
course dangerous they produce
destructive<00:00:21.439> winds<00:00:21.680> heavy<00:00:22.070> rainfall<00:00:22.610> with

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
destructive winds heavy rainfall with

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.030 
destructive winds heavy rainfall with
flooding<00:00:23.059> and<00:00:23.300> they<00:00:23.809> also<00:00:23.989> produce<00:00:24.619> damaging

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.040 
flooding and they also produce damaging

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.880 
flooding and they also produce damaging
storm<00:00:25.669> surges<00:00:25.970> so<00:00:26.239> that's<00:00:26.419> when<00:00:26.570> you<00:00:26.660> get

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
storm surges so that's when you get

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.170 
storm surges so that's when you get
inundation<00:00:27.890> of<00:00:27.980> low-lying<00:00:28.340> coastal<00:00:28.669> areas

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
inundation of low-lying coastal areas

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.630 
inundation of low-lying coastal areas
now<00:00:29.840> in<00:00:30.590> Queensland<00:00:31.160> is<00:00:31.309> an<00:00:31.399> average<00:00:31.610> of

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
now in Queensland is an average of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.209 
now in Queensland is an average of
around<00:00:31.790> five<00:00:32.270> tropical<00:00:32.989> cyclones<00:00:33.500> per<00:00:33.920> year

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
around five tropical cyclones per year

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:36.790 
around five tropical cyclones per year
in<00:00:34.370> Queensland<00:00:34.910> waters<00:00:35.300> but<00:00:35.839> generally

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
in Queensland waters but generally

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.380 
in Queensland waters but generally
there's<00:00:37.010> only<00:00:37.160> around<00:00:37.460> one<00:00:37.730> or<00:00:37.760> two<00:00:37.910> that's

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
there's only around one or two that's

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.840 
there's only around one or two that's
actually<00:00:38.719> crossed<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.109> coast<00:00:39.320> now<00:00:40.249> this<00:00:40.640> year

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
actually crossed the coast now this year

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.029 
actually crossed the coast now this year
we're<00:00:41.059> actually<00:00:41.210> in<00:00:41.570> an<00:00:41.690> El<00:00:41.899> Nino<00:00:42.039> situation

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
we're actually in an El Nino situation

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.759 
we're actually in an El Nino situation
in<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.699> Pacific<00:00:44.149> Ocean<00:00:44.559> basically<00:00:45.559> what<00:00:45.739> that

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
in the Pacific Ocean basically what that

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.770 
in the Pacific Ocean basically what that
means<00:00:45.920> for<00:00:46.190> us<00:00:46.399> is<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.940> sea<00:00:47.480> surface

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
means for us is the sea surface

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.649 
means for us is the sea surface
temperatures<00:00:48.409> are<00:00:48.710> below<00:00:49.070> average<00:00:49.519> off<00:00:50.210> the

Queen and close and that generally leads

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.509

to a below average number of tropical

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.579 
to a below average number of tropical
cyclones<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:56.300> you<00:00:56.600> also<00:00:56.749> get<00:00:56.929> flood<00:00:57.260> events

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
cyclones and you also get flood events

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:58.989 
cyclones and you also get flood events
in<00:00:57.710> eastern<00:00:58.010> Queensland<00:00:58.489> not<00:00:58.789> from

thunderstorms or cell phones but just

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.469 
thunderstorms or cell phones but just
when<00:01:00.679> you<00:01:00.769> have<00:01:00.949> heavy<00:01:01.339> rain<00:01:01.640> coming<00:01:02.059> in<00:01:02.149> from

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479 
when you have heavy rain coming in from

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.380 
when you have heavy rain coming in from
moist<00:01:03.050> onshore<00:01:03.530> winds<00:01:03.800> de<00:01:03.979> peak<00:01:04.250> for<00:01:04.940> flood

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
moist onshore winds de peak for flood

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.780 
moist onshore winds de peak for flood
events<00:01:05.690> in<00:01:05.810> January<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:06.560> March<00:01:06.590> it's<00:01:07.430> a

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
events in January to March it's a

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.700 
events in January to March it's a
rainfall<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:08.450> flooding<00:01:08.720> should<00:01:09.170> not<00:01:09.410> be<00:01:09.590> as

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
rainfall and flooding should not be as

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.680 
rainfall and flooding should not be as
extensive<00:01:10.160> as<00:01:10.430> in<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.880> past<00:01:11.030> two<00:01:11.420> seasons

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
extensive as in the past two seasons

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.900 
extensive as in the past two seasons
this<00:01:12.080> year<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:12.500> that's<00:01:12.560> also<00:01:12.860> due<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:13.310> El<00:01:13.700> Nino

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
this year and that's also due to El Nino

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.660 
this year and that's also due to El Nino
so<00:01:14.240> generally<00:01:14.780> Phil<00:01:15.320> Meadows<00:01:15.710> bring<00:01:16.130> hotter

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
so generally Phil Meadows bring hotter

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.550 
so generally Phil Meadows bring hotter
and<00:01:16.940> drier<00:01:17.270> conditions<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:18.170> eastern

and drier conditions to eastern

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.740 
and drier conditions to eastern
Australia<00:01:19.040> now<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:19.880> bushfire<00:01:20.300> season<00:01:20.510> of<00:01:20.690> the

Queensland goes from spring to early

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.820 
Queensland goes from spring to early
