00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
significant I just like the way that I

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:38.970 
significant I just like the way that I
made<00:02:37.569> chose<00:02:38.019> to<00:02:38.230> do<00:02:38.349> that<00:02:38.560> at<00:02:38.799> those

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
made chose to do that at those

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.970 
made chose to do that at those
particular<00:02:39.459> times<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.969> mean<00:02:40.439> the<00:02:41.439> pickpocket

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
particular times I mean the pickpocket

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.789 
particular times I mean the pickpocket
if<00:02:42.069> it<00:02:42.219> actually<00:02:42.430> occurs<00:02:43.269> that<00:02:43.989> way<00:02:44.260> but<00:02:44.560> I

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
if it actually occurs that way but I

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.349 
if it actually occurs that way but I
think<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.639> took<00:02:45.730> some<00:02:45.970> liberties<00:02:46.120> with

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
think that it took some liberties with

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.159 
think that it took some liberties with
that<00:02:46.810> one<00:02:47.079> scene<00:02:47.319> they're<00:02:47.590> all<00:02:48.659> and<00:02:49.659> they<00:02:49.840> they

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:50.169 
that one scene they're all and they they

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.770 
that one scene they're all and they they
do<00:02:50.230> change<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.829> lot<00:02:50.919> of<00:02:51.069> things<00:02:51.220> around<00:02:51.370> here

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
do change a lot of things around here

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.149 
do change a lot of things around here
that<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.900> have<00:02:53.019> now<00:02:53.349> that<00:02:53.500> I've<00:02:53.590> read<00:02:53.859> the<00:02:53.889> mob

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
that I have now that I've read the mob

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.470 
that I have now that I've read the mob
out<00:02:54.340> with<00:02:54.519> do<00:02:54.639> i<00:02:54.730> do<00:02:54.790> notice<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.359> they're

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
out with do i do notice that they're

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.059 
out with do i do notice that they're
taking<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.810> lot<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:55.989> liberties<00:02:56.260> but<00:02:56.560> at<00:02:56.889> the

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
taking a lot of liberties but at the

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.979 
taking a lot of liberties but at the
pacing<00:02:57.489> that<00:02:57.609> they're<00:02:57.760> going<00:02:58.000> at<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.419> believe

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989
