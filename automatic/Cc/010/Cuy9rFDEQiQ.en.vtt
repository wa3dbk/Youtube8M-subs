the<00:01:19.890> band<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.369> planners<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.390> twenty<00:01:21.780> dollars

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
the band do planners are twenty dollars

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.080 
the band do planners are twenty dollars
for<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.470> particular<00:01:22.650> size<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:24.000> they

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
for this particular size and then they

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.030 
for this particular size and then they
also<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> larger<00:01:24.780> size<00:01:24.930> which<00:01:25.259> i<00:01:25.380> think<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
also have a larger size which i think is

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.980

more<00:01:26.909> equivalent<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.720> Erin<00:01:27.960> Condren

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
more equivalent to the Erin Condren

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.530
