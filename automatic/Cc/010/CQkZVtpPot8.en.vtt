00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.950
 the 80s were wonderful everything was 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.080
 beautiful cartoons technology film 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.880
 music events of importance 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.769
 there was nothing bad in the world 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.539
 just nothing 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:21.090
 well maybe something if fashion over the years 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.670
 80 we dressed like losers and that's it 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.340
 there they do not hope for a way that was certain then 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.619
 it will be the model then but remember it 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.779
 remember the shoulder pads these women who 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.540
 they looked like an American playmaker with 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.489
 puff shirts with sober colors like the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.879
 make up of jam and all the holograms 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.469
 blues and shapeless that were laid on 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.200
 pants that are not that they were for life 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.539
 high were directly axillary stuff 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.910
 from fantozzi or worse still widespread 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.410
 that if I remain hung but still serious 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.719
 only normal 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.270
 the hello effect are in the salami of the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.039
 levoni was practically assured 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.140
 in the 80s they were in short to stay 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.570
 there were these shorts these mini skirts 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.430
 that they could not be dark blacks no a 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.379
 those times were bright colors 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.360
 were the years of fluorescent tones that stuff 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.420
 a philosophical point of view we could 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.909
 read how we get out of the 70s 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.310
 gray and now we want to shout to the world 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.290
 our desire for color actually was 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.689
 simply the desire to look 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.259
 of traffic lights with pink and yellow legs 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.950
 green 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.680
 were the dullest shades for i 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.390
 little boys there was a pretty phenomenon 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.369
 characterizing the paninari also where 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.200
 I live a stone's throw from Austria 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.509
 the periphery of the empire had arrived 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.250
 this fashion though if we looked at Milan 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.850
 as a kind of cradle of civilization 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.920
 western 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.840
 we had to make do with that 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.759
 that came the sweatshirts were of the best 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.369
 the burlington socks company 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.810
 various clothing from the naj oleari that alone 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.329
 think about it now you have to ask 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.770
 because these lunar rainbows said 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.020
 harmony memory and then 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.600
 the timeless moncler the price was 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.030
 ben high honecker was completely 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.070
 out of the grace of god 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.990
 I remember timberland that cost like the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.619
 practically 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.310
 personal memory was 1987 and I was the first 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.960
 of my class 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.910
 I arrived at school with my green sweatshirt 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.190
 with hood of the best company with 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.930
 so much of a raccoon at the height of the heart 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.489
 I think I used it even when 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.440
 I could only fit one arm 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.019
 envy on the part of my companions 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.519
 I called pro polani and desperation of the 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.530
 parents when one day the pen 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:27.340
 fountain pen decided that on the green there 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.780
 all blue was damn good 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.670
 clothing that we could still make 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.099
 disappear under one of the ugliest things 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.950
 never created by the history of tailoring 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.140
 the bomber jacket that made you 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.360
 look like a michelin or a little man 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.430
 huge titanic garbage bag 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.170
 within reach 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.120
 and so here is that from this triumph of 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.700
 fabrics sticking out a head that 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.849
 he tended to be very cottony 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.650
 tata francesca or with clean or tail 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.180
 of horse for the boys instead 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.950
 that thing it was based on 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.269
 laterally the crapa and above shoots but ne 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.329
 there is a kind of atomic mushroom on the feet 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.639
 plus timberland all star moccasins e 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.470
 the espadrilles has no ravaro that 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.569
 girls wandered with leg warmers 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.400
 because flashdance has absolutely no 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.920
 left no consequence 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.500
 or even gloves without fingers 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.720
 because madonna had left no one 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.069
 result 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.840
 and here I stop because I want to leave 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.269
 spaces to your memories but above all 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.329
 answer this because in 2015 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.790
 when it was decided to import with 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.769
 decision something from the 80s have 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.690
 opted for fashion you see them 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.970
 quest espadrilles these things to 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.340
 paninari or trousers with the 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.500
 lapels are not overwhelmingly 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.799
 back in our closets but why 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.799
 write comments and above all 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.799
 enlighten
