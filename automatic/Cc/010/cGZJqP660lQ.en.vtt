like really important or anything but

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.270 
like really important or anything but
the<00:00:09.710> the<00:00:10.710> idea<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.250> like<00:00:11.460> when<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.360> have<00:00:12.389> like

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
the the idea of like when you have like

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.770 
the the idea of like when you have like
dreads<00:00:14.280> like<00:00:14.519> really<00:00:14.880> long<00:00:15.089> like<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.540> how<00:00:15.719> do

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
dreads like really long like this how do

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.170 
dreads like really long like this how do
you<00:00:15.929> deal<00:00:16.139> with<00:00:16.350> them<00:00:16.670> when<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.730> go<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:17.970> work

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
you deal with them when you go to work

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.429 
you deal with them when you go to work
or<00:00:18.510> whatever<00:00:18.660> people<00:00:19.699> often<00:00:21.080> think<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.320> when

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
or whatever people often think that when

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.870 
or whatever people often think that when
you<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.619> dreads<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.730> can't<00:00:23.970> really

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
you have dreads that you can't really

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.300 
you have dreads that you can't really
can't<00:00:26.880> really<00:00:27.260> use<00:00:28.260> them<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.010> lot<00:00:29.189> of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
can't really use them in a lot of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.910 
can't really use them in a lot of
different<00:00:29.609> places<00:00:29.820> because<00:00:30.539> they<00:00:31.230> look<00:00:31.740> all

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
different places because they look all

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.040 
different places because they look all
struggling<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.820> dirty<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.860> I<00:00:35.809> guess<00:00:36.809> that's

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
struggling and dirty and I guess that's

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.430 
struggling and dirty and I guess that's
untrustworthy<00:00:40.050> kind<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:42.200> sentiment<00:00:43.200> that's

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
untrustworthy kind of sentiment that's

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
untrustworthy kind of sentiment that's
expressed<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:45.329> what<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> basically<00:00:45.629> do<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.680> if

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
expressed so what I basically do and if

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.430 
expressed so what I basically do and if
somebody<00:00:47.850> has<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.329> better<00:00:48.629> idea<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.230> would<00:00:49.289> be

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
somebody has a better idea that would be

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.090 
somebody has a better idea that would be
great<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.969> used<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.930> tie<00:00:52.440> these<00:00:52.770> from

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
great but I used to just tie these from

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.670 
great but I used to just tie these from
all<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.090> way<00:00:54.210> into<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> back<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.289> hold<00:00:55.469> up

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
all the way into the back and hold up

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.700 
all the way into the back and hold up
the<00:00:55.920> whole<00:00:56.489> thing<00:00:56.699> but<00:00:57.570> what<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> basically<00:00:58.320> do

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the whole thing but what I basically do

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.150 
the whole thing but what I basically do
is<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:59.039> keep<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.609> top<00:00:59.969> like<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.160> then

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
is just keep the top like that and then

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.830 
is just keep the top like that and then
I<00:01:02.550> pull<00:01:03.019> these<00:01:04.019> side<00:01:04.409> pieces<00:01:06.409> here<00:01:08.810> when<00:01:09.810> I

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
I pull these side pieces here when I

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.340 
I pull these side pieces here when I
pull<00:01:10.110> them<00:01:10.260> out<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.689> try<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.960> leave<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
pull them out and just try to leave the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.840 
pull them out and just try to leave the
back<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.950> hanging<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.280> there<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:15.450> then<00:01:16.850> pull

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
back just hanging in there and then pull

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.620 
back just hanging in there and then pull
them<00:01:17.970> up<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> top<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.820> basically<00:01:21.299> just

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
them up to the top and basically just

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:32.690 
them up to the top and basically just
tie<00:01:21.900> them<00:01:23.659> so<00:01:24.950> pull<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:25.979> through<00:01:29.840> okay<00:01:30.840> so

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
tie them so pull it through okay so

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.600 
tie them so pull it through okay so
you're<00:01:33.700> basically<00:01:34.170> tied<00:01:35.170> on<00:01:35.740> my<00:01:35.920> side<00:01:36.250> and

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
you're basically tied on my side and

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.880 
you're basically tied on my side and
then<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.840> side<00:01:38.080> that<00:01:38.230> I<00:01:38.290> pulled<00:01:38.650> through<00:01:38.860> oh

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
don't know it's just fun to just be as

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.720 
don't know it's just fun to just be as
natural<00:02:09.520> as<00:02:09.550> possible<00:02:10.440> but<00:02:11.490> then<00:02:12.490> you<00:02:12.580> don't

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
natural as possible but then you don't

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.370 
natural as possible but then you don't
have<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:12.940> worry<00:02:13.090> about<00:02:13.210> if<00:02:13.600> you<00:02:13.720> lose<00:02:13.990> one<00:02:14.350> or

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
have to worry about if you lose one or

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.210 
have to worry about if you lose one or
if<00:02:14.680> one<00:02:14.830> breaks<00:02:15.070> whatever<00:02:16.290> okay<00:02:17.290> then<00:02:18.040> you

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
if one breaks whatever okay then you

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.240 
if one breaks whatever okay then you
take<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.580> back<00:02:18.850> part<00:02:19.290> which<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.320> there<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:22.050> I

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
take the back part which is there and I

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.520 
take the back part which is there and I
just<00:02:24.270> have<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.300> preference<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:26.050> put<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.350> right

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
just have a preference to put the right

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.010 
just have a preference to put the right
side<00:02:26.830> over<00:02:27.010> first<00:02:27.550> because<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:28.450> have<00:02:28.570> that<00:02:28.750> bead

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
side over first because I have that bead

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.949 
side over first because I have that bead
in<00:02:29.200> my<00:02:29.320> hair<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:31.620> wrap<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.650> all<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.920> way<00:02:33.070> around

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
in my hair so wrap it all the way around

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.449 
in my hair so wrap it all the way around
and<00:02:34.959> then<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.260> just<00:02:35.910> tuck<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.150> hairs<00:02:37.480> in<00:02:38.100> on<00:02:39.100> top

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
and then I just tuck the hairs in on top

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.560 
and then I just tuck the hairs in on top
of<00:02:39.640> themselves<00:02:40.500> make<00:02:41.500> sure<00:02:41.709> that's<00:02:41.860> all<00:02:42.570> set

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
of themselves make sure that's all set

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.390 
of themselves make sure that's all set
and<00:02:43.870> then<00:02:43.989> I<00:02:44.050> do<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.410> same<00:02:44.620> thing<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:45.250> the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
and then I do the same thing to the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.590 
and then I do the same thing to the
other<00:02:45.430> side<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.750> then<00:02:50.610> also<00:02:51.610> sometimes<00:02:52.390> would

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
other side and then also sometimes would

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.759 
other side and then also sometimes would
spin<00:02:53.019> like<00:02:53.320> twisted<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:55.360> that<00:02:55.540> kind<00:02:55.840> of<00:02:55.930> keeps

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
spin like twisted and that kind of keeps

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.490 
spin like twisted and that kind of keeps
it<00:02:57.010> full<00:02:57.940> of<00:03:00.269> getting<00:03:01.269> to<00:03:01.600> any<00:03:02.019> stragglers

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
it full of getting to any stragglers

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.940 
it full of getting to any stragglers
then<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.430> twist<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:03.910> all<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.180> way<00:03:04.300> around

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
then you twist it all the way around

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.210 
then you twist it all the way around
tuck<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.130> in<00:03:07.080> but<00:03:08.080> if<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.739> don't<00:03:08.860> have<00:03:09.190> a

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
tuck it in but if you don't have a

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.310 
tuck it in but if you don't have a
mirror<00:03:09.670> or<00:03:09.760> something<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:10.450> can<00:03:10.720> kind<00:03:11.019> of<00:03:11.110> just

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
mirror or something it can kind of just

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:19.820 
mirror or something it can kind of just
feel<00:03:11.709> around<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.880> make<00:03:16.360> it<00:03:16.390> like<00:03:16.840> more<00:03:17.140> smooth

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.410 

that

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
that

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.770
