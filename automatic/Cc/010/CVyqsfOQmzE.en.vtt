baseline<00:03:00.090> but<00:03:00.720> like<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.900> said<00:03:00.959> it's<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.260> step<00:03:01.440> in

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
baseline but like I said it's a step in

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.170

the<00:03:01.560> right<00:03:01.739> direction<00:03:02.000> overall<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.030> think

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
the right direction overall I think

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.030 
the right direction overall I think
