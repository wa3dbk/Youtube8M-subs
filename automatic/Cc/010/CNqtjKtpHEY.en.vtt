00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.310
Hey guys!

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.990
This is Jessica from JewelryTutorialHQ.com
and Bespangled Jewelry.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.330
Today I'm going to show you how to make your
own ear wires and I have a neat trick to teach

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.330
you.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.490
It will help you make two exactly the same
at a time!

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.410
I'm using 22 gauge wire, you could also use
20 gauge, and I'm starting with 3 inches and

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.659
you could start with a longer piece of wire
if you prefer a longer ear wire.

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:35.090
I'm using a ruler to measure the midpoint
which for this piece of wire is going to be

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.910
one and a half inches, and I'm using my round
nosed pliers to bend it in half.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.600
So now I have a piece that looks a little
bit like a bobby pin, and I'm going to squeeze

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.140
the end tight with my chain nose pliers.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.060
And just untwist the wires a little bit, and
grab my round nose pliers and grab the loop

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:08.369
at the very end making sure I can't feel it
on the other side of the pliers and twist.

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.920
And reposition the pliers if needed, and keep
twisting the loop around until it touches

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.369
the straight part of the wire and you have
a loop that looks like the letter P.

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.549
Now I'm going to show you how to use a special
pair of pliers - these are Wubber's large

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:26.869
bail making pliers.

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.210
They have two different size round mandrels
as jaws and they are not tapered.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.829
We are going to use the smaller jaw for this
length of wire, and inserting the piece of

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:43.689
wire with the P shape down and to the right
and the smaller jaw on the top.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.950
And pulling this so that the loop is snugly
rested as far as it can go between the jaws,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.369
and bending the wire around the top jaw to
form the ear wire.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.369
Before we separate our ear wires, we're going
to trim the ends using the back edge of our

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.090
flush cutters, just to make sure that they're
the same length - just trim off the tiniest

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.179
bit if needed.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:18.319
And using our chain nose pliers bend out the
very tip at about a 45 degree angle, this

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.569
makes it easier to put the ear wires in your
ear, and it gives it a nice finished look.

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.350
Now we're ready to separate.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:32.410
Again, using the back edge of your flush cutters,
just cut the very top of that loop that connects

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.959
the two pieces.

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.959
One last thing - we need to smooth the ends
of the ear wires and I'm going to show you

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.510
two ways to do that.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.060
The first is using a specialty tool that makes
the job much easier and faster.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.659
It's called a 'cup bur' and I have mine inserted
in a pin vise.

00:02:52.659 --> 00:03:00.799
You place the wire in the end of the tool
and twist it around in one direction around

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.799
and it's always good to get about a 45 degree
angle on it as well just to make sure you

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.370
get the edge nice and rounded.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.050
Before I show you the other way to smooth
the end of the wire, I'm actually going to

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.360
show you another way to make your ear wires
without a special pair of pliers.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.589
Now obviously the pliers makes it a lot easier,
but you can also use a round wooden pencil

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:35.299
- this is actually about the same size as
the mandrel I used.

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:43.510
Press firmly to hold the loop in place against
the pencil and bend the wire around.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.590
And the tricky part is getting the wire around
without it slipping or twisting.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.129
Of course it can be done but like most things
it takes a little bit of practice.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:06.610
After you trim the ends and separate the loops,
another way to finish the ends is with a file.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.681
Be sure to only make contact with the metal
on the down stroke if you're using one of

00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:14.329
these files like this.

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.110
It takes a little bit longer than I'm showing
you.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:24.280
You need to make sure you get all the way
around and all angles, and keep going until

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.220
the ends are nice and smooth.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:35.039
When you are ready to use your ear wire you
simply attach your drop or charm, or whatever

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.039
you want to use.

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.460
I'm using a wire wrapped briolette.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.330
You just slip it on the loop and use your
round nose pliers to twist that loop closed.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:53.750
If you'd like to learn how to wire wrap a
briolette I'll link to a video where I show

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.480
you how to do that.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.139
And if you're interested, I also have a recent
video tutorial showing you how to make these

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.020
cool diamond shaped ear wires as well.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.919
I hope you enjoyed this project and that you'll
come back and see me soon.
