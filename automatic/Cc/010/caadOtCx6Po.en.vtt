00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
but as for the sandwich itself it's

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.150 
but as for the sandwich itself it's
definitely<00:02:30.140> not<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.290> bad<00:02:30.530> sandwich<00:02:30.800> now<00:02:31.100> the

best<00:02:49.760> part<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.270> sandwich<00:02:50.570> which<00:02:50.810> oddly

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
best part of the sandwich which oddly

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.600 
best part of the sandwich which oddly
enough<00:02:51.290> like<00:02:51.470> I<00:02:51.530> said<00:02:51.770> it<00:02:51.980> really<00:02:52.220> wasn't<00:02:52.520> the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
enough like I said it really wasn't the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.970 
enough like I said it really wasn't the
turkey<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.150> was<00:02:53.330> tasty<00:02:53.750> but<00:02:53.930> I<00:02:54.500> kind<00:02:54.860> of

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
turkey that I was tasty but I kind of

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.770 
turkey that I was tasty but I kind of
but<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.730> broke<00:02:55.940> off<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.120> little<00:02:56.300> piece<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:56.690> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
but I broke off a little piece of the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.600 
but I broke off a little piece of the
turkey<00:02:57.110> with<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.380> Swiss<00:02:57.590> cheese<00:02:57.860> on<00:02:57.890> top<00:02:58.370> and

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
turkey with the Swiss cheese on top and

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.670 
turkey with the Swiss cheese on top and
tried<00:02:58.910> that<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.660> turkey<00:02:59.990> for<00:03:00.020> itself<00:03:00.470> I

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
tried that and the turkey for itself I

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.050 
tried that and the turkey for itself I
mean<00:03:00.830> like<00:03:00.980> I<00:03:01.040> said<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.310> flavor<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.760> not

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
mean like I said the flavor is not

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.550 
mean like I said the flavor is not
really<00:03:02.330> all<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.540> overwhelming<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.410> does

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
really all that overwhelming it does

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.470 
really all that overwhelming it does
have<00:03:03.740> a<00:03:03.770> nice<00:03:03.950> turkey<00:03:04.580> taste<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.210> doesn't

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
have a nice turkey taste it doesn't

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.240 
have a nice turkey taste it doesn't
taste<00:03:05.660> overly<00:03:06.110> process<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.800> does<00:03:06.950> taste

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
taste overly process it does taste

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.340 
taste overly process it does taste
somewhat<00:03:07.640> thin<00:03:08.090> they<00:03:08.270> sliced<00:03:08.600> turkey<00:03:08.930> breast

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
somewhat thin they sliced turkey breast

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.740 
somewhat thin they sliced turkey breast
with<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.860> slight<00:03:10.220> smoky<00:03:10.640> turkey<00:03:10.940> flavor<00:03:11.150> that

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
with a slight smoky turkey flavor that

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.790 
with a slight smoky turkey flavor that
actually<00:03:12.050> went<00:03:12.200> pretty<00:03:12.230> well<00:03:12.440> with<00:03:12.770> the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
actually went pretty well with the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.860 
actually went pretty well with the
sandwich<00:03:13.310> if<00:03:13.490> I<00:03:13.730> could<00:03:13.940> taste<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.270> more<00:03:14.480> and

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
sandwich if I could taste it more and

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.420 
sandwich if I could taste it more and
like<00:03:15.050> I<00:03:15.140> said<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.440> lettuce<00:03:15.710> and<00:03:15.830> tomato<00:03:16.100> kinda

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
like I said the lettuce and tomato kinda

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.890 
like I said the lettuce and tomato kinda
took<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.640> backseat<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.330> meat<00:03:17.510> was<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.690> little

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
took a backseat the meat was a little

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.540 
took a backseat the meat was a little
bit<00:03:18.020> more<00:03:18.140> overpowering<00:03:18.470> than<00:03:18.980> those<00:03:19.160> veggies

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
bit more overpowering than those veggies

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.680 
bit more overpowering than those veggies
they<00:03:19.670> were<00:03:19.760> kind<00:03:19.970> of<00:03:20.030> just<00:03:20.090> there<00:03:20.420> didn't

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
they were kind of just there didn't

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.540 
they were kind of just there didn't
really<00:03:20.900> add<00:03:21.020> much<00:03:21.050> to<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:22.250> managed

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
really add much to it and the managed

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.980 
really add much to it and the managed
just<00:03:22.700> kind<00:03:22.940> of<00:03:22.970> helped<00:03:23.240> enhance<00:03:23.390> all<00:03:23.840> the

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
just kind of helped enhance all the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.080 
just kind of helped enhance all the
flavor<00:03:24.260> all<00:03:24.980> together<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.730> I<00:03:25.790> think<00:03:26.000> this

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
flavor all together and I think this

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.640 
flavor all together and I think this
sandwich<00:03:26.330> me<00:03:26.570> pretty<00:03:26.810> good<00:03:26.990> with<00:03:27.260> some<00:03:27.440> ranch

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
sandwich me pretty good with some ranch

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.650 
sandwich me pretty good with some ranch
instead<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.340> mayonnaise<00:03:28.640> but<00:03:29.150> either<00:03:29.330> way

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
instead of the mayonnaise but either way

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.210 
instead of the mayonnaise but either way
it<00:03:29.960> definitely<00:03:30.410> needed<00:03:30.620> some<00:03:30.740> kind<00:03:31.040> of<00:03:31.100> a

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
it definitely needed some kind of a

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.590 
it definitely needed some kind of a
sauce<00:03:31.430> just<00:03:31.700> to<00:03:31.850> kind<00:03:32.030> of<00:03:32.060> help<00:03:32.150> bring<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.480> all

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
sauce just to kind of help bring it all

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.750 
sauce just to kind of help bring it all
together<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.680> last<00:03:33.890> but<00:03:33.980> not<00:03:34.130> least<00:03:34.190> for<00:03:34.610> that

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
together and last but not least for that

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.160 
together and last but not least for that
wheat<00:03:34.940> bun<00:03:35.180> it<00:03:35.420> did<00:03:35.570> have<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.750> nice<00:03:35.960> sweet

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
wheat bun it did have a nice sweet

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.720

flavor<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:36.680> wasn't<00:03:36.980> too<00:03:37.070> artificial<00:03:37.430> tasting

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
flavor it wasn't too artificial tasting

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.850

either<00:03:38.150> which<00:03:38.390> I<00:03:38.480> kind<00:03:38.720> of<00:03:38.780> enjoyed<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.680> it

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860

think you know something different than

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.230 
think you know something different than
just<00:03:42.860> a<00:03:43.040> regular<00:03:43.220> white<00:03:43.550> button<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:44.060> wheat

deal<00:04:06.440> I<00:04:06.590> mean<00:04:06.770> you<00:04:06.830> get<00:04:06.950> a<00:04:06.980> decent<00:04:07.250> amount<00:04:07.490> of

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
deal I mean you get a decent amount of

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.910 
deal I mean you get a decent amount of
turkey<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.150> quite<00:04:08.450> a<00:04:08.480> bit<00:04:08.690> of<00:04:08.810> bacon<00:04:09.170> but<00:04:09.830> I'm

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
turkey and quite a bit of bacon but I'm

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.440 
turkey and quite a bit of bacon but I'm
not<00:04:10.070> really<00:04:10.220> too<00:04:10.460> sure<00:04:10.490> that<00:04:10.970> is<00:04:11.090> enough<00:04:11.330> to

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
not really too sure that is enough to

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.300 
not really too sure that is enough to
save<00:04:11.660> it<00:04:11.810> so<00:04:11.990> bang<00:04:12.410> for<00:04:12.590> your<00:04:12.680> buck<00:04:12.740> I'm<00:04:13.130> only

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
save it so bang for your buck I'm only

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.770 
save it so bang for your buck I'm only
have<00:04:13.520> to<00:04:13.640> give<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:13.880> a<00:04:13.940> six<00:04:14.120> out<00:04:14.330> of<00:04:14.360> 10<00:04:14.600> because

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
have to give it a six out of 10 because

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.060 
have to give it a six out of 10 because
i<00:04:14.960> think<00:04:15.020> it's<00:04:15.260> somewhat<00:04:15.500> reasonably<00:04:15.860> priced

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
i think it's somewhat reasonably priced

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.890 
i think it's somewhat reasonably priced
for<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.430> amount<00:04:16.880> of<00:04:17.000> meat<00:04:17.180> that<00:04:17.210> is<00:04:17.419> on<00:04:17.600> here

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
for the amount of meat that is on here

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.330 
for the amount of meat that is on here
but<00:04:18.109> at<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.350> same<00:04:18.530> time<00:04:18.680> i<00:04:18.739> think<00:04:18.890> it<00:04:19.100> could<00:04:19.250> be

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
but at the same time i think it could be

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.349 
but at the same time i think it could be
a<00:04:19.370> little<00:04:19.549> bit<00:04:19.760> more

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
a little bit more

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.300 
a little bit more
at<00:04:20.509> least<00:04:20.689> in<00:04:20.870> a<00:04:20.959> turkey<00:04:21.289> in<00:04:21.409> but<00:04:21.919> if<00:04:22.009> you<00:04:22.099> stuck

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
at least in a turkey in but if you stuck

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.559 
at least in a turkey in but if you stuck
