00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.720
 I made repairs on this stove 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.519
 bricks from there did not take out they were 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.380
 normal things are plastered 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:17.430
 added clay right now you are there 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.949
 there was no clay at all we are all here 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.789
 here is smeared here smeared right thousands 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.619
 cold gloss over better on hot three 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.400
 things if we go we agreed to 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.830
 she then 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.000
 and from this brush permanent so here 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:44.500
 smeared it in all the cracks that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:48.630
 may appear and smear this clay there 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.120
 put a new grate inside the firebox 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.850
 bricks on raised a little higher and 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.430
 the grate made an angle 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:02.400
 the walls here the thing worked in just a brick 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.400
 already began to fall off layers 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.220
 here it is this wall brick and and 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.710
 in no case can not be used 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.619
 This is the grate I added here about 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.979
 brick and this brick cut the quarters 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:27.000
 And here it is a class Nick put there 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:34.600
 in this way, now this 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:39.100
 stick ashes sweep that is here 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.240
 Here is necessarily higher brick should 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:47.830
 be and so the hook will not 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.740
 that's there inside the brick is not good 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.409
 and two bricks . 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.939
 we put so that if the checkbox put more 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.580
 one spoon then this stick can go there 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.939
 get into the crack and pull 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.330
 always surely get on the spoons box 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.330
 spoons 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:25.989
 Well, everything did what I wanted length 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:29.250
 Iâ€™ll take a little bit with me because 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:37.260
 what to do this clay is very hard 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:37.260
 all the more autumn all bye
