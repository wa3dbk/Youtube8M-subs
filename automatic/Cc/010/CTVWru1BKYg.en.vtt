00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
than that these are really

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.580 
than that these are really
straightforward<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.870> kill<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.260> shouldn't

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
straightforward to kill and shouldn't

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.500

have<00:01:01.710> any<00:01:01.829> problems<00:01:02.309> there<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> method<00:01:03.449> of

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
have any problems there is a method of

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.570

killing<00:01:03.690> them<00:01:03.899> with<00:01:03.989> me<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:05.010> i<00:01:05.040> find<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
killing them with me but i find that the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.399 
killing them with me but i find that the
melee<00:01:05.850> method<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.540> much<00:01:06.689> more<00:01:06.720> effective

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
melee method is so much more effective

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.520 
melee method is so much more effective
and<00:01:07.530> kills<00:01:07.979> per<00:01:08.250> hour<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.140> hopefully<00:01:10.140> this

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
and kills per hour and hopefully this

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.719 
and kills per hour and hopefully this
will<00:01:10.680> get<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.250> drop<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.580> you're

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
will get you the drop that you're

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.310 
will get you the drop that you're
looking<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:12.150> witches<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.630> course<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.049> gloves

this month prepare has brought a unicorn
I<00:02:54.650> don't<00:02:55.250> really<00:02:55.430> find<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:55.730> necessary<00:02:56.330> but<00:02:57.050> I

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
I don't really find that necessary but I

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.320 
I don't really find that necessary but I
suppose<00:02:57.470> if<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.770> are<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:57.950> bit<00:02:58.160> concerned<00:02:59.060> about

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
suppose if you are a bit concerned about

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.320 
suppose if you are a bit concerned about
how<00:03:00.170> you're<00:03:00.410> going<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.620> be<00:03:00.710> damaged<00:03:01.100> then<00:03:01.610> it

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
how you're going to be damaged then it

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.940 
how you're going to be damaged then it
probably<00:03:02.810> will<00:03:03.050> be<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.230> good<00:03:03.410> idea<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.740> bring

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
probably will be a good idea to bring

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.650 
probably will be a good idea to bring
