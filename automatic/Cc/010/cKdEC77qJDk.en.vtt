00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:20.250

 bending this girl from joe leigh but 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.080
 I think that now they will leave new 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.680
 characters do not come a few facets of 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:34.509
 one that I know 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.509
 but if they come out safe what we wanted 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.560
 do not seriously put that apple on the 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.560
