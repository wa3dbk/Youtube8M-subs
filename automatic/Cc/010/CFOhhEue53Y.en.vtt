00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:07.330
 we are here in heroes second 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:09.330
 section in de morelos and the neighbors we 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.139
 they are showing 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.990
 an access to which a couple installed 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.660
 of tubes to prevent scooters or 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.330
 motorcycles of the same could happen 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.590
 easily and here they explain to us that this 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.840
 has caused a problem with the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.660
 town hall what is owed but 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.960
 fundamentally because it says we're 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.120
 is slowing free access 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.239
 where you can observe that there is no 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.280
 no situation here people go by without 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.899
 no problem is more we have 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.940
 for people who work in both 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.079
 sides for example that are the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.760
 water distributors if they are 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.190
 celestial is opened to them so they can 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.570
 pass freely also people 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.870
 that they have 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.379
 Anyway wheelchair 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.089
 walkers are also removed the two 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.790
 tubes so they can pass without any 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.490
 problem to the only people who have been 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.380
 limited the issue of fatal access 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.350
 Easy are the scooters because 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.259
 this was done because we have suffered 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.869
 assaults robberies and harassment by 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.880
 people who have been riding motorcycles and 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.869
 that could easily pass without any 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.190
 problem 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.870
 3 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.420
 we know that crime is very 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.120
 strong we know that the problem of the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.090
 insecurity and more in the state of mexico 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.100
 and in ecatepec it is fundamental and it is a 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.500
 question of priority why we 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.950
 to control these kinds of issues 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.080
 we put those two which one who is 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.060
 it limits access fundamentally and 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.290
 centrally to the scooters because they were 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.300
 those that caused us the problems 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.000
 both on that side and on this side 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.720
 that happened without any without any 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.190
 problem and this one that came out these 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.180
 the vexations robberies assaults that 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.450
 we suffered here I said a moment ago that 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.940
 He lowered the crime rate and was 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.440
 this when they are put these 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.480
 pipes 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.390
 the criminal index I think at 80 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.970
 percent really how it was and how that 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.680
 It was on Fridays Saturdays and 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.650
 Sundays that was tremendous with the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.110
 motorcycles that even some youngsters 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.520
 they came to skid I know that they did not take 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.130
 as a 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.950
 and like his three b's right now he's quiet 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.950
 at this time it was 20 in the afternoon 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.959
 the pyramids there are some there is a part 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.299
 where they removed a block we went down 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.709
 there they go through our entrance and 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.709
 they came out here and they were leaving 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.910
 this was already taken to jump 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.890
 house of the same moto cities 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.460
 to where the problem was already 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.850
 that we said there is an access to another access 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.030
 here in 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.540
 pachuca on the avenue of life 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.420
 national 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.220
 there are other neighbors equally within 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.410
 she left because of the crisis they jumped 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.900
 booths 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.660
 then anybody if I needed to steal 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.880
 something Roman so simple then 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.710
 what is the position of the city council that 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.020
 He argues because he does not leave us 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.210
 precisely the town hall is the 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.630
 president of heroes fourth which 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.580
 wants and asks the municipality to 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.580
 remove these tubes and you're losing 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.100
 also that record obviously us 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.260
 we have put to our position that 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.450
 it's a condominium regime and if they take away 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.180
 to us this grid is a spoil 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.460
 because it is private property because we are 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.520
 a condominium condominium 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.350
 have forgiveness but the question to me 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.390
 he seemed to see on the municipal side that 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.770
 it's like subdivisions and our 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.960
 color is our housing unit 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.530
 it's like fractionation and obviously 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.240
 we are governed we have the regime 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.340
 of property in condominium and by 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.700
 we therefore we should not 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.650
 govern by the state law of regime in 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.540
 property in condominium then 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.040
 we are attached to that 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.480
 situation because of some other way 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.180
 this one is 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.729
 gate was placed by agreement of the 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.519
 neighbors and that's why that's why 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.109
 operating the apple really the 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.090
 problem is these two tubes that 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.990
 you just saw where you can 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.520
 observe that it is free access is 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.190
 when today is for example to ask 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.860
 there is one of our guardians of 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.630
 the second section is assigned the 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.330
 enough time for people 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.190
 could pass freely and tell them how 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.350
 it's called forgiveness but the person who 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.760
 is the president of the board of 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.760
 citizen participation of the fourth 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.300
 She is the president of the council be 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.360
 point out that the delegate of the fourth 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.580
 section says that by him no problem 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.930
 does not cause any action and they were 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.580
 in agreement we have commented this with 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.800
 some some neighbors of the fourth 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.900
 section and they say what is in the 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.000
 situation or we see that the 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.770
 people pass without any problem is more 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.330
 they removed a tube from the 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.400
 down because supposedly people are 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:19.160
 stumbled a tube for 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.720
 center the bars register this if 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.520
 you realize it does not work anymore 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.130
 and our region is like that because as no 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.350
 has support the bottom part is in 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.790
 our law is totally agree 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.200
 its loose 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:37.570
 agree now then what regime will 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.860
 they rule good, that is if 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:44.410
 extraction to lie is unity 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.720
 parking lot 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.400
 parking and our writings 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.640
 appear as property regime in 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.640
 condominium 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.259
 like to remove this because it 's the most 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.259
 interested 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.130
 In nothing 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.600
 no situation because I think that 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.070
 First, I ask the woman to 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.230
 put to study what is the regime 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.030
 condominal and is aware that already 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.460
 has an entry and if this is right now 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:18.210
 I know it was left open for convenience 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:21.030
 from both colonies the people the people that 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.250
 is dedicated to work the people that we 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.409
 people like to have some security 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:31.319
 that we are united 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:34.939
 this what says in this case the 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:34.939
 municipal government address 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.599
 the dial was in his hands to be able 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.950
 they know they come and get me 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:48.560
 what 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.590
 To consult 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.760
 and at that moment we 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:58.060
 I exhort you to your good judgment 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.920
 in his trial and that really if we 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:04.600
 consider housing units 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:06.670
 and the one that repealed this law that 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.650
 repealed and really go back in 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.390
 vigor because the colonies need it 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.550
 who live this way the units 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:14.500
 housing we do not need that 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.240
 we really are separated because it is 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.450
 very difficult for us as advice 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.220
 of delegation to control a thousand families in 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.100
 a bit so small with so rag 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.190
 problematic of both poverty and 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.140
 lack of education as lack of as 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.450
 guide young people that I think 

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:34.180
 yes that some tubes do not cause them so much 

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.790
 nothing better to support us in a matter of 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.849
 how to channel young people not like 

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:42.419
 retained 

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:45.229
