have happened is this could have been

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.809 
have happened is this could have been
some<00:03:16.540> sort<00:03:16.569> of<00:03:16.810> mutated<00:03:17.500> version<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.160> this

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
some sort of mutated version of this

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.690 
some sort of mutated version of this
strain<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:20.079> infection<00:03:20.799> when<00:03:20.950> injected<00:03:21.489> into

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
strain of infection when injected into

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.729 
strain of infection when injected into
him<00:03:21.790> originally<00:03:22.359> which<00:03:22.870> turned<00:03:23.200> him<00:03:23.380> into<00:03:23.590> a

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
him originally which turned him into a

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.160 
him originally which turned him into a
zombie<00:03:23.859> and<00:03:24.489> now<00:03:25.030> is<00:03:25.359> turning<00:03:25.810> him<00:03:25.900> into

zombie and now is turning him into
something<00:03:26.620> even<00:03:27.280> more<00:03:27.519> so<00:03:27.819> than<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.359> zombie

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
something even more so than a zombie

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
that's one reason to explain why he's

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.930 
that's one reason to explain why he's
become<00:03:31.720> this<00:03:32.019> monster<00:03:32.200> or<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:33.400> could<00:03:33.670> be<00:03:33.790> that

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940

do as they please to cause chaos and to
create<00:04:46.030> even<00:04:46.360> more<00:04:46.389> ways<00:04:46.810> for<00:04:47.050> them<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.380> make

money but in terms of this affecting the

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.210 
money but in terms of this affecting the
gameplay<00:04:50.110> I<00:04:50.290> feel<00:04:50.500> like<00:04:50.650> this<00:04:50.800> is<00:04:50.919> going<00:04:51.040> to<00:04:51.100> be

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
gameplay I feel like this is going to be

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.700 
gameplay I feel like this is going to be
some<00:04:51.490> huge<00:04:51.970> boss<00:04:52.300> round<00:04:52.690> or<00:04:53.169> maybe<00:04:53.350> even

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
some huge boss round or maybe even

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.620 
some huge boss round or maybe even
something<00:04:53.950> which<00:04:54.190> happens<00:04:54.550> during<00:04:54.910> a<00:04:55.240> round

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
something which happens during a round

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.990 
something which happens during a round
it<00:04:55.900> could<00:04:56.080> potentially<00:04:56.230> be<00:04:56.650> a<00:04:57.010> sort<00:04:57.520> of<00:04:57.610> end

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
it could potentially be a sort of end

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.120 
it could potentially be a sort of end
