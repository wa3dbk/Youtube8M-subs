00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
I've got to say that is its best because

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.490 
I've got to say that is its best because
I<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.590> ever<00:00:55.770> heard<00:00:56.780> now<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> bass<00:00:58.199> isn't

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
I have ever heard now the bass isn't

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.279 
I have ever heard now the bass isn't
amazing<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.730> can't<00:01:00.030> kick<00:01:00.300> out<00:01:00.480> too<00:01:00.750> much<00:01:01.020> bass

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
amazing it can't kick out too much bass

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.170 
amazing it can't kick out too much bass
as<00:01:02.120> there's<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.390> low<00:01:03.949> frequency<00:01:04.949> driver<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
as there's a low frequency driver and a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.020 
as there's a low frequency driver and a
mid<00:01:06.420> frequency<00:01:07.200> driver<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.430> then<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.729> course

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
mid frequency driver and then of course

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.950 
mid frequency driver and then of course
the<00:01:09.619> toefl<00:01:10.619> treble<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.810> quite

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the toefl treble but it's quite

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.300 
the toefl treble but it's quite
interesting<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.530> way<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.770> works<00:01:14.010> because

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
interesting the way it works because

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.580 
interesting the way it works because
there's<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> crossover<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.350> one

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
there's like a crossover so this one

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.030 
there's like a crossover so this one
I'll<00:01:17.280> put<00:01:17.610> any<00:01:17.850> mid<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.350> one<00:01:19.530> up<00:01:19.830> for

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
I'll put any mid and this one up for

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.550 
I'll put any mid and this one up for
anything<00:01:20.310> that's<00:01:20.880> too<00:01:21.090> low<00:01:23.360> now<00:01:24.380> with<00:01:25.380> my

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
anything that's too low now with my

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
anything that's too low now with my
experience<00:01:26.159> I've<00:01:26.430> seen<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:26.970> using<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.509> a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
experience I've seen I'm using like a

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.190 
experience I've seen I'm using like a
Sony<00:01:27.930> AV<00:01:28.380> receiver<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.689> it's<00:01:30.689> attached<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
Sony AV receiver here it's attached to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.730 
Sony AV receiver here it's attached to
my<00:01:31.320> gaming<00:01:31.680> computer<00:01:32.130> using<00:01:32.520> iTunes<00:01:33.470> now<00:01:34.470> I

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
my gaming computer using iTunes now I

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.580 
my gaming computer using iTunes now I
have<00:01:35.040> noticed<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:36.829> with<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:38.220> app<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:40.350> best

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
have noticed that with this app the best

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.499 
have noticed that with this app the best
way<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.770> listen<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> audio<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.909> definitely

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
way to listen to the audio is definitely

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.310 
way to listen to the audio is definitely
through<00:01:42.720> digital<00:01:43.159> now<00:01:44.159> I'm<00:01:44.430> using<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:45.320> HDMI

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
through digital now I'm using a HDMI

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.749 
through digital now I'm using a HDMI
audio<00:01:46.500> connection<00:01:48.380> but<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.680> use<00:01:49.860> optical

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
audio connection but you can use optical

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.920 
audio connection but you can use optical
audio<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.479> wanted<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:52.009> but<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:54.479> analog

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
audio if you wanted to but the analog

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.410 
audio if you wanted to but the analog
gain<00:01:54.960> was<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.560> had<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.520> sound<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:57.000> sounded

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
gain was that I had the sound of sounded

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.120 
gain was that I had the sound of sounded
washed<00:01:57.689> out<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.140> these<00:01:58.350> vehicles<00:01:58.680> when<00:01:58.979> with

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
washed out with these vehicles when with

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.789 
washed out with these vehicles when with
digital<00:01:59.670> yeah<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.869> could<00:02:01.049> really<00:02:01.320> hear<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
digital yeah you could really hear the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.870 
digital yeah you could really hear the
detail<00:02:03.020> now<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.979> way<00:02:05.130> these<00:02:05.280> speakers<00:02:05.640> move

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
detail now the way these speakers move

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.820 
detail now the way these speakers move
are<00:02:06.060> quite<00:02:06.240> interesting<00:02:06.810> actually

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
are quite interesting actually

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.980 
are quite interesting actually
now<00:02:09.490> they're<00:02:09.700> not<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.880> biggest<00:02:10.390> drivers<00:02:10.870> in

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
now they're not the biggest drivers in

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.780 
now they're not the biggest drivers in
the<00:02:11.110> world<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.680> get<00:02:12.310> my<00:02:12.460> PhD<00:02:12.730> after<00:02:13.120> comparison

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.040 

they're<00:02:18.790> not<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.030> biggest<00:02:19.360> drivers<00:02:19.780> but<00:02:19.960> they

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
they're not the biggest drivers but they

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.880 
they're not the biggest drivers but they
do<00:02:20.110> pop<00:02:20.470> out<00:02:20.710> a<00:02:20.740> lot<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:22.500> lot<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.530> power

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
do pop out a lot of a lot of power

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.480 
do pop out a lot of a lot of power
they're<00:02:24.490> 120<00:02:25.270> watts<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.720> believe<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.310> a

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
they're 120 watts I believe this is a

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.060 
they're 120 watts I believe this is a
hundred<00:02:27.820> watt<00:02:28.030> receiver<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:29.710> if<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:29.920> watch

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
hundred watt receiver and if you watch

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.800 
hundred watt receiver and if you watch
my<00:02:30.100> channel<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.760> know<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.150> had<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.330> pair<00:02:31.660> of

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
my channel you know that I had a pair of

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.850 
my channel you know that I had a pair of
gold<00:02:32.080> little<00:02:32.620> speakers<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.370> know<00:02:33.640> they're<00:02:34.320> um<00:02:35.320> I

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
gold little speakers I know they're um I

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.770 
gold little speakers I know they're um I
used<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.340> use<00:02:36.430> them<00:02:36.580> as<00:02:36.730> my<00:02:36.850> main<00:02:37.090> fronts

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
used to use them as my main fronts

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.340 
used to use them as my main fronts
because<00:02:38.200> they<00:02:38.440> were<00:02:38.680> horrible<00:02:39.630> for<00:02:40.630> bass<00:02:40.840> and
