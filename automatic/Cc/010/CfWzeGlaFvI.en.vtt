good thing about life plane as it makes

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.230 
good thing about life plane as it makes
it<00:01:44.060> very<00:01:44.270> hard<00:01:44.540> view<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.140> be<00:01:45.230> miss<00:01:46.240> putting

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.110 

I<00:01:54.750> think<00:01:55.260> cycle<00:01:55.890> safety<00:01:56.190> in<00:01:56.250> London<00:01:56.580> is<00:01:56.790> not

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
I think cycle safety in London is not

all about bicycles

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.500 
all about bicycles
it's<00:01:58.650> about<00:01:58.950> cars<00:01:59.430> it's<00:01:59.790> about<00:01:59.970> pedestrians

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
it's about cars it's about pedestrians

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.000 
it's about cars it's about pedestrians
it's<00:02:00.870> about<00:02:00.990> sharing<00:02:01.260> the<00:02:01.500> road<00:02:01.680> with<00:02:01.710> other

it's about sharing the road with other

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.890 
it's about sharing the road with other
users<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.730> it's<00:02:02.850> great<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> car<00:02:03.510> brand<00:02:03.750> has

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900
