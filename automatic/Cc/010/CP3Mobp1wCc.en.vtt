but<00:01:01.859> anyways<00:01:02.160> let's<00:01:02.370> go<00:01:02.460> ahead<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.609> cover<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
but anyways let's go ahead and cover the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.669 
but anyways let's go ahead and cover the
rules<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.480> way<00:01:03.690> if<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.899> do<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.289> the<00:01:04.470> car

00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:04.679 
rules so that way if you do get the car

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:09.020 
rules so that way if you do get the car
right<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.580> will<00:01:05.759> actually<00:01:06.830> get<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.979> car<00:01:08.130> now

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
right you will actually get the car now

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.669 
right you will actually get the car now
you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.270> only<00:01:09.509> get<00:01:09.810> okay<00:01:10.170> rule<00:01:10.350> number<00:01:10.380> one

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:10.679 
you can only get okay rule number one

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:14.120 
you can only get okay rule number one
you<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.979> only<00:01:11.190> guess<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:12.300> time<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> day<00:01:13.130> there

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
you can only guess one time a day there

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.340 
you can only guess one time a day there
is<00:01:14.250> an<00:01:14.429> exception<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.390> if<00:01:15.569> I<00:01:15.899> do<00:01:16.319> a

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
is an exception and that is if I do a

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.680 
is an exception and that is if I do a
live<00:01:16.679> stream<00:01:17.069> then<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.000> come<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
live stream then you can come in and you

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.180 
live stream then you can come in and you
can<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.170> know<00:01:19.200> an<00:01:19.409> extra<00:01:19.710> five<00:01:19.890> guesses

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
can have you know an extra five guesses

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.560 
can have you know an extra five guesses
and<00:01:20.490> hopefully<00:01:20.789> you<00:01:20.880> actually<00:01:21.179> stay<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and hopefully you actually stay for a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.660 
and hopefully you actually stay for a
live<00:01:21.720> stream<00:01:21.899> but<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> total

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
live stream but so you can have a total

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.670 
live stream but so you can have a total
of<00:01:23.759> six<00:01:23.939> guesses<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.869> live<00:01:25.110> stream<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.470> day

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
of six guesses if I live stream that day

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.560 
of six guesses if I live stream that day
you<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.920> come<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.280> get<00:01:26.520> five<00:01:26.759> extra<00:01:27.149> guesses

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
you can come in get five extra guesses

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.870 
you can come in get five extra guesses
but<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.259> do<00:01:28.530> keep<00:01:28.890> track<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.159> who<00:01:29.490> leaves

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
but I do keep track of who leaves

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.210 
but I do keep track of who leaves
comments<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.570> who<00:01:30.630> no<00:01:31.049> guesses<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> video

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
comments and who no guesses on the video

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.840 
comments and who no guesses on the video
so<00:01:33.030> I'll<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.899> able<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.049> tell<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.469> know

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
so I'll be able to tell if you know

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.069 
so I'll be able to tell if you know
guess<00:01:35.850> within<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.240> certain<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.810> know<00:01:36.899> within

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
guess within a certain you know within

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.520 
guess within a certain you know within
24<00:01:37.560> hours<00:01:38.420> rule<00:01:39.420> number<00:01:39.540> two<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.020> if<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> are

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
24 hours rule number two is if you are

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.190 
24 hours rule number two is if you are
going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.950> guess<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.299> specific<00:01:42.509> I

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
going to guess you have to be specific I
