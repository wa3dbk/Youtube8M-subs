00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.170
 people exchanged things 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.449
 this is called barter as 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.460
 markets grow and develop is 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.910

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.789
 our anniversary and I will have 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.130
 to have in great detail the 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.520
 movie we've been waiting for everything 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:40.620
 the year no longer I'm going to review our 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.230
 count to see if we can give them something 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.050
 the financial situation only allows 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.020
 give them this I can give you a little more 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.590
 but we will tell you about your allowance and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.400
 with interests interests what is that and 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.160
 three shows 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.980
 If a bank lends you money, you will have to 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.800
 return that same amount plus something 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.690
 extra that extra amount that is the 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.790
 price charged to me by the bank or 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.020
 financial entities for lending me what 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.850
 it is called interest 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.980
 with the complicated in the loans 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.500
 I prefer to follow at the time of that tri 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.580
 it's not a bad idea and because we could 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.080
 exchange we will come up with something 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.970
 finally it was not such a bad idea to do 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.850
 this try that we learn about money 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.290
 the means of changing the interests and 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.290
 we are going to be able to have a little dish 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.080
 to the urban 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.620
 I 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.310
 but 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.909
 the where to be able many hands that allow 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:51.299

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:51.299
