00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
tutorial ideas and I was looking at the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.050 
tutorial ideas and I was looking at the
all<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.320> requests<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.430> will<00:00:23.640> get<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.850> all

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
looking at the comments on the particle

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.260 
looking at the comments on the particle
effect<00:00:40.770> video<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.670> seems<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.969> lot<00:00:42.149> of

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
effect video and it seems a lot of

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.729 
effect video and it seems a lot of
people<00:00:42.390> were<00:00:42.660> actually<00:00:42.809> really<00:00:43.320> interested

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
people were actually really interested

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.590 
people were actually really interested
in<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> math<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:45.300> can<00:00:45.480> actually

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
in the math and this can actually

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.500 
in the math and this can actually
surprised<00:00:46.410> me<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.340> thought<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
surprised me because I thought the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.670 
surprised me because I thought the
reaction<00:00:49.079> would<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.230> able<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.469> complete

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
reaction would be able to complete

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.319 
reaction would be able to complete
opposite<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.340> thought<00:00:50.700> people<00:00:50.820> would<00:00:51.030> say<00:00:51.270> you

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
opposite I thought people would say you

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.270 
opposite I thought people would say you
know<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.570> math<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.289> boring<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.190> you

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
know this math is just boring and you

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.520 
know this math is just boring and you
know<00:00:53.399> why<00:00:54.210> did<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.539> learn<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.469> are

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
know why did we learn this and what are

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.680 
know why did we learn this and what are
we<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.800> even<00:00:55.949> use<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.160> for<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.600> know

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
we going to even use it for and you know

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.990 
we going to even use it for and you know
I<00:00:57.719> was<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> lot<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> same<00:00:58.590> i<00:00:58.980> was<00:00:59.489> i<00:00:59.609> was<00:00:59.789> very

people who may think like that because
sure<00:01:05.220> enough<00:01:05.489> when<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.729> was<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.119> Middle<00:01:06.270> School

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
sure enough when I was in Middle School

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.390 
sure enough when I was in Middle School
in<00:01:06.659> high<00:01:06.900> school<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.470> didn't<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.070> think

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
in high school I didn't really think

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.219 
in high school I didn't really think
there<00:01:08.790> was<00:01:08.880> any<00:01:09.060> point<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.869> know<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.020> was

just<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.799> know<00:01:11.189> everyone<00:01:11.700> who<00:01:12.090> would

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
just like you know everyone who would

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.910 
just like you know everyone who would
taking<00:01:12.540> these<00:01:12.600> classes<00:01:12.780> before<00:01:13.200> me<00:01:13.619> was<00:01:13.770> like

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
taking these classes before me was like

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920 
taking these classes before me was like
oh<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.250> know<00:01:14.490> Matt<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:15.180> sucks<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.810> it's

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
oh you know Matt just sucks and it's

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.740 
oh you know Matt just sucks and it's
boring<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:17.220> was<00:01:17.400> like<00:01:17.700> oh<00:01:17.880> I'll<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
boring and I was like oh I'll just you

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.440 
boring and I was like oh I'll just you
know<00:01:18.810> I'll<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.950> same<00:01:20.159> way<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:21.150> when<00:01:21.420> I

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
know I'll think the same way so when I

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.969 
know I'll think the same way so when I
got<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.780> those<00:01:21.869> math<00:01:22.049> classes<00:01:22.350> I'm<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.740> okay

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
got to those math classes I'm like okay

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.410 
got to those math classes I'm like okay
I'm<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.100> gonna<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.820> I'll<00:01:24.119> be<00:01:24.210> done

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
I'm just gonna do this and I'll be done

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.710 
I'm just gonna do this and I'll be done
and<00:01:24.720> I'll<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.320> whatever<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:27.570> know<00:01:27.689> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
and I'll do whatever and you know I

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.740 
and I'll do whatever and you know I
think<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.110> issue<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.759> this<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.450> applied

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
think the issue and this can be applied

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.539 
think the issue and this can be applied
to<00:01:30.960> anything<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.100> really<00:01:32.189> can't<00:01:32.460> see

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
to anything is that you really can't see

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
that good stuff I'm finding out just how

that good stuff I'm finding out just how
important<00:01:53.670> all<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.270> stuff<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:56.100> know

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
important all this stuff is and you know

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.770 
important all this stuff is and you know
it's<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.700> suddenly<00:01:57.000> realize<00:01:57.570> it's

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
it's not like I suddenly realize it's

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.359 
it's not like I suddenly realize it's
like<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> huge<00:01:58.200> realization<00:01:58.439> but<00:01:59.219> I'm

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
like a huge realization but I'm

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.859 
like a huge realization but I'm
gradually<00:01:59.880> starting<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.360> realize<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.810> you

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
gradually starting to realize that you

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.719 
gradually starting to realize that you
know<00:02:00.930> hey<00:02:01.170> wait<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> second<00:02:01.799> education<00:02:02.549> is

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
know hey wait a second education is

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.450 
know hey wait a second education is
really<00:02:03.060> important<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.110> future<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.619> I

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
really important to the future and I

reach the mountaintop and he's like well
you<00:02:44.770> know<00:02:44.800> it<00:02:45.310> just<00:02:45.340> kind<00:02:45.670> of<00:02:45.700> keeps<00:02:45.880> on<00:02:46.000> going

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
you know it just kind of keeps on going

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.620 
you know it just kind of keeps on going
you<00:02:46.540> know<00:02:46.660> past<00:02:47.020> your<00:02:47.650> graduate<00:02:48.300> program<00:02:49.300> and

and<00:02:52.030> there<00:02:52.210> are<00:02:52.300> always<00:02:52.450> more<00:02:52.750> classes<00:02:53.170> to

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
and there are always more classes to

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.230 
and there are always more classes to
take<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.530> I<00:02:53.740> was<00:02:53.830> like<00:02:53.950> oh<00:02:54.100> well<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:55.210> know

that kind of blows but like okay how
about<00:02:58.870> taking<00:02:58.990> a<00:02:59.200> step<00:02:59.350> back<00:02:59.590> here<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.040> saying

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
about taking a step back here and saying

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.690 
about taking a step back here and saying
so<00:03:01.000> what<00:03:01.360> do<00:03:02.080> you<00:03:02.260> use<00:03:02.530> because<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.250> know<00:03:03.430> what<00:03:03.610> I

making simple things like circles and
arcs<00:03:17.050> and<00:03:17.260> stuff<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:18.010> know<00:03:18.100> you<00:03:18.160> need<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.430> know

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
arcs and stuff you know you need to know

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.070 
arcs and stuff you know you need to know
how<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.700> manipulate<00:03:18.970> angles<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:19.810> all<00:03:19.870> that

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
how to manipulate angles and all that

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.410 
how to manipulate angles and all that
and<00:03:20.320> that's<00:03:20.770> not<00:03:20.920> too<00:03:21.100> difficult<00:03:21.280> but<00:03:22.120> when<00:03:22.330> it

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
and that's not too difficult but when it

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.090 
and that's not too difficult but when it
gets<00:03:22.510> crazy<00:03:23.050> is<00:03:23.230> when<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.620> start<00:03:23.680> doing<00:03:23.920> the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
gets crazy is when you start doing the

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.590 
gets crazy is when you start doing the
differential<00:03:24.640> equations<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.180> we<00:03:25.239> instruct

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
differential equations and we instruct

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.380 
differential equations and we instruct
we<00:03:25.870> start<00:03:26.140> to<00:03:26.200> work<00:03:26.380> in<00:03:26.500> 3d<00:03:26.890> space<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:27.520> I'm

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
we start to work in 3d space and I'm

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.000 
we start to work in 3d space and I'm
like<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:28.959> know<00:03:29.020> how<00:03:29.260> much<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.470> this<00:03:29.620> stuff<00:03:29.680> is

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
like you know how much of this stuff is

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.820 
like you know how much of this stuff is
like<00:03:30.700> useful<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:31.360> it's<00:03:31.480> hard<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.930> know<00:03:32.590> at<00:03:32.739> the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
like useful and it's hard to know at the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.800 
like useful and it's hard to know at the
time<00:03:32.860> when<00:03:33.220> you're<00:03:33.340> studying<00:03:33.610> what<00:03:34.510> will<00:03:34.690> be

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
time when you're studying what will be

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.229 
time when you're studying what will be
useful<00:03:35.170> for<00:03:35.200> when<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.770> proceed<00:03:36.580> on<00:03:36.820> in<00:03:37.090> your

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
useful for when you proceed on in your

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.050 
useful for when you proceed on in your
career<00:03:37.390> so<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.770> know<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:38.920> was<00:03:39.130> thinking<00:03:39.160> well

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
career so you know I was thinking well

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.660 
career so you know I was thinking well
he<00:03:40.180> says<00:03:40.360> to<00:03:40.480> me<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:41.200> know<00:03:41.320> i'm<00:03:41.590> working<00:03:42.280> unity

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
he says to me you know i'm working unity

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.050 
he says to me you know i'm working unity
and<00:03:42.880> well<00:03:43.720> weren't<00:03:43.959> unity<00:03:44.350> being<00:03:44.560> um<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.670> i

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
and well weren't unity being um the i

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.640 
and well weren't unity being um the i
believe<00:03:46.510> it's<00:03:46.630> like<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.870> game<00:03:47.140> engine<00:03:47.530> or

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
believe it's like the game engine or

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.290 
believe it's like the game engine or
something<00:03:48.010> for<00:03:48.459> iOS<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:49.120> can't<00:03:49.959> remember<00:03:50.380> but

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
something for iOS I can't remember but

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.670 
something for iOS I can't remember but
he<00:03:52.300> writes<00:03:53.190> using<00:03:54.190> this<00:03:54.400> game<00:03:54.880> engine<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.680> he

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
he writes using this game engine and he

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.920 
he writes using this game engine and he
needs<00:03:56.860> to<00:03:57.040> know<00:03:57.070> pretty<00:03:57.850> much<00:03:57.910> a<00:03:58.330> lot<00:03:58.780> of

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
needs to know pretty much a lot of

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.620 
needs to know pretty much a lot of
physics<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.470> he<00:03:59.920> said<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.430> me<00:04:00.640> that<00:04:01.450> the

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
physics and he said to me that the

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.080 
physics and he said to me that the
calculus<00:04:02.050> came<00:04:02.350> in<00:04:02.440> handy<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:02.739> lot<00:04:02.830> and<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:04.060> was

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
calculus came in handy a lot and it was

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.210 
calculus came in handy a lot and it was
interesting<00:04:04.330> because<00:04:04.660> I<00:04:05.260> was<00:04:05.709> thinking<00:04:06.010> well

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
interesting because I was thinking well

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.050 
interesting because I was thinking well

know<00:04:20.650> what<00:04:21.130> do<00:04:21.789> you<00:04:21.910> need<00:04:22.090> to<00:04:22.150> know<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.630> he's

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
know what do you need to know and he's

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.050 
know what do you need to know and he's
like<00:04:22.900> well<00:04:23.110> it<00:04:23.979> really<00:04:24.130> depends<00:04:24.520> on<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:24.789> field

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
like well it really depends on the field

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.740 
like well it really depends on the field
and<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.690> really<00:04:25.840> depends<00:04:26.289> on<00:04:26.410> what

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
and it really depends on what

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.890 
and it really depends on what
plan<00:04:26.960> on<00:04:27.110> using<00:04:27.380> with<00:04:27.680> it<00:04:27.860> but<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:28.820> know<00:04:29.180> I<00:04:29.570> do

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
plan on using with it but you know I do

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.540 
plan on using with it but you know I do
plan<00:04:30.260> on<00:04:30.320> making<00:04:30.650> more<00:04:30.800> videos<00:04:30.830> on<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.340> math

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
plan on making more videos on the math

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.580 
plan on making more videos on the math
because<00:04:31.820> that<00:04:32.210> seems<00:04:32.510> to<00:04:32.630> be<00:04:32.750> an<00:04:32.990> interesting

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
because that seems to be an interesting

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.860 
because that seems to be an interesting
topic<00:04:33.950> and<00:04:34.400> it<00:04:35.060> seems<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.390> be<00:04:35.480> something<00:04:35.720> that

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
topic and it seems to be something that

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.810 
topic and it seems to be something that
you<00:04:36.140> guys<00:04:36.320> would<00:04:37.190> like<00:04:37.310> to<00:04:37.460> know<00:04:37.580> more<00:04:37.760> about

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
you guys would like to know more about

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.140 
you guys would like to know more about
so<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:39.650> know<00:04:39.740> I<00:04:39.770> really<00:04:40.580> don't<00:04:40.610> have<00:04:40.880> too<00:04:41.030> much

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
so you know I really don't have too much

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.350 
so you know I really don't have too much
more<00:04:41.450> math<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.870> complete<00:04:42.290> for<00:04:43.070> my<00:04:43.790> major

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
more math to complete for my major

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.330 
more math to complete for my major
requirement<00:04:45.020> requirements<00:04:45.980> but<00:04:46.040> I'm<00:04:46.130> still

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
requirement requirements but I'm still

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.430 
requirement requirements but I'm still
probably<00:04:46.490> going<00:04:46.700> to<00:04:46.760> do<00:04:46.970> some<00:04:47.540> more<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:47.960> don't

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
probably going to do some more I don't

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.630 
probably going to do some more I don't
you<00:04:48.530> guys<00:04:48.590> can<00:04:48.740> hear<00:04:48.890> that<00:04:49.100> but<00:04:49.250> I'm<00:04:49.340> a<00:04:49.430> bit

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
you guys can hear that but I'm a bit

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.610 
you guys can hear that but I'm a bit
distracted<00:04:49.760> because<00:04:50.420> my<00:04:50.690> dog<00:04:51.140> is<00:04:51.380> just

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
distracted because my dog is just

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.950 
distracted because my dog is just
barking<00:04:51.950> so<00:04:52.220> loud<00:04:52.250> but<00:04:53.470> anyways<00:04:54.730> yeah<00:04:55.730> so<00:04:56.180> that

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
barking so loud but anyways yeah so that

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.920 
barking so loud but anyways yeah so that
was<00:04:56.990> kind<00:04:57.260> of<00:04:57.290> an<00:04:57.560> unexpected<00:04:58.720> thing<00:04:59.720> that

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
was kind of an unexpected thing that

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.590 
was kind of an unexpected thing that
people<00:05:00.260> were<00:05:00.440> interested<00:05:00.590> in<00:05:01.010> and<00:05:01.250> I'm<00:05:02.210> more

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
people were interested in and I'm more

useful on how you can apply them because

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.290 
useful on how you can apply them because
you<00:05:12.169> know<00:05:12.290> a<00:05:12.530> lot<00:05:13.160> of<00:05:13.190> people<00:05:13.310> may<00:05:13.700> be<00:05:13.760> deterred

you know a lot of people may be deterred

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.909 
you know a lot of people may be deterred
from<00:05:14.330> math<00:05:14.720> because<00:05:14.930> you're<00:05:15.140> like<00:05:15.290> ah<00:05:15.470> math

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
from math because you're like ah math

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.010 
from math because you're like ah math
you<00:05:16.250> know<00:05:16.370> it's<00:05:16.580> just<00:05:16.640> it's<00:05:17.000> just<00:05:17.600> not<00:05:17.870> really

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
you know it's just it's just not really

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.050 
you know it's just it's just not really
my<00:05:18.080> thing<00:05:18.169> and<00:05:18.890> you<00:05:19.160> know<00:05:19.220> I'm<00:05:19.460> more<00:05:19.640> into<00:05:19.880> like

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
my thing and you know I'm more into like

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.860 
my thing and you know I'm more into like
riding<00:05:21.050> or<00:05:21.230> you<00:05:21.590> know<00:05:21.740> art<00:05:22.130> music<00:05:23.090> things<00:05:23.720> like

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
riding or you know art music things like

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.930 
riding or you know art music things like
that<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:24.310> you<00:05:25.310> know<00:05:25.430> I<00:05:25.460> was<00:05:25.580> a<00:05:25.610> lot<00:05:25.730> of<00:05:25.850> the

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
that and you know I was a lot of the

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.210 
that and you know I was a lot of the
same<00:05:26.090> way<00:05:26.300> of<00:05:26.419> course<00:05:26.630> but<00:05:27.380> it's<00:05:28.130> all<00:05:28.190> about

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
same way of course but it's all about

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.450 
same way of course but it's all about
practice<00:05:28.610> and<00:05:29.060> if<00:05:30.020> you<00:05:30.230> have<00:05:30.560> a<00:05:30.890> goal<00:05:31.160> it's

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
practice and if you have a goal it's

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.730 
practice and if you have a goal it's
much<00:05:32.120> easier<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.750> be<00:05:32.930> motivated<00:05:33.470> to<00:05:33.500> work

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
much easier to be motivated to work

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.740 
much easier to be motivated to work
towards<00:05:34.130> that<00:05:34.190> goal<00:05:34.310> clearly<00:05:35.300> if<00:05:35.390> you<00:05:35.540> don't

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
towards that goal clearly if you don't

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.180 
towards that goal clearly if you don't
have<00:05:36.020> any<00:05:36.169> idea<00:05:36.410> what<00:05:36.560> you<00:05:36.680> want<00:05:36.860> to<00:05:36.950> do<00:05:37.040> with

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
have any idea what you want to do with

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.900 
have any idea what you want to do with
this<00:05:37.310> math<00:05:37.550> and<00:05:38.090> it<00:05:38.180> makes<00:05:38.360> no<00:05:38.540> sense<00:05:39.070> so<00:05:40.070> you

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
this math and it makes no sense so you

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.360 
this math and it makes no sense so you
know<00:05:41.060> it's<00:05:41.840> all<00:05:41.990> about<00:05:42.229> what<00:05:42.890> you<00:05:42.979> want<00:05:43.130> to<00:05:43.190> do

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
know it's all about what you want to do

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.280 
know it's all about what you want to do
and<00:05:43.640> perspective<00:05:44.180> and<00:05:44.270> all<00:05:44.419> that<00:05:44.630> and<00:05:45.080> I<00:05:45.169> was

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
and perspective and all that and I was

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.830 
and perspective and all that and I was
thinking<00:05:45.700> this<00:05:46.700> is<00:05:46.880> the<00:05:46.910> kind<00:05:47.419> of<00:05:47.540> thing<00:05:47.600> that

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
thinking this is the kind of thing that

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.840 
thinking this is the kind of thing that
I<00:05:48.020> want<00:05:48.229> to<00:05:48.260> provide<00:05:48.530> the<00:05:49.310> kind<00:05:49.490> of<00:05:49.520> content<00:05:49.820> I

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
I want to provide the kind of content I

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.040 
I want to provide the kind of content I
