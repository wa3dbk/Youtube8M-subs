00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
really good glue gun like this you also

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.259 
really good glue gun like this you also
need<00:00:27.300> something<00:00:27.960> like<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.789> to

need something like this and that is to

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.510 
need something like this and that is to
stand<00:00:32.239> your<00:00:33.239> nozzle<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.950> reason<00:00:35.219> for

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
stand your nozzle in and the reason for

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.010 
stand your nozzle in and the reason for
that<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:36.090> what<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.780> do<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.850> glue<00:00:39.020> glue

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
that is what you have to do is glue glue

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.900 
that is what you have to do is glue glue
your<00:00:40.230> nozzle<00:00:40.710> into<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.370> wall<00:00:41.700> like<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
your nozzle into the wall like this and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
your nozzle into the wall like this and
put<00:00:44.910> plenty<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.420> glue<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.079> because<00:00:46.469> what

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
put plenty of glue in it because what

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.970 
put plenty of glue in it because what
happens<00:00:47.430> sometimes<00:00:48.230> well<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.379> happens<00:00:49.770> quite

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
happens sometimes well it happens quite

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.479 
happens sometimes well it happens quite
often<00:00:50.430> when<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.210> wash<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.289> you'd<00:00:53.160> wash

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
often when you wash in it if you'd wash

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.750 
often when you wash in it if you'd wash
it<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.210> water<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.410> too<00:00:55.710> hot<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.430> just

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
it in the water if it's too hot it just

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.740 
it in the water if it's too hot it just
falls<00:00:57.210> out<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.570> there<00:00:58.250> when<00:00:59.270> and<00:01:00.270> then<00:01:00.629> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
falls out of there when and then you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.840 
falls out of there when and then you
have<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.930> pick<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.469> gloom<00:01:01.739> off<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.190> redo<00:01:02.399> it

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
have to pick the gloom off and redo it

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.690 
have to pick the gloom off and redo it
again<00:01:03.439> so<00:01:05.450> you<00:01:06.450> also<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.380> glue<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.890> run

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
again so you also have to glue it run

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
again so you also have to glue it run
the<00:01:08.970> side<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.900> nozzle<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:11.390> don't<00:01:12.390> know<00:01:12.479> why

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the side of the nozzle I don't know why

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.039 
the side of the nozzle I don't know why
my<00:01:12.930> hands<00:01:13.170> shaking<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.420> glue<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.750> not

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
my hands shaking and the glue is not

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.630 
my hands shaking and the glue is not
coming<00:01:16.439> out<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.619> here<00:01:16.979> very<00:01:17.310> well<00:01:19.460> but<00:01:20.460> that's

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
coming out of here very well but that's

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.440 
coming out of here very well but that's
what<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.150> need<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.080> glue<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.880> in<00:01:23.880> there

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
what you need to do is glue it in there

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.410 
what you need to do is glue it in there
as<00:01:25.290> well<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:25.920> don't<00:01:26.189> put<00:01:26.460> too<00:01:26.670> much<00:01:26.700> glue<00:01:27.240> in

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
as well but don't put too much glue in

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.170 
as well but don't put too much glue in
otherwise<00:01:27.990> year<00:01:28.409> your<00:01:29.280> lid<00:01:29.490> won't<00:01:29.790> actually

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
otherwise year your lid won't actually

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.940 
otherwise year your lid won't actually
go<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.409> your<00:01:33.860> bottle<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.420> as<00:01:36.780> they<00:01:37.350> say<00:01:37.710> on

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950

TV<00:01:38.810> this<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.229> one<00:01:40.590> added<00:01:40.979> earlier<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
TV this is one added earlier this is a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.960 
TV this is one added earlier this is a
different<00:01:42.930> nozzle<00:01:43.290> again<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.549> what<00:01:44.820> it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
different nozzle again this is what it

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.649 
different nozzle again this is what it
looks<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.420> when<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.810> glue<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.380> set<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.659> then

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
looks like when the glue is set and then

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.499 
looks like when the glue is set and then
always<00:01:49.590> make<00:01:49.829> sure<00:01:49.860> whether<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.939> screws

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
always make sure whether it's it screws

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.810 
always make sure whether it's it screws
on<00:01:51.810> properly<00:01:52.380> because<00:01:52.649> what<00:01:53.250> I've<00:01:53.430> done<00:01:53.640> in

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
on properly because what I've done in

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.899 
on properly because what I've done in
the<00:01:53.850> past<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.540> not<00:01:54.810> screwed<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.530> tight<00:01:55.950> because

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the past is not screwed on tight because

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.590 
the past is not screwed on tight because
I<00:01:57.149> put<00:01:57.509> too<00:01:57.750> much<00:01:57.960> glue<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.570> when<00:02:00.570> I

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
I put too much glue in it and when I

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.990 
I put too much glue in it and when I
squeezed<00:02:01.229> all<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.920> saw<00:02:02.219> pit<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.549> all

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
squeezed all of the saw pit just all

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.080 
squeezed all of the saw pit just all
burst<00:02:03.390> out<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.049> spread<00:02:04.590> everywhere<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
burst out and spread everywhere but the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.600 
burst out and spread everywhere but the
beauty<00:02:06.659> with<00:02:06.899> these<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.530> there's<00:02:07.979> no<00:02:08.250> waste

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
beauty with these is there's no waste
