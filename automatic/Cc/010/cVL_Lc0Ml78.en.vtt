00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
it isn't very pretty but it's been

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.609 
it isn't very pretty but it's been
working<00:00:57.960> I've<00:01:02.719> been<00:01:03.719> really<00:01:03.870> surprised<00:01:04.350> at

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
working I've been really surprised at

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.460 
working I've been really surprised at
how<00:01:04.769> long<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.430> has<00:01:05.580> burned<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:07.260> does

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
how long this has burned and it does

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.530 
how long this has burned and it does
smell<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.280> little<00:01:08.640> bit<00:01:08.970> now<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:10.020> meatloaf

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
smell a little bit now like meatloaf

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.580 
smell a little bit now like meatloaf
probably<00:01:12.540> because<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.080> getting<00:01:13.380> down<00:01:13.530> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
probably because it's getting down to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.030 
probably because it's getting down to
the<00:01:14.010> bottom<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.390> grease<00:01:15.720> where<00:01:16.200> all<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the bottom of the grease where all of

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.770 
the bottom of the grease where all of
the<00:01:17.250> drippings<00:01:17.700> from<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.060> meatloaf<00:01:18.420> kind<00:01:18.659> of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the drippings from the meatloaf kind of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:27.940 
the drippings from the meatloaf kind of
settled<00:01:20.060> catch<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.479> stuff<00:01:21.810> down<00:01:22.049> there

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.100 

what<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.220> about<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.110> it

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
what I like about this is that it

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.010 
what I like about this is that it
doesn't<00:01:31.500> give<00:01:31.650> off<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.890> strong<00:01:33.020> chemical

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
doesn't give off that strong chemical

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.050 
doesn't give off that strong chemical
smell<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.470> comes<00:01:34.710> with<00:01:35.009> lamp<00:01:35.310> oil<00:01:35.430> regular

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
smell that comes with lamp oil regular

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.359 
smell that comes with lamp oil regular
lamp<00:01:36.299> oil<00:01:36.509> gives<00:01:36.840> off<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> really<00:01:37.590> strong<00:01:37.890> smell

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
lamp oil gives off a really strong smell

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.300 
lamp oil gives off a really strong smell
and<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.689> tends<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.140> burn<00:01:40.380> my<00:01:40.590> eyes<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.130> this

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and it it tends to burn my eyes but this

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.760 
and it it tends to burn my eyes but this
hasn't<00:01:41.549> given<00:01:41.790> off<00:01:42.060> any<00:01:42.380> anything<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.740> that

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
hasn't given off any anything like that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.990 
hasn't given off any anything like that
this<00:01:44.310> has<00:01:44.460> been<00:01:44.490> really<00:01:44.790> cool<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.700> has

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
this has been really cool the can has

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.840 
this has been really cool the can has
worked<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:49.320> does<00:01:49.560> get<00:01:49.770> hot<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.250> touch<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.759> it

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
worked it does get hot to touch so it

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.179 
worked it does get hot to touch so it
wouldn't<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.270> something<00:01:51.710> good<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.920> try<00:01:53.130> to

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
wouldn't be something good to try to

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.690 
wouldn't be something good to try to
carry<00:01:53.579> around<00:01:54.590> but<00:01:55.590> I'm<00:01:55.710> thinking<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.369> this

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
carry around but I'm thinking that this

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.670 
carry around but I'm thinking that this
hamburger<00:01:57.689> Greece<00:01:59.090> would<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:01.110> good<00:02:01.439> to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
hamburger Greece would be really good to

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.940 
hamburger Greece would be really good to
porn<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.759> bottom<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.329> an<00:02:03.600> oil<00:02:04.530> lamp

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
porn to the bottom of an oil lamp

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.620 
porn to the bottom of an oil lamp
because<00:02:05.340> then<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.700> would<00:02:05.820> hold<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.119> wick<00:02:06.390> in

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
because then it would hold the wick in

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.380 
because then it would hold the wick in
the<00:02:06.750> center<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.190> adjust

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the center and you can adjust

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.160 
the center and you can adjust
the<00:02:09.929> wick<00:02:10.170> size<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:11.510> adjust<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.660> size<00:02:12.840> if<00:02:13.020> your

that of course only in an emergency
situation<00:02:25.530> because<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.550> will<00:02:26.730> go<00:02:26.910> bad<00:02:27.290> sitting

out<00:02:28.440> unless<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.220> freeze<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:29.520> i<00:02:29.760> guess<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.180> can

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
out unless you freeze it i guess you can

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.050 
out unless you freeze it i guess you can
pour<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.350> in<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.740> can<00:02:32.070> or<00:02:32.250> something<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.730> freeze

better way to do this but yeah in an

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.060 
better way to do this but yeah in an

the<00:04:49.820> side<00:04:50.030> that<00:04:50.060> would<00:04:50.360> maybe<00:04:51.020> it<00:04:51.260> might<00:04:51.440> be<00:04:51.500> a

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
the side that would maybe it might be a

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.469 
the side that would maybe it might be a
good<00:04:52.130> idea<00:04:52.190> i<00:04:52.520> don't<00:04:52.760> know<00:04:52.849> if<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.150> handle

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
good idea i don't know if the handle

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.480 
good idea i don't know if the handle
would<00:04:53.599> get<00:04:53.750> hot<00:04:53.990> but<00:04:54.289> i<00:04:54.500> have<00:04:54.979> read<00:04:55.220> of<00:04:55.250> other

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
would get hot but i have read of other

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.320 
would get hot but i have read of other
people<00:04:55.880> doing<00:04:56.060> that<00:05:00.430> just<00:05:01.430> a<00:05:01.580> good<00:05:01.940> way<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.150> use

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
people doing that just a good way to use
