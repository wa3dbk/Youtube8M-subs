the desert camouflage and we have the
silver<00:00:29.880> version<00:00:30.619> now<00:00:31.619> these<00:00:31.830> particular

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
silver version now these particular

silver version now these particular
aircraft<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:33.360> course<00:00:33.630> support<00:00:34.320> our<00:00:34.500> ground

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
aircraft of course support our ground

troops has a 37 millimeter cannon in the
front<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.520> was<00:00:38.670> very<00:00:38.910> very<00:00:39.120> effective<00:00:39.480> for

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
front that was very very effective for

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.520 
front that was very very effective for
also<00:00:40.110> hitting<00:00:40.320> all<00:00:41.090> armored<00:00:42.090> vehicles<00:00:42.570> what

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
also hitting all armored vehicles what

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.369 
also hitting all armored vehicles what
we<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.829> also<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.340> very<00:00:44.700> large<00:00:45.110> area<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
we have also a very large area for the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.170 
we have also a very large area for the
battery<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.610> use<00:00:47.760> different<00:00:48.000> size

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
battery so you can use different size

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.090 
battery so you can use different size
batteries<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.410> has<00:00:49.559> developed<00:00:49.770> where<00:00:50.010> you

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
batteries and has developed where you

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.279 
batteries and has developed where you
just<00:00:50.219> attach<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.850> slide<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.719> out<00:00:51.840> be

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
just attach it slide it in and out be

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.850 
just attach it slide it in and out be
sure<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:53.010> check<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.460> CG<00:00:54.059> before<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.440> take<00:00:55.680> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
sure you check the CG before you take it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.240 
sure you check the CG before you take it
up<00:00:56.129> because<00:00:56.809> this<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.870> airplane<00:00:58.500> tend<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
up because this is airplane tend to be a

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.270 
up because this is airplane tend to be a
little<00:00:59.489> CG<00:01:00.059> sensitive<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.920> actuality

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
little CG sensitive and in actuality

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.910 
little CG sensitive and in actuality
tends<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.390> tail<00:01:03.600> heavy<00:01:03.870> which<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.470> unusual

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
tends to be tail heavy which is unusual

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.469 
tends to be tail heavy which is unusual
for<00:01:04.949> scale<00:01:05.369> plane<00:01:05.640> that's<00:01:05.880> because<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.330> its

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
for scale plane that's because of its

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.170 
for scale plane that's because of its
long<00:01:06.720> nose<00:01:07.130> like<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> really<00:01:08.670> do<00:01:08.790> like<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
long nose like so I really do like the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.570 
long nose like so I really do like the
large<00:01:09.750> battery<00:01:10.500> area<00:01:10.979> which<00:01:11.130> more<00:01:11.369> airplanes

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
large battery area which more airplanes

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.160 
large battery area which more airplanes
would<00:01:11.850> come<00:01:11.970> out<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.240> something<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.720> that

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
would come out with something like that

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.420 
would come out with something like that
so<00:01:13.860> that's<00:01:14.460> basically<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.840> comes

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
so that's basically if it comes

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.450 
so that's basically if it comes
forty-two<00:01:17.240> inch<00:01:17.480> wingspan<00:01:18.130> that's<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.280> nice

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
forty-two inch wingspan that's a nice

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.670 
forty-two inch wingspan that's a nice
size<00:01:20.080> something<00:01:21.080> that<00:01:21.200> you<00:01:21.290> can<00:01:21.410> put<00:01:21.560> in<00:01:21.650> a

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
size something that you can put in a

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.740 
size something that you can put in a
small<00:01:21.950> car<00:01:22.280> but<00:01:22.850> not<00:01:22.940> so<00:01:23.120> small<00:01:23.450> you're<00:01:23.630> going

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
small car but not so small you're going

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.210 
small car but not so small you're going
to<00:01:23.810> be<00:01:23.870> blown<00:01:24.080> around<00:01:24.260> and<00:01:24.620> moved<00:01:24.770> too<00:01:24.920> much<00:01:25.070> in

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
to be blown around and moved too much in

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.640 
to be blown around and moved too much in
the<00:01:25.310> wind<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:26.240> let's<00:01:26.780> put<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:26.960> battery<00:01:27.200> in<00:01:27.470> it

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
the wind so let's put a battery in it

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.260 
the wind so let's put a battery in it
take<00:01:28.130> it<00:01:28.250> out<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.520> flight<00:01:28.820> line<00:01:28.850> we'll

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
take it out to the flight line we'll

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.410 
take it out to the flight line we'll
give<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.510> a<00:01:29.570> shot<00:01:29.810> show<00:01:30.440> you<00:01:30.500> what<00:01:30.890> out<00:01:31.100> lights

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:52.319 

here<00:01:35.420> we<00:01:35.510> go

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.050 

and<00:01:53.329> we're<00:01:53.600> just<00:01:53.689> basically<00:01:53.899> cruising<00:01:54.680> at<00:01:54.860> a

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
and we're just basically cruising at a

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.410 
and we're just basically cruising at a
medium<00:01:56.060> speed<00:01:56.710> so<00:01:57.710> this<00:01:57.950> is<00:01:58.009> about<00:01:58.329> where<00:01:59.329> it

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
medium speed so this is about where it

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.950 
medium speed so this is about where it
would<00:01:59.540> go

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
would go

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.070 
would go
you<00:02:00.770> guys<00:02:00.979> like<00:02:01.189> cruise<00:02:01.490> by<00:02:01.759> oh<00:02:02.060> three<00:02:02.780> tracks

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
you guys like cruise by oh three tracks

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:17.670 
you guys like cruise by oh three tracks
right<00:02:04.040> up<00:02:04.220> there

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.850 

it<00:02:18.680> also<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:19.370> role<00:02:19.730> was<00:02:19.910> very<00:02:20.000> scale<00:02:20.540> like

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
it also that role was very scale like

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.640 
it also that role was very scale like
the<00:02:21.860> airplane<00:02:22.160> acts<00:02:22.550> very<00:02:22.940> very<00:02:23.240> well<00:02:23.650> my

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
the airplane acts very very well my

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.390 
the airplane acts very very well my
typical<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.610> aircraft<00:02:26.209> itself<00:02:27.400> the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
typical of the aircraft itself the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.800 
typical of the aircraft itself the
reason<00:02:28.520> why<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:28.850> because<00:02:29.150> if<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:29.480> look<00:02:29.600> at<00:02:29.690> the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
reason why is because if you look at the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.600 
reason why is because if you look at the
wing<00:02:30.020> it's<00:02:30.590> much<00:02:30.830> more<00:02:31.010> like<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.220> sport

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
wing it's much more like a sport
