nerf in a review earth everyone here I
have<00:00:17.849> here<00:00:18.090> I'll<00:00:18.990> jolt<00:00:19.619> ex1<00:00:21.079> now<00:00:23.419> the<00:00:24.419> reason

why<00:00:24.689> I'm<00:00:24.779> out<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.930> breath<00:00:25.200> if<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.680> just<00:00:25.860> went

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
why I'm out of breath if I just went

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.089 
why I'm out of breath if I just went
down<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.400> stairs<00:00:26.669> I<00:00:27.000> went<00:00:27.300> outside<00:00:27.890> shot<00:00:28.890> it

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
down the stairs I went outside shot it

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.410 
down the stairs I went outside shot it
shot<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.300> jolt<00:00:30.599> here<00:00:30.960> modified<00:00:31.529> complete

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
shot this jolt here modified complete

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.920 
shot this jolt here modified complete
completely<00:00:34.430> got<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.610> excited<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:36.420> ran<00:00:36.690> like<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
completely got so excited I ran like a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.540 
completely got so excited I ran like a
hold<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.470> place<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.920> actually<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.370> didn't

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
hold the place and I actually I didn't

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.130 
hold the place and I actually I didn't
do<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.790> part<00:00:39.860> but<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.750> shot<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:42.990> this

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
do that part but I shot it with this

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.000 
do that part but I shot it with this
streamline<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.980> unmodified<00:00:44.730> streamline

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
streamline this unmodified streamline

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.400 
streamline this unmodified streamline
with<00:00:47.010> two<00:00:47.460> Springs<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.450> thing<00:00:48.720> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
with two Springs and this thing the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.810 
with two Springs and this thing the
spring<00:00:49.650> that<00:00:49.800> came<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.160> gun<00:00:50.310> and<00:00:50.490> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
spring that came to the gun and the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.910 
spring that came to the gun and the
spring<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.150> got<00:00:51.330> from<00:00:52.940> from<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.620> long<00:00:55.620> shot

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
spring I got from from the long shot

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.990 
spring I got from from the long shot
front<00:00:56.400> gun<00:00:57.590> so<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> mean<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.220> I<00:00:59.370> said<00:00:59.400> I<00:00:59.820> knew

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
front gun so I mean like I said I knew

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.400 
front gun so I mean like I said I knew
that<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.390> bang<00:01:00.600> apart<00:01:00.930> would<00:01:01.110> be<00:01:01.200> useful

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that that bang apart would be useful

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.979 
that that bang apart would be useful
somehow<00:01:02.030> they<00:01:03.030> say<00:01:03.210> what<00:01:03.360> I<00:01:03.390> did<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.960> went

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
somehow they say what I did is I went

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.370 
somehow they say what I did is I went
that<00:01:04.259> Instructables<00:01:05.420> looked<00:01:06.420> up<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.930> jolt

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that Instructables looked up on a jolt

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.630 
that Instructables looked up on a jolt
mod<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.720> it's<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.869> carefully<00:01:10.619> put<00:01:10.890> two<00:01:11.249> Springs

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
mod and it's a carefully put two Springs

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.090 
mod and it's a carefully put two Springs
together<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.329> think<00:01:13.259> I<00:01:13.380> don't<00:01:13.590> think<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.829> really

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
together I think I don't think I really

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.730 
together I think I don't think I really
mattered<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.819> I<00:01:15.200> went<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.289> the<00:01:16.439> one<00:01:16.560> that

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
mattered so I went with the one that

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.169 
mattered so I went with the one that
could<00:01:16.859> easily<00:01:17.069> fit<00:01:17.429> through<00:01:17.640> there<00:01:17.819> and<00:01:18.060> they

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
could easily fit through there and they

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:19.700 
could easily fit through there and they
the<00:01:18.659> first<00:01:18.899> one<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.079> tried<00:01:19.319> didn't<00:01:19.649> work

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
the first one I tried didn't work

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.389 
the first one I tried didn't work
because<00:01:20.579> it<00:01:20.670> didn't<00:01:20.880> fit<00:01:21.859> the<00:01:22.859> second<00:01:23.280> one<00:01:23.369> I

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
because it didn't fit the second one I

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.010 
because it didn't fit the second one I
tried<00:01:23.670> work<00:01:23.999> perfectly<00:01:24.770> this<00:01:25.770> shoots<00:01:26.039> about

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
tried work perfectly this shoots about

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.950 
tried work perfectly this shoots about
I'd<00:01:28.020> say<00:01:28.429> it<00:01:29.429> before<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.969> could<00:01:30.060> shoot<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.299> 30

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
I'd say it before it could shoot like 30

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.949 
I'd say it before it could shoot like 30
feet<00:01:31.609> those<00:01:32.609> from<00:01:33.079> say<00:01:34.729> halfway<00:01:35.749> halfway<00:01:36.749> from

00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:36.959 
feet those from say halfway halfway from

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:39.770 
feet those from say halfway halfway from
between<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.009> hamper<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.399> they<00:01:38.689> basket<00:01:39.689> over

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
between that hamper and they basket over

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.639 
between that hamper and they basket over
there<00:01:39.899> between<00:01:40.829> those<00:01:41.009> two<00:01:41.219> all<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.090> way<00:01:42.649> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
there between those two all the way to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.819 
there between those two all the way to
the<00:01:43.740> wall<00:01:43.920> that's<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.389> pretty<00:01:45.990> good<00:01:47.060> 35<00:01:48.060> feet

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
the wall that's a pretty good 35 feet

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.919 
the wall that's a pretty good 35 feet
with<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> two<00:01:50.069> Springs<00:01:50.399> added<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:51.479> was<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> pain

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
with the two Springs added it was a pain

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:53.389 
with the two Springs added it was a pain
to<00:01:52.049> get<00:01:52.139> them<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.560> got<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.889> a<00:01:52.920> hole<00:01:53.100> cut

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
to get them on I got like a hole cut

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.879 
to get them on I got like a hole cut
from<00:01:53.639> it<00:01:54.109> I'll<00:01:55.109> deal<00:01:55.380> with<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:56.929> better<00:01:57.929> I<00:01:58.350> don't

00:01:58.879 --> 00:01:58.889 
from it I'll deal with it better I don't

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
from it I'll deal with it better I don't
like<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.729> not<00:01:59.999> real<00:02:00.119> word<00:02:00.299> um<00:02:00.569> anyway<00:02:01.909> this

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
like that's not real word um anyway this

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.469 
like that's not real word um anyway this
jolt<00:02:04.099> with<00:02:05.099> two<00:02:05.429> Springs<00:02:05.759> added<00:02:06.060> making<00:02:06.329> it

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
jolt with two Springs added making it

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.949 
jolt with two Springs added making it
like<00:02:06.719> double<00:02:06.990> power<00:02:08.119> so<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.420> started<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:09.899> a

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
like double power so I started with a

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.860 
like double power so I started with a
stream<00:02:10.259> line<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:11.370> goes<00:02:11.610> roughly<00:02:12.090> 40<00:02:12.390> 50<00:02:12.690> feet

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
stream line it goes roughly 40 50 feet

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.470 
stream line it goes roughly 40 50 feet
maybe<00:02:13.370> so<00:02:14.370> I'm<00:02:14.580> going<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.970> use<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.270> more

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
maybe so I'm going to use this more

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.410 
maybe so I'm going to use this more
often<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:16.140> haven't<00:02:16.560> tested<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.950> be

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
often I haven't tested to be

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.170 
often I haven't tested to be
the<00:02:18.110> bead<00:02:18.880> size<00:02:19.880> yet<00:02:20.510> like<00:02:21.580> light<00:02:22.580> from<00:02:22.970> the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
the bead size yet like light from the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.380 
the bead size yet like light from the
tip<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.750> about<00:02:23.990> here<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:25.060> haven't<00:02:26.060> tested<00:02:26.180> that

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
tip to about here I haven't tested that

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.640 
tip to about here I haven't tested that
out<00:02:26.600> yeah<00:02:26.780> I'm<00:02:26.900> actually<00:02:27.110> gonna<00:02:27.380> test<00:02:27.590> that

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
out yeah I'm actually gonna test that

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:50.520 
out yeah I'm actually gonna test that
out<00:02:27.770> now<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:30.340> they're<00:02:31.390> right

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:03:04.600 

Wow<00:02:53.080> my<00:02:54.080> scissors

yeah<00:03:06.050> sorry<00:03:07.050> for<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.290> bit<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.590> delay

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
yeah sorry for that bit of the delay

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.100 
yeah sorry for that bit of the delay
that<00:03:08.069> 30-second<00:03:08.640> delay<00:03:08.730> this<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.840> what<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:10.050> was

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
that 30-second delay this is what I was

now<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.610> already<00:03:33.120> know<00:03:33.390> this<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.690> gonna<00:03:33.810> go<00:03:33.959> far

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
now I already know this is gonna go far

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.990 
now I already know this is gonna go far
even<00:03:34.470> though<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.709> tested<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.340> with<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.760> half

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
even though I tested it with a half

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.360 
even though I tested it with a half
modded<00:03:36.480> jolt<00:03:36.780> with<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.770> air<00:03:37.920> restrictor<00:03:38.280> out

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
modded jolt with the air restrictor out

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.060 
modded jolt with the air restrictor out
I<00:03:39.290> personally<00:03:40.290> think<00:03:40.380> this<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.650> gonna<00:03:40.830> use

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
I personally think this is gonna use

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.500 
I personally think this is gonna use
them<00:03:41.220> this<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.200> this<00:03:43.200> thing<00:03:43.590> out<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.830> way<00:03:43.950> I

already know this is gonna go a lot

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.449 
already know this is gonna go a lot
farther<00:03:46.830> than<00:03:47.010> before<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:48.950> going<00:03:49.950> as<00:03:50.040> far<00:03:50.280> back

jolt<00:04:50.850> added<00:04:51.690> double<00:04:52.290> springs<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:53.040> this<00:04:53.180> and

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
jolt added double springs to this and

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.300 
jolt added double springs to this and
took<00:04:55.020> out<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:55.169> air<00:04:55.380> restrictors<00:04:55.770> later

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
took out the air restrictors later

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.580 
took out the air restrictors later
earlier<00:04:57.060> on<00:04:57.210> I<00:04:57.240> add<00:04:57.540> I<00:04:57.810> took<00:04:58.169> out<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.440> air

earlier on I add I took out the air

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.560 
earlier on I add I took out the air

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
restrictors but then like put double

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.750 
restrictors but then like put double
springs<00:05:00.840> I<00:05:01.139> put<00:05:01.950> double<00:05:02.280> springs<00:05:02.490> on<00:05:02.610> this

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
springs I put double springs on this

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.219 
springs I put double springs on this
thing<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.120> that<00:05:03.300> works<00:05:03.540> so<00:05:04.340> this<00:05:05.340> is<00:05:05.520> it<00:05:06.229> I'll

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
probably find the beat sight thing after
