have danced initially I started writing

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.410 
have danced initially I started writing
a<00:00:52.980> blog<00:00:53.149> just<00:00:54.149> after<00:00:54.510> Billy<00:00:54.750> passed<00:00:55.230> away<00:00:55.559> and

a blog just after Billy passed away and
then<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.719> realized<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.920> wrote<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> book<00:00:59.579> it's

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
then I realized if I wrote a book it's

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.930 
then I realized if I wrote a book it's
more<00:01:00.449> tangible<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.379> even<00:01:02.070> though<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.489> lost

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
more tangible and even though we lost

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.260 
more tangible and even though we lost
him<00:01:03.379> we<00:01:04.379> could<00:01:04.619> still<00:01:05.280> make<00:01:05.489> him<00:01:05.670> live<00:01:05.939> that

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
him we could still make him live that

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.210 
him we could still make him live that
way

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220
