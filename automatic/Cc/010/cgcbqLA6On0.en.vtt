00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.480

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.480
 First 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.170
 and how about friends of youtube good 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.180
 in this video I bring you what would be 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.100
 an information about the uis 11 right now 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.690
 I woke up because I was checking the 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.580
 google + and I find this image 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.350
 that he's going to leave in a few hours 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.300
 I will be at school and I can not 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.010
 bring them what would be the apk but 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.840
 Now I'm going to tell you new things that 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.460
 they will add and correct errors 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.740
 I will not say because you do not 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.270
 I understand a lot but you here below what 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.770
 are going to happen to see down here in the 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.050
 description of the video I will be leaving you 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.809
 what would be translated all the Spanish 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.730
 not very well translated but I did what 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.980
 I could and good what would be the new 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.199
 things added what would be to the wolves 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.999
 they can eat rotten meat and then 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.399
 they will also be able to add what would be 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:48.929
 the third person fishing rod that 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.460
 you could not fish when you were in 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:52.469
 third person but they're going to 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.030
 correct that they already added it and then 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.640
 now they will be able to fish in third 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.409
 person I expected more about this 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.409
 wil I thought I was going to add some 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.120
 new amount or something else but 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.700
 they have not added anything 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.320
 just good two things were added 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.990
 that the wolves can eat rotten meat 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.460
 but that does not matter much and what of 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.530
 the third person fishing rod 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.330
 It does not matter much 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.990
 I thought they were going to add something else 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.060
 I do not know the snowfield or I do not know the gas I do not know the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.950
 something else they would have added 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.509
 I would have liked more here below the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.369
 comments can you tell me that they 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.650
 I would have liked you to bring this build 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.270
 for them to see more or less what is it 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.330
 what were you waiting for I expected another 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.040
 thing the truth I did not expect either 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.810
 these two things just the truth that this 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.430
 it was more to correct errors because the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.320
 truth that is a big list of errors 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.700
 what they corrected that down here a 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.440
