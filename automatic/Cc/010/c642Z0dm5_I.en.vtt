hello<00:00:04.200> I<00:00:04.230> have<00:00:04.680> for<00:00:04.830> you<00:00:04.920> today<00:00:04.950> is<00:00:05.190> just<00:00:05.700> a

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
hello I have for you today is just a

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.299 
hello I have for you today is just a
quick<00:00:05.910> little<00:00:06.120> video<00:00:06.210> so<00:00:06.919> sequential<00:00:07.919> jumping

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
quick little video so sequential jumping

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.430 
quick little video so sequential jumping
now<00:00:08.610> what<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:08.790> means<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.420> double<00:00:10.139> jumping

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
now what that means is double jumping

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.330 
now what that means is double jumping
triple<00:00:10.980> jumping<00:00:11.309> quadruple<00:00:11.849> jumping<00:00:12.440> etc<00:00:13.440> so

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
triple jumping quadruple jumping etc so

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.330 
triple jumping quadruple jumping etc so
as<00:00:14.670> you'd<00:00:14.910> expect<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.540> way<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:15.690> works<00:00:15.990> is

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
as you'd expect the way this works is

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.800 
as you'd expect the way this works is
every<00:00:17.340> time<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.550> go<00:00:17.789> for<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> new<00:00:18.240> jump<00:00:18.510> you're

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
every time you go for a new jump you're

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.679 
every time you go for a new jump you're
going<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:18.990> get<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> little<00:00:19.380> bit<00:00:19.710> higher<00:00:20.689> so

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
going to get a little bit higher so

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.170 
going to get a little bit higher so
until<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.470> get<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.160> certain<00:00:23.460> point<00:00:23.760> where<00:00:23.910> we

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
until we get to a certain point where we

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.509 
until we get to a certain point where we
can<00:00:24.300> get<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.630> next<00:00:24.750> level<00:00:25.130> so<00:00:26.130> one<00:00:26.340> one

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
can get to the next level so one one

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.800 
can get to the next level so one one
jump<00:00:26.849> should<00:00:27.480> be<00:00:27.689> enough<00:00:29.359> okay<00:00:30.359> there<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.689> go

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
jump should be enough okay there we go

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.900 
jump should be enough okay there we go
and<00:00:31.529> then<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.820> treasure<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.360> be<00:00:34.489> very<00:00:35.489> happy

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
and then a treasure and be very happy

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
and then a treasure and be very happy
about<00:00:36.000> our<00:00:36.329> newfound<00:00:37.399> prosperity<00:00:38.719> now<00:00:39.719> this

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
about our newfound prosperity now this

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.690 
about our newfound prosperity now this
obviously<00:00:40.140> uses<00:00:40.770> command<00:00:41.070> blocks<00:00:41.309> with<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
obviously uses command blocks with the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.819 
obviously uses command blocks with the
potion<00:00:41.969> effect<00:00:42.390> another<00:00:43.230> patient<00:00:43.559> event<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
potion effect another patient event the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.600 
potion effect another patient event the
effect<00:00:44.040> command<00:00:45.170> uses<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.350> jump<00:00:47.100> boost<00:00:47.309> so

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
effect command uses the jump boost so

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.060 
effect command uses the jump boost so
obviously<00:00:48.120> every<00:00:48.870> time<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.260> get<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:50.039> a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
obviously every time you get to a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.680 
obviously every time you get to a
specific<00:00:50.309> height<00:00:50.789> you're<00:00:51.090> given<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.329> new<00:00:51.480> Jump

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
specific height you're given a new Jump

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.920 
specific height you're given a new Jump
List<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.379> start<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> 56<00:00:53.449> but<00:00:54.449> once<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:54.840> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
List so we start a 56 but once we get to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.130 
List so we start a 56 but once we get to
57<00:00:55.559> we'll<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.699> given<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.390> potion<00:00:57.870> effect

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
57 we'll be given this potion effect

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.310 
57 we'll be given this potion effect
which<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:59.340> boost<00:00:59.609> last<00:01:00.270> one<00:01:00.570> second<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
which is your boost last one second and

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.889 
which is your boost last one second and
has<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> potency<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.309> two<00:01:02.550> which<00:01:03.329> will<00:01:03.570> allow<00:01:03.750> us

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
has a potency of two which will allow us

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.020 
has a potency of two which will allow us
to<00:01:03.930> jump<00:01:04.170> higher<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.530> next<00:01:04.769> jump<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.220> then

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
to jump higher the next jump and then

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
to jump higher the next jump and then
etc<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.659> does<00:01:06.780> sort<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.080> same<00:01:07.200> thing<00:01:07.500> that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
etc it does sort of the same thing that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.530 
etc it does sort of the same thing that
Gibson<00:01:07.830> gives<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> higher<00:01:08.640> potency<00:01:08.939> potion

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
Gibson gives you a higher potency potion

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.679 
Gibson gives you a higher potency potion
effects<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.970> they<00:01:12.090> actually<00:01:12.180> want<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.510> note

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
effects so they actually want to note

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.830 
effects so they actually want to note
though<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.710> way<00:01:13.920> actually<00:01:14.070> did<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> video

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
though is the way actually did the video

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.350 
though is the way actually did the video
so<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.320> did<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.189> corridor<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.210> will

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
so I did in this corridor and you will

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.730 
so I did in this corridor and you will
have<00:01:18.450> noticed<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.049> there<00:01:19.170> are<00:01:19.200> vines<00:01:19.470> at<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
have noticed that there are vines at the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.300 
have noticed that there are vines at the
bottom<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.040> things

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
bottom of things

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.010 
bottom of things
now<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.030> reason<00:01:21.330> there<00:01:21.450> are<00:01:21.509> vines<00:01:21.689> and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
now the reason there are vines and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.370 
now the reason there are vines and
you've<00:01:22.140> most<00:01:22.830> likely<00:01:22.950> reach<00:01:23.280> guest<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.850> that

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
you've most likely reach guest is that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.200 
you've most likely reach guest is that
when<00:01:25.380> you're<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.560> survival<00:01:25.860> mode<00:01:29.210> you're

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
when you're in survival mode you're

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.300 
when you're in survival mode you're
going<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> get<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.960> recoil<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.920> damaged

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
going to get that of recoil that damaged

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.460 
going to get that of recoil that damaged
your<00:01:32.430> coil<00:01:32.700> which<00:01:32.909> sort<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.259> ruins<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
your coil which sort of ruins the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.690 
your coil which sort of ruins the
jumping<00:01:34.970> mechanism<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:38.189> only<00:01:38.400> way<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
jumping mechanism so the only way to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.560 
jumping mechanism so the only way to
stop<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.590> from<00:01:40.590> happening<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.220> via<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
stop that is from happening is via the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.560 
stop that is from happening is via the
vines<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.280> doesn't<00:01:44.850> really<00:01:44.939> work<00:01:45.149> as<00:01:45.420> I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
vines so it doesn't really work as I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.109 
vines so it doesn't really work as I
wanted<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.549> wanted<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> be<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> big

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
wanted it to I wanted it to be a big

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.060 
wanted it to I wanted it to be a big
area<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.259> has<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.619> be<00:01:49.649> limit<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.979> that

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
area but it has to be limit to that

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.440 
area but it has to be limit to that
thing<00:01:50.250> which<00:01:50.399> kind<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:52.820> stunts<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:54.060> little<00:01:54.329> bit

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
thing which kind of stunts a little bit

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.260 
thing which kind of stunts a little bit
but<00:01:54.810> there<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.110> actually<00:01:55.680> not<00:01:56.640> very<00:01:56.700> reliable

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
but there is actually not very reliable

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.330 
but there is actually not very reliable
because<00:01:57.360> I'm<00:01:57.540> not<00:01:57.630> completely<00:01:58.110> sure<00:01:58.380> how<00:01:59.280> to

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
because I'm not completely sure how to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.590 
because I'm not completely sure how to
time<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.790> correctly<00:01:59.820> but<00:02:00.210> there<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.450> actually

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
time it correctly but there is actually

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.980 
time it correctly but there is actually
a<00:02:00.780> different<00:02:01.229> way<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:02.270> getting<00:02:03.270> past<00:02:03.540> that

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
a different way of getting past that

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.249 
a different way of getting past that
limitation<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> way<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.299> get<00:02:06.540> past<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.990> is

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
limitation so the way to get past it is

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.330 
limitation so the way to get past it is
quite<00:02:07.799> simple<00:02:08.069> really

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
quite simple really

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.570 
quite simple really
if<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.270> give<00:02:09.450> yourself

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
if you give yourself

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.240 
if you give yourself
what's<00:02:11.910> called<00:02:12.120> resistance<00:02:12.660> five<00:02:13.250> what

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
what's called resistance five what

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.380 
what's called resistance five what
that's<00:02:14.400> going<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.610> do<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:14.940> it's<00:02:15.120> going<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.270> make

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
that's going to do is it's going to make

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.150 
that's going to do is it's going to make
you<00:02:15.510> invincible<00:02:15.720> basically<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.890> can't

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
you invincible basically so you can't

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.710 
you invincible basically so you can't
actually<00:02:17.400> take<00:02:17.790> damage<00:02:18.240> if<00:02:18.420> you've<00:02:18.540> got

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
actually take damage if you've got

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.080 
actually take damage if you've got
resistance<00:02:18.960> five<00:02:19.410> because<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.760> blocks<00:02:20.910> were

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
resistance five because it blocks were

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.660 
resistance five because it blocks were
damaged<00:02:21.680> but<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:22.980> there<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:23.430> go<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.640> have

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
damaged but so there we go you have

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.840 
damaged but so there we go you have
resistance<00:02:24.090> five<00:02:24.330> there<00:02:24.800> but<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.460> annoying

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
resistance five there but the annoying

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.660 
resistance five there but the annoying
thing<00:02:27.030> here<00:02:27.240> is<00:02:27.510> even<00:02:28.140> though<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.410> can't<00:02:29.040> take

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
thing here is even though you can't take

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.010 
thing here is even though you can't take
damage<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.450> still<00:02:30.720> get<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:30.930> coil<00:02:31.380> effect

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
damage you still get that coil effect

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.960 
damage you still get that coil effect
but<00:02:34.020> there<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.410> still<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.310> way<00:02:35.460> of<00:02:35.640> getting<00:02:35.880> past

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
but there is still a way of getting past

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.290 
but there is still a way of getting past
it<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:37.340> another<00:02:38.340> if<00:02:38.490> we<00:02:38.640> add<00:02:38.790> actually<00:02:39.060> add

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
it so another if we add actually add

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.930 
it so another if we add actually add
aliens<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.800> command<00:02:41.160> we<00:02:41.340> don't<00:02:41.520> need<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.790> mean

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
aliens to command we don't need to mean

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.400 
aliens to command we don't need to mean
you<00:02:42.000> only<00:02:42.240> need<00:02:42.450> one<00:02:42.630> really<00:02:42.780> but<00:02:43.110> let's<00:02:43.260> do

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
you only need one really but let's do

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.400 
you only need one really but let's do
two<00:02:43.560> anyway<00:02:43.800> if<00:02:44.640> we<00:02:44.820> add<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.240> command<00:02:46.230> block

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
two anyway if we add a command block

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.190 
two anyway if we add a command block
that<00:02:46.890> basically<00:02:47.610> gives<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.630> an<00:02:48.720> instant

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
that basically gives you an instant

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.930 
that basically gives you an instant
damage<00:02:49.410> effect<00:02:49.800> right<00:02:50.190> before<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.730> hit<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
damage effect right before you hit the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.720 
damage effect right before you hit the
ground<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.950> can<00:02:52.980> actually<00:02:53.310> take<00:02:53.460> advantage

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
ground you can actually take advantage

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.870 
ground you can actually take advantage
of<00:02:54.270> this<00:02:54.860> for<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.920> very<00:02:56.070> brief<00:02:56.280> moment<00:02:56.520> you're

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
of this for a very brief moment you're

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.390 
of this for a very brief moment you're
you're<00:02:57.510> invulnerable<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.100> can<00:02:59.220> take

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
you're invulnerable so you can take

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.340 
you're invulnerable so you can take
damage<00:02:59.580> so<00:03:00.150> because<00:03:00.480> you've<00:03:00.660> taken<00:03:01.080> the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
damage so because you've taken the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.810 
damage so because you've taken the
damage<00:03:01.620> before<00:03:01.890> you've<00:03:02.280> actually<00:03:02.430> hit<00:03:02.730> the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
damage before you've actually hit the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.850 
damage before you've actually hit the
ground<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.630> can<00:03:03.660> do<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.080> other<00:03:04.200> jump<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:04.710> I'll

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
ground you can do the other jump so I'll

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.880 
ground you can do the other jump so I'll
try<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.340> demonstrate<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:07.290> if<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.710> give

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
try and demonstrate that so if I give

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.080 
try and demonstrate that so if I give
myself<00:03:08.040> resistance<00:03:08.960> go<00:03:09.960> into<00:03:10.200> game<00:03:10.470> mode

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
myself resistance go into game mode

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.050 
myself resistance go into game mode
survival<00:03:13.340> you'll<00:03:14.340> see<00:03:14.490> I<00:03:14.520> sort<00:03:14.910> of<00:03:14.940> take

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
survival you'll see I sort of take

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.390 
survival you'll see I sort of take
damage<00:03:15.390> before<00:03:15.570> I<00:03:15.750> hit<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.050> ground<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:19.400> I'm

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
damage before I hit the ground and I'm

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.600 
damage before I hit the ground and I'm
allowed<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.790> jump<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.090> bit<00:03:21.300> higher<00:03:21.510> now

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
allowed to jump a bit higher now

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.440 
allowed to jump a bit higher now
obviously<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.700> reason<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:23.970> didn't<00:03:24.180> use<00:03:24.300> this

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
obviously the reason I didn't use this

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.949 
obviously the reason I didn't use this
because<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:24.930> quite<00:03:25.080> unreliable<00:03:25.560> um<00:03:26.330> I<00:03:27.330> can't

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
because it's quite unreliable um I can't

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.960 
because it's quite unreliable um I can't
seem<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.530> get<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.830> times<00:03:29.070> quite<00:03:29.430> right<00:03:29.640> but

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
seem to get the times quite right but

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.030 
seem to get the times quite right but
basically<00:03:30.930> as<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.230> just<00:03:31.500> demonstrated<00:03:31.590> when

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
basically as I just demonstrated when

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.979 
basically as I just demonstrated when
you<00:03:32.160> get<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.400> about<00:03:32.550> this<00:03:32.790> level<00:03:32.930> this<00:03:33.930> level

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
you get to about this level this level

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.290 
you get to about this level this level
here<00:03:34.410> where<00:03:34.590> this<00:03:34.680> person<00:03:35.070> is<00:03:35.670> here<00:03:35.940> that's

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
here where this person is here that's

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.640 
here where this person is here that's
great<00:03:36.690> when<00:03:36.930> you're<00:03:37.020> going<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.200> get<00:03:37.290> damaged

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
great when you're going to get damaged

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.560 
great when you're going to get damaged
so<00:03:37.830> right<00:03:38.130> before<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.459> hit<00:03:38.670> then<00:03:39.420> you're

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
so right before you hit then you're

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.810 
so right before you hit then you're
going<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.989> kind<00:03:40.770> of<00:03:40.800> set<00:03:40.950> damage<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.610> can't

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
going to kind of set damage so you can't

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.490 
going to kind of set damage so you can't
take<00:03:42.000> damage<00:03:42.180> when<00:03:42.360> you<00:03:42.510> hit<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.720> ground<00:03:42.900> if

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
take damage when you hit the ground if

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.440 
take damage when you hit the ground if
you<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:44.280> understand<00:03:44.610> what<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.730> mean<00:03:44.790> there<00:03:45.120> if
