00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello if you can not manage anymore 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.450
 the rear fch and your brake touches 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.210
 completely self weight nor of your 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.240
 scooter there is only one way to settle 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.640
 the variator voting brake so how 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.619
 set the brake on your drive you 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.050
 see there my brake touches completely 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.640
 employees and I will not do much by 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.500
 example if I roll to 60 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.849
 I'm not going to slow you down and 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.039
 youth to make an accident 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.320
 so there is only one method all 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.450
 simple to do that it takes you five 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.780
 minutes is like that there will be a lot 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.200
 more security and at least well you 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.290
 will be better 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.270
 so here these drives so the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.180
 scooter dimmer here the rear wheel 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.920
 and we see that there is a small cable here 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.010
 and that's the brake that will adjust the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.199
 variator so how to do it for 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.500
 serves and then you do not need the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.960
 any tools or pliers have no 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.670
 help you can do it alone so 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.390
 how do you go push their 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.119
 language is here that's like here and there 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.619
 you see that your brake is going off 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.920
 in fact not if you see the light 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.979
 red 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.590
 but the fart triggered by a system 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.380
 electronics is so in fact you're going 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.330
 push this tongue is is tight this 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.320
 leblond which a kind of bolts that has 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:37.229
 here on the screw and this will stretch your 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.750
 your your brake so wanted to squeeze you 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.930
 look a little green here it should 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.189
 go 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.750
 so we're going to watch a little bit I've braked 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.659
 see it's too tense there is no 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.820
 a lot of movements 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.220
 you're still pressed loosen a 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.360
 little 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.380
 so do not be too tight otherwise you 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.399
 do not be able to brake any more 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.560
 we are going to look here here is there is a 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.560
 pretty good movement my handle 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.890
 this fold well we had to have just 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:16.450
 after the handle so the road we are there 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:26.650
 where I know well we'll put the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:30.300
 contact then get the wheel spinning 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.300
 and we'll see what happens 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.110
 So here we see that the swell 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.090
 brakes quickly and that the cable 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:51.510
 falls well so we will look at everything 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:56.160
 that it makes the handle so here 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.590
 I settled the the brake of du 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.810
 drive and we see that the handle this 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.640
 block pretty much here school is blocking itself pretty much 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.050
 near here there you see I took 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.300
 really thoroughly but it's not very goal 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.240
 for the brake but when I press hard 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.800
 it touches the normal font but you 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.720
 really go pretty much like that if 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.580
 when you will do but it starts to 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.740
 tender and its surroundings to two 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.230
 centimeters of your skin nor do you have 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.790
 fine adjust your brake so here 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.680
 now you can roll any 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.500
 insecurity and well braked in scooter 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.480
 without falling or skidding 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.150
 I hope you have everything 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.420
 understood and that you will roll better 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.420
