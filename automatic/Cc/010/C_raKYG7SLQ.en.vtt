now<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.330> thought<00:00:09.540> about<00:00:09.780> installing<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.290> pioneer

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
now I thought about installing a pioneer

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.080 
now I thought about installing a pioneer
head<00:00:10.889> unit<00:00:11.190> but<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.400> fact<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.759> matter<00:00:11.790> is

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
head unit but the fact of the matter is

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.759 
head unit but the fact of the matter is
these<00:00:12.269> are<00:00:12.330> pretty<00:00:12.630> expensive<00:00:12.900> they<00:00:13.559> take

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
these are pretty expensive they take

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.110 
these are pretty expensive they take
forever<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.309> Buddha<00:00:14.639> they<00:00:14.759> usually<00:00:14.910> have

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
forever to Buddha they usually have

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.480 
forever to Buddha they usually have
resistive<00:00:15.599> touchscreens<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.109> carplay<00:00:16.890> quite

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
resistive touchscreens and carplay quite

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.880 
resistive touchscreens and carplay quite
honestly<00:00:17.850> sucks<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:19.109> people<00:00:19.380> recommended

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
I wouldn't just be updating the iPad I'd

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.950 
I wouldn't just be updating the iPad I'd
also<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.660> installing<00:00:28.019> new<00:00:29.090> speakers<00:00:30.090> new<00:00:30.599> Dax

new<00:00:31.349> amplifiers<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.340> that's<00:00:32.579> just<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.969> very

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
new amplifiers and that's just a very

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.819 
new amplifiers and that's just a very
expensive<00:00:33.570> process<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.800> I

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
expensive process it's not that I

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.290 
expensive process it's not that I
wouldn't<00:00:35.100> do<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.030> wouldn't

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300

old<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.910> here's<00:00:39.180> my<00:00:39.360> solution<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.140> obd<00:00:40.649> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
old so here's my solution I have obd to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100 
old so here's my solution I have obd to
support<00:00:41.219> bluetooth<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.030> more<00:00:42.300> best<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.960> all

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
support bluetooth and more best of all

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:54.260 
support bluetooth and more best of all

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
beautiful tonight back on topic so I

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.010 
beautiful tonight back on topic so I
installed<00:03:07.950> obd<00:03:08.670> turbo<00:03:09.239> which<00:03:09.450> is<00:03:09.600> available

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
installed obd turbo which is available

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.720 
installed obd turbo which is available
in<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.140> App<00:03:10.260> Store<00:03:10.500> for<00:03:10.530> $9.99<00:03:11.310> it's<00:03:11.489> one<00:03:11.640> of

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
in the App Store for $9.99 it's one of

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.250 
in the App Store for $9.99 it's one of
the<00:03:11.820> pricier<00:03:12.300> ones<00:03:12.510> but<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.720> think<00:03:12.930> it's<00:03:13.050> worth

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
the pricier ones but I think it's worth

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.750 
the pricier ones but I think it's worth
it<00:03:13.440> because<00:03:13.560> not<00:03:13.860> only<00:03:13.890> does<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.250> function

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
it because not only does it function

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.490
