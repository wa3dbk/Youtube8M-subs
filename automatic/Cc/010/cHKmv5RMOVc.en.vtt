 there the notice that our dear friend 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.200
 trox daemon has allegedly published in its 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.359
 twitter 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.359
 it was not worth the guys to spend time 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:38.389
 to vote for him and he apologizes 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:40.999

 receives sponsorship and not simply 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.529
 said he will not play because there is something 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.259
 most important to do 

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:58.219
 I sincerely hope that it is there. 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.079
 a lie 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.759
 I told the guys what they 're doing 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.159

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.969
 You'll have to sleep because two 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:11.690
