00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.560 
you can do pretty well against anyway
and<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.240> heracross<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:54.299> only<00:01:54.420> thing

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and then heracross and the only thing

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.730 
and then heracross and the only thing
that's<00:01:54.720> gonna<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:55.020> threaten<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.500> how<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
that's gonna really threaten you how to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.140 
that's gonna really threaten you how to
those<00:01:55.950> trees<00:01:56.190> shannon<00:01:56.580> law<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.880> they<00:01:56.970> usually

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
those trees shannon law and they usually

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.050 
those trees shannon law and they usually
run<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> scarf<00:01:57.840> anyway<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.399> think<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.729> modest

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
run a scarf anyway so I think the modest

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.999 
run a scarf anyway so I think the modest
nature<00:02:00.330> is<00:02:00.479> better<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.049> more<00:02:01.350> power<00:02:01.680> with

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
nature is better to get more power with

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.340 
nature is better to get more power with
your<00:02:02.190> attacks<00:02:02.640> because<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.750> essentially

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
your attacks because this is essentially

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.680 
your attacks because this is essentially
a<00:02:04.590> really<00:02:05.190> hard-hitting<00:02:05.549> set<00:02:06.060> once<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.539> get<00:02:06.659> a

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
a really hard-hitting set once you get a

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.070 
a really hard-hitting set once you get a
nasty<00:02:06.899> plot<00:02:07.229> up<00:02:07.640> now<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.000> moves<00:02:09.209> first<00:02:09.780> is

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
nasty plot up now the moves first is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.410 
nasty plot up now the moves first is
nasty<00:02:10.560> plot<00:02:10.770> pretty<00:02:11.370> straightforward<00:02:12.090> it's

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
nasty plot pretty straightforward it's

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.050 
nasty plot pretty straightforward it's
the<00:02:12.720> only<00:02:13.350> thing<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.860> lets<00:02:14.040> Toxicroak<00:02:14.819> hit

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the only thing that lets Toxicroak hit

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.970 
the only thing that lets Toxicroak hit
reasonably<00:02:15.660> hard<00:02:15.840> because<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.680> Special

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
reasonably hard because the Special

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.850 
reasonably hard because the Special
Attack<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.340> 86<00:02:17.880> which<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.269> not<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:19.290> good<00:02:19.620> at

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
Attack is 86 which is not that good at

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.640 
Attack is 86 which is not that good at
all<00:02:20.069> that's<00:02:20.760> why<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.600> beneficial<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.380> run<00:02:22.620> a

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
all that's why it is beneficial to run a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.009 
all that's why it is beneficial to run a
modest<00:02:23.010> nature<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.580> even<00:02:24.360> after<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.600> nasty

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
modest nature and even after a nasty

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.960 
modest nature and even after a nasty
plot<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.950> nicely<00:02:26.280> plot<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.610> boost<00:02:26.850> your

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
plot so nicely plot is a boost your

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.900 
plot so nicely plot is a boost your
special<00:02:27.269> attack<00:02:27.480> up<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.810> usable<00:02:28.140> levels<00:02:28.560> and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
special attack up to usable levels and

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.720 
special attack up to usable levels and
then<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.030> next<00:02:30.239> move<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.720> one<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.860> got<00:02:32.519> I

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
then the next move is one that got I

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.320 
then the next move is one that got I
think<00:02:33.060> added<00:02:33.450> in<00:02:33.600> 6th<00:02:33.989> generation<00:02:34.489> if<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.880> don't

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
think added in 6th generation if I don't

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.789 
think added in 6th generation if I don't
think<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.569> was<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.750> 5th<00:02:36.959> generation<00:02:37.110> but<00:02:37.500> yeah

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
think it was in 5th generation but yeah

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.370 
think it was in 5th generation but yeah
this<00:02:37.980> move<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.610> called<00:02:38.640> belch<00:02:39.540> now<00:02:40.500> belch<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.940> a

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
this move is called belch now belch is a

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.789 
this move is called belch now belch is a
120<00:02:43.380> special<00:02:44.130> attack<00:02:44.690> 120<00:02:45.690> power<00:02:45.930> 90%

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
120 special attack 120 power 90%

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:47.449 
120 special attack 120 power 90%
accurate

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
accurate

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.280 
accurate
special<00:02:48.120> poison<00:02:48.630> moves<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.049> might<00:02:49.260> be

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
special poison moves so you might be

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.990 
special poison moves so you might be
thinking<00:02:49.410> like<00:02:49.829> hang<00:02:50.250> on<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.820> an

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
thinking like hang on this is an

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.880 
thinking like hang on this is an
insanely<00:02:51.390> good<00:02:51.660> move<00:02:51.870> what's<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.709> downside

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
insanely good move what's the downside

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.770 
insanely good move what's the downside
why<00:02:53.640> not<00:02:53.820> just<00:02:53.970> use<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.120> over<00:02:54.299> sludge<00:02:54.570> bomb

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
why not just use it over sludge bomb

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.319 
why not just use it over sludge bomb
well<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.320> downside<00:02:55.709> is<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.730> have<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.150> eat<00:02:57.299> a

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
well the downside is you have to eat a

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.229 
well the downside is you have to eat a
berry<00:02:57.810> before<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.440> can<00:02:58.590> use<00:02:58.769> this<00:02:58.920> move<00:02:59.239> so

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
berry before you can use this move so

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.110 
berry before you can use this move so
it's<00:03:00.930> very<00:03:01.260> situational<00:03:01.670> but<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:02.700> think<00:03:02.940> this

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
it's very situational but I think this

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.750 
it's very situational but I think this
set<00:03:03.390> takes<00:03:03.799> really<00:03:04.799> good<00:03:05.010> advantage<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.640> it

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
set takes really good advantage of it

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.069 
set takes really good advantage of it
due<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.239> fact<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.660> can<00:03:06.810> set<00:03:07.049> up

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
due to the fact that you can set up

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.470 
due to the fact that you can set up
first<00:03:07.380> turn<00:03:07.650> with<00:03:07.859> nastyplot<00:03:08.340> get<00:03:09.299> your

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
first turn with nastyplot get your

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.289 
first turn with nastyplot get your
citrus<00:03:09.810> berry<00:03:10.400> then<00:03:11.400> be<00:03:11.790> healed<00:03:12.000> up<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.269> a

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
citrus berry then be healed up to a

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.390 
citrus berry then be healed up to a
decent<00:03:12.720> amount<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:13.019> HP<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.620> then<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.250> can

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
decent amount of HP and then you can

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.949 
decent amount of HP and then you can
start<00:03:14.609> going<00:03:14.760> for<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> hundred<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.570> twenty

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.030 
we're going to be running is vacuum wave
now<00:03:42.700> this<00:03:42.969> is<00:03:43.120> personally<00:03:43.599> for<00:03:43.780> me<00:03:43.959> because<00:03:44.769> I

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
now this is personally for me because I

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.339 
now this is personally for me because I
just<00:03:45.400> miss<00:03:45.670> focus<00:03:46.090> blast<00:03:46.269> way<00:03:46.689> too<00:03:46.750> much<00:03:47.079> to

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
just miss focus blast way too much to

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.679 
just miss focus blast way too much to
ever<00:03:47.530> want<00:03:47.799> to<00:03:47.890> use<00:03:48.159> it<00:03:48.280> again<00:03:48.340> you<00:03:49.120> can<00:03:49.420> run

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:49.689 
ever want to use it again you can run

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.030 
ever want to use it again you can run
focus<00:03:49.930> blast<00:03:50.290> if<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.620> just<00:03:50.769> want<00:03:50.980> to

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
focus blast if you just want to

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.479 
focus blast if you just want to
massively<00:03:52.000> powerful<00:03:52.540> moves<00:03:52.829> but<00:03:53.829> then<00:03:54.219> you

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
massively powerful moves but then you

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.709 
massively powerful moves but then you
won't<00:03:54.670> really<00:03:54.849> have<00:03:55.060> anything<00:03:55.359> to<00:03:55.569> hit

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:55.719 
won't really have anything to hit

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:58.229 
won't really have anything to hit
accurately<00:03:56.319> and<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:57.219> priority<00:03:57.640> does<00:03:57.879> help

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
accurately and the priority does help

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.539 
accurately and the priority does help
especially<00:03:58.900> if<00:03:58.989> you're<00:03:59.109> running<00:03:59.230> modest<00:03:59.739> so

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
especially if you're running modest so

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.970 
especially if you're running modest so
vacuum<00:04:01.060> wave<00:04:01.299> is<00:04:01.480> good<00:04:01.689> for<00:04:02.049> maybe<00:04:02.560> if<00:04:02.709> a<00:04:02.769> belch

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
vacuum wave is good for maybe if a belch

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.360 
vacuum wave is good for maybe if a belch

puts them down on 80 or 90 does 80 or 90
percent<00:04:06.489> of<00:04:06.819> them<00:04:06.970> they're<00:04:07.269> left<00:04:07.510> on<00:04:07.599> a<00:04:07.659> little

percent of them they're left on a little

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.899

bit<00:04:08.319> of<00:04:08.409> HP<00:04:08.739> you<00:04:08.889> can<00:04:09.010> vacuum<00:04:09.189> wave<00:04:09.459> next<00:04:09.760> turn

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
bit of HP you can vacuum wave next turn

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.479 
bit of HP you can vacuum wave next turn
without<00:04:10.209> taking<00:04:10.569> any<00:04:10.750> damage<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.590> you<00:04:12.370> could

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
without taking any damage and you could

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.400 
without taking any damage and you could
also<00:04:12.609> hit<00:04:12.849> things<00:04:13.120> like<00:04:14.189> scarf<00:04:15.189> hydreigon

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
also hit things like scarf hydreigon

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.089 
also hit things like scarf hydreigon
just<00:04:17.410> fast

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
just fast

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.469 
just fast
Tourette's<00:04:18.519> you<00:04:18.729> can<00:04:18.880> get<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.030> bit<00:04:19.180> of<00:04:19.269> damage

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
Tourette's you can get a bit of damage

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.060 
Tourette's you can get a bit of damage
on<00:04:19.690> them<00:04:19.840> before<00:04:19.959> you<00:04:20.229> get<00:04:20.349> taken<00:04:20.620> out<00:04:20.799> which

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
on them before you get taken out which

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.460 
on them before you get taken out which
is<00:04:21.190> always<00:04:21.340> nice<00:04:21.609> and<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.660> last<00:04:22.840> move<00:04:23.080> it

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
is always nice and the last move it

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.219 
is always nice and the last move it
gives<00:04:23.680> you<00:04:23.800> perfect<00:04:24.039> coverage<00:04:24.729> between<00:04:25.509> this

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
gives you perfect coverage between this

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.839 
gives you perfect coverage between this
move<00:04:26.440> and<00:04:26.620> belt<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:27.099> get<00:04:27.280> pretty<00:04:27.610> decent

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
move and belt you get pretty decent

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:29.700 
move and belt you get pretty decent
coverage<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.509> then<00:04:28.599> vacuum<00:04:29.169> wave<00:04:29.470> just

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
coverage and then vacuum wave just

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.230 
coverage and then vacuum wave just
finishes<00:04:30.099> it<00:04:30.160> off<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.520> it's<00:04:30.669> shadow<00:04:30.970> ball

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
finishes it off and it's shadow ball

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.960 
finishes it off and it's shadow ball
chatter<00:04:31.990> was<00:04:32.229> just<00:04:32.440> 100%<00:04:33.220> accurate<00:04:33.820> reliable

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
chatter was just 100% accurate reliable

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.360 
chatter was just 100% accurate reliable
move<00:04:34.479> to<00:04:34.720> use<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.289> it<00:04:35.590> does<00:04:35.620> actually<00:04:36.039> get

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
move to use and it does actually get

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.820 
move to use and it does actually get
pretty<00:04:36.669> good<00:04:36.820> coverage<00:04:37.150> as<00:04:37.300> I<00:04:37.419> said<00:04:37.660> you<00:04:38.620> can

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
pretty good coverage as I said you can

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.920 
pretty good coverage as I said you can
use<00:04:38.860> dark<00:04:39.310> pulse<00:04:39.430> but<00:04:40.150> there's<00:04:40.509> not<00:04:40.630> that<00:04:40.780> much

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
use dark pulse but there's not that much

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.710 
use dark pulse but there's not that much
reason<00:04:41.199> to<00:04:41.380> use<00:04:41.500> it<00:04:41.530> over<00:04:41.949> shadow<00:04:42.220> ball

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
reason to use it over shadow ball

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.659 
reason to use it over shadow ball
so<00:04:43.770> yeah<00:04:44.770> I<00:04:44.800> don't<00:04:44.979> I<00:04:45.220> don't<00:04:45.280> even<00:04:45.430> know<00:04:45.610> if

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
so yeah I don't I don't even know if

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:46.770 
so yeah I don't I don't even know if
there's<00:04:45.820> any<00:04:45.970> reason<00:04:46.180> to<00:04:46.330> use<00:04:46.510> sort<00:04:46.690> of<00:04:46.720> a

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
there's any reason to use sort of a

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.939 
there's any reason to use sort of a
shadow<00:04:47.110> ball<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.440> be<00:04:47.560> honest

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
shadow ball to be honest

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.430 
shadow ball to be honest
yeah<00:04:48.789> Shadow<00:04:49.000> Ball<00:04:49.210> is<00:04:49.360> by<00:04:49.780> far<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:50.050> best

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
yeah Shadow Ball is by far the best

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.659 
yeah Shadow Ball is by far the best
coverage<00:04:50.800> move<00:04:51.010> that<00:04:51.159> it<00:04:51.250> gets<00:04:51.400> because<00:04:51.520> it

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
coverage move that it gets because it

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.279 
coverage move that it gets because it
doesn't<00:04:51.880> get<00:04:52.000> that<00:04:52.210> big<00:04:52.449> of<00:04:52.630> a<00:04:52.720> special<00:04:53.139> move

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
doesn't get that big of a special move

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.029 
doesn't get that big of a special move
fool<00:04:53.560> but<00:04:53.860> you<00:04:54.789> know<00:04:55.289> shadow<00:04:56.289> ball<00:04:56.530> it's

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
fool but you know shadow ball it's

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.700 
fool but you know shadow ball it's
pretty<00:04:57.280> good<00:04:57.460> coverage<00:04:58.229> so<00:04:59.229> yeah

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
pretty good coverage so yeah

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.920 
pretty good coverage so yeah
you<00:04:59.830> basically<00:05:00.310> switch<00:05:00.940> in<00:05:01.120> this<00:05:01.240> set<00:05:01.570> on

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
you basically switch in this set on

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.360 
you basically switch in this set on
something<00:05:02.260> you<00:05:02.349> can<00:05:02.470> set<00:05:02.650> up<00:05:02.740> on<00:05:02.889> like<00:05:03.099> maybe<00:05:03.220> a

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
something you can set up on like maybe a

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.330 
something you can set up on like maybe a
bulky<00:05:03.789> water<00:05:04.030> type<00:05:04.270> like<00:05:05.260> for<00:05:05.860> examples

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
bulky water type like for examples

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.969 
bulky water type like for examples
probably<00:05:07.180> not<00:05:07.449> Slowbro<00:05:08.020> actually<00:05:08.440> like

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
probably not Slowbro actually like

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.469 
probably not Slowbro actually like
melodic<00:05:09.430> or<00:05:09.550> something<00:05:09.880> you<00:05:10.030> can<00:05:10.120> set<00:05:10.330> up<00:05:10.419> a

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
melodic or something you can set up a

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.750 
melodic or something you can set up a
nastyplot<00:05:10.900> then<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:11.979> next<00:05:12.190> turn<00:05:12.310> you<00:05:12.460> can<00:05:12.610> hit

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
nastyplot then the next turn you can hit

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.810 
nastyplot then the next turn you can hit
anything<00:05:13.090> with<00:05:13.240> it's<00:05:13.539> super<00:05:14.080> powerful<00:05:14.260> pouch

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
anything with it's super powerful pouch

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.860 
anything with it's super powerful pouch
assuming<00:05:15.820> that<00:05:15.940> you<00:05:16.060> do<00:05:16.210> get<00:05:16.419> your<00:05:16.570> citrus

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
assuming that you do get your citrus

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.360 
assuming that you do get your citrus
berry<00:05:17.110> if<00:05:17.380> you<00:05:17.500> don't<00:05:17.680> get<00:05:17.740> used<00:05:17.919> to<00:05:17.979> just<00:05:18.190> bury

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
berry if you don't get used to just bury

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.560 
berry if you don't get used to just bury
you<00:05:18.490> can<00:05:18.610> just<00:05:18.760> go<00:05:18.849> for<00:05:19.000> shadow<00:05:19.150> balls<00:05:19.419> or

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
you can just go for shadow balls or

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.550 
you can just go for shadow balls or
vacuum<00:05:19.930> ways<00:05:20.110> until<00:05:20.500> you<00:05:20.620> do<00:05:20.909> but<00:05:21.909> yeah<00:05:22.560> that

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
vacuum ways until you do but yeah that

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.680 
vacuum ways until you do but yeah that
is<00:05:23.590> essentially<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.610> set<00:05:24.970> it's<00:05:25.240> a<00:05:25.330> bit<00:05:25.479> of<00:05:25.599> a

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
is essentially the set it's a bit of a

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.649 
is essentially the set it's a bit of a
different<00:05:26.349> set<00:05:26.590> for<00:05:26.770> Toxicroak<00:05:27.220> very<00:05:27.729> very

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:28.659 
different set for Toxicroak very very

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:30.689 
different set for Toxicroak very very
weird<00:05:28.990> but<00:05:29.409> that's<00:05:29.830> what<00:05:29.979> makes<00:05:30.159> it<00:05:30.280> so<00:05:30.460> fun

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
weird but that's what makes it so fun

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.460 
weird but that's what makes it so fun
because<00:05:30.880> the<00:05:31.120> surprise<00:05:31.479> factor<00:05:31.780> is<00:05:32.139> there

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
because the surprise factor is there

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.830 
because the surprise factor is there
same<00:05:33.159> with<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.430> physical<00:05:33.789> Celebi<00:05:34.240> set<00:05:34.479> it

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
same with the physical Celebi set it

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.570 
same with the physical Celebi set it
just<00:05:34.900> catches<00:05:35.740> so<00:05:35.979> many<00:05:36.159> people<00:05:36.430> off-guard

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
just catches so many people off-guard

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.330 
just catches so many people off-guard
and<00:05:36.970> hopefully<00:05:37.449> I'll<00:05:37.570> be<00:05:37.690> showing<00:05:37.919> how<00:05:38.919> it

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
and hopefully I'll be showing how it

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.219 
and hopefully I'll be showing how it
catches<00:05:39.610> people<00:05:40.000> off<00:05:40.060> guard<00:05:40.120> in<00:05:40.570> my<00:05:40.659> next<00:05:40.870> uu

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
catches people off guard in my next uu

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.719 
catches people off guard in my next uu
session<00:05:41.590> which<00:05:41.770> will<00:05:41.919> probably<00:05:42.250> come<00:05:42.400> out<00:05:42.550> in

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
session which will probably come out in

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.480 
session which will probably come out in
