00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 and their youtube jani and how you see it is 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.830
 changed something 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.750
 as you will have seen from my video 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.519
 previous I am in Rome but according to you 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:20.279
 this prevents me from continuing to do 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:27.680
 the videos you would like true while I was 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.680
 here we studied it we put 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.719
 openly a dear one called me 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.590
 friend I remember an old man of mine 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.010
 project a few months ago and think of a 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.129
 little 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.260
 this project I had proposed to 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.600
 several friends who had one in common 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.550
 simple thing everyone works in 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.039
 a video game store or places 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.010
 where I sell them my initial idea was 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.960
 to ask him questions, clients but not 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.539
 just a simple interview 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.920
 simple question for each customer the most 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:06.710
 pretty and the most absurd is the most 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.659
 possible if they marked the drama 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.290
 here they are genuinely little boy I wouldn't have 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:18.210
 never could have imagined that some comments 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.630
 were they just shoot a shot into 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.320
 face no way out blam enough 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.500
 end is fine cut from here the question 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:32.600
 mail to everyone was a simple one 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.600
 her favorite video game duo 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:43.090
 let's start right away with the three big and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.460
 export that I represent in cars 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.290
 video games 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.300
 oh well because football is the 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.690
 best thing there is no game 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:02:02.020
 it could have been otherwise because this way 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:07.240
 I can play like I'm there because it is 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.479
 so cool to shoot because at least you 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.860
 gives the impression of killing someone 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.300
 as well as some bars have made the 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:20.250
 wars because it is the most difficult game 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.250
 in the history of rita games 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:37.280
 because so I learn history in a manner 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:39.770
 more fun because splatter because it is 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.640
 set in Italy in fact the 3 that 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.720
 will be set in the American Falaschi pro 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.560
 no guys this is too much 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.470
 no no this not because I learn which ones 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.420
 are the real injustices well after 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.950
 these big three and leave you with some 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.950
 other pearl the others 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:18.170
 because it's scary, it's what I can do 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:25.459
 I want and obviously guys since 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:28.040
 it's me couldn't miss it for whom 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:33.709
 master chief and the strongest character 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:40.849
 of all because the first shooter 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:43.389
 of history yes because nothing exists 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.389
 of similar 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:58.489
 and finally because always cool for 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:04:01.909
 something to give but where to fuck clothes in 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:05.599
 a cave in this because it is 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:09.069
 the perfect video game that you fuck the 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.069
 playstation 3 and the 360 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:18.229

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:20.799
 I prefer other words because where not 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.799
 I can 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:30.610
 ready hello how well we are 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:35.710
 by going to you're still asking the question 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:39.570
 someone has a life that answered you 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.570
 so I tell him immediately live 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.820
