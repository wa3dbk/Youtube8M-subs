tablets<00:02:03.709> looking<00:02:04.709> along<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.009> top<00:02:05.189> here<00:02:05.219> we've

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
tablets looking along the top here we've

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.730 
tablets looking along the top here we've
got<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.700> plastic<00:02:06.270> strip<00:02:06.719> which<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> little

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
got a plastic strip which is a little

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.139 
got a plastic strip which is a little
bit<00:02:07.890> different<00:02:08.160> than<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> Prime<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.849> helps

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
bit different than the Prime this helps

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.309 
bit different than the Prime this helps
to<00:02:09.239> make<00:02:09.390> sure<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.810> all<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:10.079> wireless

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
to make sure that all your wireless

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.819 
to make sure that all your wireless
signals<00:02:10.799> are<00:02:11.009> coming<00:02:11.310> through<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:12.299> fine

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:12.829 
signals are coming through just fine

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.130

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
Wi-Fi and gps reception is great on this

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.610

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
edge of the tablet if i tilted there you

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.289 
edge of the tablet if i tilted there you
can<00:03:06.180> see<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.420> little<00:03:06.569> bit<00:03:06.720> better<00:03:07.819> along<00:03:08.819> this

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
can see a little bit better along this

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.789 
can see a little bit better along this
edge<00:03:09.540> we<00:03:09.840> don't<00:03:09.989> actually<00:03:10.170> have<00:03:10.349> anything

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
edge we don't actually have anything

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.039

along the right edge along the left edge

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.410 
along the right edge along the left edge
though<00:03:13.410> we've<00:03:13.950> got<00:03:14.190> our<00:03:14.220> 3.5<00:03:15.150> millimeter

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
though we've got our 3.5 millimeter

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.910 
though we've got our 3.5 millimeter
audio<00:03:15.900> jack<00:03:16.200> at<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.440> bottom<00:03:16.709> which<00:03:16.829> is<00:03:16.859> a

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
audio jack at the bottom which is a

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.870 
audio jack at the bottom which is a
little<00:03:17.040> bit<00:03:17.190> different<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.519> original

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
little bit different the original

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.509 
little bit different the original
transformer<00:03:18.620> which<00:03:19.620> had<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:19.920> at<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.190> top

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
transformer which had it at the top

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.789 
transformer which had it at the top
which<00:03:21.389> made<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.840> kind<00:03:22.049> of<00:03:22.200> awkward<00:03:22.590> when<00:03:22.709> it

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
which made it kind of awkward when it

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.830 
which made it kind of awkward when it
was<00:03:22.919> in<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.250> keyboard<00:03:23.459> dock<00:03:23.819> so<00:03:24.299> along<00:03:24.720> the

was in the keyboard dock so along the

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.409 
was in the keyboard dock so along the
bottom<00:03:24.959> makes<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.380> work<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.620> lot<00:03:25.829> better<00:03:26.419> also

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
bottom makes it work a lot better also

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.720 
bottom makes it work a lot better also

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.540 
to what you'll find on the transformer
prime<00:04:37.479> they<00:04:38.479> seem<00:04:38.810> almost<00:04:39.080> identical<00:04:39.770> if<00:04:40.310> you

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
prime they seem almost identical if you

it's<00:04:45.530> got<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.830> same<00:04:46.039> aluminum<00:04:46.610> construction

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910

it's got the same aluminum construction
of<00:04:47.479> the<00:04:47.990> tablet<00:04:48.500> so<00:04:48.650> there's<00:04:48.919> no<00:04:49.099> flex<00:04:49.490> to<00:04:49.610> this

the<00:05:36.919> tablet<00:05:37.310> so<00:05:37.820> if<00:05:37.940> i<00:05:38.030> plug<00:05:38.210> in<00:05:38.360> the<00:05:38.419> tablet

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
the tablet so if i plug in the tablet

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.270 
the tablet so if i plug in the tablet
you<00:05:38.930> just<00:05:39.080> line<00:05:39.260> up<00:05:39.289> there's<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.740> little<00:05:40.010> arrow

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
you just line up there's a little arrow

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.820 
you just line up there's a little arrow
on<00:05:40.639> the<00:05:41.210> base<00:05:41.419> of<00:05:41.599> the<00:05:41.659> dock<00:05:41.840> as<00:05:42.110> well<00:05:42.380> as<00:05:42.650> on

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
on the base of the dock as well as on

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.189 
on the base of the dock as well as on
the<00:05:42.919> bottom<00:05:43.190> of<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.310> tablet<00:05:43.550> very<00:05:43.699> small

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
the bottom of the tablet very small

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.170 
the bottom of the tablet very small
usually<00:05:45.199> goes<00:05:45.320> by<00:05:45.470> unnoticed<00:05:45.860> but<00:05:46.430> helps<00:05:47.060> you

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
usually goes by unnoticed but helps you

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.490 
usually goes by unnoticed but helps you
just<00:05:47.330> slide<00:05:47.570> that<00:05:47.599> tablet<00:05:48.080> right<00:05:48.169> it<00:05:48.289> is<00:05:48.409> a

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
just slide that tablet right it is a

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.980 
just slide that tablet right it is a
little<00:05:48.650> bit<00:05:48.770> stiffer<00:05:49.099> than<00:05:49.729> the<00:05:50.570> original

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
little bit stiffer than the original

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.769 
little bit stiffer than the original
transformer<00:05:51.760> but<00:05:52.760> after<00:05:53.150> a<00:05:53.180> little<00:05:53.300> while<00:05:53.419> you

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:53.779 
transformer but after a little while you

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:55.230 
transformer but after a little while you
will<00:05:53.810> get<00:05:54.080> used<00:05:54.289> to<00:05:54.409> it<00:05:54.500> no<00:05:54.620> problem

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
will get used to it no problem

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.300 
will get used to it no problem
so<00:05:56.020> taking<00:05:56.259> a<00:05:56.289> look<00:05:56.319> the<00:05:56.530> whole<00:05:56.650> assembly<00:05:57.099> here

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
so taking a look the whole assembly here

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.309 
so taking a look the whole assembly here
is<00:05:57.669> very<00:05:58.000> light<00:05:58.240> very<00:05:58.270> easy<00:05:58.690> to<00:05:58.810> carry<00:05:59.020> in<00:05:59.139> one

00:05:59.309 --> 00:05:59.319 
is very light very easy to carry in one

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:01.620 
is very light very easy to carry in one
hand<00:05:59.590> various<00:06:00.460> on<00:06:00.669> so<00:06:01.000> it<00:06:01.090> doesn't<00:06:01.300> feel<00:06:01.389> weird

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
hand various on so it doesn't feel weird

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.779 
hand various on so it doesn't feel weird
when<00:06:02.020> you're<00:06:02.199> carrying<00:06:02.919> it<00:06:03.039> even<00:06:03.400> from<00:06:03.550> just<00:06:03.729> a

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
when you're carrying it even from just a

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:05.969 
when you're carrying it even from just a
small<00:06:04.030> edge<00:06:04.210> like<00:06:04.509> that<00:06:04.949> the<00:06:05.949> whole

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
small edge like that the whole

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.100 
small edge like that the whole
construction<00:06:06.520> is<00:06:06.699> very<00:06:06.880> thin<00:06:07.180> let's<00:06:07.840> compare

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
construction is very thin let's compare

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.760 
construction is very thin let's compare
it<00:06:08.229> to<00:06:08.410> the<00:06:08.620> original<00:06:09.400> transformer<00:06:10.229> it<00:06:11.229> is

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
it to the original transformer it is

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.370 
it to the original transformer it is
quite<00:06:12.759> a<00:06:12.789> bit<00:06:13.000> thinner<00:06:13.240> as<00:06:13.449> you<00:06:13.509> can<00:06:13.960> see<00:06:14.169> and

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
quite a bit thinner as you can see and

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.950 
quite a bit thinner as you can see and
what<00:06:14.979> I<00:06:15.009> really<00:06:15.460> like<00:06:15.729> about<00:06:15.910> this<00:06:16.330> new<00:06:16.630> dock

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
what I really like about this new dock

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.939 
what I really like about this new dock
is<00:06:17.259> that<00:06:18.039> the<00:06:18.340> hinge<00:06:18.849> is<00:06:19.090> a<00:06:19.120> lot<00:06:19.509> sturdier<00:06:19.949> so

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
is that the hinge is a lot sturdier so

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:26.059 
is that the hinge is a lot sturdier so
if<00:06:21.069> I<00:06:21.160> compare<00:06:21.550> it<00:06:21.610> to<00:06:22.000> my<00:06:22.539> transformer<00:06:23.229> here

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:26.069 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:28.080 

the<00:06:27.069> transformer<00:06:27.580> had<00:06:27.699> a<00:06:27.729> little<00:06:27.909> bit<00:06:28.060> of

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
the transformer had a little bit of

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
the transformer had a little bit of
wiggle<00:06:28.330> in<00:06:28.630> the<00:06:29.110> dock<00:06:29.319> hinge<00:06:30.180> the<00:06:31.180> Prime<00:06:31.659> hat

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
wiggle in the dock hinge the Prime hat

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.439 
wiggle in the dock hinge the Prime hat
or<00:06:32.409> the<00:06:32.440> infinity<00:06:33.340> Rather's<00:06:33.759> sometimes<00:06:34.360> I

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:34.449 
or the infinity Rather's sometimes I

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:37.320 
or the infinity Rather's sometimes I
even<00:06:34.569> get<00:06:34.720> them<00:06:34.870> confused<00:06:35.610> has<00:06:36.610> a<00:06:36.639> lot<00:06:37.060> less

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
even get them confused has a lot less

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.779 
even get them confused has a lot less
wiggle<00:06:37.630> to<00:06:38.080> it<00:06:38.259> it<00:06:38.440> feels<00:06:38.919> a<00:06:39.099> lot<00:06:39.250> more<00:06:39.310> stable

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
wiggle to it it feels a lot more stable

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:42.390 
wiggle to it it feels a lot more stable
in<00:06:40.120> that<00:06:40.330> dot<00:06:40.569> and<00:06:40.840> then<00:06:41.289> the<00:06:41.800> hinge<00:06:42.099> here

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
in that dot and then the hinge here

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.640 
in that dot and then the hinge here
feels<00:06:42.849> a<00:06:43.030> lot<00:06:43.180> lighter<00:06:43.509> it's<00:06:44.169> easy<00:06:44.319> to<00:06:44.500> press

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
feels a lot lighter it's easy to press

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.879 
feels a lot lighter it's easy to press
down<00:06:45.060> whereas<00:06:46.060> the<00:06:46.240> one<00:06:46.419> on<00:06:46.659> the<00:06:47.080> infinity<00:06:47.710> is

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889 
down whereas the one on the infinity is

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.770 
down whereas the one on the infinity is
a<00:06:47.949> little<00:06:48.819> bit<00:06:48.940> sturdier<00:06:49.150> but<00:06:49.479> it<00:06:49.569> doesn't

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 
a little bit sturdier but it doesn't

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.110 
a little bit sturdier but it doesn't
actually<00:06:49.900> make<00:06:50.139> it<00:06:50.319> hard<00:06:50.710> to<00:06:50.800> press<00:06:51.039> down<00:06:51.120> but

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
actually make it hard to press down but

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.290 
actually make it hard to press down but
it<00:06:52.900> still<00:06:53.710> does<00:06:53.979> have<00:06:54.159> a<00:06:54.220> very<00:06:54.400> sturdy<00:06:54.729> feel<00:06:55.060> to

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
it still does have a very sturdy feel to

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.600 
it still does have a very sturdy feel to
it<00:06:55.330> it<00:06:55.780> doesn't<00:06:56.050> shake<00:06:56.289> when<00:06:57.009> you're<00:06:57.190> pushing

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
it it doesn't shake when you're pushing

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.159 
it it doesn't shake when you're pushing
it<00:06:57.669> down<00:06:57.880> it<00:06:58.120> stays<00:06:58.840> wherever<00:06:59.469> you<00:06:59.800> put<00:06:59.979> it<00:07:01.169> so

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:02.169 
it down it stays wherever you put it so

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:04.649 
it down it stays wherever you put it so
close<00:07:02.500> both<00:07:02.740> of<00:07:02.860> those<00:07:02.949> up<00:07:03.190> I<00:07:03.340> had<00:07:03.699> one

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:04.659 
close both of those up I had one

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:08.999 
close both of those up I had one
question<00:07:05.289> on<00:07:05.889> reddit<00:07:06.490> about<00:07:07.180> the<00:07:08.009> charging

question on reddit about the charging
cable<00:07:09.130> actually<00:07:09.849> so<00:07:10.810> taking<00:07:11.110> a<00:07:11.139> look<00:07:11.320> at<00:07:11.530> the

infinity one redditor asked whether or

infinity one redditor asked whether or
not<00:07:20.440> it<00:07:20.800> was<00:07:20.949> longer<00:07:21.780> so<00:07:22.780> I<00:07:22.840> can<00:07:22.990> show<00:07:23.139> you<00:07:23.199> here

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 
not it was longer so I can show you here

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.399 
not it was longer so I can show you here
I've<00:07:23.710> got<00:07:24.370> both<00:07:24.580> of<00:07:24.610> these<00:07:24.819> cables<00:07:25.300> and<00:07:25.539> as<00:07:26.199> I

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:26.409 
I've got both of these cables and as I

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:28.950 
I've got both of these cables and as I
go<00:07:26.620> here<00:07:27.069> this<00:07:27.969> is<00:07:28.180> where<00:07:28.360> we<00:07:28.479> reach<00:07:28.690> the<00:07:28.930> end

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 
go here this is where we reach the end

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.379 
go here this is where we reach the end
of<00:07:29.409> the<00:07:29.500> original<00:07:29.860> transformer<00:07:30.400> cable<00:07:30.729> some

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:31.389 
of the original transformer cable some

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:32.520 
of the original transformer cable some
people<00:07:31.630> complain<00:07:31.750> that<00:07:31.960> it<00:07:32.139> was<00:07:32.229> a<00:07:32.259> little<00:07:32.380> bit

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.530
