school and they're really struggling

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.020 
school and they're really struggling
it's<00:00:36.210> really<00:00:36.719> tough<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.219> thought<00:00:38.969> I

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
it's really tough and so I thought I

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.360 
it's really tough and so I thought I
would<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.360> do<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> quick<00:00:40.050> vlog<00:00:40.800> about<00:00:41.219> my

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
would just do a quick vlog about my

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.930 
would just do a quick vlog about my
thoughts<00:00:41.910> about<00:00:42.510> why<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.129> process<00:00:44.129> sucks<00:00:44.730> so

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
thoughts about why the process sucks so

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.590 
thoughts about why the process sucks so
bad<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:46.100> maybe<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.460> inspire<00:00:47.820> anybody

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
bad and maybe it can inspire anybody

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.020 
bad and maybe it can inspire anybody
that's<00:00:48.980> trudging<00:00:49.980> through<00:00:50.010> first<00:00:50.520> or<00:00:50.700> second

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
that's trudging through first or second

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.790 
that's trudging through first or second
year<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.390> kind<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.750> get<00:00:52.140> through<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.559> because

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
year to kind of get through it because

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.130 
year to kind of get through it because
third<00:00:53.340> year<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.640> great<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.960> totally

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
third year is great and it's totally

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.790 
third year is great and it's totally
worth<00:00:55.410> it

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
worth it

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.910 
worth it
so<00:00:56.789> okay<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.390> think<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.710> main

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
so okay I think that one of the main

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.189 
so okay I think that one of the main
reasons<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.520> first<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.270> second<00:01:00.570> year<00:01:00.750> suck

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
reasons that first and second year suck

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.880 
reasons that first and second year suck
so<00:01:01.530> bad<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.160> because<00:01:02.899> number<00:01:03.899> one<00:01:04.170> you're

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
so bad is because number one you're

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.460 
so bad is because number one you're
learning<00:01:05.460> more<00:01:06.360> material<00:01:06.960> than<00:01:06.990> you've<00:01:07.320> ever

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
learning more material than you've ever

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.289 
learning more material than you've ever
learned<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:08.130> your<00:01:08.490> whole<00:01:08.700> life

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
learned in your whole life

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.750 
learned in your whole life
people<00:01:09.869> say<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.100> week<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.580> med

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
people say that like one week in med

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
people say that like one week in med
school<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.750> equivalent<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.530> whole

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
school is the equivalent of a whole

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.300 
school is the equivalent of a whole
semester<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.250> undergrad<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.860> probably

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
semester in undergrad and that probably

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.240 
semester in undergrad and that probably
is<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.490> case<00:01:17.820> maybe<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.420> exam<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.229> med<00:01:19.890> school

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
is the case maybe one exam in med school

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.490 
is the case maybe one exam in med school
is<00:01:20.490> similar<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.180> what<00:01:21.330> your<00:01:21.450> final<00:01:21.840> exam<00:01:22.170> in

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
is similar to what your final exam in

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.640 
is similar to what your final exam in
undergrad<00:01:23.490> would<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.320> more

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
undergrad would be and so it's just more

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.800 
undergrad would be and so it's just more
material<00:01:26.100> than<00:01:26.130> you've<00:01:26.400> ever<00:01:26.490> had<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.600> manage

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
material than you've ever had to manage

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.210 
material than you've ever had to manage
before<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.680> don't<00:01:28.890> know<00:01:29.009> how<00:01:29.159> to

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
before and if you don't know how to

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.370 
before and if you don't know how to
shove<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.640> into<00:01:30.060> your<00:01:30.150> brain<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:31.259> be

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
shove all that into your brain it can be

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.260 
shove all that into your brain it can be
really<00:01:31.590> overwhelming<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:33.030> feel

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
really overwhelming and you can feel

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450 
really overwhelming and you can feel
really<00:01:33.509> lost<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.110> not<00:01:34.229> really<00:01:34.530> know<00:01:34.710> where<00:01:35.310> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
really lost and not really know where to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.700 
really lost and not really know where to
turn<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:37.049> you're<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.229> dealing<00:01:37.530> with

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
turn and so you're just dealing with

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.890 
turn and so you're just dealing with
this<00:01:37.950> constant<00:01:38.520> stress<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.240> constant

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
this constant stress and constant

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.550 
this constant stress and constant
anxiety<00:01:40.460> because<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.939> are<00:01:42.210> always<00:01:42.659> having<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
anxiety because you are always having to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.130 
anxiety because you are always having to
study<00:01:43.829> there<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.360> much<00:01:45.540> material

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
study there is just so much material

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.840 
study there is just so much material
that<00:01:46.170> you're<00:01:46.500> constantly<00:01:46.829> studying<00:01:47.579> so

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
that you're constantly studying so

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.819 
that you're constantly studying so
that's<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.240> that's<00:01:48.360> really<00:01:48.659> hard<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.500> second

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
that's one that's really hard the second

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.410 
that's one that's really hard the second
thing<00:01:49.950> that's<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.310> hard<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.180> first

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
thing that's really hard is that first

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.749 
thing that's really hard is that first
and<00:01:51.600> second<00:01:51.930> year<00:01:52.110> there's<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.740> much<00:01:52.950> learning

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
and second year there's so much learning

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.539 
and second year there's so much learning
that<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.130> don't<00:01:56.310> get

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
that you have to do that you don't get

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.240 
that you have to do that you don't get
to<00:01:56.729> spend<00:01:56.939> very<00:01:57.240> much<00:01:57.390> time<00:01:57.570> with<00:01:58.409> patients<00:01:59.130> at

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
to spend very much time with patients at

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.450
