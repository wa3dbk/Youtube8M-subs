00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.230
 we go to the bookshelf of designs and 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.620

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:05.040
 the camouflage book of me thrill that what 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:07.040

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.270
 it will cost us 16 blocks to issue 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.270
 to be able to form 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.670
 we will do it well 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.150
 Well, now we have to jump 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.910
 on the bellows to light the oven 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.240
 as usual 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.240
 we need three times 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.020
 and now the challenge will be responsible for forging 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.020
 our design 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.890
 we wait a little while 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.300
 and here we have our camouflage book 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.300
 subway 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.900

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.900

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.590
 very well we enter our treasure 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.870
 and we look for the book where we have it 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.380
 here is the demetrio camouflage book 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.720

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.460
 camouflage us right now we're like a 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.370
 Christmas tree 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.530
 well what I have not tried is if the 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.770
 camouflage changes according to the place where 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:34.150
 we are but I think that if it goes to 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:37.360
 change that why you try not for 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.520
