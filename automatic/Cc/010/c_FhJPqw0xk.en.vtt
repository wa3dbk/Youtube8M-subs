00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.980
 feeder and not 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.490
 manual feeder innovated designed and 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.890
 produced by my court with 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.110
 very special features that what 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.540
 they make completely different 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.270
 traditional manual feeders 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.760
 It is a feeder made with materials 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.060
 original premiums that give you more 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.710
 durability with a lower platter that 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.610
 allows birds to use it 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.250
 from the first week of age 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.410
 chicks come and go with a lot 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.660
 ease because in the inner part of the 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.329
 dish has some tracks where the 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.929
 chicks are supported to leave 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.989
 the feeder to bicorb and does not carry a 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.369
 grate that in addition to strengthen it 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.970
 prevents birds from wasting the 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.670
 food the feeder to viktor bill no 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.580
 has a capacity of 9 kilos of 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.229
 enough food to attend each 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.930
 day 60 to 70 layers on floor or 70 to 80 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.990
 lifting cocks and with an extension 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.490
 over the hopper that prevents these birds 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.100
 can enter the feeder 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.970
 that same capacity for food is 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.720
 enough to serve 50 to 55 chickens 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.560
 of order up to 6 weeks of age without 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.530
 need to extend over the hopper 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.049
 cheapening this type of eating 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.290
 the special extension increases the 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.420
 capacity up to 12 kilos of food and 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.270
 Its design prevents laying layers in 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.700
 floor or lifting cocks can 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.579
 get inside the feeder 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.399
 a number no greater than 50 is recommended 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.250
 support edge by feeder avoid 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.830
 to the maximum scratches on the skin of birds 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.610
 that disqualifies and punishes the price of 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.390
 bicorb chicken and also produces a 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.410
 grating that adapts to the trough innova 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.870
 turning it into a feeding trough for 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.599
 heavy reproductive that prevents 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.540
 males can steal food from 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.299
 females 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.090
 It is a spectacular feeder and 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:33.390
 its design is not casual but the result 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.239
 of the continuous ones that mean better 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.900
 results for farmers better 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.720
 conversion and more uniform lots this 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.810
 feeder is more balanced and the cast 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.510
 of food is uniform the grid 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.159
 carries under the radios that hold 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.959
 the outer ring 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.180
 some divisions like some pins 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.010
 projections do not allow 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.620
 chicks get blocked 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.819
 it is really a manual feeder 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.390
 more leased to bicorb and equipment for 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.390
 poultry farming
