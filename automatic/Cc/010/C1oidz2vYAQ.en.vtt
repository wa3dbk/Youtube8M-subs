00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.479 

one<00:03:00.390> issue<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.840> come<00:03:01.050> across<00:03:01.379> though<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:02.430> that

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
one issue of come across though is that

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.869 
one issue of come across though is that
you<00:03:02.790> have<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.239> have<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:04.530> can't<00:03:05.280> play<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.580> upon

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
you have to have I can't play this upon

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.940 
you have to have I can't play this upon
him<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.959> have<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.349> have<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.940> music<00:03:09.269> at<00:03:09.390> snap

him you have to have the music at snap

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.570 
him you have to have the music at snap
so<00:03:10.950> for<00:03:11.430> example<00:03:11.879> if<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.150> go<00:03:12.810> ahead<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.110> say

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
so for example if I go ahead and say

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.670 
so for example if I go ahead and say
Xbox<00:03:14.580> on<00:03:14.849> snap<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:18.090> will<00:03:18.420> unsnap<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.110> app<00:03:19.230> but

Xbox on snap it will unsnap the app but

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.070 
Xbox on snap it will unsnap the app but
it<00:03:19.950> also<00:03:20.099> pauses<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.849> game<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.390> stops<00:03:21.840> the

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
it also pauses the game and stops the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.960 
it also pauses the game and stops the
music<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:23.910> kind<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.180> stinks

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
more cumbersome like I don't want to

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.790 
more cumbersome like I don't want to
have<00:05:02.030> the<00:05:02.270> song<00:05:02.510> info'<00:05:02.900> snapped<00:05:03.290> on<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.620> side

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
of the screen while I'm playing I don't

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.740 
of the screen while I'm playing I don't
understand<00:05:06.800> how<00:05:06.979> that's<00:05:07.220> better<00:05:08.120> than<00:05:08.450> having

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
understand how that's better than having

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.530 
understand how that's better than having
it<00:05:08.960> in<00:05:09.080> the<00:05:09.200> guide<00:05:09.380> at<00:05:09.740> any<00:05:09.889> time<00:05:10.190> I<00:05:10.550> really

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
it in the guide at any time I really

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.659 
it in the guide at any time I really
liked<00:05:11.720> how<00:05:11.840> the<00:05:11.900> 360<00:05:12.500> did<00:05:12.680> that<00:05:12.830> I<00:05:13.100> could

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
liked how the 360 did that I could

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.240 
liked how the 360 did that I could
stream<00:05:14.150> everything<00:05:14.419> from<00:05:15.320> my<00:05:15.440> Mac<00:05:15.680> using<00:05:16.130> this

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
stream everything from my Mac using this

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.520 
stream everything from my Mac using this
program<00:05:16.669> called<00:05:16.910> connects<00:05:17.210> Connect<00:05:17.870> 360<00:05:18.440> and

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
program called connects Connect 360 and

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.170 
program called connects Connect 360 and
it<00:05:18.590> just<00:05:18.770> had<00:05:18.890> my<00:05:19.039> whole<00:05:19.190> I<00:05:19.220> tunes<00:05:19.580> library

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
it just had my whole I tunes library

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.490 
it just had my whole I tunes library
this<00:05:20.900> is<00:05:20.960> a<00:05:21.110> little<00:05:21.410> bit<00:05:21.530> more<00:05:21.740> convoluted<00:05:23.500> it

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
this is a little bit more convoluted it

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.650 
this is a little bit more convoluted it
works<00:05:24.830> but<00:05:25.580> it's<00:05:26.450> not<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:26.870> ideal<00:05:27.169> situation

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
works but it's not the ideal situation

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.510 
works but it's not the ideal situation
guess<00:05:29.660> it's<00:05:29.840> better<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.200> ps4<00:05:30.500> doesn't<00:05:30.919> let

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
guess it's better the ps4 doesn't let

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.130 
guess it's better the ps4 doesn't let
you<00:05:31.640> stream<00:05:31.970> to<00:05:32.210> it<00:05:32.330> at<00:05:32.419> all<00:05:32.539> as<00:05:32.780> of<00:05:32.960> right<00:05:33.080> now

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
you stream to it at all as of right now

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.070 
you stream to it at all as of right now
so<00:05:33.620> I<00:05:33.979> guess<00:05:34.580> this<00:05:34.789> is<00:05:34.940> a<00:05:34.970> step<00:05:35.570> ahead<00:05:35.690> of<00:05:35.840> that

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
so I guess this is a step ahead of that

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.879 
so I guess this is a step ahead of that
but<00:05:36.520> not<00:05:37.520> by<00:05:37.729> a<00:05:37.760> whole<00:05:37.940> lot<00:05:38.200> this<00:05:39.200> is<00:05:39.380> a<00:05:39.410> pretty

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.679 

pretty<00:05:42.520> clunky<00:05:43.710> implementation<00:05:44.710> of<00:05:44.860> this

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:45.689 
pretty clunky implementation of this

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:49.379 
pretty clunky implementation of this
actually<00:05:46.689> asked<00:05:47.110> xbox<00:05:47.560> support<00:05:48.060> if<00:05:49.060> there<00:05:49.300> is

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
actually asked xbox support if there is

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.209 
actually asked xbox support if there is
a<00:05:49.419> way<00:05:49.599> to<00:05:49.659> have<00:05:50.020> this<00:05:50.229> work<00:05:50.499> without<00:05:50.650> snapping

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:51.219 
a way to have this work without snapping

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:52.559 
a way to have this work without snapping
and<00:05:51.580> they<00:05:51.639> didn't<00:05:51.939> even<00:05:52.060> know<00:05:52.270> what<00:05:52.389> I<00:05:52.419> was

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:52.569 
and they didn't even know what I was

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:54.689 
and they didn't even know what I was
talking<00:05:52.810> about<00:05:53.080> with<00:05:53.439> it<00:05:53.590> being<00:05:53.800> a<00:05:53.830> deal<00:05:54.039> and<00:05:54.279> a

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
talking about with it being a deal and a

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.110 
talking about with it being a deal and a
server<00:05:55.180> so<00:05:55.529> it's<00:05:56.529> kind<00:05:56.710> of<00:05:56.770> a<00:05:56.830> bummer<00:05:57.039> but<00:05:57.159> all

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
server so it's kind of a bummer but all

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.969 
server so it's kind of a bummer but all
right<00:05:58.210> this<00:05:58.449> song<00:05:58.629> is<00:05:58.960> almost<00:05:59.289> over<00:05:59.650> and<00:05:59.889> I'll

will actually start playing the next
track<00:06:20.770> but<00:06:21.250> it<00:06:21.370> pauses<00:06:21.610> the<00:06:21.939> game<00:06:22.259> so<00:06:23.259> then<00:06:23.500> I

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:23.529 
track but it pauses the game so then I

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:26.790 
track but it pauses the game so then I
can't<00:06:23.979> even<00:06:24.250> just<00:06:24.490> resume<00:06:25.000> I<00:06:25.300> have<00:06:25.719> to<00:06:25.930> snap

xbox switch very not twitch ah anyway
you<00:07:04.449> get<00:07:04.569> the<00:07:04.629> idea<00:07:04.719> you<00:07:05.199> have<00:07:05.379> to<00:07:05.500> switch<00:07:05.770> the

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:06.099 
you get the idea you have to switch the

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:08.040 
you get the idea you have to switch the
focus<00:07:06.310> back<00:07:06.849> to<00:07:06.879> the<00:07:07.240> game<00:07:07.449> and<00:07:07.689> then<00:07:07.810> you<00:07:07.839> can

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 
focus back to the game and then you can

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.629 
focus back to the game and then you can
unpause<00:07:08.379> it<00:07:08.560> and<00:07:08.589> keep<00:07:08.830> playing<00:07:09.099> it<00:07:09.310> and<00:07:09.460> it

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:09.639 
unpause it and keep playing it and it

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.719 
unpause it and keep playing it and it
works<00:07:09.879> but<00:07:10.180> it's<00:07:10.830> it's<00:07:11.830> not<00:07:12.009> the<00:07:12.129> greatest<00:07:12.339> so

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:12.729 
works but it's it's not the greatest so

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:16.320 
works but it's it's not the greatest so
that<00:07:13.509> is<00:07:13.870> how<00:07:14.169> you<00:07:14.229> play<00:07:15.159> your<00:07:15.189> own<00:07:15.399> music<00:07:15.520> from

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330 
that is how you play your own music from

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.939 
that is how you play your own music from
your<00:07:17.009> PC<00:07:18.009> library<00:07:18.520> or<00:07:18.669> from<00:07:18.879> your<00:07:19.060> smartphone

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:28.539 
doesn't work the greatest it's a little

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:31.079 
doesn't work the greatest it's a little
clunky<00:07:28.750> and<00:07:29.139> I<00:07:29.379> don't<00:07:29.889> know<00:07:30.099> if<00:07:30.729> anyone<00:07:31.000> has
