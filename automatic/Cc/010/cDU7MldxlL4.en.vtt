00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
originally thought I have in here 85 and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.160 
originally thought I have in here 85 and
when<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.059> say<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.300> here<00:00:36.480> my<00:00:36.660> little<00:00:36.750> lipstick

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
when I say in here my little lipstick

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.850 
when I say in here my little lipstick
tray<00:00:38.100> um<00:00:38.870> but<00:00:39.870> those<00:00:40.020> are<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.440> ones<00:00:40.590> that

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
tray um but those are just the ones that

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.520 
tray um but those are just the ones that
I<00:00:40.890> actually<00:00:41.629> use<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.079> most

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
I actually use the most

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.010 
I actually use the most
I<00:00:43.590> do<00:00:44.250> dominate<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.969> lot<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.300> my<00:00:45.420> lip<00:00:45.600> products

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
I do dominate a lot of my lip products

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.700 
I do dominate a lot of my lip products
to<00:00:46.710> either<00:00:47.460> family<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.450> friends<00:00:49.350> if<00:00:49.500> they

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
to either family or friends if they

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.619 
to either family or friends if they
don't<00:00:49.920> mind<00:00:50.100> um<00:00:50.520> because<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.390> get<00:00:51.510> bored

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
don't mind um because I just get bored

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.970 
don't mind um because I just get bored
easily<00:00:51.930> no<00:00:52.170> don't<00:00:52.350> go<00:00:52.710> off

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
easily no don't go off

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.299 
easily no don't go off
so<00:00:53.309> yeah<00:00:53.910> that's<00:00:54.329> by<00:00:54.629> no<00:00:54.660> means<00:00:55.199> an<00:00:56.129> actual

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
so yeah that's by no means an actual

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.029 
so yeah that's by no means an actual
fair<00:00:56.989> accurate<00:00:57.989> representation<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.710> how<00:00:58.770> many

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
fair accurate representation of how many

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.310 
fair accurate representation of how many
lipsticks<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.820> probably<00:01:00.059> would<00:01:00.480> own<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:01.020> I

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
lipsticks I probably would own if I

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.060 
lipsticks I probably would own if I
didn't<00:01:01.559> give<00:01:01.649> them<00:01:01.800> away

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
didn't give them away

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.530 
didn't give them away
so<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:03.000> think<00:01:03.420> everything<00:01:03.960> 85<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:05.240> is<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.299> bit

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
so I think everything 85 is is a bit

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.730 
so I think everything 85 is is a bit
ridiculous<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.229> that's<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:07.409> even<00:01:07.560> counting

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
ridiculous and that's not even counting

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.980 
ridiculous and that's not even counting
lip<00:01:08.100> glosses<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:09.000> ridiculous<00:01:09.659> anyway

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
lip glosses it's just ridiculous anyway

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.840 
lip glosses it's just ridiculous anyway
so<00:01:10.350> yeah<00:01:10.500> what<00:01:11.250> was<00:01:11.369> your<00:01:11.460> first<00:01:11.640> ever

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
so yeah what was your first ever

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.289 
so yeah what was your first ever
lipstick<00:01:12.330> um<00:01:13.070> I<00:01:14.070> believe<00:01:14.220> my<00:01:14.640> first<00:01:14.880> off<00:01:15.060> I

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
lipstick um I believe my first off I

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.999 
lipstick um I believe my first off I
don't<00:01:15.540> remember<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.900> show<00:01:16.080> but<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.680> believe

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
don't remember the show but I do believe

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.740 
don't remember the show but I do believe
probably<00:01:17.640> one<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> first<00:01:18.119> lipsticks<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
probably one of the first lipsticks I
