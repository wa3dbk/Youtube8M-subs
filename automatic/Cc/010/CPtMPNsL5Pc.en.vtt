00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
shocked and his mentality i don't know i

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.420 
shocked and his mentality i don't know i
think<00:02:48.900> he<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.319> think<00:02:49.620> he<00:02:49.650> could<00:02:49.889> have<00:02:50.010> stood<00:02:50.250> up

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
think he I think he could have stood up

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.800 
think he I think he could have stood up
man<00:02:50.670> I'm<00:02:50.849> pretty<00:02:51.090> sure<00:02:51.209> he<00:02:51.299> could<00:02:51.450> have<00:02:51.599> stood

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
man I'm pretty sure he could have stood

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.780 
man I'm pretty sure he could have stood
up<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.230> think<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.040> could<00:02:53.129> have<00:02:53.280> stood<00:02:53.459> up<00:02:53.609> i

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
up I think you could have stood up i

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.909 
up I think you could have stood up i
think<00:02:53.819> that<00:02:54.599> punch<00:02:54.930> wasn't<00:02:55.620> really<00:02:55.799> that

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
think that punch wasn't really that

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.890 
think that punch wasn't really that
devastating<00:02:56.609> at<00:02:56.730> least<00:02:56.879> compared<00:02:57.419> to<00:02:57.659> when

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
devastating at least compared to when

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.020 
devastating at least compared to when
Berto<00:02:58.379> punch<00:02:58.650> him<00:02:58.829> in<00:02:58.950> my<00:02:59.069> opinion<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.579> thought

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
Berto punch him in my opinion I thought

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.360 
Berto punch him in my opinion I thought
the<00:03:00.150> Berto<00:03:00.389> punch<00:03:00.840> was<00:03:01.079> more<00:03:01.319> devastating<00:03:01.500> and

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
the Berto punch was more devastating and

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.000 
the Berto punch was more devastating and
I<00:03:03.180> don't<00:03:03.419> know<00:03:03.510> man<00:03:03.689> Victor<00:03:04.409> Ortiz<00:03:04.530> his

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
mentality just wasn't there he wasn't a

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.979 
mentality just wasn't there he wasn't a
hundred<00:03:08.370> percent<00:03:08.579> when<00:03:09.299> it<00:03:09.450> comes<00:03:09.629> to<00:03:09.810> his

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
hundred percent when it comes to his

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.619 
hundred percent when it comes to his
