00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
in two parts they're really easy to

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.540 
in two parts they're really easy to
sublimate<00:01:06.700> let's<00:01:07.240> get<00:01:07.420> started<00:01:07.810> so<00:01:08.340> our<00:01:09.340> first

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
sublimate let's get started so our first

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.719 
sublimate let's get started so our first
step<00:01:09.820> is<00:01:10.060> going<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.360> be<00:01:10.600> to<00:01:11.259> lint<00:01:11.740> roll<00:01:11.950> all<00:01:12.310> of

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
step is going to be to lint roll all of

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.950 
step is going to be to lint roll all of
our<00:01:12.850> products<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:16.270> reason<00:01:16.600> we<00:01:16.690> do<00:01:16.840> this

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
our products and the reason we do this

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.050 
our products and the reason we do this
is<00:01:17.020> because<00:01:17.380> we<00:01:17.619> don't<00:01:17.740> want<00:01:18.040> to<00:01:18.130> get<00:01:18.880> any

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
is because we don't want to get any

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.600 
is because we don't want to get any
contaminants<00:01:20.050> on<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:20.979> pieces<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:21.460> we're

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
contaminants on the pieces that we're

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.330 
contaminants on the pieces that we're
sublimating<00:01:22.830> because<00:01:23.830> we<00:01:23.920> don't<00:01:24.070> want<00:01:24.190> it<00:01:24.250> to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
sublimating because we don't want it to

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.190 
sublimating because we don't want it to
ruin<00:01:24.550> our<00:01:24.910> design<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:27.090> once<00:01:28.090> we<00:01:28.509> get<00:01:28.690> all<00:01:28.960> of

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
ruin our design and once we get all of

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.340 
ruin our design and once we get all of
them<00:01:29.380> really<00:01:29.560> good<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:31.299> can<00:01:31.780> head<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.229> the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
them really good we can head to the

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.789 
them really good we can head to the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
and we've already adjusted the pressure

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.480 
and we've already adjusted the pressure
on<00:02:01.240> our<00:02:01.390> press<00:02:01.720> so<00:02:02.500> that<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.979> height<00:02:03.220> of<00:02:03.250> the

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
shoe fits and the reason we pre press is

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.840 
shoe fits and the reason we pre press is
just<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.750> create<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:08.049> nice<00:02:08.320> flat<00:02:09.070> surface<00:02:09.369> to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
just to create a nice flat surface to

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.690 
just to create a nice flat surface to
work<00:02:09.970> with<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.540> it<00:02:11.140> also<00:02:11.320> eliminates<00:02:12.130> any

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
work with and it also eliminates any

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.810 
work with and it also eliminates any
moisture<00:02:13.299> that's<00:02:13.510> in<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.690> product<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.670> now

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
moisture that's in the product so now

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.280 
moisture that's in the product so now
that<00:02:18.880> these<00:02:19.269> have<00:02:19.450> had<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.570> second<00:02:19.989> to<00:02:20.080> cool

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
that these have had a second to cool

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.229 
that these have had a second to cool
we're<00:02:20.860> gonna<00:02:20.950> go<00:02:21.160> ahead<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.370> do<00:02:21.519> a<00:02:21.549> quick<00:02:21.820> lint

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
we're gonna go ahead and do a quick lint

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.800 
we're gonna go ahead and do a quick lint
roll<00:02:22.709> once<00:02:23.709> again<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.579> then<00:02:25.510> we're<00:02:25.660> going<00:02:25.750> to

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
roll once again and then we're going to

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.420 
roll once again and then we're going to
go<00:02:25.930> ahead<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:26.200> sublimate<00:02:26.650> these<00:02:26.860> first

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
go ahead and sublimate these first

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.460 
go ahead and sublimate these first
because<00:02:27.910> our<00:02:28.150> press<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.600> already<00:02:28.810> set<00:02:29.049> to<00:02:29.079> the

because our press is already set to the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.780 
because our press is already set to the
pressure<00:02:30.459> for<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.420> bottoms<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:32.500> now<00:02:32.800> we're

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
pressure for the bottoms so now we're

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.610
