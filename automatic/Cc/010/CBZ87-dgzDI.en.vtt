very<00:02:40.640> easy<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:41.120> put<00:02:41.330> on<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.720> is<00:02:42.530> time<00:02:43.430> consuming

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
very easy to put on it is time consuming

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.380 
very easy to put on it is time consuming
it<00:02:45.500> took<00:02:45.709> me<00:02:45.860> about<00:02:46.010> half<00:02:46.070> hour<00:02:46.430> just<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.239> do
