the<00:00:12.840> cool<00:00:13.080> thing<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.500> told<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.769> this

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
the cool thing and I told you this

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.650 
the cool thing and I told you this
before<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.059> all<00:00:15.330> through

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
before is this is all through

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.240 
before is this is all through
interneurons<00:00:16.970> okay<00:00:18.740> interneurons<00:00:19.740> occur<00:00:20.160> in

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
interneurons okay interneurons occur in

interneurons okay interneurons occur in
all<00:00:20.460> areas<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.570> gray<00:00:21.810> matter<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
court white matter is white right

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.009 
court white matter is white right
because<00:00:23.580> it's<00:00:23.730> myelinated<00:00:24.210> what<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.840> white

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
because it's myelinated what is white

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.170 
because it's myelinated what is white
matter<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.380> axons<00:00:25.939> that's<00:00:26.939> what<00:00:27.090> you're
