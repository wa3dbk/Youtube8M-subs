because I think there is a lot of

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.140 
because I think there is a lot of
diversity<00:02:33.459> teachers<00:02:34.459> do<00:02:34.580> not<00:02:34.610> only<00:02:34.940> to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
diversity teachers do not only to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.399

tolerate people who are different from
you<00:02:36.680> but<00:02:37.220> also<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.879> celebrate<00:02:38.500> people<00:02:39.500> who<00:02:39.590> are

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
you but also to celebrate people who are

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.220

different than you that I think growing

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.920
