00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.830
 Hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.110
 crazy train and show you today 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.309
 mechanism called explosive stove to 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.170
 Sorry how it works for you 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.830
 I can not show and why you find out 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.720
 later but in a nutshell i will explain to you what 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.760
 digest things in the stove 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.010
 the piece you see these things the most stove for 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.350
 breaks and leave a big hole 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.690
 naturally let's in some kind not 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.510
 being built we will need red dust and 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.180
 red torch stove dynamite main 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.280
 block and and ice naturally first need 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.240
 select one block and put there 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.000
 raptors like this block by any civil 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.010
 block and immediately put ice here from 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.170
 of this unit to post a ration here 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.590
 another block to put a red torch 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.560
 hold growth and put tnt this 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.840
 it was where we put the stove and surrounded 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.560
 block yes so that when ice 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.899
 melted 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.780
 once the belt he got exactly this one 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.700
 here in donating through the tone otherwise our mechanism 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.890
 no water will flow it to anyone 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.799
 not so well from here 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.200
 close and now our mechanism is ready 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.200
 and we can test it we charge 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.109
 the stove so that we have to melt and 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.240
 this constant furnace melts clear 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:20.869
 ice starts to bark but because of bugs 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.579
 mine ice will not immediately swim to 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.270
 this 1 ton and just hang in this 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:29.119
 block and he and the water will be here only then 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.709
 when we remove things from the stove with a nose not 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.499
 will melt in about half a minute 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:35.810
 now i will pause the video and when 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:38.659
 it will melt I will continue shooting and here 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.329
 base with you as I said water 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.649
 melted more accurately the hatch spread out and this 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:47.209
 happened in 40 seconds and now 1 to 1 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.999
 feeling when when we have this in the stove 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:52.549
 remove all its playa that is, remove 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.340
 all the shelves as we, too, take at all 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.460
 all she has 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.039
 and as you can see the water flowed away 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.979
 shot down arrested this activated and 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.500
 teens in the north-east which we all 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.630
 so inaccurately blew hopefully data and 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.340
 It seems to us useful though it will be 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.280
 the guy is only seven built then show 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.410
 you can take ice only in 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.060
