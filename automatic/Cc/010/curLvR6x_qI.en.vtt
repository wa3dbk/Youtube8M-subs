stand<00:01:10.500> configurations<00:01:11.400> where<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.970> could<00:01:12.180> have

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
stand configurations where we could have

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.660 
stand configurations where we could have
maybe<00:01:13.020> even<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.439> double<00:01:13.710> decker<00:01:13.830> Stan<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.490> is

maybe even a double decker Stan which is

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.920 
maybe even a double decker Stan which is
something<00:01:14.850> we've<00:01:15.090> been<00:01:15.240> considering<00:01:15.540> doing

with our sponsors and downstairs there

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.520 
with our sponsors and downstairs there
will<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.880> whole<00:01:21.210> arrangement<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.930> stands<00:01:22.350> so

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
will be a whole arrangement of stands so

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.440 
will be a whole arrangement of stands so
that<00:01:22.740> people<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.189> browse<00:01:23.580> around<00:01:23.850> rather

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
that people can browse around rather

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.719 
that people can browse around rather
than<00:01:24.689> necessarily<00:01:24.900> having<00:01:25.470> them<00:01:25.770> all<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.580> they

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
than necessarily having them all as they

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.090 
than necessarily having them all as they
were<00:01:26.790> last<00:01:27.210> year<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.259> row<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.829> we<00:01:28.950> might

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
were last year in a row so we might

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.920 
were last year in a row so we might
could<00:01:29.400> look<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.970> more<00:01:30.090> interesting<00:01:30.420> design

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
could look for a more interesting design

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.649 
could look for a more interesting design
so<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:31.799> does<00:01:32.009> shoots<00:01:32.250> get<00:01:32.549> out<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.060> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
so what does shoots get out of it and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.600 
so what does shoots get out of it and
what<00:01:33.840> other<00:01:34.079> attractions<00:01:34.770> are<00:01:34.920> there<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.460> the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
successful which was a benchmark of 78

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.350

shoots<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.340> then<00:02:29.519> telling<00:02:29.910> us<00:02:30.030> what<00:02:30.239> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
shoots and then telling us what the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.150 
shoots and then telling us what the
average<00:02:30.450> price<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.200> bird<00:02:31.380> was<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.099> on
