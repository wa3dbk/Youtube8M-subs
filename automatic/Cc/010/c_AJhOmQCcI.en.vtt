I'd<00:02:14.070> give<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.310> about<00:02:14.400> nine<00:02:14.730> points<00:02:15.300> at<00:02:15.510> 45<00:02:16.140> feet

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
I'd give it about nine points at 45 feet

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.240 
I'd give it about nine points at 45 feet
as<00:02:17.970> we<00:02:18.180> continue<00:02:18.540> step<00:02:18.810> back<00:02:19.070> that's<00:02:20.070> where

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
as we continue step back that's where

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.620 
as we continue step back that's where
the<00:02:20.340> performance<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.910> one<00:02:21.060> really<00:02:21.360> begins

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
the performance of the one really begins

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.380 
the performance of the one really begins
to<00:02:21.720> shine<00:02:22.050> it's<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.130> great<00:02:23.459> performer<00:02:24.030> I'd<00:02:24.209> say

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
to shine it's a great performer I'd say

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.479 
to shine it's a great performer I'd say
about<00:02:24.800> 9<00:02:25.800> out<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.010> 10<00:02:26.340> at<00:02:27.000> 70<00:02:27.480> feet<00:02:28.400> but<00:02:29.400> it

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
about 9 out of 10 at 70 feet but it

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.780 
about 9 out of 10 at 70 feet but it
still<00:02:29.820> left<00:02:30.090> me<00:02:30.270> wanting<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.900> little<00:02:31.050> bit<00:02:31.200> extra

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
still left me wanting a little bit extra

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.330 
still left me wanting a little bit extra
and<00:02:32.790> that's<00:02:33.030> where<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.720> faster<00:02:34.230> cousin<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
and that's where the faster cousin the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
and that's where the faster cousin the
sage<00:02:35.580> method<00:02:36.410> was<00:02:37.410> absolutely<00:02:38.250> perfect<00:02:38.459> 70<00:02:39.090> 80

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
sage method was absolutely perfect 70 80

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.750 
sage method was absolutely perfect 70 80
100<00:02:39.840> feet<00:02:40.260> no<00:02:40.860> problem<00:02:41.250> with<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.400> rod

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
100 feet no problem with that rod

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.340 
100 feet no problem with that rod
whereas<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.450> felt<00:02:42.660> like<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.840> had<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:42.989> work<00:02:43.230> a

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
whereas I felt like I had to work a

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.530 
whereas I felt like I had to work a
little<00:02:43.500> bit<00:02:43.650> harder<00:02:43.769> on<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.310> stage<00:02:44.519> one<00:02:44.790> so<00:02:45.390> my

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
little bit harder on the stage one so my

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.120 
little bit harder on the stage one so my
overall<00:02:45.810> impression<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.320> this<00:02:46.380> rod<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.100> I

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
overall impression on this rod is that I

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.060 
overall impression on this rod is that I
felt<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.519> was<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.640> better<00:02:48.140> fishing<00:02:49.140> rod<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:49.769> the

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
felt it was a better fishing rod on the

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.390 
felt it was a better fishing rod on the
river<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.850> was<00:02:50.880> casting<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.630> lawn

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
river and it was casting on the lawn

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.740 
river and it was casting on the lawn
taking<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.489> out<00:02:53.640> on<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.850> can<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.239> go<00:02:54.480> I

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
taking it out on the can of a go I

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.470 
taking it out on the can of a go I
thought<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.709> fish<00:02:55.890> really<00:02:56.130> well<00:02:56.480> really

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
thought it fish really well really

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.390 
thought it fish really well really
nicely<00:02:57.660> at<00:02:57.930> all<00:02:58.050> distances<00:02:58.380> but<00:02:59.190> when<00:02:59.310> you

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
nicely at all distances but when you

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.310 
nicely at all distances but when you
take<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.700> into<00:02:59.820> a<00:02:59.910> laboratory<00:03:00.180> setting<00:03:00.750> just

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
take it into a laboratory setting just

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.569 
take it into a laboratory setting just
doesn't<00:03:01.620> perform<00:03:01.829> as<00:03:01.980> well<00:03:02.040> as<00:03:02.190> some<00:03:02.459> of<00:03:02.519> the

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
doesn't perform as well as some of the

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.000 
doesn't perform as well as some of the
top<00:03:02.640> rods<00:03:03.060> today<00:03:03.530> if<00:03:04.530> you're<00:03:04.739> looking<00:03:04.950> to

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
top rods today if you're looking to

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.979 
top rods today if you're looking to
upgrade<00:03:05.070> from<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.549> z-axis<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.690> one's<00:03:06.900> a

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
upgrade from the z-axis the one's a

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.410 
upgrade from the z-axis the one's a
natural<00:03:07.350> choice<00:03:07.590> it's<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.459> more<00:03:08.670> accurate<00:03:08.880> rod

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
natural choice it's a more accurate rod

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.330 
natural choice it's a more accurate rod
it's<00:03:10.230> still<00:03:10.620> in<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.280> same<00:03:11.670> speed<00:03:12.540> class<00:03:13.340> but

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
it's still in that same speed class but

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.560 
it's still in that same speed class but
on<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.700> other<00:03:14.790> hand<00:03:14.880> if<00:03:15.120> you're<00:03:15.239> looking<00:03:15.269> for

on the other hand if you're looking for

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.420 
on the other hand if you're looking for
the<00:03:15.660> ultimate<00:03:15.780> distance<00:03:16.440> Sage<00:03:16.980> makes<00:03:17.280> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
the ultimate distance Sage makes the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.670 
the ultimate distance Sage makes the
method<00:03:17.820> which<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.630> better<00:03:18.840> option<00:03:19.110> finally

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
method which is a better option finally

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.440 
method which is a better option finally
I<00:03:19.709> just<00:03:19.769> wanted<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.160> comment<00:03:20.370> on<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.730> overall

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
I just wanted to comment on the overall

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.150 
I just wanted to comment on the overall
build<00:03:21.750> quality<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.380> rod<00:03:22.530> which<00:03:22.799> is<00:03:22.829> really

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
build quality of the rod which is really

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.910 
build quality of the rod which is really
fantastic<00:03:23.370> especially<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.989> grip<00:03:25.350> which<00:03:25.799> I

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
fantastic especially the grip which I

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.780 
fantastic especially the grip which I
think<00:03:26.130> sage

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
think sage

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.550 
think sage
does<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.060> better<00:03:27.390> job<00:03:27.540> with<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.019> snub-nosed

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
does a better job with the snub-nosed

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.920 
does a better job with the snub-nosed
half<00:03:28.829> wells<00:03:29.130> grip<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.269> just<00:03:30.329> about<00:03:30.660> anything

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
half wells grip and just about anything

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.160 
half wells grip and just about anything
out<00:03:31.200> there

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
out there

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.630 
out there
so<00:03:32.770> let's<00:03:32.920> know<00:03:33.040> what<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.250> think<00:03:33.400> about<00:03:33.430> this

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
so let's know what you think about this

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.440 
so let's know what you think about this
review<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.270> we'll<00:03:34.960> see<00:03:35.080> on<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.260> water
