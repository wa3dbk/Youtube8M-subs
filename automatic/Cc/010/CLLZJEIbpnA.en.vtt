from<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.300> couple<00:03:18.330> people<00:03:18.600> that<00:03:18.900> they're<00:03:19.020> going

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
from a couple people that they're going

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.080 
from a couple people that they're going
to<00:03:19.200> add<00:03:19.350> more<00:03:19.650> consequences<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.820> game

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
to add more consequences to the game

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.330 
to add more consequences to the game
other<00:03:21.750> than<00:03:21.930> just<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.680> way<00:03:22.860> point<00:03:23.190> is

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
other than just the way point is

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.060 
other than just the way point is
contested<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.330> of<00:03:24.959> course<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.440> obvious<00:03:25.650> they

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
contested and of course the obvious they

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.880 
contested and of course the obvious they
kill<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.459> NPC's<00:03:26.940> in<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.360> town<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.380> won't

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
kill the NPC's in the town so you won't

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.550 
kill the NPC's in the town so you won't
be<00:03:29.100> able<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.489> buy<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:30.150> merchant<00:03:30.900> or<00:03:31.020> repair<00:03:31.380> your

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
be able to buy a merchant or repair your

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.110 
be able to buy a merchant or repair your
armor<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.040> stuff<00:03:32.280> like<00:03:32.550> that<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:32.850> would<00:03:32.970> have

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
armor and stuff like that you would have

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.520 
armor and stuff like that you would have
to<00:03:33.239> like<00:03:33.330> kind<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.630> walk<00:03:33.870> all<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.350> way<00:03:34.380> to

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
to like kind of walk all the way to

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.550 
to like kind of walk all the way to
another<00:03:35.040> town<00:03:35.340> or<00:03:35.640> spend<00:03:36.450> money<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.810> take<00:03:37.320> away

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
another town or spend money to take away

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.180 
another town or spend money to take away
point<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:37.980> another<00:03:38.100> town<00:03:38.520> so<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.930> think<00:03:40.800> that's

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
point to another town so I think that's

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.280 
point to another town so I think that's
pretty<00:03:41.430> cool<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:42.030> they're<00:03:42.330> adding<00:03:42.840> this<00:03:42.989> in

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
pretty cool that they're adding this in

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.199 
pretty cool that they're adding this in
so<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.680> it's<00:03:44.280> like<00:03:44.400> an<00:03:44.550> incentive<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.180> actually

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
so it it's like an incentive to actually

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.100 
so it it's like an incentive to actually
go<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.959> do<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.320> events<00:03:46.800> even<00:03:47.520> though<00:03:47.910> I<00:03:48.239> kind

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
go and do the events even though I kind

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.860 
go and do the events even though I kind
of<00:03:49.200> want<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.470> do<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.709> events<00:03:50.070> anyway<00:03:50.520> and<00:03:50.870> did

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
of want to do the events anyway and did

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.440 
of want to do the events anyway and did
this<00:03:52.080> up<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.680> particular<00:03:53.430> dynamic<00:03:54.060> event<00:03:54.300> I

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
this up this particular dynamic event I

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.140 
this up this particular dynamic event I
actually<00:03:54.570> did<00:03:54.959> it<00:03:54.989> over<00:03:55.680> on<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.700> last<00:03:56.940> day

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
actually did it over on the last day

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.540

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
you can't really do these dynamic events

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.530 
you can't really do these dynamic events
by<00:04:38.710> yourself<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.490> can't<00:04:39.760> most<00:04:40.150> of<00:04:40.300> them<00:04:40.419> are

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
by yourself you can't most of them are

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
now back to the dynamic event if you

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.370 
now back to the dynamic event if you
stop<00:05:33.850> the<00:05:34.090> center's<00:05:34.510> from<00:05:34.810> building<00:05:35.350> the

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
stop the center's from building the

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.270 
stop the center's from building the
bridge<00:05:36.720> you<00:05:37.720> push<00:05:37.990> them<00:05:38.200> back<00:05:38.410> all<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:39.070> way<00:05:39.250> to

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
bridge you push them back all the way to

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.020 
bridge you push them back all the way to
their<00:05:40.090> home<00:05:40.479> camp<00:05:40.930> or<00:05:41.289> it<00:05:41.440> is<00:05:41.560> just<00:05:41.590> huge<00:05:42.340> camp

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
their home camp or it is just huge camp

in Cannon and so it would just

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.760 
in Cannon and so it would just
automatically<00:05:46.270> spawn<00:05:46.660> i'll<00:05:46.810> say<00:05:47.050> a<00:05:47.080> vet

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770
