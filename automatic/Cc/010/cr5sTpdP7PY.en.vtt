the intensity of the track becomes even
stronger<00:00:42.489> and<00:00:42.699> stronger<00:00:42.940> because<00:00:43.179> the<00:00:43.359> faster

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:43.749 
stronger and stronger because the faster

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:46.349 
stronger and stronger because the faster
you<00:00:43.839> go<00:00:44.019> the<00:00:44.350> more<00:00:45.309> you<00:00:45.429> need<00:00:45.609> every<00:00:45.940> line<00:00:46.149> on

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.130 
you go the more you need every line on
the<00:00:46.449> track<00:00:46.600> and<00:00:46.929> every<00:00:47.829> hole<00:00:48.699> and<00:00:48.749> post<00:00:49.749> and

very<00:00:53.829> very<00:00:54.839> intense

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.160 

I<00:01:02.760> already<00:01:03.760> knew<00:01:03.940> it<00:01:04.210> was<00:01:04.390> why<00:01:04.720> it<00:01:04.780> was<00:01:04.989> so

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
I already knew it was why it was so

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.950 
I already knew it was why it was so
special<00:01:05.410> but<00:01:05.740> now<00:01:05.980> I<00:01:06.010> have<00:01:06.220> my<00:01:06.550> own<00:01:06.960> feelings

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
you know that how it works and how it is

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.990 
you know that how it works and how it is
you<00:01:11.500> know<00:01:11.620> after<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:11.980> first<00:01:12.130> day<00:01:12.430> I<00:01:12.490> think

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
you know after the first day I think

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.380 
you know after the first day I think

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
maybe I'll finish the week and then

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.200 
maybe I'll finish the week and then
never<00:01:17.380> come<00:01:17.530> back<00:01:17.740> you<00:01:17.950> know<00:01:18.070> it's<00:01:18.220> it's<00:01:18.880> very

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
never come back you know it's it's very

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.380 
never come back you know it's it's very
a<00:01:19.600> very<00:01:20.050> confronting<00:01:21.000> situation<00:01:22.000> where<00:01:22.240> it's

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
a very confronting situation where it's

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.560 
a very confronting situation where it's
difficult<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:23.640> at<00:01:24.640> first<00:01:24.940> all<00:01:25.240> you're<00:01:25.390> looking

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
difficult to at first all you're looking

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.719 
difficult to at first all you're looking
at<00:01:25.780> is<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:25.990> worst<00:01:26.290> possible<00:01:26.650> scenario<00:01:26.890> every

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
at is the worst possible scenario every

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.370 
at is the worst possible scenario every
time<00:01:27.940> you<00:01:28.240> go<00:01:28.390> in<00:01:28.479> every<00:01:28.720> corner<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:29.110> think<00:01:29.290> of

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
time you go in every corner you think of

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.320 
time you go in every corner you think of
the<00:01:29.470> worst<00:01:29.680> thing<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:29.920> can<00:01:30.070> happen<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.550> it's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
the worst thing that can happen and it's

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.050 
the worst thing that can happen and it's
quite<00:01:32.100> difficult<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.400> understand<00:01:34.000> how

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
quite difficult to understand how

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.790 
quite difficult to understand how
everyone<00:01:34.390> can<00:01:34.570> just<00:01:34.690> ignore<00:01:34.930> it<00:01:35.140> and<00:01:35.290> go<00:01:35.380> fast

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
everyone can just ignore it and go fast

00:01:35.800 --> 00:02:02.930 
everyone can just ignore it and go fast
go<00:01:36.070> fast
