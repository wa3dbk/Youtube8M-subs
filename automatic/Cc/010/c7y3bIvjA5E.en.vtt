00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.000 
hidden and you don't want that really
small<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.480> braid<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.900> really<00:02:15.140> small<00:02:15.380> which

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
small so the braid is really small which

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.830 
small so the braid is really small which
you<00:02:16.099> don't<00:02:16.310> want<00:02:16.489> it<00:02:16.580> really<00:02:17.209> big<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:17.690> it's

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
you don't want it really big so it's

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.680 
you don't want it really big so it's
really<00:02:17.989> noticeable<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.880> then<00:02:20.030> after<00:02:20.209> you<00:02:20.540> have

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
really noticeable so then after you have

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.990 
really noticeable so then after you have
that<00:02:23.800> what<00:02:24.800> I'm<00:02:24.920> going<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.220> do<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.580> just<00:02:25.760> take<00:02:25.940> a

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
that what I'm going to do is just take a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.860

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
is just take this on section right here

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.010 
is just take this on section right here
in<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.050> front<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:23.600> you're<00:03:24.600> going<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.810> bring

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
in the front and you're going to bring

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.370 
in the front and you're going to bring
that<00:03:25.080> brace<00:03:25.560> right<00:03:26.430> under<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:26.970> section<00:03:27.480> just

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
that brace right under that section just

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.730 
that brace right under that section just
hide<00:03:28.740> it<00:03:28.950> even<00:03:29.130> more<00:03:29.520> and<00:03:30.170> then<00:03:31.170> just<00:03:31.440> let<00:03:31.590> it

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
hide it even more and then just let it

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.440 
hide it even more and then just let it
go<00:03:33.230> there<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.320> go<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.980> just<00:03:35.820> so<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.000> can't

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
go there you go and just so you can't

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.030 
go there you go and just so you can't
even<00:03:36.660> see<00:03:36.930> where<00:03:36.960> that<00:03:37.230> brightness<00:03:37.590> started

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
even see where that brightness started

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.760 
even see where that brightness started
so<00:03:38.550> that<00:03:38.700> just<00:03:38.910> hides<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.270> even<00:03:39.540> more<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.620> then

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
so that just hides it even more so then

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.050 
so that just hides it even more so then
