00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.910
 hello my name is sonia and today I like 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.410
 I'm going to teach you how to do these 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.680
 beautiful flowers made with fabric 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.420
 they are very easy to do so stay 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.730
 let's see what we need and the 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.730
 procedure to perform them 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.370
 we need fabric a piece of felt or 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.440
 from a thicker cloth a candle one 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.780
 scissors the silicone gun and 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.710
 optionally something small to put on 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.710
 the center of the flower 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.579
 before I started I wanted to show you a 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.719
 little the fabric that I'm going to use this is 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.329
 a thin cloth a little transparent 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.949
 vaporous light that I think that a 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.840
 This type of flower gives an air like 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.790
 romantic can also use a 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.190
 a little thicker fabric there is no 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.290
 problem will be equally good what 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.659
 next thing we're going to do is look 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.150
 us some circular templates in this 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.490
 case I found these two caps 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.330
 jars and I'm ideal a bit 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.840
 bigger and one smaller the bigger 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:27.800
 measure here 8 centimeters and the 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.289
 small 6.5 I have not chosen them for those 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.360
 specific measures but they have 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.310
 worked very well then what 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.000
 next thing we're going to do is take the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.500
 big circle let's cut a strip 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.500
 of our fabric 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.899
 about like this on the sides of this 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.789
 circumference and to cut several 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.960
 circles at the same time because we're going to 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:56.209
 need nine of this measure what 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:01.189
 we are going to do is go folding the fabric 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:04.030
 with the measure of this circle and we're going 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.030
 doing so 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.170
 once we have it all folded 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.040
 we can have something like this we're going to 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.439
 put 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.610
 the circumference and we're going to dial with 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.610
 a pen around 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.640
 and now the next thing is to cut and how 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.299
 a fine cloth we can cut them all to 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.299
 same time 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.310
 and already if we have cut the nine 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.160
 circles now what we're going to do is 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.430
 put together the piece of felt or fabric 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.180
 thick with another piece of the 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.150
 cloth 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.260
 and we are going to mark with the circumference 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.469
 smaller and we are going to cut equally 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.469
 the two 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.400
 now we take the candle we're going to 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.350
 turn on and what we're going to do is go 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.510
 burning the edges so you do not 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.890
 undo and also have an effect 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.890
 pretty around 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.730
 you do not have to have it too long 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.269
 it's burning very fast and we're going like this 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.269
 spinning 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.450
 and we are left as well as raised is a 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.360
 very interesting effect let's repeat 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.940
 this with the petals that we have left 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.150
 and once all the edges are 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.510
 burned out of all the circles we're going to 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.150
 fold all the large petals the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.519
 we will leave it small 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.400
 so the folds are going to be from the 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.030
 next way let's double by the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.030
 half first 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:07.640
 then we are going to double a third part 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.640
 let's put a little bit of silicone 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.630
 and we are going to put on that other third 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.970
 part 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.310
 and we are left in this way 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.110
 the next thing is to take the felt or the 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.510
 thick fabric which is what we are going to put 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.750
 in the back of the flower 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.390
 and we 're going to fold it in half 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.110
 let's cut 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.110
 A) Yes 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.440
 and we will have these marks now 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.890
 let's double it again let's do 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:47.170
 match those marks and let's do what 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.170
 same here at the extremes 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.740
 I have done this in order to divide 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.870
 this circle in four parts so that 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.120
 we can put the petals in a more 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.310
 Easy now let's go arranging 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.639
 in the following way let's go 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.689
 putting two petals 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:12.629
 inside these marks we are going to do it 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:12.629
 so let's put hot silicone 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.029
 we put 1 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:23.719
 that coincides towards the center and we put 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.719
 the other side 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.600
 and so we're going to put 2 2 and 2 up 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.600
 to complete 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.909
 already once like that with the eight petals 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.449
 let's put this circle on the 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:45.449
 small 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.830
 and we stick it 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:54.270
 and now we are going to put the latter 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.270
 let's put him 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.889
 a little silicon here 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.400
 we put it in the center we will wait 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:09.129
 to dry and now that it is dry we are going to 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.129
 put a little here around 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:19.150
 and we are going to bring this here 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.150
 to create a small flower in the center 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.460
 here I can put a little more to 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.460
 open it 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.160
 we can also put something small in 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.760
 the center to do it a little more 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.760
 showy 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:50.260
 and it is ready to flower well 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:52.540
 pretty so from behind that you can already 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.310
 put a brooch or a hook for the 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.620
 hair or you can put on a headband 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.510
 or to decorate a bag or whatever they want 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.660
 You have already seen that it is a flower 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.570
 extremely easy to do brings us almost 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.160
 time or almost materials so I hope 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.680
 that you liked this tutorial and that 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.510
