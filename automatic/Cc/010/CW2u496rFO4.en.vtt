00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
major bug in this game and I have no

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.960 
major bug in this game and I have no
idea<00:00:29.010> why<00:00:29.490> they<00:00:29.699> even<00:00:31.430> added<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.460> concept<00:00:32.669> of

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
idea why they even added the concept of

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.430 
idea why they even added the concept of
this<00:00:33.090> as<00:00:33.330> some<00:00:33.720> of<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.900> may<00:00:33.989> know<00:00:34.110> when<00:00:34.350> you

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
this as some of you may know when you

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.410 
this as some of you may know when you
shoot<00:00:34.650> Windows<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.699> can<00:00:35.820> auto<00:00:36.000> climb<00:00:36.239> through

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
shoot Windows you can auto climb through

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.610 
shoot Windows you can auto climb through
it<00:00:36.480> no<00:00:36.540> matter<00:00:36.660> what<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.080> so<00:00:37.199> what<00:00:37.379> does<00:00:37.470> it

it no matter what and so what does it

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.770 
it no matter what and so what does it
forget<00:00:37.949> think<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> middle<00:00:39.150> of<00:00:39.269> it<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.570> can

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
forget think in the middle of it you can

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.390 
forget think in the middle of it you can
jump<00:00:39.989> right<00:00:40.110> through<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.500> if<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.830> small

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
jump right through it if it's a small

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.219 
jump right through it if it's a small
window<00:00:41.940> that's<00:00:42.120> two<00:00:42.360> feet<00:00:42.540> tall<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.930> can<00:00:42.960> go

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:43.229 
window that's two feet tall you can go

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:45.439 
window that's two feet tall you can go
right<00:00:43.379> through<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.089> we<00:00:45.089> discovered<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
right through it and we discovered a

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.079 
right through it and we discovered a
glitch<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:46.370> primarily<00:00:47.370> happens<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:47.970> this

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
glitch it primarily happens with this

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:49.000 
glitch it primarily happens with this
window<00:00:48.449> right<00:00:48.659> here

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
like snark doesn't be f2 essentially

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.490 
like snark doesn't be f2 essentially
this<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.510> like<00:01:16.050> I<00:01:16.140> said<00:01:16.230> this<00:01:16.350> is

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
this is you know like I said this is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
this is you know like I said this is
gonna<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.740> some<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.980> that<00:01:17.070> everybody's<00:01:17.460> gonna

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
gonna be some of that everybody's gonna

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.760 
gonna be some of that everybody's gonna
do<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:17.910> I<00:01:18.090> think<00:01:18.120> that<00:01:18.570> there<00:01:19.380> will<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.590> people

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
do but I think that there will be people

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.000 
do but I think that there will be people
who<00:01:19.890> would<00:01:19.980> use<00:01:20.190> this<00:01:20.310> glitch<00:01:21.680> it's<00:01:22.680> pretty

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
who would use this glitch it's pretty

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.510 
who would use this glitch it's pretty
sad

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
sad

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.070 
sad
it's<00:01:23.910> a<00:01:23.970> pretty<00:01:24.150> sad<00:01:24.300> question<00:01:24.510> I<00:01:24.750> don't<00:01:24.840> think

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
it's a pretty sad question I don't think

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.420 
it's a pretty sad question I don't think
should<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.260> ever<00:01:25.350> been<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.650> game<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
should have ever been in the game but I

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.340 
should have ever been in the game but I
guess<00:01:27.270> when<00:01:27.420> you're<00:01:27.480> in<00:01:27.630> arm<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.870> know<00:01:27.960> rocket

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
guess when you're in arm you know rocket

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.870 
guess when you're in arm you know rocket
at<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> end<00:01:28.800> and<00:01:28.980> you<00:01:29.040> kind<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.280> forget<00:01:29.670> about

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
at the end and you kind of forget about

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.520 
at the end and you kind of forget about
things<00:01:30.120> like<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:32.030> but<00:01:33.030> yeah<00:01:33.240> once<00:01:34.230> we<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.410> up

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
things like this but yeah once we get up

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.900 
things like this but yeah once we get up
here<00:01:34.710> I'll<00:01:34.830> show<00:01:35.190> you<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.400> collisions<00:01:35.790> it

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
here I'll show you the collisions it

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.980 
here I'll show you the collisions it
basically<00:01:36.270> essentially<00:01:36.510> we<00:01:36.660> can<00:01:36.720> get<00:01:36.870> under

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
basically essentially we can get under

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.950 
basically essentially we can get under
the<00:01:37.080> map<00:01:37.230> here<00:01:37.440> and<00:01:37.470> captured<00:01:38.159> me<00:01:38.280> I'll<00:01:39.180> show

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
the map here and captured me I'll show

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.540 
the map here and captured me I'll show
you<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.080> whole<00:01:40.260> run<00:01:41.010> around<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.340> bit<00:01:41.460> and

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
you the whole run around a bit and

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.450 
you the whole run around a bit and
everything<00:01:42.620> looks<00:01:43.620> only<00:01:43.830> position<00:01:44.310> like

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
everything looks only position like

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.770 
everything looks only position like
we're<00:01:45.210> ready<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.750> go<00:01:45.870> okay

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.780 

as<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.040> he<00:01:50.130> shut<00:01:50.280> out<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.399> windows

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
as you can see he shut out the windows

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.719 
as you can see he shut out the windows
and<00:01:51.619> what<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.710> basically<00:01:53.070> had<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.520> here

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
and what you basically had to do is here

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.910 
and what you basically had to do is here
now<00:01:54.420> I'm<00:01:54.990> sure<00:01:55.170> there's<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.439> way<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.799> people

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
now I'm sure there's a way that people

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.609 
now I'm sure there's a way that people

underneath<00:03:38.190> here<00:03:38.370> they're<00:03:38.459> gonna<00:03:38.549> be<00:03:38.730> holding

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
underneath here they're gonna be holding

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.759 
underneath here they're gonna be holding
B<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.239> whole<00:03:39.359> time<00:03:39.630> people<00:03:40.440> will<00:03:40.530> never<00:03:40.650> be

B the whole time people will never be

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.410 
B the whole time people will never be
able<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:41.040> take<00:03:41.190> B<00:03:41.370> from<00:03:41.700> anybody<00:03:42.060> on<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:42.269> map

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
able to take B from anybody on this map

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.379 
able to take B from anybody on this map
and<00:03:42.660> like<00:03:43.380> in<00:03:43.650> another<00:03:44.010> map<00:03:44.280> what<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:44.819> it

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
and like in another map what is it

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.440 
and like in another map what is it
the<00:03:45.569> cross<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:45.989> map<00:03:46.139> the<00:03:46.440> sea<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.329> cross<00:03:48.329> it

the cross and map the sea and cross it

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.660 
the cross and map the sea and cross it
you<00:03:48.480> can<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.930> window<00:03:49.650> just<00:03:49.889> like<00:03:50.130> that<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.549> can

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
you can a window just like that you can

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.069 
you can a window just like that you can
get<00:03:50.760> up<00:03:50.819> there<00:03:51.000> by<00:03:51.209> yourself<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:51.810> you

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
get up there by yourself and you

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.390 
get up there by yourself and you
literally<00:03:52.350> parachute<00:03:52.829> underneath<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.250> map

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
literally parachute underneath the map

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.050 
literally parachute underneath the map
for<00:03:53.579> like<00:03:53.700> an<00:03:53.819> hour

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
for like an hour

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.960 
for like an hour
I<00:03:54.269> mean<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:55.139> to<00:03:55.919> my<00:03:56.070> knowledge<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.639> don't<00:03:56.669> think

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
I mean I to my knowledge I don't think

I mean I to my knowledge I don't think
anybody's<00:03:57.359> found<00:03:57.750> this<00:03:57.870> glitch

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
anybody's found this glitch

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.950 
anybody's found this glitch
and<00:03:59.280> if<00:03:59.400> they<00:03:59.520> have<00:03:59.700> you<00:04:00.270> know<00:04:00.360> my<00:04:00.540> bad<00:04:00.720> on<00:04:00.930> that

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
and if they have you know my bad on that

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.960 
and if they have you know my bad on that
but<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:02.070> my<00:04:02.160> knowledge<00:04:02.370> I've<00:04:02.610> never<00:04:02.790> seen

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.210 
but to my knowledge I've never seen
anybody<00:04:03.090> do<00:04:03.330> this<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:03.780> this<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.860> pretty<00:04:04.980> game

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
anybody do this and this is pretty game

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.800 
anybody do this and this is pretty game
breaking<00:04:05.580> right<00:04:05.730> here<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.210> I'm<00:04:06.330> not<00:04:06.480> just<00:04:06.690> for

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
breaking right here and I'm not just for

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.030 
breaking right here and I'm not just for
competition<00:04:07.290> obviously<00:04:07.650> because<00:04:07.830> this<00:04:07.950> could

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
competition obviously because this could

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.180 
competition obviously because this could
be<00:04:08.130> hard<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.400> do<00:04:08.520> something<00:04:08.730> like<00:04:08.910> that<00:04:09.090> but

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
be hard to do something like that but

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.590 
be hard to do something like that but
you<00:04:11.190> know<00:04:11.280> just<00:04:11.580> clubs<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:12.270> know<00:04:12.360> in<00:04:12.480> general

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
you know just clubs you know in general

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.730 
you know just clubs you know in general
something<00:04:13.050> like<00:04:13.170> this<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.560> know<00:04:13.590> I'm

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
something like this you know I'm

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.440 
something like this you know I'm
surprised<00:04:14.100> they're<00:04:14.400> gonna<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:15.240> know<00:04:15.330> they

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
surprised they're gonna you know they

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.280 
surprised they're gonna you know they
left<00:04:16.020> in<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.230> game<00:04:16.350> essentially<00:04:16.890> you<00:04:17.130> know<00:04:17.250> so

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
left in the game essentially you know so

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.930 
left in the game essentially you know so
that<00:04:19.290> definitely<00:04:19.830> needs<00:04:20.040> to<00:04:20.070> be<00:04:20.160> fixed

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
that definitely needs to be fixed

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.330 
that definitely needs to be fixed
I'm<00:04:21.120> sure<00:04:21.300> after<00:04:21.450> this<00:04:21.690> video<00:04:21.959> hopefully<00:04:22.620> if

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
I'm sure after this video hopefully if

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.340 
I'm sure after this video hopefully if
word<00:04:23.670> gets<00:04:23.790> out<00:04:23.970> on<00:04:24.030> it<00:04:24.300> that<00:04:24.480> they<00:04:24.630> will<00:04:24.870> you

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
word gets out on it that they will you

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.400 
word gets out on it that they will you
know<00:04:25.380> take<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.190> knowledge<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.840> fix<00:04:28.290> it

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
know take the knowledge and and fix it

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.980 
know take the knowledge and and fix it
so<00:04:28.560> but<00:04:29.460> basically<00:04:29.640> any<00:04:30.390> of<00:04:30.600> these<00:04:30.750> windows

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
so but basically any of these windows

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.440 
so but basically any of these windows
here<00:04:31.410> that<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:31.860> see<00:04:32.070> that<00:04:32.430> are<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:33.150> know<00:04:33.270> like

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
here that you see that are you know like

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.580 
here that you see that are you know like
the<00:04:33.510> ones<00:04:33.750> we<00:04:33.870> jump<00:04:34.110> through<00:04:34.230> you're<00:04:34.410> going<00:04:34.530> to

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
the ones we jump through you're going to

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.500 
the ones we jump through you're going to
be<00:04:34.650> able<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:35.210> do<00:04:36.210> that<00:04:36.420> so<00:04:37.220> there's<00:04:38.220> several

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
be able to do that so there's several

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.840 
be able to do that so there's several
several<00:04:39.510> of<00:04:39.600> those<00:04:39.750> on<00:04:40.410> different<00:04:41.370> maps<00:04:41.520> so

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
several of those on different maps so

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.480 
several of those on different maps so
you're<00:04:42.690> gonna<00:04:42.780> want<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.110> watch<00:04:44.010> after<00:04:44.280> that<00:04:44.400> I

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
you're gonna want to watch after that I

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.190 
you're gonna want to watch after that I
guess<00:04:44.670> and<00:04:45.150> you<00:04:45.390> can<00:04:45.510> test<00:04:45.720> pretty<00:04:45.900> much<00:04:46.020> any

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
guess and you can test pretty much any

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.510 
guess and you can test pretty much any
other<00:04:46.260> windows<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.830> isn't<00:04:46.980> like<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:47.220> if

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
other windows to that isn't like that if

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.860 
other windows to that isn't like that if
you<00:04:47.610> notice<00:04:48.000> when<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.180> ought<00:04:48.390> to<00:04:48.420> climb<00:04:48.660> it

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
you notice when you ought to climb it

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.570 
you notice when you ought to climb it
you're<00:04:49.470> actually<00:04:49.620> with<00:04:49.950> the<00:04:50.040> Lich<00:04:50.190> through<00:04:50.460> it

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
you're actually with the Lich through it

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.710 
you're actually with the Lich through it
your<00:04:50.670> head<00:04:50.820> it'll<00:04:50.940> go<00:04:51.030> through<00:04:51.300> it<00:04:51.450> you'll<00:04:51.570> see

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
your head it'll go through it you'll see

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.590 
your head it'll go through it you'll see
texture<00:04:52.080> glitches<00:04:52.410> and<00:04:52.560> I'm<00:04:52.800> sure<00:04:53.250> that

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
texture glitches and I'm sure that

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.520 
texture glitches and I'm sure that
somebody<00:04:54.600> spends<00:04:54.930> time<00:04:55.050> in<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.230> server<00:04:55.410> they

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
somebody spends time in a server they

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.690 
somebody spends time in a server they
probably<00:04:55.680> find<00:04:55.920> more<00:04:56.070> glitches<00:04:56.280> just<00:04:56.550> like

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
probably find more glitches just like

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.850 
probably find more glitches just like
this<00:04:56.940> this<00:04:57.750> was<00:04:57.900> done<00:04:58.050> in<00:04:58.110> minimal<00:04:58.500> time<00:04:58.530> we

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
this this was done in minimal time we

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.720 
this this was done in minimal time we
were<00:04:58.950> like<00:04:59.070> hey<00:04:59.220> let's<00:04:59.400> see<00:04:59.460> we<00:04:59.550> could<00:04:59.640> go

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
were like hey let's see we could go

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.470 
were like hey let's see we could go
through<00:04:59.850> this<00:04:59.940> window

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
through this window

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.790 
through this window
Nexen<00:05:00.990> we<00:05:01.080> know<00:05:01.170> we<00:05:01.260> oughta<00:05:01.410> climb<00:05:01.620> through

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
Nexen we know we oughta climb through

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.080 
Nexen we know we oughta climb through
we've<00:05:01.980> grown<00:05:02.130> up<00:05:02.250> there<00:05:02.370> today<00:05:02.730> we're<00:05:02.940> under
