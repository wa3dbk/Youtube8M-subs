four five and then that way now engage

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.710 
four five and then that way now engage
now<00:00:36.010> it's<00:00:36.220> in<00:00:36.340> test<00:00:36.579> mode<00:00:36.790> you<00:00:37.300> can<00:00:37.450> see<00:00:37.630> is

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
now it's in test mode you can see is

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.090 
now it's in test mode you can see is
calibrating<00:00:38.350> now<00:00:40.290> yeah<00:00:41.290> you<00:00:41.680> can<00:00:41.860> do<00:00:41.950> this

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
calibrating now yeah you can do this

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.650 
calibrating now yeah you can do this
over<00:00:42.310> and<00:00:42.550> over<00:00:42.700> and<00:00:42.850> over<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:43.270> just<00:00:43.300> don't

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
over and over and over you just don't

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.150 
over and over and over you just don't
have<00:00:43.930> to<00:00:44.080> do<00:00:44.200> it<00:00:44.320> again<00:00:44.530> just<00:00:44.740> leave<00:00:44.860> it<00:00:44.980> on<00:00:45.040> the

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
have to do it again just leave it on the

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.850 
have to do it again just leave it on the
ignition<00:00:45.750> say<00:00:46.750> once<00:00:47.170> this<00:00:47.290> plastic<00:00:47.650> pieces

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
ignition say once this plastic pieces

off you can take your needles out and if

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.800 
off you can take your needles out and if
it's<00:00:51.520> not<00:00:51.670> in<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:51.910> right<00:00:52.060> position<00:00:52.240> usually

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
it's not in the right position usually

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.020 
it's not in the right position usually
the<00:00:52.960> needle<00:00:53.200> will<00:00:53.290> be<00:00:53.320> like<00:00:53.560> 40<00:00:53.950> 60<00:00:54.610> if<00:00:54.850> it's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
the needle will be like 40 60 if it's

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.760 
the needle will be like 40 60 if it's
not<00:00:55.180> in<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.390> right<00:00:55.510> position<00:00:55.720> and<00:00:56.470> you<00:00:56.620> just

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
not in the right position and you just

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.530 
not in the right position and you just
keep<00:00:56.980> on<00:00:57.100> pressing<00:00:57.310> this<00:00:57.610> button<00:00:57.670> to<00:00:58.120> test<00:00:58.329> it

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
keep on pressing this button to test it

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.810 
keep on pressing this button to test it
make<00:00:59.020> sure<00:00:59.079> it<00:00:59.350> stays<00:00:59.560> at<00:00:59.740> zero<00:00:59.770> and<00:01:00.310> goes<00:01:00.610> all

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
make sure it stays at zero and goes all

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.120 
make sure it stays at zero and goes all
the<00:01:00.850> way<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:01.510> all<00:01:02.260> of<00:01:02.290> these<00:01:02.530> goes<00:01:02.829> all<00:01:03.100> the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
the way and all of these goes all the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.920 
the way and all of these goes all the
way<00:01:03.340> to<00:01:03.430> their<00:01:03.820> full<00:01:04.059> spot<00:01:05.340> as<00:01:06.340> you<00:01:06.400> can<00:01:06.549> see

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
way to their full spot as you can see

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.260 
way to their full spot as you can see
yep<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.110> that's<00:01:08.950> pretty<00:01:09.310> much<00:01:09.430> how<00:01:09.820> to

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
yep and that's pretty much how to

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.389 
yep and that's pretty much how to
calibrate<00:01:10.810> it<00:01:10.929> and<00:01:11.170> then<00:01:11.710> once<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:12.069> turn<00:01:12.310> it

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
calibrate it and then once you turn it

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.520 
calibrate it and then once you turn it
off<00:01:12.549> it<00:01:12.819> will<00:01:13.539> be<00:01:13.659> back<00:01:13.840> in<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.200> right

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
off it will be back in the right

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:25.420 
off it will be back in the right
positions

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.790 

what<00:01:26.390> I'm<00:01:26.510> doing<00:01:26.540> is<00:01:26.900> I'm<00:01:27.080> recalibrating<00:01:27.350> the

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
what I'm doing is I'm recalibrating the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.770 
what I'm doing is I'm recalibrating the
needle<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.370> I<00:01:28.520> think<00:01:29.150> I<00:01:29.240> got<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:29.570> where<00:01:29.720> I

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
needle and I think I got it where I

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.500 
needle and I think I got it where I
wanted<00:01:30.110> what<00:01:30.800> you<00:01:30.830> do<00:01:31.100> is<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:31.430> once<00:01:32.120> you<00:01:32.270> have

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
wanted what you do is you once you have

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.510 
wanted what you do is you once you have
it<00:01:32.630> in<00:01:32.750> test<00:01:32.960> mode<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.770> want<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.040> press<00:01:34.250> the

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
it in test mode you want to press the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.960 
it in test mode you want to press the
trip<00:01:35.420> meter<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:36.170> make<00:01:36.500> sure<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:36.980> goes<00:01:37.550> from

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
trip meter and make sure it goes from

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.870 
trip meter and make sure it goes from
zero<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.750> last<00:01:38.990> number<00:01:39.290> on<00:01:39.440> all<00:01:39.800> of<00:01:40.280> these

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
zero to the last number on all of these

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.620 
zero to the last number on all of these
areas<00:01:42.130> your<00:01:43.130> rpm<00:01:43.580> your<00:01:43.820> miles<00:01:44.030> per<00:01:44.120> hour<00:01:44.330> and

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
areas your rpm your miles per hour and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.800 
areas your rpm your miles per hour and
your<00:01:45.440> feel<00:01:45.740> in<00:01:46.070> cold<00:01:46.610> right<00:01:47.180> now<00:01:47.210> I<00:01:47.360> have<00:01:47.510> a<00:01:47.540> set

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
your feel in cold right now I have a set

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.410 
your feel in cold right now I have a set
it<00:01:47.930> correct<00:01:48.260> so<00:01:48.470> this<00:01:48.620> is<00:01:48.830> good<00:01:49.160> about<00:01:49.910> just

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
it correct so this is good about just

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.100 
it correct so this is good about just
about<00:01:50.540> right

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
about right

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.170 
about right
but<00:01:51.380> I<00:01:51.470> can<00:01:51.620> still<00:01:51.800> find<00:01:52.040> tweak<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.460> if<00:01:52.730> I<00:01:52.940> want

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
but I can still find tweak it if I want

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.080 
but I can still find tweak it if I want
to<00:01:53.300> I'll<00:01:53.540> just<00:01:53.830> let<00:01:54.830> this<00:01:55.040> test<00:01:55.340> finish<00:01:58.090> and

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
to I'll just let this test finish and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.719 
to I'll just let this test finish and
then<00:01:59.840> what<00:01:59.990> I'll<00:02:00.110> do<00:02:00.290> is<00:02:00.320> I<00:02:00.710> will<00:02:00.740> if<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.490> if

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
then what I'll do is I will if it if

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.790 
then what I'll do is I will if it if
it's<00:02:01.970> not<00:02:02.090> lined<00:02:02.330> up<00:02:02.450> maybe<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.110> cold<00:02:03.560> ones

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
it's not lined up maybe the cold ones

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.770 
it's not lined up maybe the cold ones
not<00:02:03.979> lined<00:02:04.160> up<00:02:04.280> little<00:02:04.610> I'll<00:02:05.030> remove<00:02:05.540> this

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
not lined up little I'll remove this

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.960 
not lined up little I'll remove this
I'll<00:02:06.050> pull<00:02:06.260> it<00:02:06.290> back<00:02:06.530> up<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:06.920> then<00:02:06.979> make<00:02:07.940> sure

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
I'll pull it back up and then make sure

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.300 
I'll pull it back up and then make sure
it's<00:02:08.149> lined<00:02:08.479> up<00:02:08.720> straight<00:02:08.869> how<00:02:09.380> I<00:02:09.410> want<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.830> the
