00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.900
 Time has come (DEVIL MAY CRY) 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.020
 And I dream 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.980
 I will laugh last because you came to die. 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.100
 I will laugh last because you came to die. (Here!) 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.320
 The scars are already on me, but the pain is falling 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.700
 And I see the bright fear when I look into your eye 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.360
 I will never kneel and never rest 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.280
 You can easily pull my heart out with my proud 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.480
 I'll show you what I'm best at 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.120
 I'll make sure you breathe the last breath 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.080
 Now I know how an angel fell 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.152
 I know the story very well 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.500
 You're gonna want your soul to sell 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.150
 When I put you on the floor 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.310
 And I will send you DIRECTLY TO THE HELL 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.750
 My army is coming in deeply! 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.650
 Under my soul, under my skin! 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.190
 Just as you end up getting started 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.810
 My strength is pain and I never seem! 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.670
 I'll tell you now, I'll be the one to survive! 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.150
 You will never break my faith or my step before! 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.030
 I'll choke you with your death 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.590
 ANGEL WILL CALL ME FROM ME 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.110
 A DEMON BREAK 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.680
 My honorable brothers 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.290
 My honorable brothers 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.320
 We're coming together 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.760
 To unite as one 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.360
 Against those who are damned 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.180
 We do not show compassion because we have none 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.480
 Our enemy will fall 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.640
 While we rise 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.580
 For our destiny 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.480
 Now and forever 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.580
 We will be together 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.460
 In love and hate 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.800
 They will see 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.300
 I'll fight forever 

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:31.302
 Come with me 

00:02:31.302 --> 00:02:35.782
 Fight to stand and fight together 

00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:38.022
 Our strength 

00:02:38.022 --> 00:02:43.462
 I'll make a better day tomorrow 

00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:45.822
 We will never give up 

00:02:45.822 --> 00:02:48.982
 We will never give up 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.040
 They will see 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.880
 I'll fight forever 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.640
 Come with me 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.120
 I will stand and fight 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.900
 Our strength 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.820
 I'll make a better day tomorrow 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.900
 We will never give up 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.400
 Come with me, stand and fight, I will. 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.980
 With our strength, we will make a better tomorrow 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.820
 We will never give up 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.120
 They will see 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.580
 I'll fight forever 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.340
 Come with me 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.500
 It will stand and fight for the sake 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.580
 Our strength 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.920
 We'll make tomorrow a better day 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:17.900
 We will never give up
