00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:11.550
 performed by zabu fields 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.839
 5 dance vidosik you see the most 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.000
 simple form of performance of the year and reel 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:21.029
 the second most important of the three to to the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.060
 goc level turkey its name is far from 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.359
 accidentally and not at all hyperbole that because 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.699
 which is similar to the five primary elements 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.130
 symbols earth water fire wind and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.559
 emptiness combining a myriad of things 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.059
 so and 5 of the simplest movements of a cat absorb 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.170
 thousands of technical actions 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.670
 unarmed 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.379
 and armed combat possessing threads on the cat 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.030
 not unlike most 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.980
 familiar to the viewer cat 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.660
 for example karate only one two 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.660
 decoding each movement 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.670
 rather, it acts as the main idea 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.010
 principle they are specific technique 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.079
 This can be explained primarily by the fact that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.270
 it must not be completely different to build 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.120
 his training in fighting he 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.350
 based on logic and intuition 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.600
 simultaneously they are on one of these 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.710
 aspects like most martial arts 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.960
 or self defense systems shock 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.119
 attack and defense techniques are very 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.470
 easy to memorize and execute and 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.840
 even at first glance it may seem 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.770
 quite impractical in terms of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.380
 real fight 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.200
 however this is far from being similar 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.270
 tradition is very characteristic for anything under 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.100
 simple seemingly meaningless 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.439
 movements lies complex combat 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.850
 technique I honed in practice for 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.530
 centuries by several generations 7 ninja 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.049
 and the most important aspect in all 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.420
 this is that the techniques and technique are not 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.860
 given specifically as an example in famous 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.079
 kata karate or jidzhet 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.689
 the student himself is entitled 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.869
 disclosure and gradually as it grows 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.829
 physical and spiritual mastery 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.990
 it is considered yes the way it really is 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.790
 the deed that man is new enough 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.490
 take a fresh look at something 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.960
 familiar and well known to him so that he 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.540
 discovered in this subject or phenomenon 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.479
 something new and even unusual for yourself 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.890
 many practices are built on it 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.110
 development of feelings camouflage methods 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.150
 the art of depersonalizing reincarnation 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.790
 the same method applies when working on 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.560
 where , well, then there is almost 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.720
 all principles of investing and 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.520
 working with a partner working with 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.560
 distance timeliness of action and 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.810
 Of course, a huge variety of combat 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.480
 techniques as well as bringing exercises to 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.370
 It is natural that for not 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.080
 dedicated to the cat that is in the process 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.849
 exactly how should be with her 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.489
 work all about what was said above 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.010
 remains behind the scenes he sees only 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.140
 elementary blocks and strikes and at its best 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.730
 case will find one or two applications to them on 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.120
 practice in the form in which they 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.489
 performed so how do you work on to 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.069
 so first study and and meticulously up 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.959
 trivia hone and movements themselves on this 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.760
 stage is still too early to think about what exactly 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.370
 they mean since the movement is still 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.989
 hold your breath unnatural for you 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.239
 and calm relaxed manner 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.130
 practice all five technicians in a row 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.290
 then repeat all over again 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.760
 for one workout you can repeat 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.890
 them up to 100 or more times but not 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.329
 overstretch the movement of the cat should not 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.489
 become a punishment for you or 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.130
 duty consciousness must be 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.620
 let go thought arising in the head 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.540
 must flow freely do not become attached 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.640
 not one of them just watching 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.959
 their continuous flow of breath must 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.810
 be calm and even 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.329
 not significant body strain while inhaling 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.329
 and exhale with blocks and blows should 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.890
 become completely natural for you 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:36.209
 having worked livestock in some manner about 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.530
 months slightly change and exercise 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.180
 focus your attention on the tide 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.549
 and the flow of blood in the limbs and trunk 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.530
 with all the changes occurring 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.630
 performance of a cat 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.139
 blocks of lessons the most blows breaths and 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.239
 exhale 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.359
 dissolve your mind in your work 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.290
 bodies become one with what you do 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.420
 at some point you are surprised 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.579
 find that it is not your mind at all 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.400
 direct the body movements breathing and 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:03.220
 blood but some kind of single powerful will and 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.170
 energy first fills then leads and 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.470
 finally pervading all your 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.810
 the body is even more likely not the body as such from 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.790
 body performing to try so hard 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.420
 keep this state as possible 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.370
 longer 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.799
 she will lead the practitioner to absolute 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.850
 fullness and merging with the energy of all 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.380
 existence of a single for the whole universe 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.060
 reaching such level work with themselves 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.280
 direct your work with movements 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:32.050
 consciousness on the next target of the enemy 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.540
 consider the examples shown in this. 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.190
 film and carefully study them and but not 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.639
 in any case, do not become attached to them 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.020
 as something unshakeable and do not change 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.990
 if this happens you on the wrong 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.000
 the paths are all shown here just a grain 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.010
 the knowledge that is encrypted in the year I 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.650
 on the cat and your work with her only 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.930
 started at this stage will not interfere purely 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.580
 logical perception you can 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.400
 work out a variety of partners 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.910
 options approaches biases change those 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.520
 or other 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.590
 as well as protection work as you can 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.690
 more otherwise you will never understand what 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.580
 all tricks and combinations are simple 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.430
 impossible to comprehend or work 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.700
 guided and went their infinite 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.110
 set like a star in the night sky 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.430
 to say that I studied all possible 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.050
 technical options equivalent to 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.000
 statements that I understand and know that 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.130
 such a universe these sayings 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.880
 equal since they are both awful 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.380
 far from the true state of things for 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.570
 order to embrace it to you extremely 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.890
 need to understand what to know 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.960
 unknowable but can only be on 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.490
 intuitive level since usually and 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.410
 logical thinking is simply not in 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.240
 able to do this since a 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.090
 washed away in their judgments on that experience 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.590
 which she has like this can't 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.650
 to be because it cannot be 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.300
 never worth the time 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.400
 to repeat one combination 100 times 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.890
 in the same given conditions 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.050
 some kind of attack protection and 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.000
 similar similar method 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.800
 terribly long and also absolutely not 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.580
 needed because it does not meet the requirement 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.030
 real fight 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.039
 why explain first such 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.900
 stocking works only against this 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:07.360
 specific strike of that particular 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.940
 human rhythm and so on 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.950
 change a bit and ask for conditions 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.560
 partner change rack or trajectory 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.240
 strike or grab you before attacking or 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.150
 these or maybe a few dozen 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.010
 if not hundreds and each of them leads to 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.870
 the impossibility of holding a combination in 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.020
 the kind in which the person spent on 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.340
 her watch and 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.110
 and then often and years in the second you 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.030
 never asked yourself the question why 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.770
 karate in what form it is practiced in 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.539
 we often lose in real 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.560
 they are ostentatious fights english or 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:39.020
 thai boxing 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.090
 The reasons are several differences in the most 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.520
 technique accents dominant tricks 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.750
 tactics and training method but the main thing 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.699
 what needs to be emphasized that 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.129
 modern karate is most often a care 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:51.050
 from reality side trying to make out 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:53.360
 cut split the crease into some 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.810
 individual small pieces that can 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.009
 occur every 10 thousand cases and 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.259
 looping on this unlike boxing 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:03.080
 where the basis of gsen is put by 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:06.909
 rules and yet the real fight in it under 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.909
 will be dressed in general and in guessing but cats
