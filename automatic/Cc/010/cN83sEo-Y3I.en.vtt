00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
here to Vermont to Vermont what was the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.040 
here to Vermont to Vermont what was the
biggest<00:00:59.760> challenge<00:01:00.030> fitting<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.660> engine

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
biggest challenge fitting this engine

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.869 
biggest challenge fitting this engine
for<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
for you

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.399 
for you
the<00:01:02.879> engine<00:01:03.149> bay<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.600> morris<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.170> very

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
the engine bay in the morris is very

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:04.939 
the engine bay in the morris is very
very<00:01:04.650> short

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
very short

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.609 
very short
both<00:01:05.700> Alec<00:01:06.060> Issigonis<00:01:06.180> who<00:01:06.810> designed<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> car

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
both Alec Issigonis who designed the car

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.359 
both Alec Issigonis who designed the car
also<00:01:09.310> designed<00:01:09.640> an<00:01:09.789> engine<00:01:10.060> for<00:01:10.240> Rjay

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
also designed an engine for Rjay

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.459 
also designed an engine for Rjay
horizontally-opposed<00:01:12.369> flathead<00:01:13.469> horse

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
horizontally-opposed flathead horse

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:17.459 
horizontally-opposed flathead horse
Walker<00:01:14.710> and<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:16.119> it<00:01:16.179> was<00:01:16.270> very<00:01:16.299> wide<00:01:16.780> it's<00:01:17.170> very

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469 
Walker and so it was very wide it's very

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.590 
Walker and so it was very wide it's very
very<00:01:17.710> short<00:01:17.920> that<00:01:18.819> engine<00:01:19.119> never<00:01:19.240> went<00:01:19.479> into

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
very short that engine never went into

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.510 
very short that engine never went into
production<00:01:19.719> so<00:01:20.500> that<00:01:20.530> was<00:01:20.829> introduced<00:01:21.340> with

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
production so that was introduced with

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.990 
production so that was introduced with
an<00:01:21.640> inline<00:01:22.000> for<00:01:22.359> the<00:01:23.259> just<00:01:23.679> barely<00:01:23.950> fit<00:01:24.700> and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
an inline for the just barely fit and

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.709 
an inline for the just barely fit and
that<00:01:25.299> was<00:01:25.479> tiny<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.350> on<00:01:26.679> board<00:01:26.979> and<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.509> the

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
that was tiny and on board and so the

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.069 
that was tiny and on board and so the
challenge<00:01:29.140> is<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.439> package<00:01:30.250> all<00:01:30.549> this<00:01:31.179> in<00:01:31.840> the

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
challenge is to package all this in the

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.020 
challenge is to package all this in the
link<00:01:32.319> that's<00:01:32.500> provided<00:01:32.759> you've<00:01:33.759> got<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:33.909> very

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
link that's provided you've got a very

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.789 
link that's provided you've got a very
definite<00:01:34.390> limitation<00:01:35.020> in<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.170> length<00:01:35.469> as

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
definite limitation in the length as

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.249 
definite limitation in the length as
forwards<00:01:36.250> you<00:01:36.340> can<00:01:36.459> go<00:01:36.700> back<00:01:36.909> because<00:01:37.719> the

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
forwards you can go back because the

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.100 
forwards you can go back because the
cars<00:01:39.130> rack<00:01:39.399> and<00:01:39.609> pinion<00:01:39.880> steering<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.899> rack

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
cars rack and pinion steering the rack

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.690 
cars rack and pinion steering the rack
is<00:01:41.319> very<00:01:41.500> high<00:01:41.739> mounted<00:01:42.220> you<00:01:42.310> hunted<00:01:42.610> this

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
is very high mounted you hunted this

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.809 
is very high mounted you hunted this
crossmember<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:44.259> pretty<00:01:45.250> much<00:01:45.340> anything<00:01:45.640> you

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
crossmember so pretty much anything you

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.339 
crossmember so pretty much anything you
put<00:01:46.090> there<00:01:46.329> the<00:01:46.360> first<00:01:46.659> thing<00:01:46.989> you're<00:01:47.140> going

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:47.349 
put there the first thing you're going

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:49.620 
put there the first thing you're going
to<00:01:47.439> interfere<00:01:48.130> with<00:01:48.189> this<00:01:48.640> is<00:01:48.789> scary<00:01:49.090> so

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
to interfere with this is scary so

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.410 
to interfere with this is scary so
unless<00:01:50.110> you're<00:01:50.319> willing<00:01:50.709> to<00:01:51.239> scrap<00:01:52.239> the

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
unless you're willing to scrap the

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.020 
unless you're willing to scrap the
original<00:01:52.840> steering<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.649> suspension<00:01:54.030> you

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
original steering and suspension you

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.699 
original steering and suspension you
have<00:01:55.179> to<00:01:55.329> live<00:01:55.479> with<00:01:55.659> that<00:01:55.689> placement<00:01:56.289> when

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
have to live with that placement when

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:58.050 
have to live with that placement when
there's<00:01:56.890> only<00:01:57.039> so<00:01:57.250> far<00:01:57.429> you<00:01:57.489> can<00:01:57.610> go<00:01:57.789> forward

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
there's only so far you can go forward

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.539 
there's only so far you can go forward
and<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.079> did<00:01:59.409> end<00:01:59.739> up<00:01:59.920> scrapping<00:02:00.280> the

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
and so you did end up scrapping the

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.279 
and so you did end up scrapping the
steering<00:02:00.909> now<00:02:01.209> you<00:02:01.270> let<00:02:01.479> it<00:02:01.629> in<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:02.140> original

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
steering now you let it in the original

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.319 
steering now you let it in the original
steering<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:02.979> suspension<00:02:03.090> architecture<00:02:04.090> is

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
steering and suspension architecture is

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.039 
steering and suspension architecture is
as<00:02:04.810> designed<00:02:05.289> in<00:02:05.469> 1948<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:07.450> totally

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
as designed in 1948 it's totally

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.309 
as designed in 1948 it's totally
retained<00:02:08.500> but<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.429> is<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.670> savanna<00:02:10.209> for<00:02:10.539> you<00:02:10.660> so

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
retained but it is a savanna for you so

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.610

this<00:02:12.280> engine<00:02:12.780> was<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.380> shortest<00:02:14.889> of<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
this engine was the the shortest of the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.740 
this engine was the the shortest of the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
fairly modern engines that that I felt

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.660 
fairly modern engines that that I felt
like<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.870> package<00:02:20.319> in<00:02:20.470> here<00:02:20.650> this<00:02:21.100> engine<00:02:21.489> is

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
like a package in here this engine is

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.770 
like a package in here this engine is

it<00:02:30.450> makes<00:02:30.570> really<00:02:30.780> good<00:02:30.930> power<00:02:31.140> that's<00:02:31.680> quite

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
it makes really good power that's quite

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.170 
it makes really good power that's quite
a<00:02:31.920> difference<00:02:32.340> from<00:02:32.490> them<00:02:32.700> what<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:32.970> the

a difference from them what is the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
948 cc engine which was significantly

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.130 
948 cc engine which was significantly
more<00:03:00.709> powerful<00:03:01.709> even<00:03:02.190> though<00:03:02.660> it<00:03:03.660> was<00:03:03.810> rated

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
more powerful even though it was rated

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.280 
more powerful even though it was rated
at<00:03:04.260> 43<00:03:04.920> horsepower<00:03:05.400> as<00:03:06.180> opposed<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.750> know<00:03:07.260> I

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
at 43 horsepower as opposed to know I

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.770 
at 43 horsepower as opposed to know I
think<00:03:07.470> 37<00:03:08.100> horsepower<00:03:08.489> on<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.820> one<00:03:08.970> the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
think 37 horsepower on that one the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.449 
think 37 horsepower on that one the
later<00:03:09.989> when<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.260> was<00:03:10.320> 43<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:11.040> how<00:03:11.280> many

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
later when I was 43 and how many

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.720 
later when I was 43 and how many
horsepower<00:03:11.970> up<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.360> now<00:03:13.100> 140<00:03:14.100> ish<00:03:14.400> it's

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
horsepower up to now 140 ish it's

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.990 
horsepower up to now 140 ish it's
actually<00:03:16.010> 112<00:03:17.010> with<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.250> rear<00:03:17.430> wheels<00:03:17.640> as

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
actually 112 with the rear wheels as

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.910 
actually 112 with the rear wheels as
measured<00:03:18.450> on<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.600> dyno<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.560> think<00:03:19.800> it's

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
measured on a dyno and I think it's

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.580 
measured on a dyno and I think it's
about<00:03:20.100> 140<00:03:20.580> at<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.850> crane<00:03:21.060> that's<00:03:21.510> great<00:03:21.959> what

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
about 140 at the crane that's great what

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.870 
about 140 at the crane that's great what
were<00:03:22.680> some<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.070> other<00:03:23.220> challenges<00:03:23.520> like

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
were some of the other challenges like

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.180 
were some of the other challenges like
what<00:03:24.480> else<00:03:24.630> all<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.050> beautiful<00:03:25.500> workmanship

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
what else all this beautiful workmanship

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.949 
what else all this beautiful workmanship
up<00:03:26.370> here<00:03:26.580> what<00:03:26.760> else<00:03:26.910> did<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.270> you<00:03:27.570> fit<00:03:27.810> air

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
up here what else did you you fit air

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.360 
up here what else did you you fit air
conditioning<00:03:28.500> as<00:03:28.680> well<00:03:28.890> right

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
conditioning as well right

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.310 
conditioning as well right
air<00:03:29.670> conditioned<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.209> super<00:03:30.810> challenging

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
air conditioned is super challenging

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.440 
air conditioned is super challenging
because<00:03:31.890> there's<00:03:32.310> barely<00:03:32.580> room<00:03:32.670> for<00:03:32.850> radiator

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
because there's barely room for radiator

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.630 
because there's barely room for radiator
much<00:03:33.600> less<00:03:33.780> air<00:03:33.959> conditioned<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:34.680> see<00:03:34.890> how

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
much less air conditioned so you see how

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.490 
much less air conditioned so you see how
tight<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.360> air<00:03:36.450> conditioned<00:03:36.900> condenser<00:03:37.410> is

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
tight the air conditioned condenser is

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.520 
tight the air conditioned condenser is
package<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.250> actually<00:03:38.810> partially<00:03:39.810> covered<00:03:40.500> by

many jer advisor that wouldn't work and

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.810 
many jer advisor that wouldn't work and
I<00:03:50.590> told<00:03:50.890> them<00:03:51.010> what<00:03:51.070> I<00:03:51.280> thought<00:03:51.490> would<00:03:51.640> work

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
I told them what I thought would work

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.790 
I told them what I thought would work
respond<00:03:52.180> again<00:03:52.480> my<00:03:52.600> bear<00:03:52.780> broke<00:03:53.020> and<00:03:53.320> in<00:03:53.560> fact

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
respond again my bear broke and in fact

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.340 
respond again my bear broke and in fact
it<00:03:54.490> does<00:03:54.670> it<00:03:55.030> hit<00:03:55.240> carpool<00:03:55.810> strike

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
it does it hit carpool strike

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.210 
it does it hit carpool strike
that's<00:03:56.650> great<00:03:58.440> packaging<00:03:59.440> air<00:03:59.680> conditioning

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
that's great packaging air conditioning

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.890 
that's great packaging air conditioning
was<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.750> huge<00:04:02.400> decision<00:04:03.400> for<00:04:04.000> us<00:04:04.270> the<00:04:04.510> time<00:04:04.750> it

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
was a huge decision for us the time it

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.140 
was a huge decision for us the time it
because<00:04:05.140> everything<00:04:05.410> had<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.680> be<00:04:05.830> fabricated

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
because everything had to be fabricated

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.250 
because everything had to be fabricated
and<00:04:07.150> absolutely<00:04:07.570> everything<00:04:07.840> had<00:04:08.080> to<00:04:08.110> be

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
and absolutely everything had to be

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.710 
and absolutely everything had to be
fabricated<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:09.400> under<00:04:09.640> -<00:04:09.820> packaging<00:04:10.480> was

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
fabricated the under - packaging was

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.900 
fabricated the under - packaging was
very<00:04:11.020> very<00:04:11.140> difficult<00:04:11.380> -<00:04:11.800> so<00:04:12.130> I<00:04:12.520> actually

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
very very difficult - so I actually

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.030 
very very difficult - so I actually
don't<00:04:13.330> know<00:04:13.600> of<00:04:13.750> another<00:04:13.840> Marsh<00:04:14.560> miner

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
don't know of another Marsh miner

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.849 
don't know of another Marsh miner
that<00:04:15.460> has<00:04:15.930> air<00:04:16.930> conditioning<00:04:16.959> I<00:04:17.530> know<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.680> lot

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859

that has air conditioning I know a lot
of<00:04:17.890> people<00:04:18.190> have<00:04:18.280> attempted<00:04:18.519> it<00:04:18.790> and<00:04:18.940> then

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
of people have attempted it and then

there's some hot rods Morrison that have

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.130 
there's some hot rods Morrison that have
air<00:04:21.670> conditioning<00:04:22.210> literally<00:04:22.600> with<00:04:23.110> a

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140

cutaway firewall and just shoved
everything<00:04:25.720> back<00:04:26.230> and<00:04:26.560> then<00:04:26.650> they<00:04:26.860> fitted<00:04:27.370> air

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
everything back and then they fitted air

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.940 
everything back and then they fitted air
conditioning<00:04:28.000> in<00:04:28.120> that<00:04:28.270> those<00:04:28.630> cars<00:04:28.900> but<00:04:29.860> this

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
opened everything under the hood they

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.429 
opened everything under the hood they
actually<00:05:01.030> had<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.479> throttle<00:05:01.960> body<00:05:02.050> on<00:05:02.259> the

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
backside of Hannya now I see in its

backside of Hannya now I see in its
original<00:05:05.319> configuration<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:06.669> throttle<00:05:07.029> body

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
original configuration the throttle body

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.149 
original configuration the throttle body
because<00:05:07.449> it<00:05:07.569> was<00:05:07.659> transverse<00:05:08.199> to<00:05:08.770> be<00:05:08.919> on<00:05:09.039> the

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
because it was transverse to be on the

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.640 
because it was transverse to be on the
back<00:05:09.340> and<00:05:09.639> most<00:05:10.240> of<00:05:10.389> the<00:05:10.479> other<00:05:10.659> relatively

back and most of the other relatively
short<00:05:11.919> Japanese<00:05:12.490> engines<00:05:12.939> that<00:05:13.539> you<00:05:13.689> see<00:05:13.930> and

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
short Japanese engines that you see and

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.040 
short Japanese engines that you see and
I'm<00:05:14.259> 12<00:05:14.680> people<00:05:14.979> wonder<00:05:15.249> why<00:05:15.400> you<00:05:15.460> didn't<00:05:15.879> use

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
I'm 12 people wonder why you didn't use

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.100 
I'm 12 people wonder why you didn't use
other<00:05:17.050> things<00:05:18.360> have<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.449> distributor<00:05:19.960> at<00:05:20.020> the

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
other things have the distributor at the

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.689 
other things have the distributor at the
back<00:05:20.289> of<00:05:20.439> the<00:05:20.499> cylinder<00:05:20.830> head<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.310> reason

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
back of the cylinder head the reason

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.519 
back of the cylinder head the reason
that<00:05:22.330> is<00:05:22.599> because<00:05:22.990> they're<00:05:23.289> kind<00:05:23.469> of

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:23.529 
that is because they're kind of

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:25.350 
that is because they're kind of
personally<00:05:23.800> mounted<00:05:24.129> that<00:05:24.550> there's<00:05:25.060> plenty

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
personally mounted that there's plenty

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.629 
personally mounted that there's plenty
of<00:05:25.389> room<00:05:25.599> so<00:05:26.439> you<00:05:26.499> just<00:05:26.800> drive<00:05:27.009> distributor

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
of room so you just drive distributor

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.070 
of room so you just drive distributor
off<00:05:27.759> one<00:05:27.939> of<00:05:28.029> the<00:05:28.090> camshafts<00:05:28.659> because<00:05:28.930> it's

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
off one of the camshafts because it's

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.050 
off one of the camshafts because it's
turning<00:05:29.379> the<00:05:29.439> right<00:05:29.590> speed<00:05:29.830> anyway<00:05:30.099> and<00:05:30.400> there

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
turning the right speed anyway and there

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.089 
turning the right speed anyway and there
you<00:05:31.150> go<00:05:31.330> but<00:05:31.629> if<00:05:31.870> you<00:05:31.900> try<00:05:32.229> to<00:05:32.259> package<00:05:32.830> this

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
you go but if you try to package this

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.070 
you go but if you try to package this
whether<00:05:33.460> the<00:05:33.610> shrimp<00:05:33.819> are<00:05:34.090> at<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.240> back<00:05:34.449> and

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
whether the shrimp are at the back and

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.439 
whether the shrimp are at the back and
you<00:05:35.259> know<00:05:35.469> you've<00:05:35.680> got<00:05:35.889> to<00:05:36.099> you've<00:05:36.939> got<00:05:37.120> to<00:05:37.270> cut

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
you know you've got to you've got to cut

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.320 
you know you've got to you've got to cut
away<00:05:37.539> too<00:05:37.870> much<00:05:37.990> of<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.229> car<00:05:38.469> so<00:05:39.129> this<00:05:40.060> engine

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
away too much of the car so this engine

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.480 
away too much of the car so this engine
because<00:05:40.930> of<00:05:41.080> sugar<00:05:41.259> comes<00:05:41.620> out<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:41.919> side<00:05:42.129> and

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
because of sugar comes out the side and

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.879 
because of sugar comes out the side and
I'm<00:05:43.120> absolutely<00:05:43.330> maxed<00:05:44.139> out<00:05:44.289> for<00:05:44.529> clearance

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
I'm absolutely maxed out for clearance

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.100 
I'm absolutely maxed out for clearance
toward<00:05:45.159> the<00:05:45.250> hood<00:05:45.460> at<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:46.210> back<00:05:46.419> and<00:05:46.719> then<00:05:47.080> I

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
toward the hood at the back and then I

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.890 
toward the hood at the back and then I
actually<00:05:47.469> had<00:05:47.830> you<00:05:48.009> to<00:05:48.939> change<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:49.539> way<00:05:49.689> the

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
actually had you to change the way the

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.869 
actually had you to change the way the
water<00:05:50.080> flows<00:05:50.199> for<00:05:50.710> heater<00:05:50.889> and<00:05:51.219> such<00:05:51.490> because

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:51.879 
water flows for heater and such because

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:54.149 
water flows for heater and such because
there's<00:05:52.089> there's<00:05:52.419> normally<00:05:52.810> water<00:05:53.050> bowing<00:05:54.009> on

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
there's there's normally water bowing on

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:58.529 
there's there's normally water bowing on
the<00:05:54.250> back<00:05:54.400> of<00:05:54.550> the<00:05:54.639> motor<00:05:54.849> and<00:05:57.029> to<00:05:58.029> package<00:05:58.449> the

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
the back of the motor and to package the

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.619 
the back of the motor and to package the
engine<00:05:58.839> even<00:05:58.930> shorter<00:05:59.499> and<00:06:00.159> i<00:06:00.249> used<00:06:00.629> toyota

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:01.629 
engine even shorter and i used toyota

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:06.269 
engine even shorter and i used toyota
mr2<00:06:03.029> police<00:06:04.050> because<00:06:05.050> they're<00:06:05.229> thinner<00:06:05.529> to

get the maximum amount of clearance for
the<00:06:08.560> radiator<00:06:08.949> so<00:06:09.699> all<00:06:09.879> the<00:06:10.000> drive<00:06:10.240> system<00:06:10.569> is

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
the radiator so all the drive system is

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.249 
the radiator so all the drive system is
driving<00:06:12.089> all<00:06:13.089> these<00:06:13.330> pulleys<00:06:13.659> is<00:06:13.899> actually

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259 
driving all these pulleys is actually

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.619 
driving all these pulleys is actually

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:16.629 
mr2 in Florida you just didn't have

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:18.389 
mr2 in Florida you just didn't have
enough<00:06:16.870> room<00:06:17.080> for<00:06:17.379> anything<00:06:17.560> thicker<00:06:18.129> than<00:06:18.370> a

enough room for anything thicker than a

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:21.420 
enough room for anything thicker than a
and<00:06:19.389> what<00:06:19.839> about<00:06:20.020> mounting<00:06:20.589> it<00:06:20.710> how<00:06:21.099> did<00:06:21.159> you

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
and what about mounting it how did you

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.459 
and what about mounting it how did you
fabricate<00:06:21.879> the<00:06:22.330> mounts<00:06:22.719> for<00:06:22.899> this<00:06:25.469> Toyota

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469 
fabricate the mounts for this Toyota

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.829 
fabricate the mounts for this Toyota
Corolla<00:06:27.099> GTS<00:06:27.610> like<00:06:27.849> an<00:06:27.969> 8<00:06:28.149> and<00:06:28.300> 5<00:06:28.509> the

00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:28.839 
Corolla GTS like an 8 and 5 the

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:29.970 
Corolla GTS like an 8 and 5 the
longitudinal<00:06:29.589> mode

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:29.980 
longitudinal mode

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.460 
longitudinal mode
mounting<00:06:30.460> system<00:06:30.850> I've<00:06:31.120> used<00:06:31.390> none<00:06:32.230> of<00:06:32.320> those

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
mounting system I've used none of those

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.310 
mounting system I've used none of those
brackets<00:06:33.070> and<00:06:33.220> mounts<00:06:33.610> on<00:06:34.540> the<00:06:34.780> engine<00:06:35.140> and

brackets and mounts on the engine and

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.310 
brackets and mounts on the engine and
actually<00:06:36.040> a<00:06:36.280> Corolla<00:06:36.670> GTS<00:06:37.180> exhaust<00:06:37.780> manifold

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
actually a Corolla GTS exhaust manifold

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.740 
actually a Corolla GTS exhaust manifold
off<00:06:38.500> in<00:06:38.650> 85<00:06:39.070> core<00:06:39.370> because<00:06:40.180> that<00:06:40.360> car<00:06:40.600> was

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
off in 85 core because that car was

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.960 
off in 85 core because that car was
longitudinal<00:06:41.380> and<00:06:41.620> then<00:06:42.250> fabricated

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
longitudinal and then fabricated

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.440 
longitudinal and then fabricated
brackets<00:06:43.390> to<00:06:43.600> go<00:06:43.750> to<00:06:43.810> the<00:06:44.230> to<00:06:44.860> the<00:06:45.070> unibody<00:06:45.880> on

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.450 
brackets to go to the to the unibody on

brackets to go to the to the unibody on
this<00:06:47.140> car<00:06:47.410> and<00:06:48.190> that<00:06:48.640> part<00:06:49.030> was<00:06:49.180> pretty<00:06:49.270> easy

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
this car and that part was pretty easy

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.390 
this car and that part was pretty easy
how<00:06:50.140> long<00:06:50.320> did<00:06:50.470> it<00:06:50.590> take<00:06:50.650> you<00:06:50.950> for<00:06:51.310> this

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
how long did it take you for this
