to put things into nature there

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.589 
to put things into nature there
we<00:00:18.800> all<00:00:19.009> have<00:00:19.550> started<00:00:19.880> out<00:00:19.970> drawing<00:00:20.150> trees

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
we all have started out drawing trees

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.560 
we all have started out drawing trees
like<00:00:21.160> this<00:00:22.420> okay

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.939 

lots<00:00:26.570> of<00:00:26.689> people<00:00:26.929> draw<00:00:27.109> trees<00:00:27.349> like<00:00:27.589> that<00:00:27.619> some

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
lots of people draw trees like that some

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.409 
lots of people draw trees like that some
people<00:00:28.160> draw<00:00:28.339> trees<00:00:28.699> depending<00:00:29.210> on<00:00:29.300> the

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
people draw trees depending on the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.109 
people draw trees depending on the
season<00:00:29.839> like<00:00:29.990> that<00:00:30.550> okay<00:00:31.550> that's<00:00:31.730> good<00:00:31.910> for

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
season like that okay that's good for

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.790 
season like that okay that's good for
sketching<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:32.870> you<00:00:33.050> know<00:00:33.140> getting<00:00:33.410> an<00:00:33.500> idea

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
sketching and you know getting an idea

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.930 
sketching and you know getting an idea
basically<00:00:34.370> you<00:00:34.430> know<00:00:34.520> real<00:00:34.790> quick<00:00:35.000> you<00:00:35.330> know

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
basically you know real quick you know

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.850 
basically you know real quick you know
we're<00:00:37.940> gonna<00:00:38.030> have<00:00:38.120> the<00:00:38.390> forest<00:00:38.900> but<00:00:39.470> let's

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
we're gonna have the forest but let's

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.590 
we're gonna have the forest but let's
not<00:00:40.010> try<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:40.430> draw<00:00:40.610> trees<00:00:40.970> like<00:00:41.180> this<00:00:41.330> anymore

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
not try and draw trees like this anymore

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.990 
not try and draw trees like this anymore
for<00:00:41.900> finished<00:00:42.200> artwork<00:00:42.490> one<00:00:43.490> technique<00:00:43.940> for

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
for finished artwork one technique for

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.160 
for finished artwork one technique for
drawing<00:00:44.510> trees<00:00:45.080> and<00:00:45.950> this<00:00:46.460> will<00:00:46.610> be<00:00:46.730> a<00:00:47.420> very

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
drawing trees and this will be a very

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.550 
drawing trees and this will be a very
big<00:00:48.350> leafy<00:00:48.740> tree<00:00:49.010> is<00:00:49.690> we<00:00:50.690> start<00:00:51.020> drawing<00:00:51.350> the

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
big leafy tree is we start drawing the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.120 
big leafy tree is we start drawing the
trunk<00:00:51.980> okay<00:00:52.910> and<00:00:53.540> then<00:00:54.290> eventually<00:00:54.560> the<00:00:54.830> trunk

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
trunk okay and then eventually the trunk

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.520 
trunk okay and then eventually the trunk
starts<00:00:55.520> growing<00:00:55.760> up<00:00:56.110> into<00:00:57.110> the<00:00:57.200> various

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
starts growing up into the various

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.160 
starts growing up into the various
branches<00:00:58.570> okay<00:01:01.390> they<00:01:02.390> come<00:01:02.660> out<00:01:02.810> at<00:01:02.990> different

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
branches okay they come out at different

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.259 
branches okay they come out at different
angles<00:01:03.770> and<00:01:04.070> you<00:01:04.400> know<00:01:04.820> they<00:01:05.059> have<00:01:05.239> a

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
angles and you know they have a

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.200 
angles and you know they have a
different<00:01:05.720> mount<00:01:05.869> of<00:01:05.960> weight<00:01:06.200> on<00:01:06.820> them<00:01:07.820> and

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
different mount of weight on them and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.550 
different mount of weight on them and
you<00:01:08.930> know<00:01:09.020> they're<00:01:09.140> carrying<00:01:09.410> different

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
you know they're carrying different

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.320 
you know they're carrying different
loads<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:10.280> they<00:01:10.400> might<00:01:10.550> be<00:01:10.580> bending<00:01:11.090> or<00:01:11.240> they

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
loads so they might be bending or they

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.580 
loads so they might be bending or they
might<00:01:11.480> be<00:01:11.540> thicker<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:12.110> they<00:01:12.200> still<00:01:12.440> keep

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
might be thicker and they still keep

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.750 
might be thicker and they still keep
growing<00:01:12.980> up<00:01:13.130> like<00:01:13.940> that<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:15.200> want<00:01:15.650> to<00:01:15.740> as<00:01:16.040> a

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
growing up like that so you want to as a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.430 
growing up like that so you want to as a
start<00:01:17.240> if<00:01:17.390> you're<00:01:17.480> working<00:01:17.690> in<00:01:17.870> pencil<00:01:18.320> I

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
start if you're working in pencil I

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.870 
start if you're working in pencil I
can't<00:01:18.710> do<00:01:18.890> this<00:01:19.010> I'm<00:01:19.190> not<00:01:19.280> doing<00:01:19.400> this<00:01:19.610> one<00:01:19.790> in

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
can't do this I'm not doing this one in

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.280 
can't do this I'm not doing this one in
my<00:01:20.000> marker<00:01:20.360> anymore<00:01:20.659> I'm<00:01:20.750> doing<00:01:20.930> this<00:01:21.020> one<00:01:21.170> in

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
my marker anymore I'm doing this one in

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.490 
my marker anymore I'm doing this one in
pencil<00:01:21.680> but<00:01:22.490> at<00:01:22.580> least<00:01:22.670> we<00:01:22.880> have<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.120> start<00:01:23.570> you

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
pencil but at least we have a start you

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.540 
pencil but at least we have a start you
know<00:01:24.560> it's<00:01:24.710> a<00:01:24.770> little<00:01:24.950> bit<00:01:25.040> more<00:01:25.159> realistic

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
know it's a little bit more realistic

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.170 
know it's a little bit more realistic
looking<00:01:26.000> tree<00:01:26.440> and<00:01:27.440> what<00:01:27.650> you<00:01:27.770> do<00:01:27.920> after<00:01:28.220> this

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
looking tree and what you do after this

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.290 
looking tree and what you do after this
if<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.540> isn't<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.840> winter<00:01:30.170> scene<00:01:30.470> or<00:01:31.030> early<00:01:32.030> fall

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
if it isn't a winter scene or early fall

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.760 
if it isn't a winter scene or early fall
that<00:01:32.570> kind<00:01:32.810> of<00:01:32.840> thing<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.020> can<00:01:33.229> start<00:01:33.500> erasing

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
that kind of thing you can start erasing

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.270 
that kind of thing you can start erasing
out<00:01:34.450> areas<00:01:35.450> where<00:01:36.440> we're<00:01:36.590> gonna<00:01:36.680> start<00:01:37.040> seeing

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
out areas where we're gonna start seeing

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.950 
out areas where we're gonna start seeing
a<00:01:37.430> lot<00:01:37.580> of<00:01:37.640> leaves<00:01:37.990> okay<00:01:40.479> and<00:01:42.580> we<00:01:43.580> can<00:01:43.960> look

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
a lot of leaves okay and we can look

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.380 
a lot of leaves okay and we can look
through<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.530> branches<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.370> see<00:01:46.670> different

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
through the branches and see different

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.719 
through the branches and see different
formations<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:49.040> branches<00:01:49.490> in<00:01:49.640> the

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
formations of the branches in the

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.620 
formations of the branches in the
background<00:01:50.470> okay<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:54.140> then<00:01:54.590> you'll<00:01:55.479> kind<00:01:56.479> of

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
background okay and then you'll kind of

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:06.480 
background okay and then you'll kind of
draw<00:01:57.590> in<00:01:57.650> these<00:01:57.920> big<00:01:58.190> patches<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:59.770> leaves

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.440 

okay<00:02:07.490> we're<00:02:07.670> trying<00:02:07.789> to<00:02:07.939> make<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:08.209> look<00:02:08.390> a

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
okay we're trying to make this look a

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.759 
okay we're trying to make this look a
little<00:02:08.660> more<00:02:08.869> realistic<00:02:12.700> alright<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:15.500> you'll

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
little more realistic alright and you'll

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.390 
little more realistic alright and you'll
always<00:02:15.980> see<00:02:17.230> branches<00:02:18.230> popping<00:02:19.010> through<00:02:19.220> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
always see branches popping through the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.839 
always see branches popping through the
leaves<00:02:20.050> okay<00:02:23.170> alright<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.200> then<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.849> can

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
leaves okay alright and then you can

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.600 
leaves okay alright and then you can
shadow<00:02:26.120> these<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.720> some<00:02:26.959> extent<00:02:27.519> on<00:02:28.519> the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
shadow these to some extent on the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.520 
shadow these to some extent on the
bottom<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.090> Sun's<00:02:29.360> up<00:02:29.510> here<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:30.319> course

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
bottom of the Sun's up here of course

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:44.699 
bottom of the Sun's up here of course
and<00:02:38.769> again<00:02:39.769> this<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.190> just<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.459> quick<00:02:40.700> treatment

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.750 

of<00:02:45.709> what<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:47.440> nice<00:02:48.440> big<00:02:48.709> leafy<00:02:49.160> tree<00:02:49.430> would<00:02:49.580> look

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
of what a nice big leafy tree would look

00:02:49.760 --> 00:03:03.930 
of what a nice big leafy tree would look
like

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.980 

okay<00:03:04.940> so<00:03:05.000> you<00:03:05.180> can<00:03:05.390> see<00:03:05.570> we<00:03:05.690> have<00:03:05.870> the

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
okay so you can see we have the

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.790 
okay so you can see we have the
highlights<00:03:06.470> on<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.680> tops<00:03:07.040> of<00:03:07.280> the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
highlights on the tops of the

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.250 
highlights on the tops of the
collections<00:03:09.800> of<00:03:09.980> leaves<00:03:10.280> here<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:11.210> yet<00:03:12.080> there

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
collections of leaves here and yet there

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.960 
collections of leaves here and yet there
is<00:03:12.410> some<00:03:13.120> dark<00:03:14.120> areas<00:03:14.950> for<00:03:15.950> shadow<00:03:16.400> where<00:03:16.820> you

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
is some dark areas for shadow where you

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.680 
is some dark areas for shadow where you
have<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.230> undergrowth<00:03:18.800> or<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:20.030> bottom<00:03:20.390> sides

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
have the undergrowth or the bottom sides

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.520 
have the undergrowth or the bottom sides
of<00:03:20.900> all<00:03:21.080> these<00:03:21.910> formations<00:03:23.380> all<00:03:24.380> these

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
of all these formations all these

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.770 
of all these formations all these
different<00:03:24.920> groupings<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:26.330> we<00:03:26.420> still<00:03:26.660> see<00:03:26.900> the

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
different groupings and we still see the

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.300 
different groupings and we still see the
still<00:03:29.780> see<00:03:29.960> some<00:03:30.230> of<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.380> branches<00:03:30.650> popping

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
still see some of the branches popping

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.360 
still see some of the branches popping
through<00:03:31.960> and<00:03:32.960> other<00:03:33.200> elements<00:03:33.470> in<00:03:33.770> you<00:03:34.190> might

through and other elements in you might

you're<00:03:48.560> looking<00:03:48.680> at<00:03:49.010> things<00:03:49.370> much<00:03:49.850> closer<00:03:50.150> to

you're looking at things much closer to
you<00:03:50.540> our<00:03:50.750> darker<00:03:51.350> and<00:03:51.560> things<00:03:52.280> much<00:03:52.490> further

you our darker and things much further

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.320 
you our darker and things much further
away<00:03:53.140> tend<00:03:54.140> to<00:03:54.230> be<00:03:54.410> lighter<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:55.820> you<00:03:55.880> know<00:03:56.180> like

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
away tend to be lighter so you know like

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
on the time of day it could be you know

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.810 
on the time of day it could be you know
like<00:04:02.630> a<00:04:02.690> very<00:04:02.930> light<00:04:03.230> pale<00:04:03.680> Bluegreen<00:04:04.130> way

vibrant green this of course will all
get<00:04:11.690> darker<00:04:12.440> and<00:04:12.560> through<00:04:12.770> here<00:04:13.160> you<00:04:13.880> know<00:04:14.000> and

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
airplanes so you know they're always

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.980 
airplanes so you know they're always

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.580 

particularly<00:04:37.850> cumulus<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:39.350> know<00:04:39.440> this

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
particularly cumulus and you know this

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.340 
particularly cumulus and you know this
is<00:04:39.710> where<00:04:39.890> you<00:04:39.919> actually<00:04:40.610> get<00:04:40.970> a<00:04:41.240> little<00:04:42.200> more

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
is where you actually get a little more

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.850 
is where you actually get a little more
creative<00:04:42.590> and<00:04:43.130> you<00:04:44.060> can<00:04:44.210> go<00:04:44.360> out<00:04:44.620> spend<00:04:45.620> some

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
creative and you can go out spend some

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.500 
creative and you can go out spend some
time<00:04:46.070> looking<00:04:46.340> at<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:46.520> clouds<00:04:46.760> typically<00:04:47.390> you

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
time looking at the clouds typically you

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.310 
time looking at the clouds typically you
know<00:04:47.600> they're<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:48.860> nice<00:04:49.370> big<00:04:49.610> cumulus<00:04:50.180> and<00:04:50.450> the

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
know they're a nice big cumulus and the

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.620 
know they're a nice big cumulus and the
darker<00:04:51.710> areas<00:04:52.040> on<00:04:52.190> a<00:04:52.220> cloud<00:04:52.520> are<00:04:52.760> usually<00:04:53.180> from

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
darker areas on a cloud are usually from

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.720 
darker areas on a cloud are usually from
being<00:04:54.320> in<00:04:54.440> shadow<00:04:54.710> from<00:04:55.010> clouds<00:04:55.280> ahead<00:04:55.580> of

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
them closest to the Sun and you've got

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.790 
them closest to the Sun and you've got
the<00:04:58.730> dark<00:04:58.940> areas<00:04:59.270> down<00:04:59.480> there<00:04:59.780> and<00:05:00.080> there's

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
the dark areas down there and there's

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.130 
the dark areas down there and there's
always<00:05:00.950> some<00:05:01.280> little<00:05:01.430> wisp<00:05:01.850> of<00:05:02.090> gray<00:05:02.480> floating

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
always some little wisp of gray floating

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.720 
always some little wisp of gray floating
through<00:05:03.380> there<00:05:03.620> because<00:05:03.860> it<00:05:04.130> got<00:05:04.310> knocked<00:05:04.550> out

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
through there because it got knocked out

up sketching real quick some really nice

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.240 
up sketching real quick some really nice
cloud<00:05:14.810> scapes<00:05:15.200> as<00:05:15.380> well<00:05:15.590> and<00:05:15.740> they<00:05:15.830> fit<00:05:16.070> real

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
cloud scapes as well and they fit real

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.570 
cloud scapes as well and they fit real
good<00:05:16.280> in

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
good in

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.059 
good in
to<00:05:16.639> backgrounds<00:05:17.470> any<00:05:18.470> kind<00:05:18.740> of<00:05:18.800> thing<00:05:18.919> and

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
again remember you know that's the

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.950 
again remember you know that's the
closer<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:21.470> you<00:05:21.620> they<00:05:22.340> are<00:05:22.750> they're<00:05:23.750> a<00:05:23.780> little

closer to you they are they're a little

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.320 
closer to you they are they're a little
bit<00:05:24.080> darker<00:05:24.470> and<00:05:24.590> they'll<00:05:24.710> be<00:05:25.000> much<00:05:26.000> lighter

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
bit darker and they'll be much lighter

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
in the in the background and depending

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.730 
in the in the background and depending
on<00:05:29.180> the<00:05:29.330> type<00:05:29.509> on<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:29.870> time<00:05:30.080> of<00:05:30.110> day<00:05:30.409> you<00:05:30.469> know

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
on the type on the time of day you know

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.709 
on the type on the time of day you know
the<00:05:30.919> atmosphere<00:05:31.250> exchange<00:05:32.150> colors<00:05:32.509> on

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:32.719 
the atmosphere exchange colors on

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:34.209 
the atmosphere exchange colors on
everything<00:05:33.020> in<00:05:33.110> fact<00:05:33.319> trees<00:05:33.620> can<00:05:33.860> even<00:05:34.069> take

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
everything in fact trees can even take

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.159 
everything in fact trees can even take
kind<00:05:34.460> of<00:05:34.520> an<00:05:34.610> orange<00:05:34.789> tint<00:05:35.150> even<00:05:36.080> though

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
kind of an orange tint even though

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.589 
kind of an orange tint even though
they're<00:05:36.349> green<00:05:36.560> a<00:05:36.830> reddish<00:05:37.610> tint<00:05:37.849> the<00:05:38.180> tops<00:05:38.449> of

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
they're green a reddish tint the tops of

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.330 
they're green a reddish tint the tops of
the<00:05:38.719> trees<00:05:38.870> as<00:05:39.169> the<00:05:39.349> Sun<00:05:39.530> is<00:05:39.650> going<00:05:39.830> down<00:05:40.129> you

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
the trees as the Sun is going down you

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.369 
the trees as the Sun is going down you
know<00:05:40.370> the<00:05:40.520> tops<00:05:40.759> are<00:05:41.479> hit<00:05:41.750> with<00:05:41.780> sunlight<00:05:42.110> and

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:42.379 
know the tops are hit with sunlight and

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.740 
know the tops are hit with sunlight and
then<00:05:42.680> eventually<00:05:43.069> they<00:05:43.159> all<00:05:43.419> changed<00:05:44.419> through

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
then eventually they all changed through

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.129 
then eventually they all changed through
but<00:05:46.300> you<00:05:47.300> know<00:05:47.419> it's<00:05:47.539> the<00:05:47.629> same<00:05:47.780> thing<00:05:47.840> with

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
but you know it's the same thing with

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.040 
but you know it's the same thing with
clouds<00:05:48.439> and<00:05:48.800> clouds<00:05:49.009> even<00:05:49.430> get<00:05:49.580> all<00:05:50.539> kinds<00:05:51.020> of

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
clouds and clouds even get all kinds of

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.290 
clouds and clouds even get all kinds of
different<00:05:51.259> reds<00:05:51.860> and<00:05:52.099> oranges<00:05:52.280> there's<00:05:53.240> a

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
different reds and oranges there's a

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.899 
different reds and oranges there's a
color<00:05:53.539> carmine<00:05:54.139> which<00:05:54.319> is<00:05:54.469> a<00:05:54.500> really<00:05:54.710> nice

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:54.909 
color carmine which is a really nice

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:58.469 
color carmine which is a really nice
color<00:05:55.909> to<00:05:56.090> use<00:05:56.270> for<00:05:56.860> cloud<00:05:57.860> scapes

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
color to use for cloud scapes

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.330 
color to use for cloud scapes
you<00:05:59.479> know<00:05:59.539> it's<00:05:59.690> it's<00:05:59.930> fun<00:06:00.139> just<00:06:00.379> getting<00:06:00.590> out

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
you know it's it's fun just getting out

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.740 
you know it's it's fun just getting out
and<00:06:01.370> sometimes<00:06:01.789> just<00:06:01.969> sketching<00:06:02.449> and<00:06:02.629> you

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
and sometimes just sketching and you

and sometimes just sketching and you
know<00:06:02.840> filling<00:06:03.319> up<00:06:03.409> a<00:06:03.500> page<00:06:03.740> with<00:06:03.979> this<00:06:04.159> kind<00:06:04.430> of

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
know filling up a page with this kind of

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.390 
know filling up a page with this kind of
thing<00:06:04.669> so<00:06:05.000> that's<00:06:05.870> a<00:06:06.020> basic<00:06:06.250> lesson<00:06:07.250> in

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
thing so that's a basic lesson in

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.449 
thing so that's a basic lesson in
landscape<00:06:07.909> art<00:06:08.300> work
