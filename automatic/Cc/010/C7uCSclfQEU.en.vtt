hi I'm Fraser from the rugged guide and

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.940 
hi I'm Fraser from the rugged guide and
we're<00:00:07.330> gonna<00:00:07.420> be<00:00:07.540> looking<00:00:07.600> at<00:00:07.840> fitting<00:00:08.620> a<00:00:08.770> rev

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:08.950 
we're gonna be looking at fitting a rev

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.549 
we're gonna be looking at fitting a rev
counter<00:00:09.130> today<00:00:09.370> we're<00:00:09.820> going<00:00:09.969> to<00:00:10.030> fit<00:00:10.240> this

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
counter today we're going to fit this

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.379 
counter today we're going to fit this
Durai<00:00:11.559> unit<00:00:12.250> into<00:00:12.700> the<00:00:12.730> dashboard

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
it's a fifty-two millimeter unit so it

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:16.590 
it's a fifty-two millimeter unit so it
should<00:00:15.490> slot<00:00:15.700> in<00:00:15.850> exactly<00:00:16.180> the<00:00:16.270> same<00:00:16.450> position

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
should slot in exactly the same position

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.490 
should slot in exactly the same position
it's<00:00:17.289> also<00:00:17.410> suitable<00:00:17.860> for<00:00:18.750> four<00:00:19.750> six<00:00:20.289> and

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
eight cylinder vehicles and obviously

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.700 
eight cylinder vehicles and obviously
we've<00:00:22.750> got<00:00:22.780> an<00:00:22.960> eight<00:00:23.050> cylinder<00:00:23.170> vehicle

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
we've got an eight cylinder vehicle

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.900 
we've got an eight cylinder vehicle
being<00:00:23.920> the<00:00:23.980> v8<00:00:24.280> so<00:00:24.490> we're<00:00:24.580> going<00:00:24.700> to<00:00:24.760> switch

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
being the v8 so we're going to switch

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.970 
being the v8 so we're going to switch
over<00:00:25.030> to<00:00:25.150> there<00:00:25.390> and<00:00:25.660> it's<00:00:25.960> 12<00:00:26.230> volt<00:00:26.500> negative

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
over to there and it's 12 volt negative

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.160 
over to there and it's 12 volt negative
ground<00:00:27.280> so<00:00:27.670> we've<00:00:28.180> got<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.390> right<00:00:28.540> bit<00:00:28.840> of<00:00:28.960> kit

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
ground so we've got the right bit of kit

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
ground so we've got the right bit of kit
and<00:00:29.590> we're<00:00:29.710> going<00:00:29.830> to<00:00:29.890> give<00:00:30.040> you<00:00:30.070> a

procedures to take your dash apart take

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.740 
procedures to take your dash apart take
out<00:00:36.100> the<00:00:36.219> old<00:00:36.309> unit<00:00:36.610> fitting<00:00:37.180> this<00:00:37.329> unit<00:00:37.600> into

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
out the old unit fitting this unit into

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.540 
out the old unit fitting this unit into
the<00:00:37.900> dash<00:00:38.079> and<00:00:38.410> actually<00:00:38.829> connecting<00:00:39.310> it<00:00:39.400> up

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
the dash and actually connecting it up

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.610 
the dash and actually connecting it up
to<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.120> vehicle<00:00:40.300> so<00:00:40.870> you<00:00:40.900> can<00:00:40.990> get<00:00:41.320> an

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
to the vehicle so you can get an

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.720 
to the vehicle so you can get an
accurate<00:00:41.770> reading<00:00:42.100> from<00:00:42.310> your<00:00:42.400> rev<00:00:42.579> counter

accurate reading from your rev counter

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.790 
accurate reading from your rev counter
so<00:00:43.060> we'll<00:00:43.180> get<00:00:43.300> started<00:00:43.660> so<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.380> first<00:00:44.470> thing

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
so we'll get started so the first thing

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.380 
so we'll get started so the first thing
we<00:00:44.860> need<00:00:44.980> to<00:00:45.010> do<00:00:45.130> is<00:00:45.489> disconnect<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:46.030> battery

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
with the steering wheel that I've learnt

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.870 
with the steering wheel that I've learnt
from<00:01:01.710> mechanic<00:01:02.710> friend<00:01:02.890> of<00:01:02.950> mine<00:01:03.100> is<00:01:03.550> just<00:01:03.790> a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
from mechanic friend of mine is just a

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.240 
from mechanic friend of mine is just a
rocket<00:01:04.180> from<00:01:04.299> left<00:01:04.509> left<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.320> right<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:06.070> try

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
rocket from left left to right to try

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.560 
rocket from left left to right to try
and<00:01:06.340> loosen<00:01:06.460> it<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:06.759> you<00:01:06.850> bang<00:01:07.240> it<00:01:07.390> on<00:01:07.509> the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
and loosen it and you bang it on the

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:15.120 
and loosen it and you bang it on the
right<00:01:08.200> side<00:01:08.229> so<00:01:08.710> like<00:01:08.829> this<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:14.530> we<00:01:14.620> go<00:01:14.740> and

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
right side so like this there we go and

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.010 
right side so like this there we go and
it<00:01:15.250> just<00:01:15.280> comes<00:01:15.580> off<00:01:15.760> just<00:01:16.390> removing<00:01:16.930> the

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
it just comes off just removing the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.609 
it just comes off just removing the
screws<00:01:17.440> on<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:17.740> main<00:01:17.950> panel<00:01:18.250> on<00:01:18.430> both<00:01:18.700> sides

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
screws on the main panel on both sides

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.740 
screws on the main panel on both sides
these<00:01:20.619> have<00:01:20.740> been<00:01:20.830> off<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:20.979> few<00:01:21.280> times<00:01:21.750> and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
these have been off a few times and

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.940 
these have been off a few times and
you'll<00:01:22.960> probably<00:01:23.110> find<00:01:23.440> that<00:01:23.590> some<00:01:23.799> of<00:01:23.890> the

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
you'll probably find that some of the

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.410 
you'll probably find that some of the
plastics<00:01:24.369> broken<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:27.130> be<00:01:27.250> careful<00:01:27.940> that<00:01:28.390> the

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
plastics broken just be careful that the

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.969 
plastics broken just be careful that the
little<00:01:28.720> retaining<00:01:29.170> Clips<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.740> metal

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
little retaining Clips the metal

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.840 
little retaining Clips the metal
retaining<00:01:30.310> clips<00:01:30.549> don't<00:01:31.510> disappear<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.700> need

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
retaining clips don't disappear you need

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.410 
retaining clips don't disappear you need
to<00:01:33.939> loosen<00:01:34.470> two<00:01:35.470> screws<00:01:35.770> on<00:01:35.890> each<00:01:36.010> side<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
to loosen two screws on each side and

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.320 
to loosen two screws on each side and
one<00:01:37.659> at<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:38.049> base<00:01:38.229> in<00:01:38.560> each<00:01:38.799> corner<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:40.119> now<00:01:40.270> we

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
one at the base in each corner so now we

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.580 
one at the base in each corner so now we
should<00:01:40.479> be<00:01:40.600> able<00:01:40.689> to<00:01:40.840> lift<00:01:41.110> this<00:01:41.320> forward

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
should be able to lift this forward

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.520 
should be able to lift this forward
slightly<00:01:42.750> there<00:01:43.750> we<00:01:43.810> go<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.590> you'll<00:01:44.770> see<00:01:44.950> that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
slightly there we go and you'll see that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.980 
slightly there we go and you'll see that
in<00:01:47.530> here<00:01:47.920> we've<00:01:48.820> got<00:01:49.000> our<00:01:49.060> speedo<00:01:49.540> cable<00:01:49.570> we

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
in here we've got our speedo cable we

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.270 
in here we've got our speedo cable we
need<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.170> disconnect<00:01:50.320> that<00:01:50.590> which<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.040> just

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
need to disconnect that which is just

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.929 
need to disconnect that which is just
you<00:01:51.700> just<00:01:51.820> twist<00:01:52.119> it<00:01:52.240> off<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:53.820> there's<00:01:54.820> your

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
you just twist it off and there's your

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.640 
you just twist it off and there's your
speedo<00:01:55.180> cable<00:01:55.270> there<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:56.080> just<00:01:56.110> pull<00:01:56.470> straight

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
speedo cable there I just pull straight

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.679 
speedo cable there I just pull straight
off<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.280> then<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.729> units<00:01:58.060> actually<00:01:58.240> quite

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
off and then the units actually quite

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.690 
off and then the units actually quite
free<00:01:59.640> okay<00:02:00.640> so<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.180> actually<00:02:01.540> remove<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.990> unit

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
free okay so to actually remove the unit

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.359 
free okay so to actually remove the unit
that's<00:02:03.700> my<00:02:03.909> lamp<00:02:04.150> fitting<00:02:04.890> which<00:02:05.890> we<00:02:06.009> can<00:02:06.159> use

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
that's my lamp fitting which we can use

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.130 
that's my lamp fitting which we can use
hopefully<00:02:06.790> on<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:06.909> other<00:02:07.060> one<00:02:07.180> there's<00:02:08.049> a

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
hopefully on the other one there's a

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.240 
hopefully on the other one there's a
little<00:02:08.349> screw<00:02:09.099> here<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:10.569> we<00:02:10.720> just<00:02:11.680> loosen

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
little screw here that we just loosen

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.520 
little screw here that we just loosen
off<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:12.700> will<00:02:12.879> allow<00:02:12.970> us<00:02:13.239> to<00:02:13.380> remove<00:02:14.380> the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
off and this will allow us to remove the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.790 
off and this will allow us to remove the
unit<00:02:14.970> through<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.810> dash

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
unit through the dash

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.340 
unit through the dash
these<00:02:18.700> wires<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.240> ones<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.870> were<00:02:19.960> connected

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
these wires the ones that were connected

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
these wires the ones that were connected
to<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.470> voltmeter<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:20.950> we're<00:02:21.040> going<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.220> use

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
to the voltmeter so we're going to use

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.290 
to the voltmeter so we're going to use
those<00:02:21.520> again<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:24.490> there<00:02:24.610> we<00:02:24.640> go<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.030> unit

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
those again and there we go the unit

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.030 
those again and there we go the unit
just<00:02:25.450> comes<00:02:25.630> out<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.380> that's<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.740> so<00:02:26.950> we're

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
just comes out so that's it so we're

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.350 
just comes out so that's it so we're
gonna<00:02:27.130> reuse<00:02:27.520> this<00:02:27.670> lamp<00:02:27.880> wiring<00:02:28.120> here<00:02:28.240> so

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
gonna reuse this lamp wiring here so

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.240 
gonna reuse this lamp wiring here so
we'll<00:02:28.480> snip<00:02:28.690> these<00:02:28.810> off<00:02:29.020> about<00:02:29.590> an<00:02:29.740> inch<00:02:29.830> down

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
we'll snip these off about an inch down

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.570 
we'll snip these off about an inch down
from<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:31.030> top<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.890> what<00:02:36.130> we're<00:02:36.250> going<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.400> do

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
from the top so what we're going to do

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.550 
from the top so what we're going to do
is<00:02:36.670> we've<00:02:36.820> you've<00:02:37.210> got<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.570> positive<00:02:38.080> wire

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
is we've you've got the positive wire

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.380 
is we've you've got the positive wire
here<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.010> then<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.700> negative<00:02:39.850> we're<00:02:40.270> just

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
here and then the negative we're just

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.150 
here and then the negative we're just
going<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.540> remove<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:41.050> from<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.320> next<00:02:41.740> pod

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
going to remove it from the next pod

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.850 
going to remove it from the next pod
over<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:42.880> then<00:02:43.360> use<00:02:43.630> that<00:02:43.870> same<00:02:44.110> fixing<00:02:44.620> for

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
over and then use that same fixing for

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.620 
over and then use that same fixing for
the<00:02:44.920> unu<00:02:45.520> unit<00:02:45.850> just<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.090> keep<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.300> nice<00:02:46.420> and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
the unu unit just to keep it nice and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.990 
the unu unit just to keep it nice and
tidy

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
tidy

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.390 
tidy
try<00:02:49.000> not<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.210> drop<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.450> because<00:02:50.160> it's<00:02:51.160> quite<00:02:51.370> a

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
try not to drop it because it's quite a

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.570 
try not to drop it because it's quite a
mess<00:02:51.670> behind<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.180> -<00:02:53.040> I've<00:02:54.040> said<00:02:54.280> that<00:02:54.430> now

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
mess behind the - I've said that now

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.550 
mess behind the - I've said that now
it's<00:02:54.700> going<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:54.940> go<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.060> can<00:02:55.330> tell<00:02:55.540> no<00:02:56.140> there<00:02:56.470> we

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
it's going to go I can tell no there we

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.950 
it's going to go I can tell no there we
go<00:02:57.030> we're<00:02:58.030> going<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.210> take<00:02:58.360> those<00:02:58.510> off

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
go we're going to take those off

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.550 
go we're going to take those off
and<00:02:59.650> use<00:03:00.400> those<00:03:00.670> again<00:03:01.120> on<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.630> youth<00:03:01.870> new

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
and use those again on the youth new

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.620 
and use those again on the youth new
unit<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.370> that<00:03:03.820> just<00:03:03.970> makes<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.240> all<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.420> lot

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
unit and that just makes it all a lot

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.410 
unit and that just makes it all a lot
tidier<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:05.470> as<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.650> can<00:03:05.740> see<00:03:05.800> here<00:03:06.160> we've<00:03:06.790> used

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
tidier so as you can see here we've used

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.040 
tidier so as you can see here we've used
the<00:03:07.720> previous<00:03:09.240> connections<00:03:10.240> so<00:03:10.810> that<00:03:10.960> they're

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
the previous connections so that they're

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.430 
the previous connections so that they're
easy<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.470> fit<00:03:11.920> back<00:03:12.130> on<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.730> center<00:03:13.180> module

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
easy to fit back on to the center module

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.790 
easy to fit back on to the center module
in<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.770> -<00:03:15.270> to<00:03:16.270> earth<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:16.840> then<00:03:17.320> we've<00:03:17.590> got<00:03:17.710> the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
in the - to earth and then we've got the

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.790 
in the - to earth and then we've got the
two<00:03:17.950> positives<00:03:18.400> here<00:03:18.720> again<00:03:19.720> we've<00:03:20.350> used<00:03:20.620> the

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
two positives here again we've used the

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.120 
two positives here again we've used the
original<00:03:21.989> blade<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.620> can<00:03:23.739> be<00:03:23.830> attached

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
original blade so it can be attached

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.360 
original blade so it can be attached
easily<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.650> all<00:03:26.650> those<00:03:26.830> are<00:03:27.040> using<00:03:27.310> the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
easily and all those are using the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.710 
easily and all those are using the
existing<00:03:27.910> ones<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:28.330> were<00:03:28.420> on<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.690> previous

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
existing ones that were on the previous

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.300 
existing ones that were on the previous
amp<00:03:29.500> meter<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:31.300> we've<00:03:31.420> now<00:03:31.570> got<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:32.080> run<00:03:32.920> a

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
amp meter and we've now got to run a

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.780 
amp meter and we've now got to run a
wire<00:03:33.820> from<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.360> ignition<00:03:34.780> coil<00:03:35.340> through<00:03:36.340> the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
wire from the ignition coil through the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.360 
wire from the ignition coil through the
bulkhead<00:03:37.090> into<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:37.930> -<00:03:38.140> area<00:03:38.709> so<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.040> we<00:03:39.220> can

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
bulkhead into the - area so that we can

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.160 
bulkhead into the - area so that we can
connect<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.910> this<00:03:40.000> one<00:03:40.180> here<00:03:40.420> so<00:03:40.750> using<00:03:41.110> a

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
connect it to this one here so using a

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
connect it to this one here so using a
10<00:03:41.380> mil<00:03:41.620> I'm<00:03:41.860> just<00:03:42.070> going<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.250> loosen<00:03:42.550> off<00:03:44.190> the

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
10 mil I'm just going to loosen off the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.260 
10 mil I'm just going to loosen off the
ignition<00:03:45.520> coil<00:03:47.700> okay<00:03:48.700> so<00:03:48.850> this<00:03:48.940> is<00:03:49.120> our

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
ignition coil okay so this is our

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.790 
ignition coil okay so this is our
admission<00:03:49.600> call<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.050> we've<00:03:50.230> got<00:03:50.530> the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
admission call and we've got the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.800 
admission call and we've got the
positive<00:03:51.070> on<00:03:51.520> the<00:03:51.640> left-hand<00:03:52.270> side<00:03:52.450> here<00:03:52.480> and

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
positive on the left-hand side here and

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.870 
positive on the left-hand side here and
negative<00:03:53.380> here<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:53.920> this<00:03:54.010> is<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.340> point<00:03:54.580> on

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
negative here and this is the point on

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.600 
negative here and this is the point on
this<00:03:55.450> side<00:03:55.630> we<00:03:55.810> need<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:56.020> connect<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.739> rev

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
this side we need to connect the rev

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.090 
this side we need to connect the rev
counter<00:03:57.790> to<00:03:59.160> that's<00:04:00.160> going<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.400> pass<00:04:00.610> up<00:04:02.100> along

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
counter to that's going to pass up along

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.199 
counter to that's going to pass up along
the<00:04:03.220> back<00:04:03.370> of<00:04:03.520> the<00:04:03.580> bulkhead<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:05.470> into<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.800> -

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
the back of the bulkhead and into the -

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.300 
the back of the bulkhead and into the -
so<00:04:07.209> we<00:04:07.360> pushed<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.900> zip<00:04:08.170> tie<00:04:08.410> into<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.130> hole

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
so we pushed the zip tie into the hole

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.250 
so we pushed the zip tie into the hole
because<00:04:09.970> it's<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.360> bit<00:04:10.630> more<00:04:10.780> rigid<00:04:11.080> than<00:04:11.110> a

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
because it's a bit more rigid than a

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.530 
because it's a bit more rigid than a
wire<00:04:11.440> actually<00:04:11.739> to<00:04:11.800> stick<00:04:12.040> through<00:04:12.220> better

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
wire actually to stick through better

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.440 
wire actually to stick through better
now<00:04:13.540> I've<00:04:13.750> cut<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.820> location<00:04:15.820> tab<00:04:16.090> out<00:04:16.239> of<00:04:16.359> the

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
now I've cut the location tab out of the

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.360 
now I've cut the location tab out of the
zip<00:04:16.660> tie<00:04:16.840> head<00:04:17.140> so<00:04:17.500> that<00:04:17.530> I<00:04:17.680> can<00:04:17.830> push<00:04:18.040> my<00:04:18.190> wire

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
zip tie head so that I can push my wire

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.320 
zip tie head so that I can push my wire
through<00:04:18.580> there<00:04:20.070> it's<00:04:21.070> a<00:04:21.160> tight<00:04:21.459> fit<00:04:21.489> there<00:04:22.060> we

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
through there it's a tight fit there we

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.850 
through there it's a tight fit there we
go

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
go

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.550 
go
I'll<00:04:23.860> just<00:04:24.040> leave<00:04:24.250> that<00:04:24.280> round<00:04:25.289> and<00:04:26.289> wrap<00:04:26.440> it

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
I'll just leave that round and wrap it

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.989 
I'll just leave that round and wrap it
around<00:04:26.590> a<00:04:26.800> couple<00:04:26.830> of<00:04:27.039> times

00:04:28.989 --> 00:04:28.999 
around a couple of times

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:33.200 
around a couple of times
hopefully<00:04:29.999> I<00:04:30.979> grab<00:04:31.979> the<00:04:32.099> other<00:04:32.219> end<00:04:32.280> that

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
hopefully I grab the other end that

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.920 
hopefully I grab the other end that
should<00:04:33.449> pull<00:04:33.569> it<00:04:33.659> through<00:04:36.800> there<00:04:37.800> we<00:04:37.860> go<00:04:38.840> so<00:04:39.840> as

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
should pull it through there we go so as

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.739 
should pull it through there we go so as
you<00:04:40.050> saw<00:04:40.169> with<00:04:40.319> this<00:04:40.379> unit<00:04:40.710> here<00:04:40.949> it<00:04:41.099> had<00:04:41.310> a

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:41.749 
you saw with this unit here it had a

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:44.989 
you saw with this unit here it had a
mounting<00:04:42.749> bridge<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.889> supported<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:44.580> in<00:04:44.759> the

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:44.999 
mounting bridge that supported it in the

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:47.860 
mounting bridge that supported it in the
dash<00:04:45.210> and<00:04:46.050> we've<00:04:46.229> got<00:04:46.349> a<00:04:46.379> similar<00:04:46.680> arrangement

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
dash and we've got a similar arrangement

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.499 
dash and we've got a similar arrangement
for<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:48.990> new<00:04:49.139> rev<00:04:49.319> counter<00:04:49.529> a<00:04:50.210> two<00:04:51.210> pronged

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
for the new rev counter a two pronged

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.269 
for the new rev counter a two pronged
version<00:04:51.930> but<00:04:52.169> it<00:04:52.259> does<00:04:52.409> the<00:04:52.499> same<00:04:52.650> thing<00:04:52.710> need

00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:53.279 
version but it does the same thing need

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:55.010 
version but it does the same thing need
to<00:04:53.310> remove<00:04:53.580> these<00:04:53.819> one<00:04:54.210> at<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.419> time<00:04:54.569> so<00:04:54.900> the

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
to remove these one at a time so the

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.540 
to remove these one at a time so the
whole<00:04:55.050> unit<00:04:55.439> doesn't<00:04:55.590> drop<00:04:55.830> through<00:04:56.129> just<00:04:56.460> do

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
whole unit doesn't drop through just do

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.519 
whole unit doesn't drop through just do
one<00:04:56.699> at<00:04:56.789> a<00:04:56.819> time<00:04:56.969> replace<00:04:57.449> these<00:04:57.870> nuts<00:04:58.319> with

00:04:58.519 --> 00:04:58.529 
one at a time replace these nuts with

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:00.499 
one at a time replace these nuts with
the<00:04:58.620> stud<00:04:58.800> extensions<00:04:59.340> before<00:04:59.490> fitting<00:04:59.849> you

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
the stud extensions before fitting you

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:01.369 
the stud extensions before fitting you
need<00:05:00.659> to<00:05:00.719> make<00:05:00.840> sure<00:05:00.990> you've<00:05:01.110> got<00:05:01.139> this

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
need to make sure you've got this

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:03.260 
need to make sure you've got this
switched<00:05:01.650> over<00:05:01.830> to<00:05:01.949> the<00:05:02.759> right<00:05:02.969> number<00:05:03.120> of

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
switched over to the right number of

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.339 
switched over to the right number of
cylinders<00:05:03.659> in<00:05:03.750> your<00:05:03.840> vehicle<00:05:04.110> which<00:05:04.199> we've

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
cylinders in your vehicle which we've

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.200 
cylinders in your vehicle which we've
got<00:05:04.469> eight<00:05:04.710> somebody<00:05:05.400> click<00:05:05.879> it<00:05:05.969> over<00:05:06.060> to

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
got eight somebody click it over to

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.709 
got eight somebody click it over to
there<00:05:07.849> there<00:05:08.849> we<00:05:08.909> go<00:05:09.060> and<00:05:09.240> that's<00:05:09.449> how<00:05:09.599> the

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:09.719 
there there we go and that's how the

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:12.459 
there there we go and that's how the
unit<00:05:10.020> is<00:05:10.139> going<00:05:10.169> to<00:05:10.289> be<00:05:10.409> supported<00:05:10.919> okay<00:05:11.879> so

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:12.469 
unit is going to be supported okay so

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:18.050 
unit is going to be supported okay so
passing<00:05:13.469> the<00:05:13.560> bracket<00:05:13.969> in<00:05:14.969> place<00:05:16.699> yes<00:05:17.699> we<00:05:17.879> just

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
passing the bracket in place yes we just

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.249 
passing the bracket in place yes we just
nipped<00:05:18.270> that<00:05:18.330> up<00:05:18.599> very<00:05:19.409> gently<00:05:21.050> that's<00:05:22.050> in

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
nipped that up very gently that's in

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.570 
nipped that up very gently that's in
place<00:05:22.469> now<00:05:22.680> if<00:05:22.770> we<00:05:22.889> went<00:05:23.039> over<00:05:23.219> too<00:05:23.339> tight

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
place now if we went over too tight

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.529 
place now if we went over too tight
because<00:05:23.759> we're<00:05:23.969> gonna<00:05:24.060> get<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.300> other<00:05:24.389> one

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
because we're gonna get the other one

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:33.740 
because we're gonna get the other one
now<00:05:30.529> this<00:05:31.529> is<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:31.800> center<00:05:32.279> module<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.599> we've

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
now this is the center module that we've

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.179 
now this is the center module that we've
loosened<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:34.289> you<00:05:34.379> can<00:05:34.529> see<00:05:34.710> here<00:05:34.979> this<00:05:35.129> is

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:35.189 
loosened and you can see here this is

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:37.100 
loosened and you can see here this is
where<00:05:35.430> we've<00:05:35.580> reattached<00:05:35.819> the<00:05:36.120> earth´s<00:05:36.360> so

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
where we've reattached the earth´s so

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.149 
where we've reattached the earth´s so
this<00:05:37.259> is<00:05:37.379> loose<00:05:37.560> at<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:37.740> moment<00:05:37.919> so<00:05:37.979> we<00:05:38.039> need

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.159 
this is loose at the moment so we need

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.300 
this is loose at the moment so we need
to<00:05:38.250> do<00:05:38.370> that<00:05:38.520> up<00:05:39.560> and<00:05:40.560> we<00:05:40.650> can<00:05:40.800> reconnect<00:05:41.189> using

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
to do that up and we can reconnect using

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.279 
to do that up and we can reconnect using
the<00:05:41.550> existing<00:05:42.240> connector<00:05:42.930> that's<00:05:43.259> positive

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
the existing connector that's positive

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:49.909 
the existing connector that's positive
I'll<00:05:46.289> go<00:05:46.439> back<00:05:46.589> in<00:05:46.770> there<00:05:48.050> then<00:05:49.050> this<00:05:49.349> is<00:05:49.409> the

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
I'll go back in there then this is the

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:57.790 
I'll go back in there then this is the
illumination<00:05:51.110> put<00:05:52.110> these<00:05:52.289> together<00:05:53.180> there

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:04.089 

we've<00:05:58.800> now<00:05:58.919> got<00:05:59.099> to<00:05:59.219> connect<00:05:59.460> these<00:05:59.610> two<00:06:02.990> we'll

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:04.099 
we've now got to connect these two we'll

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.379 
we've now got to connect these two we'll
make<00:06:05.099> sure<00:06:05.339> that<00:06:05.370> everything<00:06:05.849> slots<00:06:06.149> back

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
make sure that everything slots back

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.860 
make sure that everything slots back
into<00:06:06.599> place<00:06:08.180> before<00:06:09.180> we<00:06:09.270> screw<00:06:09.509> anything<00:06:09.750> down

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
into place before we screw anything down
