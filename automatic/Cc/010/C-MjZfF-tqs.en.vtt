position<00:00:00.510> and<00:00:00.719> all<00:00:00.840> the<00:00:00.930> variations<00:00:01.380> we've

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
position and all the variations we've

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:09.950 
position and all the variations we've
seen<00:00:02.360> so<00:00:03.500> here<00:00:05.779> we<00:00:06.779> play<00:00:06.960> here<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:08.750> why<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:09.780> got

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
seen so here we play here and why I got

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.830 
seen so here we play here and why I got
sent<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:11.300> here<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.360> probably<00:00:12.660> come<00:00:12.780> back

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
sent a and here you probably come back

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.580 
sent a and here you probably come back
and<00:00:13.139> do<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.530> corner<00:00:14.540> but<00:00:15.540> what<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.870> want<00:00:16.170> to

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
and do the corner but what you want to

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.300 
and do the corner but what you want to
do<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:17.810> fix<00:00:18.810> yourself<00:00:19.350> before<00:00:19.800> attacking<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
do is fix yourself before attacking the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.259 
do is fix yourself before attacking the
opponent<00:00:21.710> so<00:00:22.710> if<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.920> go<00:00:23.039> here<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.519> then

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
opponent so if you go here and then

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.609 
opponent so if you go here and then
we'll<00:00:24.510> assume<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:24.869> black<00:00:25.170> goes<00:00:25.380> here

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
we'll assume that black goes here

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.800 
we'll assume that black goes here
because<00:00:25.949> that's<00:00:26.910> usually<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.449> next<00:00:27.570> best

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
because that's usually the next best

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.640 
because that's usually the next best
move<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.490> now<00:00:30.199> here's<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.380> way<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.529> think

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
move but now here's the way to think

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.670 
move but now here's the way to think
about<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.130> situation<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:33.000> don't<00:00:33.809> attack<00:00:34.530> in

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
about the situation you don't attack in

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.819 
about the situation you don't attack in
this<00:00:34.800> group<00:00:36.020> you<00:00:37.020> won't<00:00:37.260> gain<00:00:37.380> as<00:00:37.559> much<00:00:37.680> as

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
this group you won't gain as much as

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.180 
this group you won't gain as much as
black<00:00:37.980> get<00:00:38.129> over<00:00:38.280> here<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:39.480> now<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.530> position

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
black get over here but now the position

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.619 
black get over here but now the position
you<00:00:41.790> want<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.149> think<00:00:42.360> about<00:00:42.710> blacks<00:00:43.710> got<00:00:44.010> one

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
you want to think about blacks got one

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.420 
you want to think about blacks got one
possible<00:00:45.629> weak<00:00:45.840> group<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.410> white<00:00:47.190> has

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
possible weak group and white has

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.029 
possible weak group and white has
absolutely<00:00:47.879> none<00:00:48.270> now<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.890> can

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
absolutely none now and if you can

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.010 
absolutely none now and if you can
detect<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.460> weak<00:00:50.670> group<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.120> sintang<00:00:51.809> and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
detect this weak group in sintang and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.010 
detect this weak group in sintang and
profit<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.410> synteny<00:00:53.059> then<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.690> just<00:00:54.809> play

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
profit in synteny then you can just play

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.470 
profit in synteny then you can just play
elsewhere<00:00:55.199> simply<00:00:55.949> meaning<00:00:56.190> forcing<00:00:57.289> so<00:00:59.480> this

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
elsewhere simply meaning forcing so this

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.470 
elsewhere simply meaning forcing so this
is<00:01:00.930> probably<00:01:01.289> better<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.620> white<00:01:01.890> than<00:01:02.730> this

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
is probably better for white than this

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.530 
is probably better for white than this
one<00:01:03.750> because<00:01:04.350> here<00:01:07.610> what<00:01:08.610> gets<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.060> move<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
one because here what gets this move and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.760 
one because here what gets this move and
now<00:01:09.990> there's<00:01:10.229> no<00:01:10.380> sin<00:01:10.619> type<00:01:10.799> moves<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.820> white

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
now there's no sin type moves for white

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.830 
now there's no sin type moves for white
whereas<00:01:13.770> if<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.180> way<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:15.659> black

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
whereas if you do it this way then black

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.560 
whereas if you do it this way then black
plays<00:01:16.080> here<00:01:16.580> why<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.640> might<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:18.090> moves<00:01:18.390> like

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
plays here why it might have moves like

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.219 
plays here why it might have moves like
this<00:01:18.979> which<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.299> start<00:01:21.299> attacking<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.960> dome

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
this which can start attacking this dome

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.960 
this which can start attacking this dome
and<00:01:22.590> detecting<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.340> group<00:01:23.549> at<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.729> same

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and detecting this group at the same

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.539 
and detecting this group at the same
time<00:01:25.310> so<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.939> say<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.330> fix<00:01:27.659> ourselves<00:01:28.320> and

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
time so we say that we fix ourselves and

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.060 
time so we say that we fix ourselves and
then<00:01:29.549> attack<00:01:30.030> because<00:01:30.930> if<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.229> fix<00:01:31.470> ourselves

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
then attack because if we fix ourselves

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.800 
then attack because if we fix ourselves
then<00:01:32.340> black<00:01:32.909> will<00:01:33.090> not<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.329> any<00:01:33.450> forcing

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
then black will not have any forcing

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.350 
then black will not have any forcing
moves<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.140> us<00:01:34.460> now<00:01:35.460> let's<00:01:35.610> say<00:01:35.759> black<00:01:36.000> fix

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
moves on us now let's say black fix

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.819 
moves on us now let's say black fix
themself<00:01:36.810> now<00:01:38.600> it's<00:01:39.600> an<00:01:39.840> even<00:01:40.020> exchange<00:01:40.350> we

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
themself now it's an even exchange we

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.100 
themself now it's an even exchange we
both<00:01:41.009> fix<00:01:41.250> ourselves<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.880> now<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.329> get<00:01:42.720> sente

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
both fix ourselves and now I get sente

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.100 
both fix ourselves and now I get sente
so<00:01:44.040> what<00:01:44.280> usually<00:01:45.090> wants<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.600> go<00:01:45.720> from

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
so what usually wants to go from

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.679 
so what usually wants to go from
whatever<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.470> worth<00:01:46.530> more<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.509> then<00:01:48.509> like

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
whatever it's worth more and then like

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.200 
whatever it's worth more and then like
the<00:01:48.810> star<00:01:49.020> moves<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.619> these<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.909> point

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the star moves like these so the point

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.740 
the star moves like these so the point
here<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:56.130> attack<00:01:56.670> first<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.240> then<00:01:57.570> we

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
here is if we attack first and then we

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.050 
here is if we attack first and then we
have<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.020> come<00:01:58.170> back<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.560> fix<00:01:58.770> ourselves<00:01:59.060> we

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
have to come back and fix ourselves we

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.179 
have to come back and fix ourselves we
don't<00:02:00.540> get<00:02:00.719> as<00:02:00.869> much<00:02:01.110> as<00:02:01.380> if<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.710> fixed

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
don't get as much as if we just fixed

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.310 
don't get as much as if we just fixed
ourselves<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.880> attacked<00:02:03.180> next<00:02:05.299> so<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.659> want

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
ourselves and attacked next so you want

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.619 
ourselves and attacked next so you want
to<00:02:07.469> fix<00:02:07.680> your<00:02:07.890> groups<00:02:08.160> before<00:02:08.759> attacking<00:02:09.330> your

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
to fix your groups before attacking your

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.330 
to fix your groups before attacking your
opponent

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
opponent

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.740 
opponent
also<00:02:14.580> play<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.610> lot<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:15.970> games<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.540> in<00:02:16.629> your

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
also play a lot of games and in your

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.270 
also play a lot of games and in your
games<00:02:16.989> try<00:02:17.409> to<00:02:17.470> figure<00:02:17.650> out<00:02:17.769> where<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.129> weak

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
games try to figure out where the weak

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.039 
games try to figure out where the weak
groups<00:02:18.519> are<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.180> once<00:02:19.390> weak<00:02:19.599> and<00:02:19.750> what's<00:02:19.900> not

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
groups are and once weak and what's not

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.030 
groups are and once weak and what's not
that<00:02:20.980> all<00:02:21.190> comes<00:02:21.519> with<00:02:21.700> experience<00:02:22.530> now<00:02:23.530> some

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
that all comes with experience now some

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.020 
that all comes with experience now some
may<00:02:24.970> say<00:02:25.209> this<00:02:25.450> white<00:02:25.629> groups<00:02:25.900> not<00:02:26.890> weak<00:02:27.370> well

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
may say this white groups not weak well

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.880 
may say this white groups not weak well
if<00:02:28.330> they<00:02:28.629> do<00:02:29.879> here's<00:02:30.879> a<00:02:30.940> way<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.150> judge<00:02:31.599> that

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
if they do here's a way to judge that

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.880 
if they do here's a way to judge that
can<00:02:32.890> black<00:02:33.220> attack<00:02:33.610> white<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.410> we<00:02:35.620> start

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
can black attack white and so we start

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.600 
can black attack white and so we start
looking<00:02:36.069> at<00:02:36.870> white<00:02:37.870> plays<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.590> move<00:02:39.310> elsewhere

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
looking at white plays a move elsewhere

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.000 
looking at white plays a move elsewhere
can<00:02:40.569> white<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:41.170> woke<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.409> black<00:02:41.590> attack<00:02:41.709> this

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
can white it woke and black attack this

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.449 
can white it woke and black attack this
group

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
group

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.660 
group
well<00:02:43.209> hopefully<00:02:44.110> here's<00:02:44.470> black<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:45.010> this

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
well hopefully here's black and this

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.800 
well hopefully here's black and this
move<00:02:46.920> threatens<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.040> surround<00:02:48.340> white<00:02:48.810> very

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
move threatens to surround white very

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.500 
move threatens to surround white very
harshly<00:02:50.129> what<00:02:51.129> pretty<00:02:51.730> much<00:02:51.819> must<00:02:52.239> defend

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
harshly what pretty much must defend

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.640 
harshly what pretty much must defend
this<00:02:52.690> next<00:02:52.989> move<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.470> now<00:02:55.319> we<00:02:56.319> can<00:02:56.470> keep

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
this next move and now we can keep

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.650 
this next move and now we can keep
pushing<00:02:56.920> this<00:02:57.190> white<00:02:57.430> through<00:02:57.640> like<00:02:58.150> this<00:02:58.329> and

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
pushing this white through like this and

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.319 
pushing this white through like this and
this<00:02:59.620> move<00:02:59.890> also<00:03:00.670> turns<00:03:01.030> just<00:03:01.269> around<00:03:01.510> white

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
this move also turns just around white

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.990 
this move also turns just around white
we<00:03:04.329> probably<00:03:04.569> should<00:03:04.810> read<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:04.989> little<00:03:05.200> bit

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
we probably should read a little bit

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.550 
we probably should read a little bit
let's<00:03:07.000> say<00:03:07.060> white<00:03:07.269> jumps<00:03:07.510> again<00:03:07.599> and<00:03:07.930> then<00:03:08.470> we

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
let's say white jumps again and then we

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.050 
let's say white jumps again and then we
can<00:03:08.590> go<00:03:08.799> here<00:03:09.720> now<00:03:10.720> blacks<00:03:11.590> profit<00:03:12.190> here<00:03:12.430> is<00:03:12.609> he

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
can go here now blacks profit here is he

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.430 
can go here now blacks profit here is he
got<00:03:13.239> this<00:03:13.390> wall<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:15.840> white<00:03:16.840> still<00:03:17.200> can't

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
got this wall and white still can't

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.780 
got this wall and white still can't
connect<00:03:17.709> immediately<00:03:18.190> so<00:03:18.340> what's<00:03:18.549> still

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
connect immediately so what's still

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.129 
connect immediately so what's still
gonna<00:03:18.940> have<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.150> weak<00:03:19.419> group<00:03:19.569> in<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.840> center

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
gonna have a weak group in the center

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.140 
gonna have a weak group in the center
because<00:03:21.660> he<00:03:22.660> can't<00:03:23.049> connect<00:03:23.380> immediately<00:03:23.560> and

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
because he can't connect immediately and

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.349 
because he can't connect immediately and
he<00:03:25.150> has<00:03:25.329> no<00:03:25.540> eye<00:03:25.720> shape<00:03:26.019> yet<00:03:26.200> still<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.970> let's

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
he has no eye shape yet still so let's

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.479 
he has no eye shape yet still so let's
say<00:03:28.480> black<00:03:28.810> defends<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.410> black<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.340> still

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
say black defends and black and still

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.520 
say black defends and black and still
it's<00:03:30.700> half<00:03:30.849> way<00:03:31.090> but<00:03:31.480> even<00:03:31.870> if<00:03:31.959> luck<00:03:32.169> chooses

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
it's half way but even if luck chooses

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.180 
it's half way but even if luck chooses
not<00:03:32.709> to

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
not to

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.879 
not to
he<00:03:33.579> still<00:03:33.880> has<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.359> move<00:03:34.660> like<00:03:34.870> this<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:35.530> develop

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
he still has a move like this to develop

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.360 
he still has a move like this to develop
this<00:03:36.040> big<00:03:36.310> area<00:03:36.730> right<00:03:37.000> here<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:38.530> is<00:03:38.829> what<00:03:39.220> we

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
this big area right here this is what we

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.430 
this big area right here this is what we
say<00:03:39.549> is<00:03:39.669> a<00:03:39.700> weaker<00:03:39.970> of<00:03:40.209> wimps<00:03:40.720> your<00:03:41.019> opponent

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
say is a weaker of wimps your opponent

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.589 
say is a weaker of wimps your opponent
can<00:03:41.530> attack<00:03:41.829> it<00:03:42.010> in<00:03:42.220> sente<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.000> force<00:03:43.389> you<00:03:43.569> to

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
can attack it in sente and force you to

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.199 
can attack it in sente and force you to
defend<00:03:43.989> while<00:03:44.410> gaining<00:03:44.859> profit<00:03:45.099> that<00:03:45.910> means

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
defend while gaining profit that means

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.520 
defend while gaining profit that means
you<00:03:46.419> need<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.660> defend<00:03:46.930> your<00:03:47.109> group<00:03:47.349> before

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
you need to defend your group before

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.050 
you need to defend your group before
they<00:03:47.739> get<00:03:47.980> that<00:03:48.130> attack<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:51.060> that's

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
they get that attack and that's

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.809 
they get that attack and that's
basically<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.690> middle<00:03:53.169> game<00:03:53.349> is<00:03:53.819> attacking

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
basically the middle game is attacking

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.390 
basically the middle game is attacking
defense<00:03:55.590> throughout<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.739> entire<00:03:57.040> middle

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
defense throughout the entire middle

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.659 
defense throughout the entire middle
game<00:04:01.410> but<00:04:02.410> other<00:04:02.680> than<00:04:02.769> that<00:04:02.859> I'll<00:04:03.370> show<00:04:03.579> you

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
game but other than that I'll show you

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:09.349 
game but other than that I'll show you
the<00:04:03.760> position<00:04:03.910> before<00:04:04.540> it<00:04:05.019> got<00:04:05.169> like<00:04:05.349> this

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.879 

when<00:04:10.359> there's<00:04:10.599> not<00:04:10.780> weak<00:04:11.139> groups<00:04:11.410> on<00:04:11.680> the

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
when there's not weak groups on the

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:16.469 
when there's not weak groups on the
board<00:04:12.840> then<00:04:14.549> normally<00:04:15.549> like<00:04:16.060> here's<00:04:16.359> the

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
board then normally like here's the

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.949 
board then normally like here's the
position<00:04:16.739> earlier<00:04:17.739> in<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:17.949> game

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
position earlier in the game

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.379 
position earlier in the game
when<00:04:19.799> there's<00:04:20.009> not<00:04:20.430> we<00:04:20.579> groups<00:04:20.910> on<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.150> board

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
when there's not we groups on the board

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.409 
when there's not we groups on the board
like<00:04:22.229> here<00:04:22.590> like<00:04:22.979> as<00:04:23.190> a<00:04:23.610> possible<00:04:23.970> we<00:04:24.090> group<00:04:24.300> up

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
like here like as a possible we group up

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.390 
like here like as a possible we group up
here<00:04:24.620> defending<00:04:25.620> it<00:04:25.889> will<00:04:26.009> probably<00:04:26.160> give

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
here defending it will probably give

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.189 
here defending it will probably give
what<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.729> bigger<00:04:26.970> move<00:04:27.240> so<00:04:27.539> since<00:04:28.020> white

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
what the bigger move so since white

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.100 
what the bigger move so since white
can't<00:04:28.650> gain<00:04:29.160> very<00:04:29.400> much<00:04:29.610> by<00:04:29.789> attacking<00:04:30.090> gift<00:04:30.449> I

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
can't gain very much by attacking gift I

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.570 
can't gain very much by attacking gift I
would<00:04:31.680> choose<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.949> play<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.130> bigger<00:04:32.370> move

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
would choose to play the bigger move

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:40.730 
would choose to play the bigger move
first<00:04:32.910> probably<00:04:33.650> so<00:04:34.650> here<00:04:39.110> black<00:04:40.110> played<00:04:40.380> here

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
first probably so here black played here

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.800 
first probably so here black played here
and<00:04:41.060> play<00:04:42.060> on<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:42.810> side<00:04:43.160> so<00:04:44.160> when<00:04:44.370> there's<00:04:44.810> not

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
and play on the side so when there's not

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.370 
and play on the side so when there's not
wheat<00:04:46.289> groups<00:04:46.560> or<00:04:46.740> not<00:04:48.380> attacking

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
wheat groups or not attacking

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.680 
wheat groups or not attacking
possibilities<00:04:50.160> just<00:04:50.460> quite<00:04:50.729> yet<00:04:50.970> you'll<00:04:51.479> play

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
possibilities just quite yet you'll play

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.779 
possibilities just quite yet you'll play
the<00:04:51.840> territorial<00:04:52.560> moves<00:04:52.770> or<00:04:53.039> the<00:04:53.580> next

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
the territorial moves or the next

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.260
