if<00:00:01.680> I<00:00:01.829> saw<00:00:02.010> YouTube<00:00:02.429> I<00:00:03.830> just<00:00:04.830> wanted<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.220> share

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
if I saw YouTube I just wanted to share

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.450 
if I saw YouTube I just wanted to share
my<00:00:05.520> new<00:00:05.850> addition<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:07.849> the<00:00:08.849> hho<00:00:09.630> generator<00:00:10.460> and

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
my new addition to the hho generator and

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.820 
my new addition to the hho generator and
is<00:00:11.969> right<00:00:12.330> sure<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:14.780> decided<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.990> add<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> drying

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
is right sure I decided to add a drying

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.510 
is right sure I decided to add a drying
chamber<00:00:19.220> yeah

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
chamber yeah

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.000 
chamber yeah
Moisture<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.060> good<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.449> there<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> little<00:00:21.779> bit

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
Moisture is good in there a little bit

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.710 
Moisture is good in there a little bit
but<00:00:23.010> what<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:23.970> get<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.150> little<00:00:24.330> bit<00:00:24.539> too

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
but what if you get a little bit too

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.679 
but what if you get a little bit too
much<00:00:25.070> you<00:00:26.070> know<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.250> know<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.180> don't<00:00:27.480> want<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
much you know I know I don't want to

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.720 
much you know I know I don't want to
risk<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.500> my<00:00:29.720> buddy<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.869> mine<00:00:31.019> gave<00:00:31.199> me<00:00:31.260> this

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
risk it so my buddy of mine gave me this

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.790 
risk it so my buddy of mine gave me this
little<00:00:32.730> drying<00:00:33.059> cartridge<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.200> think<00:00:34.649> it's

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
little drying cartridge I think it's

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.280 
little drying cartridge I think it's
used<00:00:34.950> for<00:00:35.070> like<00:00:35.480> settling<00:00:36.480> or<00:00:36.840> something<00:00:37.200> to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
used for like settling or something to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.049 
used for like settling or something to
dry<00:00:37.469> gas<00:00:37.710> but<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.070> says<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.340> clean<00:00:38.760> dry

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
dry gas but it says for clean dry

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.080 
dry gas but it says for clean dry
compressed<00:00:39.719> air<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.469> gases<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:42.140> PSI<00:00:43.140> max<00:00:43.559> of

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
compressed air and gases the PSI max of

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.660 
compressed air and gases the PSI max of
250<00:00:45.649> basically<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.800> got<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.309> packed

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
250 basically it's got it's just packed

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.840 
250 basically it's got it's just packed
full<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.410> calcium<00:00:49.410> carbonate<00:00:50.129> which<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.820> a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
full of a calcium carbonate which is a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.600 
full of a calcium carbonate which is a
fancy<00:00:51.360> word<00:00:51.480> for<00:00:51.539> chalk<00:00:51.989> or<00:00:52.379> limestone<00:00:53.239> coral

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
fancy word for chalk or limestone coral

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.750 
fancy word for chalk or limestone coral
maybe<00:00:56.610> even<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.390> looks<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.989> cat<00:00:58.680> litter<00:00:58.920> but

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
maybe even it looks like cat litter but

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.549 
maybe even it looks like cat litter but
I<00:01:00.090> would<00:01:00.510> suspect<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.170> probably

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
I would suspect that it's probably

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.520 
I would suspect that it's probably
calcium<00:01:02.039> carbonate<00:01:02.489> that's<00:01:03.480> pretty<00:01:04.290> much<00:01:04.409> an

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
calcium carbonate that's pretty much an

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.010 
calcium carbonate that's pretty much an
inert<00:01:04.830> object<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.360> exception<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.990> few

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
inert object the exception of a few

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.820 
inert object the exception of a few
things<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:08.780> yeah<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.810> did<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.320> drying<00:01:10.710> chamber

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
things so yeah I did that drying chamber

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.910 
things so yeah I did that drying chamber
on<00:01:11.310> there<00:01:11.720> of<00:01:12.720> course<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.290> know<00:01:13.470> y'all<00:01:13.740> saw

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
on there of course you know y'all saw

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.730 
on there of course you know y'all saw
the<00:01:13.979> bubbler<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:15.330> second<00:01:15.750> secondary<00:01:16.350> bubbler

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the bubbler the second secondary bubbler

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.980 
the bubbler the second secondary bubbler
here<00:01:18.380> an<00:01:19.380> old<00:01:19.530> water<00:01:19.740> filter<00:01:20.630> added<00:01:21.630> some

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
here an old water filter added some

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.810 
here an old water filter added some
steel<00:01:22.200> braided<00:01:22.409> hose<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:24.119> go<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.500> around

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
steel braided hose to go up and around

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.899 
steel braided hose to go up and around
to<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> intake<00:01:28.189> so<00:01:29.189> anyways<00:01:31.700> systems<00:01:32.700> running

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
to the intake so anyways systems running

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:33.590 
to the intake so anyways systems running
real<00:01:33.119> well

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
real well

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.240 
real well
electrolytes<00:01:34.530> staying<00:01:34.770> clean<00:01:35.329> a<00:01:36.920> little<00:01:37.920> bit

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
electrolytes staying clean a little bit

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.330 
electrolytes staying clean a little bit
of<00:01:38.340> rust<00:01:38.610> residual<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.600> from<00:01:40.159> one<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.250> my

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
of rust residual in here from one of my

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.920 
of rust residual in here from one of my
earlier<00:01:41.670> experiments<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.720> can't

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
earlier experiments and I just can't

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.319 
earlier experiments and I just can't
seem<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.200> get<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.530> all<00:01:43.680> out<00:01:43.909> it<00:01:44.909> just<00:01:45.090> lingers

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
seem to get it all out it just lingers

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.530 
seem to get it all out it just lingers
and<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.649> mean<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> electrolyte<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and but I mean the electrolyte for the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.730 
and but I mean the electrolyte for the
most<00:01:48.720> part<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.079> staying<00:01:49.229> pretty<00:01:49.530> darn<00:01:49.770> clean

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
most part is staying pretty darn clean

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.530 
most part is staying pretty darn clean
that's<00:01:52.700> about<00:01:52.940> that<00:01:53.350> there<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:54.500> have<00:01:54.650> it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
that's about that there you have it

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.270 
that's about that there you have it
anybody<00:01:56.540> sees<00:01:56.720> any<00:01:56.930> reason<00:01:57.770> why<00:01:57.860> I<00:01:57.890> shouldn't

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
anybody sees any reason why I shouldn't

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.320 
anybody sees any reason why I shouldn't
