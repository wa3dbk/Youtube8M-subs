like<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.210> real<00:00:15.240> life<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:16.289> drill<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.100> one<00:00:17.460> point<00:00:17.699> a

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
like in real life a drill is one point a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.300 
like in real life a drill is one point a
win<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.510> worth<00:00:18.779> three<00:00:19.170> points<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.800> loss<00:00:20.010> is

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
win is worth three points and a loss is

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.060 
win is worth three points and a loss is
no<00:00:20.789> point<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.930> that's<00:00:22.260> what<00:00:22.439> I'm<00:00:22.529> trying<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.830> do

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070

over power but the leavin the 12 when

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.589 
over power but the leavin the 12 when
it's<00:04:56.169> messy<00:04:56.680> of<00:04:56.949> all<00:04:57.250> people<00:04:57.639> that's<00:04:58.419> exactly

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
it's messy of all people that's exactly

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.930 
it's messy of all people that's exactly
if<00:04:58.930> you<00:04:59.050> want<00:04:59.349> there<00:04:59.650> but<00:04:59.919> he<00:05:00.159> cannot<00:05:00.460> do<00:05:00.729> it

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
if you want there but he cannot do it

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.480 
if you want there but he cannot do it
and<00:05:01.090> then<00:05:01.319> he<00:05:02.319> gets<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.770> first<00:05:03.069> opportunity

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
and then he gets the first opportunity

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.570 
and then he gets the first opportunity
he<00:05:04.090> has<00:05:04.240> had<00:05:04.270> all<00:05:04.750> matching<00:05:05.289> positive<00:05:06.039> Benzema

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
he has had all matching positive Benzema

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.999 
he has had all matching positive Benzema
and<00:05:06.789> in<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.330> box<00:05:07.659> and<00:05:07.930> he<00:05:08.169> scores<00:05:08.500> against<00:05:08.860> me

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
and in the box and he scores against me

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.490 
and in the box and he scores against me
so<00:05:09.300> matches<00:05:10.300> like<00:05:10.449> this<00:05:10.479> are<00:05:10.840> really<00:05:11.050> annoying

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
so matches like this are really annoying

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.980 
so matches like this are really annoying

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.249 
shots and you can see my build up play
he<00:05:34.900> was<00:05:35.050> kind<00:05:35.199> of<00:05:35.349> sloppy<00:05:35.860> in<00:05:36.130> defending<00:05:36.699> and<00:05:36.909> I

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
he was kind of sloppy in defending and I

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.379 
he was kind of sloppy in defending and I
could<00:05:38.259> even<00:05:38.380> got<00:05:38.860> a<00:05:39.130> couple<00:05:39.729> of<00:05:39.909> tricks<00:05:40.120> and

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
could even got a couple of tricks and

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.270 
could even got a couple of tricks and
and<00:05:40.599> that's<00:05:40.900> my<00:05:41.139> best<00:05:41.440> opportunity<00:05:42.009> to<00:05:42.039> match

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
and that's my best opportunity to match

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.649 
and that's my best opportunity to match
but<00:05:42.580> i<00:05:42.729> don't<00:05:42.940> know<00:05:43.000> i<00:05:43.030> think<00:05:43.120> that<00:05:43.449> was<00:05:43.570> an

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
but i don't know i think that was an

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.469 
but i don't know i think that was an
automated<00:05:43.990> tackle<00:05:44.800> there<00:05:45.009> he<00:05:45.969> didn't<00:05:46.240> do<00:05:46.330> that

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
automated tackle there he didn't do that

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.399 
automated tackle there he didn't do that
on<00:05:46.539> his<00:05:46.840> own<00:05:46.960> and<00:05:47.289> he<00:05:47.919> got<00:05:48.130> the<00:05:48.810> got<00:05:49.810> left<00:05:50.110> away

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409 
on his own and he got the got left away

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.700 
on his own and he got the got left away
with<00:05:50.590> a<00:05:50.620> clean<00:05:50.889> face<00:05:50.919> again<00:05:51.810> and<00:05:52.810> then<00:05:52.960> stick

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
with a clean face again and then stick

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.740 
with a clean face again and then stick
to<00:05:53.740> the<00:05:53.919> passing<00:05:54.310> game<00:05:54.400> i<00:05:54.550> get<00:05:54.759> a<00:05:54.789> little<00:05:55.419> bit

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
to the passing game i get a little bit

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.379 
to the passing game i get a little bit
lucky<00:05:56.169> there<00:05:56.380> and<00:05:56.650> i<00:05:57.430> take<00:05:57.639> the<00:05:57.789> shine<00:05:58.000> the

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
keeper and Casillas doesn't even

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.689 
keeper and Casillas doesn't even
struggle<00:06:01.870> with<00:06:02.020> that<00:06:02.199> and<00:06:02.500> I<00:06:02.620> lost<00:06:02.919> the<00:06:03.430> first

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
struggle with that and I lost the first

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.390 
struggle with that and I lost the first
loss<00:06:04.120> and<00:06:04.509> it<00:06:04.599> had<00:06:04.780> to<00:06:04.960> be<00:06:04.990> one<00:06:05.469> of<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:05.979> most

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
loss and it had to be one of the most

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.969 
loss and it had to be one of the most
annoying<00:06:06.789> ways<00:06:07.180> you<00:06:07.360> can<00:06:07.509> lose<00:06:07.719> so<00:06:09.150> you<00:06:10.150> know

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
annoying ways you can lose so you know

annoying ways you can lose so you know
it'll<00:06:11.979> be<00:06:12.190> interesting<00:06:12.460> to<00:06:12.669> see<00:06:12.789> how<00:06:12.969> I<00:06:13.150> do<00:06:13.360> in

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
it'll be interesting to see how I do in

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.320 
it'll be interesting to see how I do in
the<00:06:13.810> rest<00:06:14.050> of<00:06:14.229> the<00:06:14.349> matches<00:06:14.560> and<00:06:15.009> if<00:06:15.880> I<00:06:16.030> really
