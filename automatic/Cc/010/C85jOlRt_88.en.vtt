hi I'm William spaniel let's learn some
game<00:00:04.200> theory<00:00:04.410> today<00:00:05.339> we're<00:00:05.580> gonna<00:00:05.670> go<00:00:05.850> over

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
game theory today we're gonna go over

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.940 
game theory today we're gonna go over
the<00:00:06.060> stag<00:00:06.330> hunt<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.810> pure<00:00:07.200> strategy<00:00:07.740> Nash

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
the stag hunt and pure strategy Nash

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.629 
the stag hunt and pure strategy Nash
equilibrium<00:00:09.200> so<00:00:10.200> here's<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.530> game<00:00:10.679> two

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639

now<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.989> stag<00:00:34.260> has<00:00:34.410> more<00:00:34.620> meat<00:00:34.800> than<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
now the stag has more meat than the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.979 
now the stag has more meat than the
rabbits<00:00:35.280> combined<00:00:35.670> but<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.120> requires<00:00:36.510> both

rabbits combined but it requires both

rabbits combined but it requires both
hunters<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.559> chase<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.980> stag<00:00:38.219> Nordik<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.700> trip

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
in other words the hunters have to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.979 
in other words the hunters have to
cooperate<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.550> catching<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.329> stag<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.750> order<00:00:42.930> to

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
on the other hand the rabbit hunters if

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.779 
on the other hand the rabbit hunters if
there<00:00:46.739> are<00:00:46.860> any<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> game<00:00:47.370> will<00:00:47.520> be<00:00:47.640> able

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
there are any in the game will be able

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.639 
there are any in the game will be able
to<00:00:47.879> catch<00:00:48.030> all<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.480> their<00:00:48.629> prey<00:00:48.870> by<00:00:49.050> themselves

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
to catch all of their prey by themselves

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.319 
to catch all of their prey by themselves
and<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.219> interesting<00:00:50.640> thing<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.090> that

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and the interesting thing here is that

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.150 
and the interesting thing here is that
if<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.539> guy<00:00:51.690> goes<00:00:51.930> out<00:00:52.110> hunting<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.620> stag<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
if a guy goes out hunting a stag and the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.040 
if a guy goes out hunting a stag and the
other<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:53.399> goes<00:00:53.520> out<00:00:53.670> hunting<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.059> rabbit<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
other one goes out hunting a rabbit the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.270 
other one goes out hunting a rabbit the
guy<00:00:55.170> who's<00:00:55.320> hunting<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.680> rabbit<00:00:56.010> will<00:00:56.129> get

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
guy who's hunting the rabbit will get

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.069 
guy who's hunting the rabbit will get
both<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.760> rabbits<00:00:57.180> while<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.690> guy<00:00:57.809> who's

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
both the rabbits while the guy who's

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.369 
both the rabbits while the guy who's
hunting<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.530> stag<00:00:58.770> won't<00:00:59.160> get<00:00:59.399> anything<00:00:59.699> and

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
hunting the stag won't get anything and

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.840 
hunting the stag won't get anything and
we<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.530> condense<00:01:01.800> all<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.190> information<00:01:02.699> to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
we can condense all this information to

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.149 
we can condense all this information to
the<00:01:02.940> matrix<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.390> your<00:01:03.539> screen<00:01:03.809> when<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.860> solved

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
the matrix on your screen when we solved

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.530 
the matrix on your screen when we solved
the<00:01:05.280> prisoner's<00:01:05.640> dilemma<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:06.180> check<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.510> see

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the prisoner's dilemma we check to see

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.240 
the prisoner's dilemma we check to see
if<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:06.900> strategy<00:01:07.229> was<00:01:07.619> always<00:01:08.010> better

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
if one strategy was always better

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.740 
if one strategy was always better
regardless<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:09.030> what<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.210> other<00:01:09.330> player<00:01:09.570> was

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
regardless of what the other player was

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.960 
regardless of what the other player was
doing<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.890> let's<00:01:11.040> see<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.400> dominant

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
doing so let's see if this dominant

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.840 
doing so let's see if this dominant
solution<00:01:12.390> concept<00:01:12.780> works<00:01:13.020> here

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
solution concept works here

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.249 
solution concept works here
well<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:14.970> player<00:01:15.180> 2<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.780> hunt<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.020> stag

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
well if player 2 is going to hunt a stag

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.350 
well if player 2 is going to hunt a stag
player<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.340> should<00:01:17.520> go<00:01:17.610> after<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.909> stag<00:01:18.210> as

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
player one should go after a stag as

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.410 
player one should go after a stag as
well<00:01:18.540> since<00:01:18.900> 3<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.140> greater<00:01:19.409> than<00:01:19.500> 2<00:01:20.330> but<00:01:21.330> if

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
well since 3 is greater than 2 but if

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.420 
well since 3 is greater than 2 but if

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
player 2 is going after rabbits player 1

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.700 
player 2 is going after rabbits player 1
should<00:01:23.640> hunt<00:01:23.850> rabbits<00:01:24.060> as<00:01:24.360> well<00:01:24.509> since<00:01:25.229> 1<00:01:25.530> is

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
should hunt rabbits as well since 1 is

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.910 
should hunt rabbits as well since 1 is
greater<00:01:25.830> than<00:01:26.040> 0<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:28.020> sometimes<00:01:28.409> player<00:01:28.680> 1

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
greater than 0 so sometimes player 1

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.440 
greater than 0 so sometimes player 1
prefers<00:01:29.280> hunting<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.670> stag<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:29.939> other<00:01:30.240> times

dominant<00:01:33.119> solution<00:01:33.479> concept<00:01:33.960> isn't

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
dominant solution concept isn't

consequently we must introduce another

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.060 
consequently we must introduce another

the others are doing and there's a rule

the others are doing and there's a rule
that<00:01:56.790> says<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.210> at<00:01:57.570> least<00:01:57.840> one<00:01:58.170> Nash

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
that says that at least one Nash

games so what does this mean well let's

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.800

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729

player two is hunting a stag player one

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.600 
player two is hunting a stag player one
can<00:02:28.930> hunt<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.140> stag<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.500> get<00:02:29.620> three-peat<00:02:30.160> three

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
can hunt a stag and get three-peat three

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.270 
can hunt a stag and get three-peat three
pieces<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.910> meat<00:02:31.440> but<00:02:32.440> if<00:02:32.530> he<00:02:32.620> chooses<00:02:32.860> to

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
pieces of meat but if he chooses to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.830 
pieces of meat but if he chooses to
deviate<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.850> go<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.000> rabbit<00:02:34.360> they'll<00:02:34.690> only

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
deviate and go to rabbit they'll only

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.570 
deviate and go to rabbit they'll only
get<00:02:35.050> two<00:02:35.260> out<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.560> deal<00:02:35.710> which<00:02:35.890> means<00:02:36.100> he

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
get two out of the deal which means he

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.790 
get two out of the deal which means he
much<00:02:36.880> prefers<00:02:37.270> going<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.870> get<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.320> stag<00:02:38.530> than

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
much prefers going to get the stag than

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.000 
much prefers going to get the stag than
trying<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.400> switch<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.910> getting<00:02:40.240> a<00:02:40.300> rabbit<00:02:41.010> now

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
trying to switch to getting a rabbit now

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.680 
trying to switch to getting a rabbit now
we<00:02:42.070> check<00:02:42.310> on<00:02:42.430> player<00:02:42.610> two<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.000> as<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.570> can

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
we check on player two and as you can

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.420 
we check on player two and as you can
see<00:02:43.810> this<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.200> same<00:02:44.380> thing<00:02:44.650> she<00:02:45.340> would

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
see this is the same thing she would

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.100 
see this is the same thing she would
want<00:02:45.490> to<00:02:45.700> hunt<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.940> stag<00:02:46.180> given<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:46.990> player

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
want to hunt a stag given that player

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.430 
want to hunt a stag given that player
one<00:02:47.530> will<00:02:47.770> be<00:02:47.890> hunting<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.190> stag<00:02:48.430> with<00:02:48.670> her

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
one will be hunting a stag with her

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.680 
one will be hunting a stag with her
so<00:02:50.440> stag<00:02:50.680> stag<00:02:50.710> is<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.190> nash<00:02:51.400> equilibrium<00:02:51.690> but

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
so stag stag is a nash equilibrium but

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.940 
so stag stag is a nash equilibrium but
there<00:02:52.840> may<00:02:52.930> be<00:02:52.960> more<00:02:53.260> than<00:02:53.350> one<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:53.770> we're<00:02:53.890> not

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
there may be more than one so we're not

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:54.540 
there may be more than one so we're not
done<00:02:54.190> yet

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
done yet

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.100 
done yet
we<00:02:54.820> need<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.030> still<00:02:55.330> check<00:02:55.360> on<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.810> rest<00:02:55.960> of

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
we need to still check on the rest of

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.860 
we need to still check on the rest of
the<00:02:56.170> outcomes<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:58.150> let's<00:02:58.300> say<00:02:58.390> player<00:02:58.600> 2<00:02:58.810> is

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
the outcomes so let's say player 2 is

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.600 
the outcomes so let's say player 2 is
hunting<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.200> stag<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.560> player<00:02:59.740> 1<00:03:00.010> is<00:03:00.250> rabbit

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
hunting a stag and player 1 is rabbit

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.370 
hunting a stag and player 1 is rabbit
hunting<00:03:00.910> again<00:03:01.480> we<00:03:01.600> have<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:01.810> ask<00:03:01.930> if<00:03:02.140> either

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
hunting again we have to ask if either

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.510 
hunting again we have to ask if either
player<00:03:02.680> would<00:03:02.890> want<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.100> change<00:03:03.280> their

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
player would want to change their

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.010 
player would want to change their
strategy<00:03:03.760> given<00:03:04.450> what<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.690> other<00:03:04.720> one<00:03:04.930> is

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
strategy given what the other one is

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.170 
strategy given what the other one is
currently<00:03:05.320> doing<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:06.610> we<00:03:06.700> can<00:03:06.820> see<00:03:06.910> here<00:03:07.060> that

well this is the proof of player 1 and
this<00:03:56.860> is<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.100> proof<00:03:57.280> for<00:03:57.310> player<00:03:57.610> 2<00:03:58.380> this

leaves us with two equilibria stag stag
and<00:04:02.170> rabbit<00:04:02.530> rabbit

and rabbit rabbit

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.100 
and rabbit rabbit
obviously<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.090> stag<00:04:04.300> stag<00:04:04.330> outcome<00:04:04.990> is

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
obviously the stag stag outcome is

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.690 
obviously the stag stag outcome is
better<00:04:05.200> for<00:04:05.440> both<00:04:05.500> players<00:04:05.800> but<00:04:06.459> that<00:04:06.580> does

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
better for both players but that does

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.100 
better for both players but that does
not<00:04:06.730> change<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:07.240> fact<00:04:07.480> that<00:04:07.630> you<00:04:07.840> wouldn't

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
not change the fact that you wouldn't

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.930 
not change the fact that you wouldn't

both<00:04:10.120> playing<00:04:10.420> rabbit<00:04:10.930> rabbit<00:04:11.400> consequently

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
both playing rabbit rabbit consequently

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.400 
both playing rabbit rabbit consequently
actors<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.090> situations<00:04:13.600> like<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.930> stag<00:04:14.200> hunt

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
actors and situations like the stag hunt

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.110 
actors and situations like the stag hunt
will<00:04:14.709> go<00:04:14.800> to<00:04:14.860> great<00:04:15.100> lengths<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:15.520> communicate

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
will go to great lengths to communicate

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.280 
will go to great lengths to communicate
that<00:04:16.270> they<00:04:16.330> want<00:04:16.510> to<00:04:16.570> converge<00:04:16.840> on<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.049> stag

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
that they want to converge on the stag

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.710 
that they want to converge on the stag
stag<00:04:17.400> equilibrium<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.580> thus<00:04:19.090> avoid<00:04:19.540> the

stag equilibrium and thus avoid the

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.300 
stag equilibrium and thus avoid the
