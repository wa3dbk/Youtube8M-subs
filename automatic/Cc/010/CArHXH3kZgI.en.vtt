this is really cool it will ricochet off
the<00:01:53.460> building<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.500> then<00:01:55.500> through<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.700> window

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the building and then through the window

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.940 
the building and then through the window
and<00:01:57.920> after<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> guy<00:01:59.180> so<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.950> really

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
and after the guy so that is a really

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.830 
and after the guy so that is a really
cool<00:02:02.159> throat<00:02:02.460> probably<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> most<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.540> put<00:02:03.689> one

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
cool throat probably the most of put one

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810 
cool throat probably the most of put one
but<00:02:04.020> my<00:02:04.140> personal<00:02:04.590> favorite<00:02:04.950> now<00:02:05.610> let's<00:02:05.729> have

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
but my personal favorite now let's have

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.449 
but my personal favorite now let's have
a<00:02:05.939> flag<00:02:06.180> see<00:02:06.540> now<00:02:07.439> flags<00:02:07.740> use<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> little<00:02:08.280> weird

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
a flag see now flags use a little weird

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.999 
a flag see now flags use a little weird
as<00:02:08.610> well<00:02:08.819> I'm<00:02:09.119> not<00:02:09.270> going<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.539> lie<00:02:09.860> but<00:02:10.860> it's

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
as well I'm not going to lie but it's

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.680 
as well I'm not going to lie but it's
probably<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.550> best<00:02:11.610> way<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:11.940> get<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.330> if<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.569> we

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
probably the best way to get it if so we

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.150 
probably the best way to get it if so we
want<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.959> do<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.260> walk<00:02:13.440> up<00:02:13.650> here<00:02:13.860> and
