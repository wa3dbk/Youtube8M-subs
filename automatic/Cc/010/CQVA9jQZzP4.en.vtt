00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
dealership to get it I've already had

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.030 
dealership to get it I've already had
this<00:00:53.530> installed<00:00:53.800> for<00:00:54.160> about<00:00:54.910> a<00:00:54.940> month<00:00:55.180> or<00:00:55.390> so

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.400 
this installed for about a month or so
but<00:00:57.040> anyway<00:00:57.630> if<00:00:58.630> you<00:00:58.840> haven't<00:00:59.079> already<00:00:59.140> tried

but anyway if you haven't already tried
you're<00:00:59.680> going<00:00:59.800> to<00:00:59.860> figure<00:01:00.040> out<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:01.390> this

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
from this bumper for whatever reason I

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.530 
from this bumper for whatever reason I
do<00:01:06.220> not<00:01:06.310> know<00:01:06.610> why<00:01:06.760> Dodge<00:01:07.000> made<00:01:07.270> it<00:01:07.390> that

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
it's connected to the bumper before I

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.830 
it's connected to the bumper before I
went<00:04:12.489> to<00:04:12.549> Dodge<00:04:12.790> Charger<00:04:13.299> for<00:04:13.480> me<00:04:13.599> to<00:04:13.660> figure

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
went to Dodge Charger for me to figure

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.659 
went to Dodge Charger for me to figure
out<00:04:13.989> how<00:04:14.109> to<00:04:14.139> get<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.560> grille<00:04:14.950> emblem<00:04:15.250> off<00:04:15.400> I

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
out how to get the grille emblem off I

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:17.729 
out how to get the grille emblem off I
try<00:04:16.209> my<00:04:16.359> best<00:04:16.389> run<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.870> pry<00:04:17.049> this<00:04:17.109> off<00:04:17.440> but<00:04:17.680> I

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
try my best run to pry this off but I

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.069 
try my best run to pry this off but I
think<00:04:17.950> it's<00:04:18.130> kind<00:04:18.400> of<00:04:18.489> hooked<00:04:19.389> up<00:04:19.570> into<00:04:19.780> the

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
think it's kind of hooked up into the

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.140 
think it's kind of hooked up into the
grill<00:04:20.650> here<00:04:20.919> so<00:04:21.519> it's<00:04:21.640> going<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:21.820> be<00:04:21.909> kind<00:04:22.090> of

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
grill here so it's going to be kind of

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.050 
grill here so it's going to be kind of
hard<00:04:22.360> to<00:04:22.530> get<00:04:23.530> this<00:04:23.650> off<00:04:23.890> without<00:04:24.580> taking<00:04:25.000> the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
hard to get this off without taking the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.600 
hard to get this off without taking the
whole<00:04:25.240> bumper<00:04:25.419> off

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
whole bumper off

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.940 
whole bumper off
this<00:04:27.610> is<00:04:27.790> why<00:04:27.940> we're<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:29.050> kind<00:04:29.350> of<00:04:29.410> marked<00:04:29.680> up<00:04:29.800> my

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
this is why we're I kind of marked up my

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.220 
this is why we're I kind of marked up my
bumper<00:04:30.250> a<00:04:30.280> little<00:04:30.580> bit<00:04:30.730> trying<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.810> get<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:32.080> off

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
bumper a little bit trying to get it off

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.440
