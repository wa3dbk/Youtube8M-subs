and<00:02:56.200> just<00:02:56.320> to<00:02:56.500> prove<00:02:56.650> it's<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.040> right<00:02:57.250> size<00:02:57.280> I

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
and just to prove it's the right size I

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.259 
and just to prove it's the right size I
go<00:02:59.470> for<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.769> long<00:02:59.980> length<00:03:00.280> put<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.030> over<00:03:01.120> my
