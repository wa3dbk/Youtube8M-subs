00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.900 

I<00:02:53.510> remember<00:02:54.470> when<00:02:54.709> I<00:02:54.739> did<00:02:55.099> this<00:02:55.280> mission<00:02:55.760> on

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
I remember when I did this mission on

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.960 
I remember when I did this mission on
PSP<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.870> while<00:02:57.110> back<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.800> couple<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.400> years<00:02:58.459> ago<00:02:58.940> I

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
PSP a while back a couple of years ago I

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.780 
PSP a while back a couple of years ago I
found<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.750> pretty<00:03:00.709> difficult<00:03:01.069> and<00:03:01.489> tricky

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
found it pretty difficult and tricky

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.720 
found it pretty difficult and tricky
because<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.959> controls<00:03:03.410> are<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:03.920> sensitive<00:03:04.489> on

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
because the controls are so sensitive on

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.759 
because the controls are so sensitive on
PSP<00:03:05.090> well<00:03:05.510> there<00:03:05.660> are<00:03:05.750> pretty<00:03:06.050> sensitive<00:03:06.349> on

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
PSP well there are pretty sensitive on

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.970 
PSP well there are pretty sensitive on
PlayStation<00:03:07.370> through<00:03:07.550> this<00:03:07.670> file<00:03:07.970> button

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
PlayStation through this file button

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.970 
PlayStation through this file button
as<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.190> can<00:03:10.340> see<00:03:10.610> but<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:11.470> found<00:03:12.470> this<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.890> be

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
as you can see but I found this to be

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.400 
as you can see but I found this to be
pretty<00:03:13.370> difficult<00:03:13.730> on<00:03:14.090> PSP<00:03:14.480> took<00:03:14.930> me<00:03:15.110> a<00:03:15.140> while

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
pretty difficult on PSP took me a while

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:27.850 
pretty difficult on PSP took me a while
before<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.920> actually<00:03:16.099> passed<00:03:16.610> it

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.130 

mr.<00:03:28.460> packets<00:03:28.880> again

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
mr. packets again

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.110 
mr. packets again
oh<00:03:30.260> great<00:03:30.950> they're<00:03:31.130> actually<00:03:31.460> disappearing

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
oh great they're actually disappearing

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.650 
oh great they're actually disappearing
as<00:03:32.240> well<00:03:33.160> so<00:03:34.160> you<00:03:34.280> need<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.520> be<00:03:34.640> quite<00:03:35.030> fast

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
as well so you need to be quite fast

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:47.110 
as well so you need to be quite fast
I<00:03:36.400> also<00:03:37.400> disappeared

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.910 

so<00:03:47.720> you're<00:03:47.900> probably<00:03:48.230> going<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.530> fill<00:03:48.769> the

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
so you're probably going to fill the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.470 
so you're probably going to fill the
mission<00:03:49.280> if<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.400> don't<00:03:49.700> pick<00:03:49.970> up<00:03:50.000> enough

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
mission if you don't pick up enough

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.180 
mission if you don't pick up enough
packages

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.060 

so<00:03:56.610> just<00:03:56.850> pick<00:03:57.060> up<00:03:57.180> as<00:03:57.360> many<00:03:57.630> as<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:57.960> can<00:03:58.200> keep

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
so just pick up as many as you can keep

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.199 
so just pick up as many as you can keep
following<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.730> tree

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
following the tree

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.559 
following the tree
it's<00:04:00.689> really<00:04:00.989> all<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:01.230> can<00:04:01.349> say<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.739> you<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:03.420> if

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
it's really all I can say to you and if

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.539 
it's really all I can say to you and if
you're<00:04:03.719> playing<00:04:03.959> on<00:04:04.170> PSP<00:04:04.530> yourself<00:04:05.250> and

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
you're playing on PSP yourself and

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.220 
you're playing on PSP yourself and
you're<00:04:05.730> fine<00:04:05.969> to<00:04:06.150> controls<00:04:06.569> also<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:07.049> be

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
you're fine to controls also to be

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.209 
you're fine to controls also to be
pretty<00:04:07.590> sensitive<00:04:08.930> all<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:09.959> really<00:04:10.469> can<00:04:10.650> say<00:04:10.920> is

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:11.219 
pretty sensitive all I really can say is

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:16.150 
pretty sensitive all I really can say is
practice<00:04:12.150> makes<00:04:12.180> perfect

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.469 

I'm<00:04:17.160> not<00:04:17.340> really<00:04:17.579> being<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.120> best<00:04:18.329> example

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
I'm not really being the best example

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:32.800 
I'm not really being the best example
myself<00:04:19.410> here<00:04:19.739> as<00:04:19.919> well

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.210
