all the time if you've seen any of my

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.740 
all the time if you've seen any of my
other<00:00:48.100> videos<00:00:48.280> you've<00:00:49.180> seen<00:00:49.239> this<00:00:49.570> thing

other videos you've seen this thing
along<00:00:49.930> with<00:00:49.989> me<00:00:50.350> on<00:00:50.379> my<00:00:50.649> trips<00:00:50.979> use<00:00:51.789> it<00:00:51.940> all

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
along with me on my trips use it all

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.169 
along with me on my trips use it all
four<00:00:52.269> seasons<00:00:52.750> and<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:54.489> done<00:00:54.670> right<00:00:54.850> by<00:00:55.000> me

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
four seasons and it's done right by me

four seasons and it's done right by me
so<00:00:55.449> I<00:00:55.660> thought<00:00:55.929> it<00:00:56.079> deserved<00:00:56.350> a<00:00:56.440> little<00:00:56.649> show

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
so I thought it deserved a little show

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:04.950 
so I thought it deserved a little show
itself

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.820

over<00:01:22.640> some<00:01:22.670> of<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:22.970> specs<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:23.810> features<00:01:23.840> here

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
over some of the specs and features here

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.050 
over some of the specs and features here
I<00:01:25.869> got<00:01:26.869> first<00:01:27.110> up<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:27.770> pillar<00:01:28.130> on<00:01:28.340> this<00:01:28.490> bag<00:01:28.700> is

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
I got first up the pillar on this bag is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.440 
I got first up the pillar on this bag is
synthetic<00:01:29.960> like<00:01:30.229> I<00:01:30.380> said<00:01:30.650> and<00:01:31.310> it's<00:01:31.970> I<00:01:32.300> think

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
synthetic like I said and it's I think

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.930 
synthetic like I said and it's I think
they<00:01:32.660> call<00:01:32.840> it<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:32.960> hibernate<00:01:33.410> extreme<00:01:34.130> seems

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
they call it the hibernate extreme seems

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.130 
they call it the hibernate extreme seems
to<00:01:35.060> be<00:01:35.150> pretty<00:01:35.300> good<00:01:35.540> stuff

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
to be pretty good stuff

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.730 
to be pretty good stuff
babs<00:01:36.619> rated<00:01:37.130> at<00:01:37.340> 20<00:01:37.970> degrees<00:01:38.330> and<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:39.380> ride

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
babs rated at 20 degrees and I ride

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.460 
babs rated at 20 degrees and I ride
probably<00:01:40.310> from<00:01:40.759> my<00:01:40.910> experience<00:01:41.509> wouldn't<00:01:41.869> go

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
probably from my experience wouldn't go

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.160 
probably from my experience wouldn't go
quite<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.920> low<00:01:43.100> with<00:01:43.850> just<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.240> pad<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.960> bag

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
quite that low with just the pad the bag

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.650 
quite that low with just the pad the bag
and<00:01:45.680> a<00:01:46.040> light<00:01:46.220> base<00:01:46.520> later<00:01:46.790> on<00:01:47.000> I<00:01:47.300> can<00:01:47.390> go

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
and a light base later on I can go

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.710 
and a light base later on I can go
comfortably<00:01:48.050> around<00:01:49.270> just<00:01:50.270> above<00:01:50.540> the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
comfortably around just above the

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.270 
comfortably around just above the
freezing<00:01:50.960> mark<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:51.530> you<00:01:51.710> know<00:01:51.800> thirty<00:01:52.040> to

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
freezing mark so you know thirty to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.820 
freezing mark so you know thirty to
thirty<00:01:52.520> five<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:53.210> that's<00:01:53.360> comfortable<00:01:53.869> I

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
thirty five and that's comfortable I

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.639 
thirty five and that's comfortable I
definitely<00:01:55.460> could<00:01:55.910> take<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.360> down<00:01:56.540> to<00:01:56.960> 20<00:01:57.320> but

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
definitely could take it down to 20 but

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.800 
definitely could take it down to 20 but
I<00:01:57.979> wouldn't<00:01:58.670> want<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:58.940> without<00:01:59.300> a<00:01:59.360> liner<00:01:59.630> or

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
I wouldn't want to without a liner or

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.529 
I wouldn't want to without a liner or
something<00:02:00.229> else<00:02:00.320> going<00:02:00.649> on<00:02:00.740> there

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
something else going on there

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.980 
something else going on there
that's<00:02:02.539> just<00:02:02.720> my<00:02:02.869> my<00:02:03.410> experience<00:02:04.690> it<00:02:05.690> packs

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
that's just my my experience it packs

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.699 
that's just my my experience it packs
down<00:02:06.259> to<00:02:06.530> about<00:02:08.679> about<00:02:09.679> 15<00:02:10.549> by<00:02:10.729> 7<00:02:10.790> inches

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
down to about about 15 by 7 inches

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.110 
down to about about 15 by 7 inches
without<00:02:12.709> it<00:02:13.010> press<00:02:13.400> it's<00:02:13.610> got<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> really<00:02:13.910> good

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
without it press it's got a really good

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.120 
without it press it's got a really good
compression<00:02:14.660> bag<00:02:14.810> on<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.019> though<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.799> so<00:02:16.040> you

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
compression bag on it though and so you

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.910 
compression bag on it though and so you
can<00:02:16.250> really<00:02:16.430> cram<00:02:16.880> this<00:02:17.090> thing<00:02:17.299> down<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:18.350> I

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
can really cram this thing down and I

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.000 
can really cram this thing down and I
use<00:02:19.519> a<00:02:19.549> day<00:02:20.150> pack<00:02:20.480> for<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.870> lot<00:02:20.989> of<00:02:21.019> my<00:02:21.170> trips<00:02:21.530> and

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
use a day pack for a lot of my trips and

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.130 
use a day pack for a lot of my trips and
missing<00:02:22.459> rides<00:02:22.700> in<00:02:22.910> there<00:02:23.120> with<00:02:23.870> my<00:02:23.989> other

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
missing rides in there with my other

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.289 
missing rides in there with my other
gear<00:02:24.380> pretty<00:02:24.560> well<00:02:24.799> so<00:02:25.250> hack<00:02:25.850> ability<00:02:26.239> is

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
gear pretty well so hack ability is

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.720 
gear pretty well so hack ability is
pretty<00:02:26.510> good<00:02:26.630> on<00:02:26.690> it<00:02:27.340> it's<00:02:28.340> probably<00:02:28.519> not

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
pretty good on it it's probably not

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.640 
pretty good on it it's probably not
comparable<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.750> some<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.080> good<00:02:30.200> down<00:02:30.380> bags

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
comparable to some of the good down bags

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.350 
comparable to some of the good down bags
out<00:02:30.890> there<00:02:30.920> as<00:02:31.280> far<00:02:31.430> as<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:32.060> know<00:02:32.150> pack

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360
