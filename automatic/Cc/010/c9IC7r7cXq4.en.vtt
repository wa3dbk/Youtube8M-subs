just a couple tablespoons and then you
want<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.580> mix<00:04:18.820> I'm<00:04:19.060> using<00:04:19.299> my<00:04:19.480> handy<00:04:19.810> dandy

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
want to mix I'm using my handy dandy

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.330 
want to mix I'm using my handy dandy
hand<00:04:20.320> mixer<00:04:20.590> here<00:04:20.799> and<00:04:20.890> because<00:04:21.070> there's<00:04:21.220> not

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
hand mixer here and because there's not

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.710 
hand mixer here and because there's not
a<00:04:21.400> lot<00:04:21.580> of<00:04:21.609> gradients<00:04:22.060> in<00:04:22.180> here<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.420> the<00:04:22.540> bowl

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
a lot of gradients in here and the bowl

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.690 
a lot of gradients in here and the bowl
is<00:04:22.840> pretty<00:04:23.050> small<00:04:23.320> I'm<00:04:23.650> just<00:04:24.130> gonna<00:04:24.220> use<00:04:24.490> one

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
is pretty small I'm just gonna use one

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:32.910 
is pretty small I'm just gonna use one
of<00:04:25.600> these<00:04:31.020> so<00:04:32.020> this<00:04:32.230> is<00:04:32.380> what<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.590> mixture

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
of these so this is what the mixture

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.350 
of these so this is what the mixture
looks<00:04:33.070> like<00:04:33.280> I<00:04:33.430> ended<00:04:33.610> up<00:04:33.700> using<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.090> full

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
looks like I ended up using the full

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.150 
looks like I ended up using the full
banana<00:04:34.570> because<00:04:35.020> a<00:04:35.200> half<00:04:35.440> a<00:04:35.530> banana<00:04:35.650> wasn't

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
banana because a half a banana wasn't

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.830 
banana because a half a banana wasn't
enough<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:36.850> I<00:04:36.940> think<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.180> poured<00:04:37.420> a<00:04:37.480> little<00:04:37.600> bit

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
enough and I think I poured a little bit

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.420 
enough and I think I poured a little bit
too<00:04:37.960> much<00:04:38.080> beer<00:04:38.350> so<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:38.680> would<00:04:38.950> suggest<00:04:39.100> a<00:04:39.340> few
