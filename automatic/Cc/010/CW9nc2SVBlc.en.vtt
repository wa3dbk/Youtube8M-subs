00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.019
 hello live mobile games reviews 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.960
 from mob uay and at the microphone i am a mordik so 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.480
 what went today we have a game under 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.310
 the name of the bounty arm as well as heard it 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.650
 I immediately introduced the name 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.410
 of some kind of edward hand bound 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.420
 but unfortunately the game nanny is such 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.150
 arcade three-dimensional shooter from the third 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.579
 Persons with whom we have to play for 1 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.130
 from 3 very colorful characters 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.960
 the plot here is habitual lack but 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.820
 for some reason, how to grow it is not really 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.800
 straining and indeed it is not too 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.230
 probably because probably the game is 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.329
 much like the good old arcade 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.160
 those times when three-dimensional still 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.309
 just entered our game 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.340
 life and gameplay was more important than the plot here 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.440
 true graphics here are better than then 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.090
 by the way about the graphics here are separate 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.460
 as for the game that is if your 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.250
 The device is the tiger grafon 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.350
 will be much better than without it 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.689
 now let's take a look at the whole 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.400
 gameplay we begin as I already 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.650
 spoke from character selection 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.600
 we have three of them is some kind of frog 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.150
 which reminded me of something dudes is 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.729
 born that man cigar similar torino 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.689
 Wolverine either stick bulletstorm 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.790
 and the third hero 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.799
 a robot that looks like some old 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.210
 satellite as you see heroes like 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.939
 original but at the same time 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.250
 traceable and secondary well so 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.410
 traced 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.170
 by the way, you can buy your character 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.060
 also the assistant each has three slots 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.370
 under any animals that will 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.740
 to help the game animals are bought for 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.080
 rubies and rubies themselves and all pretty 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.240
 rare well now actually about the game 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.340
 general gameplay as in any such 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.830
 the game boils down to pass out 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.750
 points a to point b on the road breaking through 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.570
 through flocks of enemies and trying not 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.000
 die on the way collect coins hello 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.860
 Mary sometimes there are chests to 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.050
 open which need to spend part 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.240
 These same coins are usually a waste 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.850
 justified by all sorts of nishtyak who 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.050
 drop out of the chest the battle is divided into 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.540
 near and far 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.450
 ranged heroes shoot naturally 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.489
 each his own gun but his neighbors do not understand 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.650
 where does the huge laser come from 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.350
 fly swatter control again 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.270
 standard joystick on the left 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.970
 the only item deserving 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.220
 of special attention this is a super blows to 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.590
 each hero has his own super 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.040
 an attack that hurts everyone 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.100
 around 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.530
 but such an attack is worth let's call it manna 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.930
 so that the habitual mana ends and 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.530
 they can be replenished by the same bonuses from 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.650
 chests 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.720
 Well, let's go to the results of good pros 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.780
 the graphics and the characters themselves all the same 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.549
 pretty funny cons but then I even 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.200
 I do not know I wanted to shove out of habit 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.720
 lack of plot but changed my mind 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.580
 fixed camera that's a minus one 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.980
 sides if she turned for 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.200
 the character would be easier to get lost but 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.420
 on the other trees are constantly 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.000
 strove to close the review I do not really 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.250
 liked the short game is not bad 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.709
 but personally, I have no desire to return 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.290
 days after i turn it off 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.510
 but this is just my opinion on today 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.640
