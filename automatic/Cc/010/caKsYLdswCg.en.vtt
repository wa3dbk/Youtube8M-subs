lets you use an SD card for floppy disk
images<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:16.170> see<00:00:16.350> up<00:00:16.470> here<00:00:16.500> at<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> top

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
images and you see up here at the top

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.130 
images and you see up here at the top
you<00:00:17.279> have<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.430> regular<00:00:17.820> floppy<00:00:18.119> disk<00:00:18.480> cable

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140

this<00:00:19.890> device<00:00:20.250> can<00:00:20.490> emulate<00:00:20.760> two<00:00:21.300> drives<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.529> if

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
this device can emulate two drives so if

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.500 
this device can emulate two drives so if
you<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.279> like<00:00:23.400> an<00:00:23.519> Amiga<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:23.970> example<00:00:24.420> you

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
you have like an Amiga for example you

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.420 
you have like an Amiga for example you
could<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.779> DF<00:00:25.050> 0<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.439> DF<00:00:25.650> 1<00:00:25.890> or<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.400> a

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
could do DF 0 and DF 1 or if you have a

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.570 
could do DF 0 and DF 1 or if you have a
TI<00:00:26.699> 99<00:00:27.359> for<00:00:27.660> example<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.289> can<00:00:28.470> do<00:00:28.619> des<00:00:28.980> K<00:00:29.189> 1<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
TI 99 for example you can do des K 1 and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.900 
TI 99 for example you can do des K 1 and
D<00:00:29.670> s<00:00:29.820> K<00:00:30.029> 2<00:00:30.199> you<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.590> also<00:00:31.710> do<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.309> colon<00:00:32.669> and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
D s K 2 you can also do like a colon and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.900 
D s K 2 you can also do like a colon and
B<00:00:33.059> colon<00:00:33.450> if<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> PC<00:00:34.790> takes<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
B colon if you have a PC takes a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.459 
B colon if you have a PC takes a
standard<00:00:36.360> three<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.750> half<00:00:36.870> inch<00:00:37.110> power

and so I'm gonna hit enter but first
we're<00:01:50.580> gonna<00:01:51.170> see<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.260> I<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.500> get<00:01:52.650> this<00:01:52.800> back

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
we're gonna see if I can get this back

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:03.890 
we're gonna see if I can get this back
and<00:01:53.190> focus<00:01:53.430> here<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:03.030> see<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.420> even<00:02:03.540> held<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
and focus here and see it even held the

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.999 
and focus here and see it even held the
speaker<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.380> here<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> don't<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:04.950> you

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
speaker in here I don't know if you

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.800 
speaker in here I don't know if you
heard<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.280> clicks<00:02:05.520> or<00:02:05.670> not<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.060> here<00:02:06.479> back<00:02:06.630> on

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.040 
heard the clicks or not but here back on
the<00:02:06.900> TI<00:02:10.580> here<00:02:11.580> it's<00:02:11.730> loading<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.209> letters<00:02:12.930> of

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
the TI here it's loading the letters of

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.729 
the TI here it's loading the letters of
music<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.810> I'm<00:02:15.930> not<00:02:16.050> gonna<00:02:16.140> make<00:02:16.320> you<00:02:16.380> listen

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
music and I'm not gonna make you listen

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.350 
music and I'm not gonna make you listen
to<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.920> whole<00:02:17.070> song<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:18.860> but<00:02:20.120> there's<00:02:21.120> two

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
to the whole song so but there's two

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.240 
to the whole song so but there's two
actually<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:22.020> couple<00:02:22.380> different<00:02:22.920> pieces<00:02:23.040> of

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
actually a couple different pieces of

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.550 
actually a couple different pieces of
software<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.120> have<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.390> utilize<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:25.410> get

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
software that you have to utilize to get

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.130 
software that you have to utilize to get
this<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:25.950> work<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:27.360> first<00:02:27.600> piece<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:27.959> software

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
this to work the first piece of software

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.780 
this to work the first piece of software
is<00:02:28.590> actually<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:28.950> floppy<00:02:29.220> converter<00:02:29.670> that

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
is actually a floppy converter that

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.070 
is actually a floppy converter that
converts<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.810> PC<00:02:31.350> 99<00:02:31.830> disc<00:02:32.160> images<00:02:32.730> over<00:02:33.390> to

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
converts the PC 99 disc images over to

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.190 
converts the PC 99 disc images over to
the<00:02:34.170> HFE<00:02:34.620> format<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.100> this<00:02:35.250> thing<00:02:35.489> expects

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
the HFE format that this thing expects

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.080 
the HFE format that this thing expects
and<00:02:37.200> there's<00:02:37.380> also<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.739> another<00:02:38.519> program<00:02:39.060> that

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
and there's also a another program that

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.570 
and there's also a another program that
actually<00:02:39.660> will<00:02:40.380> let<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.680> write<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.100> config

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
actually will let you write a config

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.090 
actually will let you write a config
file<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.690> root<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.140> sdcard<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.890> that

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
file to the root of the sdcard and that

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.910 
file to the root of the sdcard and that
and<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.489> thing<00:02:44.850> needs<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.810> config<00:02:46.380> file<00:02:46.650> in

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
and this thing needs the config file in

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.949 
and this thing needs the config file in
order<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.250> work<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:48.209> config<00:02:48.510> file<00:02:48.720> does

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
order to work and it config file does

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.050 
order to work and it config file does
things<00:02:49.260> like<00:02:49.410> sets<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.010> backlight<00:02:50.459> level<00:02:50.880> and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
things like sets the backlight level and

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.680 
things like sets the backlight level and
everything<00:02:51.390> else<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:52.530> notice<00:02:53.420> it's<00:02:54.420> kind<00:02:54.570> of

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
everything else you notice it's kind of

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.570 
everything else you notice it's kind of
hard<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.989> see<00:02:55.410> here<00:02:55.680> with<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:56.040> light<00:02:56.340> on

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
hard to see here with this light on

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.940 
hard to see here with this light on
right<00:02:56.880> here<00:02:57.330> but<00:02:57.750> there's<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.410> speaker<00:02:58.680> right

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
right here but there's a speaker right

two<00:03:21.209> different<00:03:21.510> areas<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.019> directory

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
two different areas of the directory

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.840 
two different areas of the directory
structure<00:03:22.790> it<00:03:23.790> supports<00:03:24.209> standard<00:03:24.420> fat32

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
structure it supports standard fat32

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.280 
structure it supports standard fat32
formatting<00:03:26.850> on<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.090> SD<00:03:27.420> card<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:27.870> SD<00:03:28.260> or

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.460 
formatting on the SD card of this SD or
SDHC<00:03:28.940> so<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.390> should<00:03:30.600> have<00:03:30.720> plenty<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.230> space

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
SDHC so you should have plenty of space

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.220 
SDHC so you should have plenty of space
to<00:03:31.530> put<00:03:31.709> your<00:03:32.120> floppy<00:03:33.120> disk<00:03:33.390> images<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.110> it

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.160 
to put your floppy disk images and it
supports<00:03:34.970> right<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.239> believe<00:03:36.420> on<00:03:36.810> everything

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
supports right I believe on everything

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.009 
supports right I believe on everything
except<00:03:37.530> Commodore<00:03:37.950> Amiga<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:39.750> know<00:03:39.840> one

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
except Commodore Amiga and you know one

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.360 
except Commodore Amiga and you know one
of<00:03:40.079> these<00:03:40.170> days<00:03:40.380> maybe<00:03:40.560> that'll<00:03:40.950> come<00:03:41.100> soon

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
of these days maybe that'll come soon

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.740 
of these days maybe that'll come soon
I'm<00:03:41.519> not<00:03:41.549> sure<00:03:41.880> but<00:03:42.120> here<00:03:42.269> on<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.390> TI<00:03:42.660> I

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
I'm not sure but here on the TI I

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.449 
I'm not sure but here on the TI I
haven't<00:03:43.230> tried<00:03:43.410> right<00:03:43.590> support<00:03:44.010> yet<00:03:44.190> but<00:03:44.370> it

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
haven't tried right support yet but it

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.850 
haven't tried right support yet but it
supposedly<00:03:44.880> has<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:46.190> but<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:48.769> you<00:03:49.769> know

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
supposedly has it but the you know

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.800 
supposedly has it but the you know
pretty<00:03:50.100> much<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.610> it's<00:03:50.850> got<00:03:51.180> its<00:03:51.540> got<00:03:51.750> some
