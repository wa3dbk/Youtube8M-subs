this<00:01:07.259> but<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.680> method<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.040> prefer<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.520> use<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.939> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
this but the method I prefer to use is a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.100 
this but the method I prefer to use is a
cordless<00:01:10.229> drill<00:01:10.729> because<00:01:11.729> cordless<00:01:12.659> drill<00:01:12.899> is

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
cordless drill because cordless drill is

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.590 
cordless drill because cordless drill is
a<00:01:13.920> nice<00:01:14.190> fast<00:01:14.550> tool<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.150> creates<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.570> very

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
a nice fast tool that creates a very

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.740 
a nice fast tool that creates a very
very<00:01:16.140> clean<00:01:16.530> hole<00:01:17.010> in<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.250> tree<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.729> tree<00:01:18.600> like

very clean hole in the tree a tree like

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.630 
very clean hole in the tree a tree like
this<00:01:18.900> should<00:01:19.110> produce<00:01:19.290> quite<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> few<00:01:20.310> litres

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
this should produce quite a few litres

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.760 
this should produce quite a few litres
of<00:01:20.790> SAP<00:01:21.030> large<00:01:21.810> damage<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.290> like<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.590> is

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
of SAP large damage on like this is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.100 
of SAP large damage on like this is
really<00:01:23.070> worth<00:01:23.220> having<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:23.940> you<00:01:24.420> don't

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
really worth having because you don't

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.270 
really worth having because you don't
want<00:01:25.260> a<00:01:25.320> small<00:01:25.560> container<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.159> will

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
want a small container that will

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.520 
want a small container that will
overflow<00:01:26.549> we're<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.450> make<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.750> hole<00:01:28.380> in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
overflow we're going to make the hole in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.710 
overflow we're going to make the hole in
the<00:01:28.620> tree<00:01:28.740> at<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.190> slightly<00:01:29.580> upward<00:01:30.180> angle<00:01:30.570> so

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
the tree at a slightly upward angle so

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.450 
the tree at a slightly upward angle so
I'm<00:01:30.810> holding<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> drill<00:01:31.620> so<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.310> can

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
I'm holding the drill so that I can

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.210 
I'm holding the drill so that I can
drill<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.210> slightly<00:01:33.630> upward<00:01:33.960> motion<00:01:37.220> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
drill in a slightly upward motion and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.180 
drill in a slightly upward motion and
put<00:01:38.430> my<00:01:39.080> piping<00:01:40.080> into<00:01:40.409> there<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.830> you<00:01:40.890> need<00:01:41.100> to

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
put my piping into there so you need to

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.390 
put my piping into there so you need to
have<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.369> reasonably<00:01:41.880> close<00:01:42.119> fit<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.229> a

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
have a reasonably close fit this is a

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.640 
have a reasonably close fit this is a
low<00:01:44.400> expense<00:01:44.850> lightweight<00:01:45.360> option<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.140> just

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
low expense lightweight option so just

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.730 
low expense lightweight option so just
use<00:01:46.799> old<00:01:47.190> water<00:01:47.729> bottles<00:01:48.150> two<00:01:49.110> litre<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.440> great

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
use old water bottles two litre a great

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.289 
use old water bottles two litre a great
then<00:01:50.070> maybe<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.729> need<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.909> check<00:01:51.119> them<00:01:51.270> a

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
then maybe you need to check them a

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.730 
then maybe you need to check them a
little<00:01:51.510> bit<00:01:51.630> more<00:01:51.810> often<00:01:51.960> than<00:01:52.260> a<00:01:52.350> damaged<00:01:52.619> one

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
little bit more often than a damaged one

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.649 
little bit more often than a damaged one
because<00:01:52.950> they're<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.280> bit<00:01:53.460> smaller<00:01:53.790> but<00:01:54.540> if

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
because they're that bit smaller but if

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.330 
because they're that bit smaller but if
you<00:01:54.720> strap<00:01:54.990> them<00:01:55.110> around<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.500> tree<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:56.040> puts

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
you strap them around the tree it puts

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.980 
you strap them around the tree it puts
tension<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.939> pipe<00:01:57.119> which<00:01:57.450> helps<00:01:57.900> to

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
tension on the pipe which helps to

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.660 
tension on the pipe which helps to
prevent<00:01:58.200> leaks<00:01:58.500> around<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.490> get<00:01:59.640> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
prevent leaks around it and you get a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.630 
prevent leaks around it and you get a
really<00:01:59.939> nice<00:02:00.060> flow<00:02:00.420> rate<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:00.780> well<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.640> this

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
really nice flow rate as well and this

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.429 
really nice flow rate as well and this
set<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.090> an<00:02:03.180> incredibly<00:02:03.689> rich<00:02:03.900> source<00:02:04.229> of

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
set is an incredibly rich source of

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.830 
set is an incredibly rich source of
vitamins<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:05.280> nutrients<00:02:05.820> which<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.630> tree

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
vitamins and nutrients which the tree

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.949 
vitamins and nutrients which the tree
uses<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.740> order<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.280> start<00:02:08.970> its<00:02:09.149> new<00:02:09.360> season<00:02:09.599> so

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
uses in order to start its new season so

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.479 
uses in order to start its new season so
it<00:02:10.080> starts<00:02:10.409> all<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.619> buds<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.189> the<00:02:11.280> leaves

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
it starts all the buds and the leaves

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.000 
it starts all the buds and the leaves
and<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:12.299> is<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> fuel<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:13.080> gets

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
and this is the fuel that gets

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.399 
and this is the fuel that gets
everything<00:02:14.280> going<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:15.239> before<00:02:15.599> we<00:02:16.019> leave<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
everything going and before we leave the

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.809 
everything going and before we leave the
tree<00:02:16.680> we<00:02:16.830> have<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.069> make<00:02:17.189> sure<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.370> we<00:02:17.549> seal

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
tree we have to make sure that we seal

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.429 
tree we have to make sure that we seal
up<00:02:17.939> the<00:02:18.060> hole<00:02:18.209> now<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.689> reason<00:02:18.989> for<00:02:19.169> that<00:02:19.230> is

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
up the hole now the reason for that is

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.929 
up the hole now the reason for that is
because<00:02:19.469> the<00:02:19.889> tree<00:02:20.099> will<00:02:20.249> effectively<00:02:20.549> bleed

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
because the tree will effectively bleed

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.190 
because the tree will effectively bleed
to<00:02:21.090> death<00:02:21.120> if<00:02:21.900> we<00:02:21.959> don't<00:02:22.169> and<00:02:22.499> also<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.889> allows

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
to death if we don't and also it allows

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.440 
to death if we don't and also it allows
infection<00:02:23.739> into<00:02:24.129> the<00:02:24.220> back<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:25.120> what<00:02:25.239> we<00:02:25.330> need

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
infection into the back so what we need

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.660 
infection into the back so what we need
to<00:02:25.540> do<00:02:25.660> is<00:02:25.810> cut<00:02:26.020> some<00:02:26.709> nice<00:02:26.860> pieces<00:02:27.099> of<00:02:27.250> hazel

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
to do is cut some nice pieces of hazel

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.119 
to do is cut some nice pieces of hazel
the<00:02:28.269> same<00:02:28.300> diameter<00:02:29.050> or<00:02:29.319> slightly<00:02:29.739> larger

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
the same diameter or slightly larger

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.680 
the same diameter or slightly larger
than<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.489> diameter<00:02:30.879> of<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.269> hole<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.480> we've

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
than the diameter of the hole that we've

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.570 
than the diameter of the hole that we've
drilled<00:02:31.870> in<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.110> tree<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:33.069> we<00:02:33.160> need<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.340> cut

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
drilled in the tree and we need to cut

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.630 
drilled in the tree and we need to cut
some<00:02:34.360> pegs<00:02:36.870> that's<00:02:37.870> properly<00:02:38.830> sealed<00:02:39.190> off<00:02:39.370> so

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
some pegs that's properly sealed off so

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.330 
some pegs that's properly sealed off so
it<00:02:39.819> can't<00:02:40.030> leak<00:02:40.239> anymore<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.830> also<00:02:41.830> prevents

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
it can't leak anymore and also prevents

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.190 
it can't leak anymore and also prevents
infection<00:02:42.880> getting<00:02:43.120> into<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.480> tree<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:43.930> the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
infection getting into the tree and the

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.120 
infection getting into the tree and the
tree<00:02:44.230> will<00:02:44.530> now<00:02:44.680> scab<00:02:45.519> over<00:02:45.849> cover<00:02:46.239> that<00:02:46.450> and

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
tree will now scab over cover that and

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.309 
tree will now scab over cover that and
it'll<00:02:48.130> be<00:02:48.190> good<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:48.370> next<00:02:48.700> year<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:49.200> that's<00:02:50.200> a

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
it'll be good for next year so that's a

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.410 
it'll be good for next year so that's a
perfectly<00:02:50.680> sealed

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
perfectly sealed

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.600 
perfectly sealed
tapping<00:02:52.420> hole<00:02:52.860> that's<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.980> proper<00:02:54.220> way<00:02:54.430> to

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
tapping hole that's the proper way to

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.280 
tapping hole that's the proper way to
