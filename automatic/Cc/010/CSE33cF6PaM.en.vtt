00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.980
 so good afternoon to all of us today and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.790
 help hurom juicers hom 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.940
 bf 04 we will make celery juice i 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.680
 I know that many people in the village of hundreds 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:36.300
 Immediately warn you that celery separately 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.440
 how to juice if you squeeze the juice out of it is better 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.309
 mix it up with some others 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.769
 fruit vegetables but do not drink it separately 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.899
 because it is very specific 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.730
 the smell is very specific taste therefore 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.290
 just survive the glass and drink it 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.640
 very very difficult then or 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:56.460
 can't look at that celery yeah 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.780
 one more recommendation on how 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.809
 squeeze celery juice 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.989
 I recommend squeezing the juice out at the end. 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.600
 celery because celery itself 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.520
 imagine the product is very fibrous and if 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.320
 squeeze it right at the beginning it is a little bit 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.020
 cakes out of the cake, that is, we all 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.970
 Equal goes but better if it is in 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.569
 late you first we squeeze the juice out 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.369
 apples and carrots and now we are ahead 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:21.780
 also to the section when we will do 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.770
 mixes, that is, show how it works 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.470
 valve in action apple we have here 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.130
 have granny 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.110
 Well, or similar to the extremely carrot 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.300
 sliced ​​again in two ways here 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.270
 such long slices and round tops and 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.979
 celery from we barely chopped on 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.170
 immediately that celery need quite 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.630
 slightly it gives a very strong smell 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.599
 that's why that's literally what you 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.340
 cut even this will be much so 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:53.270
 go 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.270
 turned on us manual juicer 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.380
 strainer there is fine black in color 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.020
 orange strainer orange strainer we 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.020
 until we have chosen the side of the ridge 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.430
 thread valve is closed i now we do 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.580
 mix 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.630
 mix fruit in this case 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.630
 apple and carrot 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.450
 notice that the liquid is stained 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.639
 orange color on green 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.370
 first now it's evenly 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:34.139
 mix why do i open the valve because 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.909
 what if the magician is his valve then all these 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:38.340
 links will be mixed in layers already 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.200
 a cup that's not very good then 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.870
 have to spoon there spoon and fork 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.459
 interfere with something and at the same time the court 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.889
 will not receive exactly for this you need a fee 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.639
 to repeat evenly 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:52.680
 mix all juices to squeezer 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.389
 juicer holds more than 300 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.859
 milliliters i.e. about 300 50 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:58.590
 milliliters here 's a typo can 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:05.129
 contained, in principle, these are two glasses 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:07.889
 juice that is 2 people for 5 as possible 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:11.669
 make can make mix here mix 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:15.829
 pour it all into a cup close 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:15.829
 valve and continue to mix the juices 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:24.449
 like for example now there are about 200 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:27.049
 milliliters when i bring to 300 i'm all 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.049
 it's salt 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.650
 here now about 200 50 I add 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.330
 literally 3-4 slices of celery see 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.790
 how a screw juicer copes with 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.140
 celery in principle she is very good 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.410
 will cope with any greens 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:57.280
 be it cum pin be celery 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:58.810
 parsley dill cabbage and also juice from 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.940
 broccoli yes some love juice from 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.240
 Broccoli is highly normal to man 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.310
 handle out with these products 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.890
 see where it is hard to notice for 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.930
 lighting but basically there is a mass 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.670
 turned out to be very uniform in color and 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.310
 consistency that is, we merge everything 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:20.590
 it and now we cups evenly 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.519
 celery fresh mixed 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.519
 apples and carrots 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.650
 close the valve continue 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.630
 you can first apple and then carrot 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.290
 you can interfere with all this how I do it 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:44.200
 yes that is to throw carrot and apple 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.530
 alternately at your discretion somehow 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.530
 like 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.300
 recommendation if you do carrot 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.230
 celery juice is high if mixed 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.650
 you with fruit then fruit should be 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.970
 about 60 70 percent of the photos of vaz ok 30 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.180
 percent of vegetable juice 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.280
 over the recommendation of doctors nutritionists and and 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.380
 again we only have to add 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.380
 celery in this mix add 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.880
 there are two things 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.620
 auger juicer it all 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.620
 grind open the valve 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.290
 it all flows fine glass of juice into 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.360
 Basically all mixed connect 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.340
 celery juicer all left as 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.230
 and we cut here just 20 pen 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.660
 Well, these two lines for 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.030
 example yes and it is desirable to cut them here 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:46.050
 such slices can be a little more 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:50.610
 of course it takes it literally there 10 15 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.620
 seconds but so the deal will be easier at the end 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.240
 you can try to press a button 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.310
 the reverse which is ours on the list of nodes 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.230
 look left product colors 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.540
 Yes, in principle, here we have a little bit 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:06.090
 celery eat we stand keys ahead 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.490
 he earns up working on 5 this 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.020
 celery then hoofs just the goal 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.600
 village juice that is whether we open not 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.560
 opened the valve then it all with evenly 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.560
 would continue to mix 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.750
 turn off the juicer close the form 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.940
 so that all this does not drop it turned out very 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:28.340
 evenly and the mixture is very uniform 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:31.770
 mix of this orange green 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.340
 try pouring then there are no layers 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:41.880
 no juice separation here now 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:44.280
 No, I don’t know exactly what quantity 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:47.550
 fruit of vegetables here was nothing I can 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:52.170
 say but here we got 2 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:53.190
