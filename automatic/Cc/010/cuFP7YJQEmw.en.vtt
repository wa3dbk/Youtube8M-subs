00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.300
 of a red 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.619

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.539

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.029
 how bad i am recording with him on this 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.300
 moment since I just got the game new 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.940
 I already explained app and bla bla bla 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.670
 today so red to campsite in in fact 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.800
 it needs and 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.239
 play like an asphalt because of this 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.309
 moment happens for the people who are still 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.230
 they do not know what in fact and content 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.960
 there is a random in fact the person 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.870
 chosen animal and now round with a knife 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.519
 looking at us and once to us after 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.679
 We are also invested so what 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.819
 So his goal is to make the whole team what now 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.769
 still alive 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:58.569
 infected to make is my goal 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.999
 is to not be infected so me 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:02.050
 must protect myself as well as possible 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:04.570
 against all and emmys who do 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.430
 infected and so what happens is we 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.020
 they find the piece of previous c4th ready 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.850
 the claims are ready or how those things are 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.860
 also called in all videos 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.920
 and we who know this part of the folder 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.930
 we are now we 2 guests myself 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.880
 of course 3 so we love this thing 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.950
 I fully see that we ourselves 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.470
 there are four of this moment and what 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.920
 we do we defend this point and it 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.870
 keep doing it until we 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.640
 yes sort of like in a certain way 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.770
 find a balance so that they cannot us 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.960
 find we can fully stand you see 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.610
 that the teams are already spreading over 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.310
 him off among the very many people in that 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.590
 only ma therefore another side while 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.750
 you are still busy with the thief and 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.530
 the from this hill and here begins my 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.150
 very first yes kind of killstreak and 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.640
 it would be something the boys are 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.650
 just very first red toe strike 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.780
 to start and then just to get one right away 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.310
 campsite hello all sometimes it will be 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.200
 would succeed this par noble 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.090
 of course the are now on a four 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.530
 killstreak and cities have a want 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.990
 as you see with every kill 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.850
 a certain skill set at the dead 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.330
 silence wants a setpoint streak and we 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.069
 continue and of course we hope so 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.870
 wicam i would go get that kem strike that 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.459
 then my very first kem strike ever 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.150
 call of duty become ghosts and needed 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.579
 is and fr 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.560
 it is quite a tough challenge 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.970
 and where we survive this 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.530
 we get a specialist bonus with 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.150
 the are on a 9 killstreak and we go 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.730
 we by we will then pick it up there action 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.920
 starts to beat faster because that is 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.959
 what everyone always has or you want 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.030
 or not but if you are that close we are 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.530
 that kem strike we just enter your heart 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.390
 your throat starts to beat your hands 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.010
 shaking hands start to sweat 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.530
 You are going to focus more and more on the ear 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.970
 have survivor bonus 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.769
 more and more people are starting to get infected 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.349
 to touch we are just now 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.720
 the four or three of you and I leave 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.730
 we are already on a 13 killstreak 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.920
 14 kills I specialist bonus is there 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.879
 another one we are with the three 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.000
 about 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.440
 and you will find this hill hoping 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.269
 the best result we have one 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.680
 technology as you see because I stand 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.000
 this points that find while mine 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.470
 teammates put a different angle 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.859
 they think it and nobody in our back too 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.930
 come 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.069
 we keep going we keep exciting 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.659
 killer 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.739
 because what they do their throw technical 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.019
 in search and snow making them 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.730
 probably stretch around the corner you 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.620
 I so I keep protecting this corner 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.000
 are just the two of them oven 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.680
 no one can make a mistake but this is coming 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.209
 error is on the 16 killstreak I know 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.349
 not how good my other team is great 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:29.410
 but for me it is going very badly 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:31.239
 or 17 18 19 years 19 is within twenty 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.859
 2020 and my teammate are still alive 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.230
 looks good then it will be 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.329
 is it the first attempt at a kem 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.010
 become a strike and the red pen catches her 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:45.000
 22 double kill 55 x p23 now still need 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.530
 only 2 boys can reach 24 degrees 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.940
 25 have the kim strike in the first 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.180
 We try to turn the cams on 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.209
 teammate is killed and what goes 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.329
 I already succeed and I get in my back 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.150
 and he did but this was just the 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.829
 first try the first try him it 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.599
 whole fucking chem-dry while you get the 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.500
 campsite word tick in the 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.120
 background 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.859
 we get to see the gameplay and me 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.449
 do not know if he officially counts but 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.180
 you see it this is my gym strike 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:14.650
 first attempt and yes I have the tension 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.690
 yet you had built up nice 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.159
 I expect him would story well I in 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.109
 at least not I hope you are top 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:21.940
 found a like behind and rubbed it 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.570
 share with your homies and until the next 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.570
 times boys
