00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
as far as far as us I'm excited that it

as far as far as us I'm excited that it

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.010 
finished that way you know at first I
would<00:00:06.180> have<00:00:06.359> thought<00:00:06.450> it<00:00:06.600> was<00:00:06.690> better<00:00:06.899> to

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
would have thought it was better to

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.629 
would have thought it was better to
close<00:00:07.290> it<00:00:07.529> out<00:00:07.589> obviously<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:08.130> formatted<00:00:08.550> off

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639

has<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.940> pick<00:00:09.120> up<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.300> first<00:00:09.480> down<00:00:09.630> there<00:00:10.099> but<00:00:11.099> I

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
has to pick up a first down there but I

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.499 
has to pick up a first down there but I
think<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.460> was<00:00:11.639> important<00:00:12.030> for<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.269> team

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
think this was important for this team

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.879 
think this was important for this team
the<00:00:12.750> energy<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.320> locker<00:00:13.590> room<00:00:13.799> and

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
the energy in that locker room and

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.530 
the energy in that locker room and
energy<00:00:14.219> on<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.400> sideline<00:00:14.880> obviously<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.420> wish

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
energy on the sideline obviously I wish

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.840 
energy on the sideline obviously I wish
we<00:00:15.750> wouldn't<00:00:15.929> work<00:00:16.080> out<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> field<00:00:16.850> would

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
we wouldn't work out on the field would

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.490 
we wouldn't work out on the field would
they<00:00:17.940> got<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.180> penalty<00:00:18.480> there<00:00:18.630> put<00:00:19.380> that

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
they got the penalty there put that

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.529 
they got the penalty there put that
energy<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.160> emotion<00:00:20.490> brings<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.359> team

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
energy and that emotion brings a team

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.939 
energy and that emotion brings a team

people<00:01:20.250> away<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.150> two<00:01:21.330> weeks<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.720> row

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
people away you know two weeks in a row

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.190 
people away you know two weeks in a row
now<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.790> it's<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.880> way<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.030> build<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.509> or<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
now but it's a way to build on or to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.010 
now but it's a way to build on or to
know<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.590> first<00:01:25.830> place<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.220> south<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.729> so

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
know in first place in the south and so

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.330 
know in first place in the south and so
that<00:01:28.020> lets<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.350> go<00:01:28.470> always<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.070> think<00:01:29.250> we

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
that lets to go always and I think we

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090 
that lets to go always and I think we
stayed<00:01:29.520> relatively<00:01:29.880> healthy<00:01:30.740> just<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.860> plain

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
stayed relatively healthy just a plain

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.609 
stayed relatively healthy just a plain
marks<00:01:32.400> where<00:01:32.579> she<00:01:32.729> did<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.380> kind<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.500> thought

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
marks where she did I kind of thought

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.350 
marks where she did I kind of thought
it'd<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> type<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.280> game<00:01:35.579> really<00:01:36.180> because

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
it'd be a type of game really because

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.870 
it'd be a type of game really because
they're<00:01:36.720> sold<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.259> defense

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
they're sold it on defense

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.060 
they're sold it on defense

lineman<00:01:42.890> in<00:01:42.950> there<00:01:43.360> obviously<00:01:44.360> that<00:01:44.509> gave<00:01:44.659> us

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
lineman in there obviously that gave us

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.170 
lineman in there obviously that gave us
issues<00:01:45.049> at<00:01:45.200> times<00:01:45.409> today<00:01:45.649> you<00:01:46.070> know<00:01:46.189> with<00:01:47.149> our

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
issues at times today you know with our

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.690 
issues at times today you know with our
guards<00:01:47.659> in<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.869> matchup<00:01:48.259> so<00:01:48.470> I<00:01:48.740> thought<00:01:49.579> it

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
guards in the matchup so I thought it

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.010 
guards in the matchup so I thought it
would<00:01:49.759> probably<00:01:49.939> be<00:01:50.119> a<00:01:50.149> mark<00:01:50.420> tyler<00:01:50.600> type<00:01:50.869> of

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
would probably be a mark tyler type of

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.539 
would probably be a mark tyler type of
game<00:01:51.170> I<00:01:51.409> knew<00:01:51.770> we<00:01:51.890> wouldn't<00:01:52.070> start<00:01:52.340> but<00:01:52.520> I

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
game I knew we wouldn't start but I

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:53.679 
game I knew we wouldn't start but I
thought<00:01:52.759> by<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:52.939> end<00:01:53.060> of<00:01:53.149> it<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.420> have<00:01:53.509> more

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
thought by the end of it you have more

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.690 
thought by the end of it you have more
carries<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.799> then<00:01:54.950> two<00:01:55.130> things<00:01:55.340> happen<00:01:55.610> it

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
carries and then two things happen it

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.550 
carries and then two things happen it
was<00:01:55.820> that<00:01:56.030> type<00:01:56.210> of<00:01:56.240> game<00:01:56.509> you<00:01:56.810> know<00:01:56.929> where<00:01:57.380> was

I've never seen him that phony on the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.190 
I've never seen him that phony on the
scene<00:03:32.099> so<00:03:32.670> usually<00:03:33.329> you<00:03:33.359> sneaky<00:03:33.720> don't<00:03:33.930> get<00:03:34.079> it

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
scene so usually you sneaky don't get it

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.369 
scene so usually you sneaky don't get it
you<00:03:34.470> don't<00:03:34.620> go<00:03:34.709> back<00:03:34.980> 15<00:03:35.400> yards<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:37.260> would

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
you don't go back 15 yards so it would

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:38.899 
you don't go back 15 yards so it would
been<00:03:37.500> interesting<00:03:37.950> decision<00:03:38.280> there<00:03:38.430> because

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
been interesting decision there because

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.899 
been interesting decision there because
their<00:03:39.030> kicker<00:03:39.209> was<00:03:39.450> kicking<00:03:39.810> really<00:03:39.989> well

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
their kicker was kicking really well

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.009 
their kicker was kicking really well
normally<00:03:41.909> I<00:03:41.940> probably<00:03:42.180> would<00:03:42.359> work<00:03:42.510> for<00:03:42.780> you

know<00:03:43.200> because<00:03:43.379> it<00:03:43.440> would<00:03:43.530> have<00:03:43.620> been<00:03:43.680> inches

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
know because it would have been inches

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.190
