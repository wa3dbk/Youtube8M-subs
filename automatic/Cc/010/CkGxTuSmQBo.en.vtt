00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
about liposuction such as who are the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.139 
about liposuction such as who are the
best<00:01:28.200> candidates<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.220> what<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.520> involved

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
best candidates for it what is involved

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.910 
best candidates for it what is involved
the<00:01:30.570> type<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.810> procedure<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.649> undertaken

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the type of procedure that is undertaken

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.830 
the type of procedure that is undertaken
and<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:33.799> liposuction<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:36.030> technique

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and and so on liposuction is a technique

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.660 
and and so on liposuction is a technique
in<00:01:37.170> which<00:01:37.469> we<00:01:39.200> take<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.259> fat<00:01:40.619> out<00:01:40.799> without

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
in which we take the fat out without

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.060 
in which we take the fat out without
traumatizing<00:01:42.149> the<00:01:42.719> skin<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.350> essentially<00:01:43.920> we

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
traumatizing the skin so essentially we

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.209 
traumatizing the skin so essentially we
make<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.280> very<00:01:44.610> very<00:01:44.820> small<00:01:45.090> hole<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.950> 1/8<00:01:46.950> of

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
make a very very small hole like 1/8 of

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.850 
make a very very small hole like 1/8 of
an<00:01:47.369> inch<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.869> very<00:01:49.049> small<00:01:49.320> hole<00:01:49.560> in

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
an inch so it's a very small hole in

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.429 
an inch so it's a very small hole in
through<00:01:50.729> which<00:01:50.909> we<00:01:51.119> go<00:01:51.329> underneath<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.200> skin

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
through which we go underneath the skin

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.550 
through which we go underneath the skin
and<00:01:52.820> suck<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.969> fat<00:01:54.149> out<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.350> very

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and suck the fat out it's a very

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.399 
and suck the fat out it's a very
effective<00:01:56.310> way<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.689> sucking<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.960> fat<00:01:58.140> out

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
effective way of sucking the fat out

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.969
