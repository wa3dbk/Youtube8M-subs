been using Man City this week
and<00:00:24.560> I<00:00:24.680> found<00:00:24.920> them<00:00:25.070> pretty<00:00:25.310> useful<00:00:25.760> at<00:00:26.060> times

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
and I found them pretty useful at times

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.320 
and I found them pretty useful at times
they<00:00:27.019> do<00:00:27.230> have<00:00:27.439> the<00:00:27.619> floors<00:00:28.180> not<00:00:29.180> as

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
they do have the floors not as

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.890 
they do have the floors not as
consistent<00:00:30.080> as<00:00:30.199> Chelsea<00:00:31.419> easier<00:00:32.419> than

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
consistent as Chelsea easier than

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.740 
consistent as Chelsea easier than
Chelsea<00:00:33.590> to<00:00:33.949> break<00:00:34.190> down<00:00:34.430> and<00:00:35.030> you<00:00:35.059> see<00:00:35.449> here<00:00:35.720> I

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
Chelsea to break down and you see here I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.890 
Chelsea to break down and you see here I
use<00:00:36.140> a<00:00:36.500> custom<00:00:37.600> 4-3-3

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
use a custom 4-3-3

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.320 
use a custom 4-3-3
I<00:00:39.049> don't<00:00:39.620> use<00:00:39.830> the<00:00:39.979> default<00:00:40.489> four<00:00:40.760> five<00:00:41.030> one

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
I don't use the default four five one

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.509 
I don't use the default four five one
because<00:00:41.960> it's<00:00:42.140> a<00:00:42.199> little<00:00:42.379> bit<00:00:42.589> flat<00:00:42.920> doesn't

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
because it's a little bit flat doesn't

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.969 
because it's a little bit flat doesn't
give<00:00:43.760> you<00:00:43.850> enough<00:00:44.180> opportunity<00:00:45.110> or<00:00:45.350> enough
