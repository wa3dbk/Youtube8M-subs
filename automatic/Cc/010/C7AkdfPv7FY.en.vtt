 channel good morning working movie 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.170
 the program continues 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.009
 new day history of sweetener 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.450
 started back in 1879 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.430
 laboratories of american professor rome 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.039
 Sona worked as an unknown chemist 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.439
 Konstantin Farber is an immigrant from Russia 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.170
 once at dinner he drew attention to 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.519
 the unusual taste of bread sold sweet 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.220
 home assured that he does not feel 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.920
 sweets then fandok understood that with adac 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.840
 not bread but his fingers are taught before dinner 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.550
 messing with the scary drug 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.190
 title should surnames 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.989
 after the meal he rushed off the laboratories 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.829
 check guess guess 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.140
 confirmed 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.390
 compound of this acid is really 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.430
 were amazing sweet so was 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.020
 synthesized sugar and since its 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.579
 inventions do not abate disputes about 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.129
 artificial sweeteners are harmful 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.320
 or not your point now 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.559
 will introduce a guest to our medical about 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.559
 briks 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.369
 good morning on air medical heading 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.710
 many of us just can't live without 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.320
 sweet but in order not to recruit 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.479
 weight and not undermine health use 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.820
 instead of sugar, its substitutes 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.820
 but are they good for those who have a frame 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.270
 blood glucose is normal and good 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.909
 in principle , we are talking about this today with 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.180
 clinical 9 duty one zusman crammed 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.380
 I must say honestly that I am 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.330
 recently switched to a substitute 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.240
 so I, too, like our viewers 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.550
 worry about what actually is 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:45.830
 sweeteners and what are your relationships 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.990
 to them i the first thing i want to say is that 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.570
 if a person has diabetes 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.840
 he wants to use something 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.729
 sweet is not worth the question 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.220
 but happy with the type they were created for 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.210
 people for observance datse temple do 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.130
 diabetes mellitus 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.369
 they don't raise sugar levels in 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.910
 blood is not i affect insulin i speak in 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.369
 general asahara substitutes now let's 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.959
 let's go more globally deep we don't 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.910
 talking about people who suffer 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.239
 diabetes and talking about people who want 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.640
 sweet ride don't add calories so 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.310
 it turns out to be very difficult to deceive 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.239
 fool our bodies 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.720
 look here it is very interesting 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:30.379
 option our brain does not know what came up 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.690
 the bitch strikes him sweet that is if 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:37.209
 we put something sweet in your mouth you our 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:40.489
 the brain takes the information that there is sugar 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:44.360
 board correctly then this moment he 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.030
 sends an order to our pancreas 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.190
 iron sugar expensive on the way 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.450
 my wife I will devote climbed climbed 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:57.080
 right we ironed this dietetic 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.200
 I don't know that we barely got sugar there 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.160
 and our body is ready to take sugar 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.750
 that is, insulin has already begun to be produced 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.090
 what happens to our body like 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.749
 It shows you know something and are not referred to as 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.990
 baby yes he starts asking you 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:17.790
 promised be kind let me 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.040
 proven today that people who drink 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.590
 for example, different diet drinks with 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.830
 sports, for example, they have increased 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.050
 appetite and they are more looking to eat and 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.290
 looking for more sweet than people who 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.640
 do not do this data suggest 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.330
 what shall we say artificial 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.160
 sugar substitutes have no calories and they 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.910
 as if perfectly safe 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.920
 but natural, they give 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.290
 calories and they kind of need him 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.170
 be wary of her 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.950
 the shop meanwhile is not the ones first i 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.580
 I myself am wary of this data 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.810
 since so many synthetic 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.140
 sugar substitutes were found during 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.540
 the fact that they were looking for any poison against 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.000
 mice against some insects that is 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.520
 we ignite I take oxidase small 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.550
 the amount of this poison is very sweet and 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.640
 started over this feed maybe 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.799
 really i don't know i always stand 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.150
 question over these studies what 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.840
 really very small 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.760
 quantities 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.220
 This is not the country do not accept in 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.560
 we are small if we are in the office 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.460
 constantly drink wonderful conditions over 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.680
 rarely pill for cars 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.160
 colas and so on we are not so little of this 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.750
 We also accept it every day 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.820
 every day and see what 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.180
 interesting moment most full 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.830
 people use slade 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.770
 Sweetener thin people that are not 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.260
 enjoys interesting tractor well yes then 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.750
 you are you not when you are very slim not 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.520
 use sucrose pour or what am i 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.960
 advise yes you want to get rid of these 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.300
 sugar substitutes no problem start 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.400
 put a spoon and a half 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.470
 don't know how much you we need your cup 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.980
 tea or coffee sugar 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.960
 regular sugar so as soon as you 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.850
 will get used to it within two to three days 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.920
 it usually happens to normal 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.870
 taste sugar and because you have to break the habit 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.360
 from sugar substitutes too 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.340
 start by reducing it 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.050
 the amount is no less used level 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.870
 habits no she once with three 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.140
 spoons of sugar in a small porcelain 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.960
 a cup of tea I'm at 0 today and I'm delicious 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.810
 it happens a little bit we can ourselves 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.160
 teach to lower the amount of sugar 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.830
 which we need 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.280
 don't think that if we took dietary 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.800
 drink 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.449
 then on so yourself something good 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.370
 up by the way 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.930
 that is, we will come to the conclusion that we are completely 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.509
 give up sugar to 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.819
 why many nutritionists are your colleagues 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:55.849
 I advise you to switch to dietary example 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:58.339
 sugar what is dietary sugar what in 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:00.680
 it has fewer calories again, even if 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:01.639
 it is less calories, we are again 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.199
 at the same level 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.719
 instead of trying to change 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.669
 some of our bad habits we just 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:11.990
 replace them with something else that seems 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:14.839
 we are not harmful for today we know that 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.669
 it does not prove itself fat people 

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:18.529
 who continue to use all these 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.930
 with sweetener naturally 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:23.060
 natural less harmful stevia too 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.439
 for example yes it is less harmful than with 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.779
 decorate no doubt about it 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:29.800
 but it still saves this our 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:33.279
 it keeps our habit 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:36.919
 need for sweet thank you so much 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:38.749
 we conclude and sweeteners fit 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:41.479
 those people who have a violation 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:44.059
 exchange glucose for everything else is desirable 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:48.370
 learn to live without sugar and without it 

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:48.370
 sweet analogues be healthy
