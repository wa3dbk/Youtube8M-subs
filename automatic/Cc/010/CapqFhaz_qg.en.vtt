honey but i'll be doing squirts of it

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.670 
honey but i'll be doing squirts of it
eyeballing<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.510> there's<00:00:55.110> no<00:00:55.379> real

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
eyeballing it there's no real

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.860 
eyeballing it there's no real
measurement<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.370> how<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> do<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.530> that's<00:00:58.530> one

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
measurement to how to do this that's one

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.530 
measurement to how to do this that's one
that's<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.140> second<00:01:01.590> one

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.210 

and<00:01:06.540> then<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:06.780> going<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.080> take<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.500> bowl<00:01:07.800> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.590 
I'm going to tweet it up in my microwave
and<00:01:16.100> i<00:01:17.100> heated<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.760> and<00:01:18.030> now<00:01:18.210> I'm<00:01:18.390> just

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
and i heated it up and now I'm just

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.510 
and i heated it up and now I'm just
stirring<00:01:19.260> in<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.590> oil<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.130> honey

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
stirring in the oil of the honey

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.980 
stirring in the oil of the honey
together<00:01:20.820> because<00:01:21.479> they're<00:01:21.630> two<00:01:21.810> different

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
together because they're two different

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.780 
together because they're two different
consistencies<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.250> blending<00:01:23.670> them

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
consistencies just blending them

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.370 
consistencies just blending them
together<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.660> it'll<00:01:24.840> be<00:01:24.930> easy<00:01:25.140> application

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
just because the peroxide is released

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.529
