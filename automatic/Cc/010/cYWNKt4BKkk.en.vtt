00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
this previously and so we're getting

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.660 
this previously and so we're getting
back<00:00:06.990> into<00:00:07.230> it<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:07.950> haven't<00:00:08.280> done<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:08.550> a

back into it and I haven't done in a

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.100 
back into it and I haven't done in a
long<00:00:08.700> time<00:00:09.090> it's<00:00:09.300> probably<00:00:09.599> been<00:00:09.750> about<00:00:09.840> two

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
long time it's probably been about two

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.320 
long time it's probably been about two
years<00:00:10.139> since<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:10.980> have<00:00:11.670> been<00:00:11.700> actively

cheerleading and actively doing my jokes
and<00:00:14.070> my<00:00:14.219> stretches<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.849> whatnot<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.420> took<00:00:15.690> time

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
and my stretches and whatnot I took time

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.800 
and my stretches and whatnot I took time
off<00:00:16.260> from<00:00:16.470> college<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.520> my<00:00:17.730> son<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.300> set

off from college to have my son and set
out<00:00:18.960> getting<00:00:19.230> back<00:00:19.380> into<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.650> swing<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
out getting back into the swing of the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.189 
out getting back into the swing of the
cheerleading<00:00:21.119> stretch<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.810> jump<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.109> so

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
cheerleading stretch of the jump it so

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.599 
cheerleading stretch of the jump it so
we're<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.500> show<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.710> how<00:00:22.920> with<00:00:23.250> using

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
we're going to show you how with using

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.250 
we're going to show you how with using
the<00:00:23.699> resistance<00:00:24.180> bands<00:00:24.449> how<00:00:24.960> much<00:00:25.140> it

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
the resistance bands how much it

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.019 
the resistance bands how much it
improves<00:00:25.619> your<00:00:25.740> jumps<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.220> your<00:00:26.250> kicks

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
improves your jumps in your kicks

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.120 
improves your jumps in your kicks
immediately<00:00:27.750> it'll<00:00:28.560> definitely<00:00:28.740> see<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
immediately it'll definitely see a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.970 
immediately it'll definitely see a
difference<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:30.019> hi<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.320> coach<00:00:31.650> McQueen

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
difference so hi this is coach McQueen

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.740 
difference so hi this is coach McQueen
we're<00:00:32.489> just<00:00:32.550> going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.880> work<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.149> little<00:00:33.180> bit<00:00:33.540> on

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
we're just going to work a little bit on

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.840 
we're just going to work a little bit on
what<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.960> call<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.410> jump<00:00:34.710> phase<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.640> we're

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
what I call the jump phase and we're

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.220 
what I call the jump phase and we're
going<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.000> kind<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.360> give<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.660> an<00:00:36.690> idea<00:00:36.930> of

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
going to kind of give you an idea of

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.190 
going to kind of give you an idea of
what<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.980> resistance<00:00:38.550> bands<00:00:38.820> actually<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.660> we

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
what the resistance bands actually do we

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.380 
what the resistance bands actually do we
will<00:00:40.379> come<00:00:40.590> back<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.070> we'll<00:00:41.190> go<00:00:41.219> over

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
will come back and we'll go over

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.030 
will come back and we'll go over
exercises<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.570> drills<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.110> things<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.860> give

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
exercises and drills and things to give

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.369 
exercises and drills and things to give
you<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> much<00:00:44.460> better<00:00:44.730> preparation<00:00:45.379> Destiny's

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
you a much better preparation Destiny's

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.279 
you a much better preparation Destiny's
already<00:00:46.530> done<00:00:47.039> her<00:00:47.250> stretching<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.289> basically

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
already done her stretching so basically

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.439 
already done her stretching so basically
what<00:00:49.860> we're<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.340> start<00:00:50.610> out<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.180> is

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449

going to get ready for the toe touch and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.440 
going to get ready for the toe touch and
actually<00:01:04.860> that's<00:01:05.040> part<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.610> getting<00:01:06.210> your

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
actually that's part of getting your

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.910 
actually that's part of getting your
body<00:01:06.689> stretched<00:01:07.140> out<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.650> getting<00:01:07.860> it

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
body stretched out and getting it

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.070 
body stretched out and getting it
prepared<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.210> I'm<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.840> going<00:01:10.020> to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
prepared for that so I'm just going to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.990 
prepared for that so I'm just going to
have<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> few<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.010> those<00:01:11.159> maybe<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.970> a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
have you do a few of those maybe do a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.990 
have you do a few of those maybe do a
few<00:01:12.270> left<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.049> right<00:01:13.229> slow<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.340> then<00:01:14.700> let's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
few left and right slow and then let's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.710 
few left and right slow and then let's
do<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.390> rapids<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:18.210> you're<00:01:18.420> truly<00:01:18.600> ready

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
do the rapids and if you're truly ready

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.320 
do the rapids and if you're truly ready
answer<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.200> never<00:01:19.380> put<00:01:19.590> your<00:01:19.619> toes<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.790> uh<00:01:20.820> uh

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
answer you never put your toes so uh uh

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270 
answer you never put your toes so uh uh
with<00:01:21.990> resistance<00:01:22.500> bands<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:23.009> feel<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
with resistance bands you do feel the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.999 
with resistance bands you do feel the
resistance<00:01:23.630> this<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.869> key<00:01:25.080> word<00:01:25.229> there<00:01:25.290> so

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
resistance this is a key word there so

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.320 
resistance this is a key word there so
we're<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.280> go<00:01:26.310> ahead<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:26.880> three

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
we're going to go ahead and do three

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.609 
we're going to go ahead and do three
more<00:01:27.360> at<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.750> side<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.110> we'll<00:01:28.290> do<00:01:28.380> five

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
more at this side then we'll do five

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.380 
more at this side then we'll do five
more<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> other<00:01:29.100> side<00:01:29.400> these<00:01:29.939> are<00:01:30.090> slower

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
more on the other side these are slower

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.569 
more on the other side these are slower
they're<00:01:30.750> not<00:01:30.900> necessarily<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.590> one<00:01:32.400> right

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
they're not necessarily the one right

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.500 
they're not necessarily the one right
after<00:01:32.700> another

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
after another

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.500 
after another
talking<00:01:34.140> about<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.270> we're<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.450> to

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
talking about so and then we're going to

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:46.580 
talking about so and then we're going to

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
race would so we're going to go in this

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.290 
race would so we're going to go in this
side<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.880> do<00:02:53.970> five<00:02:54.180> more<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:59.310> try<00:02:59.880> not<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.180> let

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
problem that i have i've always wanted

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.080 
problem that i have i've always wanted
to<00:03:04.350> just<00:03:04.470> let<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.739> drop<00:03:04.950> but<00:03:05.550> go<00:03:05.880> ahead<00:03:05.910> and

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
to just let it drop but go ahead and

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.370 
to just let it drop but go ahead and
slowly<00:03:06.239> bring<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.630> down<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.900> slower<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.230> do

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
slowly bring it down the slower you do

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.330 
slowly bring it down the slower you do
it<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.560> more<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.769> a<00:03:07.800> stretch<00:03:08.010> you're<00:03:08.190> going

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
it the more of a stretch you're going

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.990 
it the more of a stretch you're going
again<00:03:08.519> so<00:03:09.209> let's<00:03:09.450> do<00:03:09.769> maybe<00:03:10.769> about<00:03:11.010> three<00:03:11.820> of

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
again so let's do maybe about three of

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.320 
again so let's do maybe about three of
the<00:03:12.209> kicks<00:03:12.590> leg<00:03:13.590> through<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.400> leg<00:03:14.580> raises<00:03:15.090> and

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
the kicks leg through the leg raises and

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.030 
the kicks leg through the leg raises and
then<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.780> want<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.080> show<00:03:16.320> them<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.590> difference

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
then I want to show them the difference

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.130 
then I want to show them the difference
was<00:03:17.220> when<00:03:17.519> you<00:03:17.670> on<00:03:17.820> buckle<00:03:18.239> that<00:03:18.420> will<00:03:18.840> go<00:03:18.989> in

when<00:03:23.780> your<00:03:23.930> library's<00:03:24.349> is<00:03:29.920> okay<00:03:30.920> in<00:03:31.250> our<00:03:31.430> leg

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
when your library's is okay in our leg

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.679 
when your library's is okay in our leg
raises<00:03:36.129> try<00:03:37.129> to<00:03:37.189> hold<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.670> core<00:03:37.969> in<00:03:38.269> she

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:38.689 
raises try to hold that core in she

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.410 
raises try to hold that core in she
she's<00:03:39.349> kind<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:39.680> here<00:03:39.950> right<00:03:40.129> now<00:03:40.420> remember

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.449 
she's kind of here right now remember
that<00:03:41.569> in<00:03:41.870> jumping<00:03:42.379> your<00:03:42.590> abdominals<00:03:42.920> in<00:03:43.310> your

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
that in jumping your abdominals in your

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.910 
that in jumping your abdominals in your
lower<00:03:43.700> back<00:03:43.909> let's<00:03:44.239> artwork<00:03:44.720> or<00:03:45.019> and<00:03:45.530> then<00:03:45.709> was

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
lower back let's artwork or and then was

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.369 
lower back let's artwork or and then was
just<00:03:45.950> real<00:03:46.400> quick<00:03:46.640> try<00:03:46.909> that<00:03:47.150> again<00:03:47.329> keep<00:03:48.230> it

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
just real quick try that again keep it

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.920 
just real quick try that again keep it
in<00:03:48.560> mind<00:03:48.769> where<00:03:49.129> her<00:03:49.370> kick<00:03:49.730> was<00:03:50.030> as<00:03:50.359> the

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
in mind where her kick was as the

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.649 
in mind where her kick was as the
resistance<00:03:51.319> was<00:03:51.829> working<00:03:52.250> those<00:03:52.430> muscles<00:03:52.659> and

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:53.659 
resistance was working those muscles and

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.069 
resistance was working those muscles and
now<00:03:53.870> we're<00:03:54.650> getting<00:03:54.980> her<00:03:55.159> prepared<00:03:55.700> for

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
now we're getting her prepared for

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.110 
now we're getting her prepared for
actual<00:03:57.079> jump<00:03:57.409> training<00:03:57.739> I<00:03:58.069> think<00:03:58.670> you'll

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
actual jump training I think you'll

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.879 
actual jump training I think you'll
definitely<00:03:59.599> see<00:03:59.629> a<00:03:59.810> difference<00:03:59.840> okay<00:04:00.739> bring

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
definitely see a difference okay bring

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.440 
definitely see a difference okay bring
you<00:04:01.099> into<00:04:01.400> three<00:04:01.579> on<00:04:01.669> each<00:04:01.819> side<00:04:01.849> just<00:04:02.060> like<00:04:02.239> we

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
you into three on each side just like we

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:10.839 
you into three on each side just like we
just<00:04:02.659> did<00:04:08.739> see<00:04:09.739> is<00:04:10.250> an<00:04:10.430> immediate<00:04:10.760> difference

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
just did see is an immediate difference

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.300 
just did see is an immediate difference
it<00:04:11.239> feels<00:04:11.419> like<00:04:11.510> you're<00:04:11.629> flying<00:04:11.840> so<00:04:12.310> your

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
it feels like you're flying so your

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.420 
it feels like you're flying so your
momentum<00:04:13.819> increase<00:04:14.239> is<00:04:14.419> like<00:04:14.569> crazy<00:04:18.130> so<00:04:19.130> we're

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
momentum increase is like crazy so we're

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.200 
momentum increase is like crazy so we're
getting<00:04:19.720> strength<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.019> flexibility<00:04:21.829> and

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
getting strength and flexibility and

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.020 
getting strength and flexibility and
really<00:04:23.210> also<00:04:23.570> a<00:04:23.810> good<00:04:24.139> stretch<00:04:24.560> so<00:04:25.130> that<00:04:25.370> when

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
really also a good stretch so that when

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.149 
really also a good stretch so that when
you're<00:04:26.210> ready<00:04:26.479> to<00:04:26.750> do<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.080> toe<00:04:27.289> touch<00:04:27.590> you're

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:28.159 
you're ready to do the toe touch you're

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:29.680 
you're ready to do the toe touch you're
going<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.370> be<00:04:28.490> more<00:04:28.729> comfortable<00:04:29.030> and<00:04:29.419> and

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
going to be more comfortable and and

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.870 
going to be more comfortable and and
again<00:04:30.260> yes<00:04:30.530> Aeneid<00:04:30.889> mentioned<00:04:31.310> that<00:04:31.460> chief

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
again yes Aeneid mentioned that chief

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.330 
again yes Aeneid mentioned that chief
took<00:04:32.479> time<00:04:32.750> enough<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.050> have<00:04:33.289> a<00:04:33.320> son<00:04:33.710> so<00:04:34.039> she

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
took time enough to have a son so she

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.210 
took time enough to have a son so she
wasn't<00:04:34.820> quite<00:04:35.479> in<00:04:35.690> game<00:04:35.990> 4<00:04:36.440> much<00:04:36.740> you<00:04:36.919> want<00:04:37.159> it

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
wasn't quite in game 4 much you want it

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.310 
wasn't quite in game 4 much you want it
to<00:04:37.340> be<00:04:37.490> but<00:04:37.699> that's<00:04:38.300> what<00:04:38.630> I<00:04:38.659> wanted<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.110> do

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
to be but that's what I wanted to do

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.620 
to be but that's what I wanted to do
this<00:04:39.500> so<00:04:39.770> that<00:04:39.800> we<00:04:40.099> will<00:04:40.639> work<00:04:40.940> back<00:04:41.180> towards

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
this so that we will work back towards

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.110 
this so that we will work back towards
that<00:04:41.840> so<00:04:42.169> let's<00:04:42.889> just<00:04:43.159> start<00:04:43.490> with<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:43.789> tow

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
that so let's just start with the tow

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.899 
that so let's just start with the tow
trucks<00:04:44.419> and<00:04:44.659> lets<00:04:45.050> do<00:04:45.260> a<00:04:45.289> few<00:04:45.770> without<00:04:46.760> the

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:46.909 
trucks and lets do a few without the
