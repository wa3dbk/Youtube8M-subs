00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.200
 many people to exercise to meditate 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.720
 to do many things here we have the 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.690
 front cameraman please this is a 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.769
 small chapel 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.199
 from the previous century I do not know what amount 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.940
 of years I have but it's there but I 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.280
 like to come as the saying goes and what 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.039
 I learned early bird catches the early bird 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.129
 God help him then today Saturday I 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.210
 up that positive attitude with me 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.570
 love I love in a previous video 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:04.009
 I said attitude attitude gentlemen 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.930
 Friendly friends is very important because 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:10.619
 because with a positive attitude we can 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.220
 do a lot we can solve problems 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.430
 we can reassure ourselves we can do 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.980
 many things 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.200
 and most of all in the previous video 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.159
 I wanted to touch a topic 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.710
 that many say good luck 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.430
 for me, the luck that I have 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.470
 classified among 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.950
 percentages is how I see it the two 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.399
 first percentages have 5% 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.180
 5% 5% and the third percentage has 90 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:45.240
 percent the same percentage 5% yo 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.450
 I have classified it as divine luck 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.310
 which is little algea an example when the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.110
 people say I got the lottery 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.990
 that the lottery thanks 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.110
 as they understand the higher power in the 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.840
 second luck the one of the circumstances 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.020
 for example when people in this in 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.810
 these raffles are won cars are won 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.480
 travel cruises that you can contrast 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.790
 luck the other luck and the and the most 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.680
 important that if everyone the 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.290
 practice this was not world 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.530
 just as I learned it is that 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.480
 lucky that's when the knowledge and 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.510
 the opportunity 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.540
 think a little bit gentlemen 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.750
 people people from social networks what 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.910
 I am saying what is happening 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.460
 that many people have a chance 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.970
 but he does not have the knowledge then 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.380
 what's the matter of what sadness comes 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.140
 comes frustration a series of 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.240
 known feelings 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.310
 he has the opportunity but he does not have the 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.140
 knowledge then why did I say this 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.810
 is this is the one that has the greatest 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.330
 percentage but what happens that 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:01.170
 there are very few who practice 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.850
 this very important principle many 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.770
 they say I have bad luck, here is more 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.380
 I hope there what happens is 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.600
 important to read is important to learn 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.160
 is important and be educated in the 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.680
 company that I am was presented the 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.600
 opportunity as I have the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.870
 knowledge then I take it to the 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.030
 daily living led him to practice is 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.640
 very important and more than everything added to 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.340
 the joy of living gentlemen ladies 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.580

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.349
 with the puppy I've seen cameraman 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.060

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.480

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.379
 with me 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.230
 and a little bit dark here in the park 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.300

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.670

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.330

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.560

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.020

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.560
