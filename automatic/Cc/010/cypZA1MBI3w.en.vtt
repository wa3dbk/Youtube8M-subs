00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.590
 hello how about we all continue with the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.770
 member irrigation videos 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.770
 lower 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.080
 we continue with the popliteal artery that 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.760
 contributes with irrigation 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.040
 fundamentally the articulation of 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.590
 knee and from there they derive then the 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.009
 glasses for the leg and subsequently 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.660
 for the foot of the popliteal artery that 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.119
 the continuation of the figure of the 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.059
 superficial femoral then it 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.960
 break off articular or genic arteries 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:45.690
 both upper half dollars as 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.690
 lateral and other rural vessels 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.010
 but in the most superficial part some 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.360
 private canicular glasses 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.030
 medial and lateral of the knee 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.480
 as well as some glasses for the part 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.790
 mean these branches then I mentioned the 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.300
 superior joints go up 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.270
 mozart with the lateral descending of the 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.160
 surrounds lateral femoral and with the 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.020
 descending knee that comes from 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.119
 the superficial femoral 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.890
 later then the artery 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.289
 Popliteal after passing through the pit 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.009
 intercon dilia where is going to be very very 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:29.090
 very vulnerable to any injury 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:32.299
 or traumatism and that we have in mind 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.219
 that is accompanied by the vein of equal 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.810
 denomination and by the tibial nerve if 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.990
 plus 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.939
 as a few centimeters above by 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.869
 on top of the pit completes the nerve 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.850
 sciatic was derived in common figurines 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.520
 and in the tibial that accompanies the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.189
 artery and popliteal vein nothing more 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.130
 go ahead we see it in more detail 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.840
 when the popliteal artery reaches level 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.549
 of the popliteal muscle from 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.100
 rear compartment of knee that 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.009
 remember is an important muscle for 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.030
 unlock the joint at the start 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.610
 of ambulation there is going to branch 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.030
 in his posterior tibial artery that 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.209
 irrigate the rear compartment of the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.209
 leg 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.480
 this alternative of the later in many 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.599
 occasions gives a recurring branch that 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.610
 will contribute and I vascular knee 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.610
 in addition to the tibial artery 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.519
 posterior artery is derived 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:45.549
 fibula that goes to the fibula and the 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:49.090
 muscles in the lateral compartment of 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:53.610
 leg that are the regular muscles and 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.910
 long and regular short 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.490
 that other frogs have the tibial artery 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.410
 later is one of those from the upl and 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:07.540
 is then the artery 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:11.880
 will give calcareous branches yes and 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.880
 crossing the tarsus tunnel 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.970
 to give a branch for the petal a branch 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.560
 that is vulnerable in the fractures of the 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.040
 aviator and that can lead to necrosis 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.129
 avascular delta yes 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.530
 and when you have already crossed the tunnel 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:36.390
 then it branches into arteries 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.390
 medial plantar 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.159
 that will then irrigate the muscles 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.680
 through its surface branch to the 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.640
 muscles for the thumb on the 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.550
 so medial foot behavior 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:00.500
 thief deep branch that contributes to 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.090
 form the foot arch that is 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.540
 formed mainly by the artery 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.030
 lateral plantar which is the other branch 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.750
 terminal of the posterior tibial artery 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.520
 and this plant the lateral and Riga 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.169
 fundamentally to all the muscles in 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:21.169
 the interosseous compartment as the 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.320
 muscles in the lateral part e 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:28.690
 intermediate of the sole shape 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.690
 long planting as I mentioned and 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:36.439
 of this arc plant then derive 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:38.649
 the arteries while tertiary plantar 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:38.649
 is 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.650
 and these in turn will then be derived 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.569
 the digital 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.330
 own 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:53.039
 Prior to these branches I just 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.039
 mention that it is essential 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:00.240
 and let it go by and it's that 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:05.979
 some branches maleolar is if the branch 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:08.710
 medial malleolar that will contribute to 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.600
 vascular ring of the joint of the 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.300
 ankle 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:18.940
 the artery figure that is derived from 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:22.990
 it also gives some calcaneal branches 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:26.250
 and some lateral molar branches for that 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.250
 ankle joint 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:33.119
 and to finish then the other 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:36.509
 derived in the proximal part of the 

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:38.550
 popliteal artery with its income then to 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.130
 Leg 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.450
 is the anterior tibial artery the artery 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.790
 tibial anterior then leaves by 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.100
 later but immediately goes through 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.720
 the upper edge of the membrane 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.350
 interosseous 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.100
 / 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:59.370
 the tibia and the fibula and will go towards 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:03.240
 go ahead for that previous compartment 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:06.210
 of the leg then it will come to these 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.520
 muscles will be accompanied by the veins of 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.840
 same denomination and the regular nerve 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:16.800
 deep this tibial artery 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.500
 previous to a recurring branch for the 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.620
 articulation of the knee and in the part 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:27.630
 distal of a branch 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:32.330
 medial malleolar for articulation of the 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.330
 ankle as well as lateral malleolar 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:41.009
 when it immediately enters the foot and 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.569
 pass the retreat angle extender 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:46.080
 then then pass the retinaculum 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:49.050
 Extender becomes that tibial artery 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.780
 anterior in the dorsal artery of the foot or 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.300
 middle artery 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:57.139
 then the dorsal artery of the foot to 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:01.200
 give some medium Martian branches 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:03.480
 Martians and laterals that contribute 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.180
 then to the irrigation of those muscles 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:10.980
 short extenders and also of the 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:13.770
 bones of the case of the bones of the 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:16.020
 tarso then of the half foot because what 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:19.220
 it is the calcaneus and the stem its relations 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:24.230
 because from the posterior tibial 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:25.970
 and will form an artery and arcuate 

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.950
 where the goals will then be derived 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.290
 twisted ridges and goals 

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.860
 twisted dorsals will derive the 

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.860
 digital 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.600
 common and the digital ones themselves 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:41.390
 Finally 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:44.840
 with that then I'm done with the 

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:48.970
 irrigation of the lower limb in 

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.970
 As for the arterial part, see you soon
