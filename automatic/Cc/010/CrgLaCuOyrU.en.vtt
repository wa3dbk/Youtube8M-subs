on<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.920> website<00:00:56.129> people<00:00:56.670> saying<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.420> it's

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
on the website people saying that it's

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.170 
on the website people saying that it's
as<00:00:57.840> good<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:58.949> some<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> more<00:00:59.850> expensive

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
as good as some of the more expensive

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.200 
as good as some of the more expensive
ones<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.649> lot<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.730> could<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.120> been

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
ones but a lot of it could have been

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.880 
ones but a lot of it could have been
operator<00:01:03.690> error<00:01:03.930> because<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.500> said<00:01:04.559> I

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
operator error because like I said I

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.270 
operator error because like I said I
have<00:01:05.309> never<00:01:05.720> painted<00:01:06.720> using<00:01:08.150> HVLP<00:01:09.150> before

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
have never painted using HVLP before

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.240 
have never painted using HVLP before
I've<00:01:11.280> done<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.729> most<00:01:12.510> everybody<00:01:12.960> else<00:01:13.250> and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
I've done like most everybody else and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.230 
I've done like most everybody else and
just<00:01:15.030> used<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.960> know<00:01:16.080> good<00:01:16.290> old<00:01:16.320> rattle<00:01:16.830> cans

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
just used you know good old rattle cans

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.450 
just used you know good old rattle cans
so<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.570> thought<00:01:19.439> I'd<00:01:19.560> try<00:01:19.650> something<00:01:19.740> different

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
so I thought I'd try something different

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.210 
so I thought I'd try something different
anyway<00:01:22.970> I'm<00:01:23.970> not<00:01:24.030> I'm<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.619> experiment

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
anyway I'm not I'm going to experiment

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.999 
anyway I'm not I'm going to experiment
with<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.119> resto<00:01:27.540> liam<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.770> paint

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
with this resto liam and the paint

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:29.960 
with this resto liam and the paint
thinner

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
thinner

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.120 
thinner
one<00:01:30.509> thing<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.619> paint<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.040> actually

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
one thing is this paint is actually

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.870 
one thing is this paint is actually
pretty<00:01:32.460> expensive<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.530> $25<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> quart<00:01:35.189> so

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
pretty expensive it's $25 for a quart so

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.960 
pretty expensive it's $25 for a quart so
it's<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.509> hundred<00:01:36.750> dollars<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.259> gallon<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
it's a hundred dollars for a gallon and

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.800 
it's a hundred dollars for a gallon and
I<00:01:39.200> got<00:01:40.460> let's<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.970> got<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:43.079> fender<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.810> one

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
and so yeah it's kind of expensive so

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.410 
and so yeah it's kind of expensive so
anyway<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.030> said<00:01:57.180> I'm<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.390> to

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
their trucks and what they were doing in

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.140 
their trucks and what they were doing in
between<00:02:23.670> coats<00:02:23.850> was<00:02:24.090> wet<00:02:24.300> sanding<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.840> and

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
between coats was wet sanding it and

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.450 
between coats was wet sanding it and
some<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.210> these<00:02:27.270> guys<00:02:27.510> got<00:02:27.750> really<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> very

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
some of these guys got really a very

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.900 
some of these guys got really a very
very<00:02:29.580> nice<00:02:29.940> mirror<00:02:30.390> finish<00:02:30.630> on<00:02:31.670> their<00:02:32.670> paint

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
very nice mirror finish on their paint

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.210 
very nice mirror finish on their paint
and<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:34.220> I'm<00:02:35.220> going<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.600> try<00:02:37.010> I'm<00:02:38.010> going<00:02:38.160> to

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
and so I'm going to try I'm going to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.120 
and so I'm going to try I'm going to
experiment<00:02:39.260> with<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.440> except<00:02:40.800> I'm<00:02:40.890> going<00:02:40.950> to

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
experiment with this except I'm going to

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.800 
experiment with this except I'm going to
use<00:02:41.340> since<00:02:42.240> I<00:02:42.510> already<00:02:42.780> bought<00:02:43.110> this<00:02:43.260> HVLP<00:02:43.740> gun

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
use since I already bought this HVLP gun

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.680 
use since I already bought this HVLP gun
I'm<00:02:45.810> going<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.110> experiment<00:02:46.500> with<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:47.690> I'll

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
I'm going to experiment with that I'll

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.270 
I'm going to experiment with that I'll
thin<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.260> paint<00:02:49.500> down<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.680> little<00:02:49.860> bit<00:02:50.070> and

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
thin the paint down a little bit and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.790 
thin the paint down a little bit and
then<00:02:51.860> experiment<00:02:52.860> with<00:02:52.980> different<00:02:53.340> ratios

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
then experiment with different ratios

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.540 
then experiment with different ratios
most<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.950> what<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.070> saw<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.459> guys<00:02:56.790> were<00:02:57.000> using

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
most of what I saw the guys were using

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.370 
most of what I saw the guys were using
us<00:02:59.780> yeah<00:03:00.810> 50/50<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:02.070> know<00:03:02.190> 50%<00:03:03.060> 50%<00:03:03.900> paint

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
us yeah 50/50 you know 50% 50% paint

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.949 
us yeah 50/50 you know 50% 50% paint
thinner<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:05.130> think<00:03:05.880> at<00:03:06.390> least<00:03:06.570> one<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.870> the

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
thinner I think at least one of the

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.800 
thinner I think at least one of the
video<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.380> guy<00:03:07.470> was<00:03:07.680> doing<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.780> know

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
video the guy was doing a you know

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.699 
video the guy was doing a you know
basically<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.320> four<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.650> one<00:03:10.760> 75%<00:03:11.760> paint<00:03:12.709> 25%

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
basically a four to one 75% paint 25%

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.330 
basically a four to one 75% paint 25%
thinner<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.670> I'm<00:03:14.910> going<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.120> experiment<00:03:16.340> with

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
thinner so I'm going to experiment with

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.699 
thinner so I'm going to experiment with
putting<00:03:17.519> it<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.940> paint<00:03:18.720> gun<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:19.680> still

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
putting it in the paint gun and I still

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.009 
putting it in the paint gun and I still
got<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:20.160> blue<00:03:20.400> hood<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.790> haven't<00:03:21.090> taken<00:03:21.810> to

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
got this blue hood I haven't taken to

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.479 
got this blue hood I haven't taken to
the<00:03:22.110> scrapyard<00:03:22.590> yet<00:03:22.769> this<00:03:22.920> was<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.250> one<00:03:23.370> that

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
the scrapyard yet this was the one that

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.140 
the scrapyard yet this was the one that
I<00:03:23.610> cut<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.360> nose<00:03:24.510> off<00:03:24.840> because<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:26.100> nose<00:03:26.880> of

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
I cut the nose off because the nose of

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
I cut the nose off because the nose of
my<00:03:27.330> original<00:03:28.140> hood<00:03:28.560> was<00:03:28.860> rusted<00:03:29.670> out<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:30.930> got

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
my original hood was rusted out so I got

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.590 
my original hood was rusted out so I got
the<00:03:31.260> hood<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.470> just<00:03:31.890> got<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.910> leaning<00:03:33.239> up<00:03:33.360> here

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
the hood I just got it leaning up here

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.680 
the hood I just got it leaning up here
against<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.050> engine<00:03:35.010> hoist<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:36.540> is

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
against the engine hoist and this is

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.300 
against the engine hoist and this is
just<00:03:36.840> going<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:36.989> be<00:03:37.080> my<00:03:37.200> canvas<00:03:37.860> for<00:03:38.040> now<00:03:38.160> I'm

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
just going to be my canvas for now I'm

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.810 
just going to be my canvas for now I'm
gonna<00:03:38.459> use<00:03:38.760> this<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:40.400> experiment<00:03:41.400> with<00:03:41.610> the

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
gonna use this to experiment with the

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.740 
gonna use this to experiment with the
with<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.720> paint<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.170> so<00:03:43.920> I'll<00:03:44.100> just<00:03:44.750> document

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
with the paint and so I'll just document

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.690 
with the paint and so I'll just document
as<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:45.959> go<00:03:46.080> along<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.459> hopefully<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.519> get<00:03:47.580> some

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
as I go along and hopefully I get some

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.500 
as I go along and hopefully I get some
good<00:03:47.970> results<00:03:48.120> because<00:03:49.970> this<00:03:50.970> stuff<00:03:51.209> is<00:03:51.300> much

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
good results because this stuff is much

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.590 
good results because this stuff is much
cheaper<00:03:51.769> this<00:03:52.769> was<00:03:53.010> ten<00:03:53.250> dollars<00:03:53.480> for<00:03:54.480> the

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
cheaper this was ten dollars for the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.890 
cheaper this was ten dollars for the
court<00:03:55.519> but<00:03:56.519> they<00:03:56.670> also<00:03:56.820> had<00:03:57.060> gallons<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.690> just

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
court but they also had gallons I just

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.380 
court but they also had gallons I just
got<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.110> court<00:03:58.380> for<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:59.340> for<00:03:59.790> experimenting

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
got the court for it for experimenting

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.240 
got the court for it for experimenting
purposes<00:04:01.580> but<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.700> gallon<00:04:03.120> was<00:04:04.110> at<00:04:04.470> Home

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
purposes but the gallon was at Home

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.300 
purposes but the gallon was at Home
Depot<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:06.870> gallon<00:04:07.200> of<00:04:07.320> this<00:04:07.470> same<00:04:07.680> paint<00:04:08.010> was

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
Depot the gallon of this same paint was

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.920 
Depot the gallon of this same paint was
like<00:04:09.060> 26<00:04:09.570> or<00:04:09.660> 27<00:04:10.280> well<00:04:11.299> like<00:04:12.299> I<00:04:12.390> said<00:04:12.450> this<00:04:12.750> is

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
like 26 or 27 well like I said this is

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.909 
like 26 or 27 well like I said this is
25<00:04:13.700> per<00:04:14.700> quart<00:04:15.000> plus<00:04:15.330> tax<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:15.900> I<00:04:16.680> can<00:04:16.769> get<00:04:16.859> a

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
25 per quart plus tax and I can get a

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.009 
25 per quart plus tax and I can get a
gallon<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.400> this<00:04:17.430> for<00:04:18.209> roughly<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.930> same

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
gallon of this for roughly the same

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.469 
gallon of this for roughly the same
price<00:04:19.640> so<00:04:21.560> anyway<00:04:22.560> I'll<00:04:22.710> get<00:04:22.890> going<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.479> keep

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
price so anyway I'll get going and keep

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.940 
price so anyway I'll get going and keep

ounces<00:04:50.380> of<00:04:50.440> paint<00:04:50.740> and<00:04:50.980> I'll<00:04:51.940> put<00:04:52.150> in<00:04:52.300> 4<00:04:52.930> ounces

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
ounces of paint and I'll put in 4 ounces

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.500 
ounces of paint and I'll put in 4 ounces
of<00:04:54.720> paint<00:04:55.720> thinner<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.850> so<00:04:57.850> that<00:04:58.000> should<00:04:58.240> give

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
of paint thinner and so that should give

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.530 
of paint thinner and so that should give
me<00:04:58.690> a<00:04:59.340> floor<00:05:00.340> to<00:05:00.460> 1<00:05:01.860> ratio

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
me a floor to 1 ratio

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.400 
me a floor to 1 ratio
75%<00:05:05.430> paint<00:05:06.430> and<00:05:06.640> 25%<00:05:07.030> paint<00:05:07.480> thinner<00:05:07.660> so<00:05:08.170> we'll

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
75% paint and 25% paint thinner so we'll

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.200 
75% paint and 25% paint thinner so we'll
try<00:05:08.590> it<00:05:08.620> with<00:05:08.830> that<00:05:08.980> and<00:05:09.220> put<00:05:09.850> in<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.000> spray

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
try it with that and put in the spray

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.390 
try it with that and put in the spray
gun<00:05:10.390> and<00:05:11.370> see<00:05:12.370> how<00:05:12.490> it<00:05:12.580> works<00:05:14.010> ok<00:05:15.010> you<00:05:15.070> can<00:05:15.280> see

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
gun and see how it works ok you can see

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.030 
gun and see how it works ok you can see
it's<00:05:15.550> up<00:05:15.670> to<00:05:15.790> 16<00:05:16.240> ounces<00:05:16.570> now<00:05:16.810> and<00:05:17.290> that<00:05:17.440> was<00:05:17.590> 4

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
it's up to 16 ounces now and that was 4

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.640 
it's up to 16 ounces now and that was 4
ounces<00:05:18.460> of<00:05:18.640> paint<00:05:19.270> that<00:05:19.390> are<00:05:19.510> put<00:05:19.690> in<00:05:19.840> and<00:05:20.020> so

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
ounces of paint that are put in and so

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.350 
ounces of paint that are put in and so
grab<00:05:21.220> yourself<00:05:21.370> a<00:05:21.640> new<00:05:21.760> stick<00:05:22.000> that's<00:05:22.180> why<00:05:22.330> I

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
grab yourself a new stick that's why I

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.780 
grab yourself a new stick that's why I
grabbed<00:05:22.870> a<00:05:22.930> handful<00:05:23.320> of<00:05:23.560> the<00:05:23.830> sticks<00:05:24.100> because

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
grabbed a handful of the sticks because

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.880 
grabbed a handful of the sticks because
the<00:05:25.630> one<00:05:25.810> that<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:26.050> use<00:05:26.200> to<00:05:26.380> stir<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:26.710> paint

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
the one that you use to stir the paint

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.410 
the one that you use to stir the paint
still<00:05:27.220> got<00:05:27.340> a<00:05:27.370> bunch<00:05:27.610> of<00:05:27.700> paint<00:05:27.910> on<00:05:28.090> it<00:05:28.270> and

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
still got a bunch of paint on it and

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.320 
still got a bunch of paint on it and
that'll<00:05:29.320> that'll<00:05:30.160> mess<00:05:30.460> up<00:05:30.610> your<00:05:30.760> ratio<00:05:31.120> just

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
that'll that'll mess up your ratio just

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.150 
that'll that'll mess up your ratio just
a<00:05:31.450> little<00:05:31.660> bit<00:05:31.780> so<00:05:32.020> that's<00:05:32.470> you<00:05:32.710> know<00:05:32.800> grab<00:05:33.130> a

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
a little bit so that's you know grab a

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.340 
a little bit so that's you know grab a
handful<00:05:33.550> and<00:05:33.760> use<00:05:34.600> a<00:05:34.630> fresh<00:05:34.930> stick<00:05:35.170> when

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
handful and use a fresh stick when

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.920 
handful and use a fresh stick when
you're<00:05:35.470> stirring<00:05:35.680> up<00:05:36.000> your<00:05:37.000> reduced<00:05:38.010> paint

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
you're stirring up your reduced paint

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.140 
you're stirring up your reduced paint
all<00:05:40.930> right<00:05:41.050> so<00:05:41.230> I<00:05:41.260> got<00:05:41.470> my<00:05:41.500> reduced<00:05:41.890> paint<00:05:42.190> well

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
all right so I got my reduced paint well

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.120 
all right so I got my reduced paint well
mixed<00:05:43.480> up<00:05:43.630> I<00:05:44.050> think<00:05:44.620> it's<00:05:44.860> a<00:05:44.890> pretty<00:05:45.040> good

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
mixed up I think it's a pretty good

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.850 
mixed up I think it's a pretty good
consistency<00:05:45.730> at<00:05:46.270> least<00:05:46.480> to<00:05:46.570> start<00:05:46.660> with<00:05:46.960> and

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
consistency at least to start with and

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.490 
consistency at least to start with and
Boop's<00:05:48.340> that<00:05:48.580> thing<00:05:48.700> blew<00:05:48.880> over<00:05:49.260> so<00:05:50.260> now<00:05:50.410> I'm

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
Boop's that thing blew over so now I'm

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.250 
Boop's that thing blew over so now I'm
ready<00:05:50.620> to<00:05:50.710> put<00:05:50.890> it<00:05:50.980> in<00:05:51.070> my<00:05:51.220> paint<00:05:52.030> gun<00:05:52.240> and<00:05:52.510> I<00:05:53.200> do

reason<00:05:58.480> I'm<00:05:58.740> experimenting<00:05:59.740> with<00:05:59.830> using<00:06:00.100> this

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
reason I'm experimenting with using this

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.710 
reason I'm experimenting with using this
with<00:06:00.400> my<00:06:00.520> paint<00:06:00.760> gun<00:06:00.910> is<00:06:01.000> because<00:06:01.240> I<00:06:01.330> did<00:06:01.510> go

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
with my paint gun is because I did go

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.380 
with my paint gun is because I did go
and<00:06:01.990> buy<00:06:02.590> all<00:06:02.770> this<00:06:02.950> stuff<00:06:03.010> just<00:06:03.550> for<00:06:04.300> this

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
and buy all this stuff just for this

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.010 
and buy all this stuff just for this
project<00:06:04.990> and<00:06:05.200> so<00:06:05.230> I'm<00:06:05.440> gonna<00:06:06.930> experiment<00:06:07.930> at

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
project and so I'm gonna experiment at

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.230 
project and so I'm gonna experiment at
least<00:06:08.230> hopefully<00:06:09.100> I<00:06:09.160> get<00:06:09.250> my<00:06:09.730> money<00:06:09.970> out<00:06:10.030> of

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
least hopefully I get my money out of

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.630 
least hopefully I get my money out of

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:43.980 
here's my spray test on a piece of

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.600 
here's my spray test on a piece of
cardboard<00:06:44.370> and<00:06:45.830> yeah<00:06:46.830> this<00:06:46.980> paint<00:06:47.250> is<00:06:47.340> a<00:06:47.400> lot

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
cardboard and yeah this paint is a lot

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.220 
cardboard and yeah this paint is a lot
thicker<00:06:47.910> and<00:06:48.060> it<00:06:48.210> comes<00:06:48.420> out<00:06:48.570> of<00:06:48.600> the<00:06:48.750> gun<00:06:48.930> a

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.230 
thicker and it comes out of the gun a

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.350 
thicker and it comes out of the gun a
lot<00:06:49.530> better<00:06:49.860> it<00:06:50.460> covers<00:06:50.970> a<00:06:51.000> lot<00:06:51.240> better<00:06:52.070> than

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
lot better it covers a lot better than

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.460 
lot better it covers a lot better than
this<00:06:54.360> this<00:06:54.420> is<00:06:55.520> hopefully<00:06:56.520> you<00:06:56.640> can<00:06:56.730> see<00:06:56.940> that

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.470 
this this is hopefully you can see that

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.370 
this this is hopefully you can see that
some<00:06:58.470> shadows<00:06:59.160> but<00:06:59.370> this<00:06:59.520> was<00:06:59.670> my<00:06:59.790> practice

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.380 
some shadows but this was my practice

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.450 
some shadows but this was my practice
yesterday<00:07:01.380> when<00:07:01.530> I<00:07:01.590> was<00:07:01.680> spraying<00:07:01.950> the<00:07:02.130> primer

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
yesterday when I was spraying the primer

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.820 
yesterday when I was spraying the primer
and<00:07:02.700> this<00:07:03.270> was<00:07:03.480> with<00:07:03.840> the<00:07:03.900> exact<00:07:04.380> same<00:07:04.590> gun

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
and this was with the exact same gun

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.520 
and this was with the exact same gun
settings<00:07:05.250> I<00:07:05.340> haven't<00:07:05.640> changed<00:07:05.790> anything<00:07:06.530> the

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
settings I haven't changed anything the

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.030 
settings I haven't changed anything the
same<00:07:07.740> line<00:07:08.010> pressure<00:07:08.310> the<00:07:08.640> same<00:07:09.830> the<00:07:10.830> same

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040 
same line pressure the same the same

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.120 
same line pressure the same the same
number<00:07:11.310> of<00:07:11.340> turns<00:07:11.580> out<00:07:11.880> on<00:07:12.090> the<00:07:12.590> fluid<00:07:13.590> on<00:07:13.980> the

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130 
number of turns out on the fluid on the

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.260 
number of turns out on the fluid on the
fluid<00:07:14.390> dial<00:07:15.590> same<00:07:16.590> fan<00:07:16.890> and<00:07:17.190> everything<00:07:17.400> so

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270 
fluid dial same fan and everything so

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.780 
fluid dial same fan and everything so
the<00:07:18.540> thicker<00:07:18.750> paint<00:07:19.580> definitely<00:07:20.580> works

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:20.790 
the thicker paint definitely works

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.820 
the thicker paint definitely works
better<00:07:21.060> with<00:07:21.360> this<00:07:21.480> gun<00:07:21.810> and<00:07:22.110> if<00:07:22.560> I<00:07:22.680> remember

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
better with this gun and if I remember

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.920 
better with this gun and if I remember
right<00:07:23.840> that<00:07:24.840> gun<00:07:25.080> has<00:07:25.380> a<00:07:25.610> 1.4<00:07:26.610> tip<00:07:26.940> now<00:07:27.600> I<00:07:27.630> don't

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:27.930 
right that gun has a 1.4 tip now I don't

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.320 
right that gun has a 1.4 tip now I don't
know<00:07:28.020> anything<00:07:28.320> about<00:07:28.560> paint<00:07:28.920> guns<00:07:29.160> but<00:07:29.430> for
