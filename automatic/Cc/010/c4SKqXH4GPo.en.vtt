00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.330 
can kind of go like this to you need to
that's<00:02:37.540> typically<00:02:37.870> where<00:02:38.049> your<00:02:38.200> mascara<00:02:38.560> is

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.160 

and<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.519> see<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.760> top<00:02:43.000> part<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.390> almost

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
and you see that top part is almost

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.500 
and you see that top part is almost
clean<00:02:44.440> now<00:02:45.160> this<00:02:45.400> bottom<00:02:45.760> part<00:02:45.940> here<00:02:46.209> is<00:02:46.299> then

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
clean now this bottom part here is then

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.660 
clean now this bottom part here is then
saturated<00:02:47.080> with<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.860> makeup<00:02:48.069> remover<00:02:48.549> so

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
saturated with the makeup remover so

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.949 
saturated with the makeup remover so
it's<00:02:48.790> going<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:48.940> be<00:02:49.000> really<00:02:49.150> easy<00:02:49.269> to<00:02:49.630> remove

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
it's going to be really easy to remove

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.370 
it's going to be really easy to remove
just<00:02:50.860> take<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.069> flip<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:51.519> over<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:53.080> like<00:02:53.230> it

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
just take it flip it over and I like it

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.760 
just take it flip it over and I like it
just<00:02:53.530> kind<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.769> DAB<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.220> first

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.770 

now<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.460> have<00:02:59.610> long<00:02:59.850> lashes<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.630> could

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
now you have long lashes you could

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.780 
now you have long lashes you could
probably<00:03:01.020> just<00:03:02.010> put<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.310> right<00:03:02.430> underneath

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
probably just put that right underneath

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.630 
probably just put that right underneath
and<00:03:03.120> do<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.300> same<00:03:03.510> thing<00:03:03.780> with<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.640> q-tip

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640

and do the same thing with this q-tip
make<00:03:06.390> sure<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.660> q-tip<00:03:06.960> is<00:03:07.110> damp<00:03:07.350> because<00:03:07.740> if

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
make sure the q-tip is damp because if

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.080 
make sure the q-tip is damp because if
