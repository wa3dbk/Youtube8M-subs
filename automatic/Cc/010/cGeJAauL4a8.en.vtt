00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:08.689
 pera today i want to stamp you one 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.689
 nail art show namely this one 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.570
 and yes it is very simple but it gives 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.429
 your nail just that little bit extra 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.160
 of course you can do with color 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.109
 or like a quieter year with a bvd 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.680
 colors 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:26.640
 I used the smoothie that is the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.310
 color 003 of bpf makeup that's it 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.060
 makeup brand of ici paris xl 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.170
 and so I am pretty at it and I think so 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:39.360
 a very nice car pink color and 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.610
 for the oblique detail I used 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.160
 from catrice de 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.730
 the 200 from so until then and that is one 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.250
 very beautiful 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.770
 taupe color you can also ban you 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.620
 glitters for smell or even if he 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.960
 really bright colors or very whole 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.270
 dark and very light but i found this 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.950
 even if you want to do dark and light 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.500
 I recommend that you first light 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.489
 good color I already have on my nails 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.170
 already done a color namely the snoopy 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.570
 and that is, say, the color we will later 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.210
 also goes over so you can't be weak 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.100
 and worship and then get over it because 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.570
 you not a nice effect but 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.260
 so i would always say the lightest 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.020
 color as a base so blurred already made and 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.900
 I will now show you how 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.030
 only pheromones it is a roll of tape 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.680
 and I would recommend this paste that is 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.690
 that white tape instead of the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.640
 transparent because that just leaves 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.940
 a little easier so let's go 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.130
 to start 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.920
 Well one thing I've done so now 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.100
 it's time for the other and so I already have 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.010
 applied two layers of this color 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.930
 I just have an advertisement according to submission 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.690
 so I put the dirty stickers on it 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.030
 can do what you do is you do one 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:56.340
 small piece of tape and that slice 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.200
 diagonally over your nail 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.840
 and I'll just say a little left 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.990
 at the bottom and then I stick it diagonally 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.990
 above 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.979
 so then you press that well so that the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:24.480
 nail polish cannot go to the other side 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:27.230
 leaking and then I pick up the color and then 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.230
 I apply it 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.640
 over the nail and I'll do it one more 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.040
 extra layer of shower only two thin 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.810
 layers 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.329
 because it is important that you follow immediately 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.620
 the adhesive tape you removed 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.670
 otherwise you will get the new one nicely and everything 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:54.030
 do you have your first 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:58.099
 angled nail so an adhesive tape 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.099
 you stick that across nail 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:07.290
 press well and two thin layers 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.879
 roof and what I will do as one 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.889
 is a bit dried then I'll go for a while 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.569
 thin over it but then I'll take care of it 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:16.410
 I avoided the edge a bit 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:22.829
 you didn't pour it over you 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:26.420
 Jane's clean line and you see it is 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.420
 super fast a super simple 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.700
 should take care of that about all equally 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:38.440
 sparkling wine or your right and that this 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.930
 Also stuck that right there 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.709
 no bumps or 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.709
 sit on things 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.990
 and as the last inch and with this you see 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.280
 that I made it a little smaller there 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.600
 sloping bit and I think so 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.600
 funny so i'm going here too 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:06.250
 so well that it will dry briefly and then 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:08.500
 it's time for the extra layer in the 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.700
 wall just very carefully 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.860
 place is where you will find that yet 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.860
 covered enough has a very thin layer 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.739
 if you have grown, you can do it 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.570
 always remove a bit with a 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.910
 cotton bud 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.910
 and then these are the final nails 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.510
 and then this is the final one 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.380
 end result 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.420
 so it's super simple and super fast 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.890
 gives something extra with a little something 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.380
 pink can always call it a top 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.450
 coat it over and i'm under you 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.890
 and then I notice that I don't 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.700
 really a top coat that makes sense anyway 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.170
 stays in place 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.060
 but you can just get a white top 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.550
 coat it over to prevent you 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.080
 also gets lockers when it goes fast 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.280
 chipping 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.820
 well i hope you liked it and 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.400
 simple and I hear coffee is fun 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.200
 find some nail art ducks 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.310
 fixed hour here for the over looking and 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.310
 I see you soon
