amount because I want it to be very

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.330 
amount because I want it to be very
thick<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.730> voluminous<00:00:42.300> braid<00:00:42.960> also<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.280> just

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
thick and a voluminous braid also I just

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.369 
thick and a voluminous braid also I just
wanted<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.969> make<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.180> note<00:00:45.420> as<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.899> see<00:00:46.140> I'm

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
wanted to make a note as you can see I'm

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.740 
wanted to make a note as you can see I'm
holding<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:46.980> quite<00:00:47.370> loose<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.969> my<00:00:48.090> hands<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
holding it quite loose in my hands and

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.049 
holding it quite loose in my hands and
that's<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.950> make<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.340> braid<00:00:50.579> also

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
that's going to make the braid also

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.080 
that's going to make the braid also
protrude<00:00:51.570> out<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.750> little<00:00:52.020> more<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:53.579> make

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
protrude out a little more and just make

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.260 
protrude out a little more and just make
it<00:00:54.120> look<00:00:54.600> less<00:00:55.020> less<00:00:55.590> tight<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.789> hopefully

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
it look less less tight and so hopefully

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.299 
it look less less tight and so hopefully
that<00:00:57.420> makes<00:00:57.600> sense<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.230> I'm<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:58.980> kind<00:00:59.250> of

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that makes sense but I'm just kind of

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.549 
that makes sense but I'm just kind of
having<00:00:59.640> my<00:00:59.760> hands<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.359> gentle<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
having my hands really gentle on it and

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.250 
having my hands really gentle on it and
it's<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.940> create<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.359> softer<00:01:03.930> looking

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
it's going to create a softer looking

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.929 
it's going to create a softer looking
braid<00:01:04.559> which<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> look<00:01:05.369> I'm<00:01:05.549> going<00:01:05.580> for

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
braid which is the look I'm going for

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.520 
braid which is the look I'm going for
and<00:01:06.860> my<00:01:07.860> hair<00:01:08.130> here<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:09.240> little<00:01:09.840> bit<00:01:09.960> curly

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
and my hair here is a little bit curly

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.039 
and my hair here is a little bit curly
so<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.460> adds<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.820> lot<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.970> texture<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.840> my

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
so that adds a lot of texture to my

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.649 
so that adds a lot of texture to my
braids<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.250> another<00:01:14.400> tip<00:01:14.909> if<00:01:15.119> you

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
braids so that is another tip if you

braids so that is another tip if you
want<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:17.040> enhance<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.820> look<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.210> your<00:01:18.299> braid

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
want to enhance the look of your braid

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.810 
want to enhance the look of your braid

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
here I'm also going to tug on it a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.890 
here I'm also going to tug on it a
little<00:01:22.860> more<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.909> create<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> loosening

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
little more just to create a loosening

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.980 
little more just to create a loosening
effect<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.970> love<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.659> way<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.930> looks

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
effect and I just love the way it looks

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.780 
effect and I just love the way it looks
when<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.439> kind<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.979> doesn't<00:01:29.280> look<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.460> Pippi

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
when it kind of it doesn't look as Pippi

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.999 
when it kind of it doesn't look as Pippi
Longstocking<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.900> feel<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.799> just

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
Longstocking it I feel like if you just

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.880 
Longstocking it I feel like if you just
give<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.310> little<00:01:32.430> bit<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.759> tug<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:34.229> now<00:01:34.530> I'm

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.260 
give it a little bit of a tug so now I'm
going<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.159> continue<00:01:35.579> on<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.850> other<00:01:35.970> side

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
