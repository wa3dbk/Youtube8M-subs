00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.360
 good morning friends artists 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.190
 the plot of land that instead 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.009
 we're going to see today is what I have 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.660
 used to carry on another 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:19.730
 cultivation method without water is here 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.279
 unlike the pallets the ground is 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.859
 Prepared plant layer per plant are 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.029
 holes have been created in the ground of 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:31.310
 30 cm x 30 and inside there was 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.700
 inserted the ground of the excavation 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:38.810
 mixed in equal parts with sand and 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.850
 straw and this is the result as 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.850
 you can see the row of cucumbers 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.560
 here instead we have a couple of plants of 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.580
 zucchini 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.580
 the small tomato 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:59.390
 reported as cultivation holes 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:01.790
 refer not at ground level into 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.850
 so as to have more control 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.240
 precise on the spontaneous that in any case not 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.710
 will be eliminated if not from the holes e 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.810
 that's enough 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.960
 so all this terrain now 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.479
 see semi discovered and we will leave it 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.729
 regrow we will keep only mowed and 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.890
 we will use mulching itself 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.759
 green that we have and mown this is 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.759
 a nice tomato 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.009
 a cucumber from the races 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.770
 these are the last tomatoes e 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.770
 automatic cupelli 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.730
 I do not know yet 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.549
 the varieties are but the plant is 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.549
 definitely good 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.390
 as you can see the plants do not 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.960
 give the same results as plants e 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:41.100
 reja rigati le regularly this mi 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.740
 it seems obvious, however, seeing what is going on 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.080
 happening in my garden I have to say that one 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.220
 cultivation without water is undoubtedly 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.550
 It is only necessary to understand which one 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.430
 is the most functional technique though 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.490
 I am convinced that every land is a 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.440
 ground of its own therefore for each type 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.670
 of land there is need for 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.200
 experiment more and more solutions in 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.469
 how much 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.810
 one is limiting and that being said is good 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:16.810
