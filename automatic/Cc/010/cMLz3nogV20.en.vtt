00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.670 
everything too oh yeah and this is also
the<00:01:41.970> code<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.570> equation<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.320> way<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.500> can

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the code for equation that way you can

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.770 
the code for equation that way you can
use<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.460> game<00:01:45.090> itself<00:01:45.420> which<00:01:45.659> of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
use it in the game itself which of

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.760 
use it in the game itself which of
course<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.259> want<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.799> keep<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.040> code<00:01:48.770> remove

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
course I want to keep the code remove

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.740 
course I want to keep the code remove
that<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.820> guess<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> primal<00:01:51.630> clash

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
that and I guess with a primal clash

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.410 
that and I guess with a primal clash
because<00:01:52.020> that's<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.350> oldest<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.040> packs
