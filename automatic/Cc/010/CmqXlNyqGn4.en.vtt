 I hope you are quite well and 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.380
 Well, my name is mod gamer 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.020
 welcome back video and how do you 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.840
 I had promised today we will talk 3 reasons 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.230
 for which cortana can not return 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.630
 in gilo 4 so well then today we are going to 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.309
 touch this really very relevant topic 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.620
 for many fans because good this 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.480
 well they cut themselves to cause 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.790
 too much controversy between the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.590
 community leave it by which we will give 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.780
 some reasons why we imagine 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.609
 that will cut can not return so 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.589
 well before starting this video 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.659
 I would only ask you please 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.480
 you'll leave a like before it started 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.519
 really this video will love you and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.199
 Well, I would ask you please, who supported 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.600
 too much this video in case they want a 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.730
 second part where we talked about 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.589
 another theme of the halo universe you already know 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.839
 talk about master gibson talk about 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.000
 something else that happened so 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.159
 good leave your like and without more we start 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.159
 with three reasons why they cut to 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.659
 can not return in halo 4 the reason 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.610
 number one is that integrity 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.760
 artistic has become a subject 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.590
 red-hot from the end other 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.360
 if you have not played this franchise then 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.670
 well the main protagonist of this 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.070
 series died at the end of mass effect 3 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.680
 so, well, first of all alert 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.690
 of spoiler already very late maybe but 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.430
 good and well as many fans of 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.190
 the mass effect franchise felt 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.410
 disparaged because they could not see a 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.710
 happy ending that although bioware was shown 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.900
 receptive to this kind of thing that was 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.880
 so far from launching one of ls that 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.120
 modified the end of the mass campaign 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.640
 effect 3 for more than anything to give likes 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.440
 to the fans the argument presented by 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.410
 bioware is that for integrity 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.800
 artistic simply a very question 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.830
 interesting video games can be 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.630
 considered art since it was raised 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.090
 this question really left in doubt to 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.090
 many studies and companies because good 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.770
 merriam webster defines that art is the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.170
 conscious use of skill and 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.920
 creative imagination especially in the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.080
 production of aesthetic objects and this 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.420
 more than anything can be applied in the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.550
 video game industry 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.550
 if the goal of art is to make the 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.560
 viewer or reader feels something good or 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.190
 bad feel sad feel emotions 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.140
 really forced by letters or scenes 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.090
 then the anger of halo fans 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.450
 it would really indicate that the video game 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.920
 is forged really maturely and more 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.470
 that nothing is considered art 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.510
 the death of cut at the end of July 4 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.180
 did more than provoke a reaction 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.450
 emotional in the fans this 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.920
 He performed an essential artistic function 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.260
 inspiring you to converse and more than 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.170
 that caused the fans to do 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.819
 questions the loss of cortana caused 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.950
 that the player will ask about the 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.920
 mortality and the humanity of the boss 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.750
 teacher causing a pain in the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.540
 visualization of the master boss in the 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.940
 loss of cut more than anything brawling 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.519
 industry was announced its goal 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.709
 main thing that was to cause sensations to 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.569
 the players and they did not feel that 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.120
 they were playing a game where only 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.060
 you can have fun and it can not cause you 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.920
 no feeling more than anything did 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.040
 understand to the players that not everything is 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.519
 pink color no story is perfect 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.150
 not every story has a happy ending and 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.280
 there will always be losses 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.510
 really important not only in a 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.019
 video game but also in real life 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.060
 more than anything he stopped pampering us and 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.140
 make us understand that it is not always going to 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.420
 be all the same 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.310
 it will not be cut to save you 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.020
 the master boss ass every 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.520
 problems or when you need help because 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.010
 really from master boss it was never 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.210
 independent and three for three wants 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.240
 focus on the master boss 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.380
 he wants us to know him more humanely 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.880
 not like an elite killing machine 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.140
 master chip has to make decisions 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.600
 own 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.340
 have to think properly have a 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.730
 problem fixing 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.410
 you have a question solve the the 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.330
 Most fans of three four tribe 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.970
 maybe seeing the death of cortana 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.420
 he thought he was just giving him 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:36.210
 more suspense to the series or franchise and 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.550
 that there really would be a duplication of 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.380
 cortana and then he will deny everything that is 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.690
 took out that they cut up alive and 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.860
 all happy but it is not like that he 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.040
 really tri for you what is 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.680
 pretending to associate art like that more than 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.360
 nothing agile or art we carry four 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.790
 franchises following the linear history 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.820
 leave it where they cut to is always there 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.850
 to save the day and I do not say that 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.400
 only cut to show me equal 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.510
 to saved but that does not always 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.300
 is helping 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.850
 maybe the fans have a feeling of 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.670
 security because they probably think 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.100
 than to cut it again but they forget a 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.980
 little of that master boss before being 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.760
 Spartan was human and not only is it a 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:24.070
 machine to kill, let alone a robot 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.660
 in summary three four three what is 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.330
 making known is what is doing 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.760
 art is causing more than anything 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.650
 feeling in the players is doing 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.300
 feel to the players sensations that 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.610
 You really can not feel with a 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.470
 video game those sensations that 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.590
 you can only feel when you read a 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.650
 book you watch a movie or even you 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.030
 they tell a story personally this 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.710
 is the number one reason why 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.930
 they cut to can not go back to turn four 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.900
 because three for three is giving 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.610
 artistic integrity to the franchise and 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.040
 good bands like I really realized 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.960
 that this video is going to be a bit long 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.530
 I prefer to divide this video into three 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.600
 videos or what will be coming out this week 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.760
 each video will last around 58 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.830
 minutes because I want more than anything 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.900
 you entertain yourself and focus on 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.409
 every reason and do not watch a video of 15 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.319
 minute 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:16.389
 20 minutes not only will they leave 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:18.279
 forgetting after each reason what 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.800
 I said earlier so well then 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:23.139
 I prefer to do this so they lose 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.999
 some detail of each video and good 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.009
 band that was all for today I hope you 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:28.839
 I like the video, he gave you a like 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.580
 have a favorite and share this video 

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:32.529
 and more than anything and I think it 's the most 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.110
 important please comment here below 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:36.879
 what do you think about this really 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.309
 your opinion is very interesting and more than anything 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:41.649
 make your criteria known to others 

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:44.469
 people also subscribe to the channel if 

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:49.589
 you have not done it and without more I am gay mer 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:49.589
 until the next and dreams of the bag
