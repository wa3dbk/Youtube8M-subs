00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
into other kinds of platforms now when I

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.170 
into other kinds of platforms now when I
was<00:01:40.570> younger<00:01:40.869> I<00:01:41.200> actually<00:01:41.649> thought<00:01:42.220> that<00:01:42.610> I

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
was younger I actually thought that I

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.359 
was younger I actually thought that I
could<00:01:43.450> only<00:01:43.600> do<00:01:43.869> that<00:01:44.020> with<00:01:44.200> comedy<00:01:44.619> but<00:01:45.189> as

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
could only do that with comedy but as

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.880 
could only do that with comedy but as
I've<00:01:45.549> gotten<00:01:45.579> older<00:01:46.119> I<00:01:46.540> discovered<00:01:47.380> through

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
I've gotten older I discovered through

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.679 
I've gotten older I discovered through
diversification<00:01:48.430> that<00:01:49.090> it<00:01:49.180> was<00:01:49.299> a<00:01:49.329> little<00:01:49.570> bit

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
diversification that it was a little bit

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.749 
diversification that it was a little bit
more<00:01:49.869> than<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.380> that<00:01:50.560> I<00:01:50.860> could<00:01:51.100> also<00:01:51.310> take

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
more than that that I could also take

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.450 
more than that that I could also take
information<00:01:52.259> immediately<00:01:53.259> transfer<00:01:54.189> it<00:01:54.310> into

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
information immediately transfer it into

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.490 
information immediately transfer it into
inspiration<00:01:55.329> I<00:01:55.540> could<00:01:56.049> turn<00:01:56.229> it<00:01:56.289> into

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
inspiration I could turn it into

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.730 
inspiration I could turn it into
motivation<00:01:57.250> I<00:01:57.670> can<00:01:58.090> offer<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:58.509> as<00:01:58.659> guidance<00:01:59.289> so

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
motivation I can offer it as guidance so

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.740 
motivation I can offer it as guidance so
now<00:02:00.009> sitting<00:02:00.640> on<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.729> talk<00:02:01.060> show<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:01.479> actually
