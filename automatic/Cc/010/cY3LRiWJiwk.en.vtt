00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.150
 hello nature caron for education 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.360
 canine four-legged this time 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.160
 it was thought by a small capsule 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.200
 to look a little at the received ideas the 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.610
 to the idea that it would have trained my 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.860
 dog on the bases of daewoo how 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.080
 operate the wolves in master between 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.580
 with them we will see them if we go 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.510
 look at the difference between ideas 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.510
 received flees the reality 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.269
 often when I came in for consultation 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.280
 in people a pose as a question 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.100
 what do I have to do to be a 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.410
 good meter 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.480
 often lyon as an idea that they have to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.269
 to be murder leaders 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.370
 dominant that their dog owes them 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.280
 perceive as being dominant for 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.109
 that they obey them in fact I'm not 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.479
 saying that the dog nothing to 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.710
 to see with him because it's undeniable 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.979
 the wolf dogs are alike 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.430
 a lot about on full full point of 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.869
 both physical and behavioral view 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.880
 on the other hand what I sell nothing to say 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.630
 is that what predominates is 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.270
 the environment 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.789
 that's what makes a behavior go 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.069
 to express oneself or not and the environment 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.929
 which live dogs with us gold 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.659
 nothing to do with the environment is 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.039
 in fact what we want with nash and that's 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.470
 have a good relationship 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.060
 it is the basis to have a relationship of 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.100
 unimportant trust because their 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.740
 which an individual if we are going to have 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.929
 exchanges of collaboration 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.649
 but the other person must not 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.119
 not threatened in any way by us 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.549
 then from the moment when in one 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.060
 relationship of trust that was habib 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.130
 beautiful we can work with methods 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.340
 positive again the who will contribute 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.110
 always always day after day at 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.659
 make sure the animal is in 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.030
 trust and who is willing to do 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.280
 a lot of things if we get it right 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.280
 to convey to him possible ways 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.050
 in fact the ideas that were conveyed 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.350
 the idea of making submissions 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.510
 for example to a dog to show him 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.560
 what we stop a little bit more than 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.870
 look at the situation 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.000
 it's pretty easy enough to surrender 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.550
 that it makes no sense for the 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.380
 in the dog may not even that already 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.680
 that we say no no it's not that 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.470
 it will not even make the name link done 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.060
 why the questions we made a 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.340
 submission h and we are not trying 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.020
 to establish only nothing one is 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.720
 only in the process of establishing fear 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.520
 compared to dogs the chic apart 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.980
 that we do not have a submission that 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.800
 actually submit ben we are not in 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.630
 train us to show him that we have 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.920
 good scents of good intentions to 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.959
 his respect is not at all by the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.330
 force we'll get to have a good 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.030
 relationship with his animal must 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.830
 really get a little bit like 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.959
 we wanted to tame a squirrel 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.739
 banks do all the individuals are 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.049
 tamed so much between us when 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.269
 we have interactions that with the 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.430
 numbers must be tamed tame 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.500
 it means being able to observe is 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.750
 able to go to the rhythm of each 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.120
 each species a different way of 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.400
 communicated then even if we do not know 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.500
 every detail that says that the dog 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.150
 canyon tail like that the ears 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.070
 as if he is saying 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.799
 something but there is way to get 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.590
 put in a mode to feel what 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.269
 the animal tries to both of us 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.450
 communicate as emotion does that 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.340
 the animal and the dog much more than 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.739
 cream what can we ever 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.489
 the shield precisely because it understands 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.200
 not all that puts him in a situation 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.750
 of anxiety quite often for a lot of 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.459
 at most the schema will understand the 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.349
 things so we will get better 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:10.230
 communicate with him for months we will see 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:10.950
 hsu the dog does not need so a chef 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.150
 of pack 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.480
 there is no need for relationships 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.760
 conflicting for to obey what they 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.010
 need here the techniques 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.590
 learning the science of 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.300
 learning is it's available a 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.990
 who want to study the science of 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.570
 behavior 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.100
 it's technical things it's 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.960
 knowledge when one has his 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.510
 knowledge one is able to 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.669
 work and train and 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.560
 communicate things to several 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.310
 different species and that the leader 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.530
 lumber 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.120
 he can stay home Thursday it's 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.889
 often when I have clients 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.010
 families for example who have 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.139
 kids 2010 but in the bottom what 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.729
 you tell me that sounds a lot like this 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.889
 that we do with children and 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.330
 actually it looks a lot like this 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.430
 that you do with children it's up to 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.750
 say to divert the attention of pau 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.310
 focus on a problem ago 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.440
 many things that look alike 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.840
 a lot because it's behavior 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.270
 and you have to stop seeing the dog 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.889
 as being a species completely at 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.840
 share of all other species for 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.600
 who this one must look at the mode of 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.900
 new to know how to act with the ch 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.460
 and we look at the us in relation to his 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.510
 environment we look at dogs by 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.100
 relation to its environment 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.660
 is what to ask yourself as 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.880
 question do not know what is it 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.590
 to be good meters what we 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.080
 must ask is what am I 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.000
 have to know to get well 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.570
 educated monchy does that it's really 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.370
 knowledge then again support 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.770
 important to go get them and that's 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.380
 sure if we work in reinforcement 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.000
 positive my job trust with 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.889
 our dog the trust report 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.530
 between us two then in addition to the 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:53.620
 motivation the positive reinforcement is 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:56.340
 extraordinary to fill a lot 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.340
 more than a role 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.750
 it's important to question yourself 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.420
 observe an archive for sure if we 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.070
 lifts it is by being convinced that the 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.070
 dog works by rare chic month 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.990
 then we apply our education to 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.360
 this way the with with our dog 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.130
 well we will have a balance of power if 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.690
 we want we're going to have a relationship that 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.160
 does that make me feel 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.140
 that the dog actually works 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.260
 like that makes that important 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.390
 it's about being really open to the idea 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:32.200
 to observe the individual the dog with whom 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:34.600
 we can try to tame 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.540
 know and the other is always there 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.460
 go to the comfort of another the 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.770
 cheese if attic not getting us 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.230
 to say who wants to be better than who 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.730
 wants to take over on us he is 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.190
 probably just saying 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.870
 which is uncomfortable in a situation 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.180
 do not forget that all the behaviors 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.670
 are taught the good ones as bad 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.650
 so if she had me down behavior 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.570
 was learned in the same way that good 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.830
 behavior and last section puts 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.810
 the emphasis would be to take the good 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.810
 behaviours 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.800
 we have young people 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.800
 a good deal kill 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.620
 you
