00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.449
 yes 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.589
 we have taken advantage of this new change of 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.750
 sb to make a change in what they are 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.489
 the ways of working in such a way that 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.760
 the closed spaces disappear 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.320
 individual to allow all the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.659
 world is in open spaces and 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.339
 common and thus promote communication 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.460
 and the interaction between all 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:08.189
 members of the bbva team with which 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.799
 already at any level of the bank we have 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.360
 closed offices and this model is being 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.929
 implanting not only in Madrid but at 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.640
 length and width of the entire geography of the 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:22.429
 balloon where today bbva is operating from 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.429
 america to asia passing through europe 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.420
 Y 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.960
 i 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.240
 we have incorporated in the new headquarters these 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.400
 elements that you can see on the roof that 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.130
 are the cold beams are elements that 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.509
 they have very low energy consumption 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.909
 they hardly have maintenance because they do not 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.500
 They have engines and also provide a great 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.030
 comfort to the user because they do not have 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.030
 noise and do not generate currents 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.219
 the branches that you see here are about 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.159
 fiberglass elements and a 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:23.159
 metal structure what they do is 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.319
 prevent the sun from penetrating between the cde 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.269
 forcing air conditioning as you always see 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.319
 they have a shape that allows the view of 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.329
 any of the employees that are 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.329
 working and there's always light 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.799
 natural within the office complex 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.720
 they are fixed and they do not move that is a 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.280
 classic question because they were placed with 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.840
 the most unfavorable position of the sun 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.840
 to always protect the facade 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.320
 this room has a particularity and 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.310
 is that by connecting with the different 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.050
 bags from all over the world where bbva operates 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.520
 it remains open almost 24 hours a day 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.370
 day because it has to go connecting with 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.710
 the different time zones that 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.200
 they keep the different bags then 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.390
 in this room there are very conditions 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.700
 specific air conditioning 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.530
 habitability lighting so that the 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.400
 people can work in a way 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.400
 comfortable 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.360
 now we are in the restoration zone 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.310
 which is an area that we have also created 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.390
 with that idea of â€‹â€‹giving service to 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.220
 employee here employees can eat 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.660
 in a fairly broad schedule there is a 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.760
 zone of tui flow where there is a lot 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.810
 variety of dishes healthy food 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.090
 prepared different types of menus the 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.069
 helpful people take their tray their food and 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.510
 sits in these areas to eat and 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.980
 It is also used as an area of 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.330
 informal meeting to have take a 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.330
 Coffee have a meeting at the given moment - 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
 protocolized 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.470
 ah
