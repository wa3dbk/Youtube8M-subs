00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:23.720
 new material tekken come in 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.359
 media what then I was obliged 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:32.040
 so I bought a card 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:36.109
 his pc the express 7 gameline points in 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.269
 solo what as you see it 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:44.489
 lately I had the razer helmet 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:47.160
 kama have 7 points but that has been plugged 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.809
 on my motherboard and then suddenly I 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.470
 find that are at the map level 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.080
 mother farran not really clearly 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.910
 super what suddenly I had to 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.790
 to buy another map so are from 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.239
 shot I bought myself a 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.940
 this beautiful is beautiful maps are what 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.540
 really gorgeous new the box or so 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.340
 it's the same 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:15.340
 so we'll see inside so in 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:20.260
 hoping that it gives good at the level of 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:23.710
 his and what can I tell you 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:27.430
 it's a card gamer card 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:32.340
 gamer so he's really living 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:36.430
 really pretty what and if you see there 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.570
 but really great so there and at 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.570
 see you out of cayla 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.759
 we know what, then, I'm going to do 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:55.810
 will try to open that with you so 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:02:00.630
 we will take a small pick-up for 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:05.370
 cut the small the little sticker 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.370
 Germans they left the coupe 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.510
 then we will open it 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.319
 then tac tac tac same principle like that 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.099
 the 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:43.519
 you listen to PhD students leave 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:46.760
 our side I think we're going back 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:55.939
 at the mac announces to get out the little 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:03:06.489
 box and here is the little beast 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:09.290
 she went out so I take a lot 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:13.340
 so suddenly I'll plug his 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:19.699
 on the plessis hespress neo of the map 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:22.400
 mother so I tell you I'm going up 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:28.510
 that on the pc and I tell you everything to 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.510
 the time the interns to the party away 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:37.129
 here I am again so it's good 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:41.479
 happened so I 'm going to mount the map are 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:44.479
 on the sound card pc cash on a 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:47.659
 motherboard route so as one 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:49.020
 look a little we will go down to the level 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.830
 2 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.610
 next to the graphics card at the level 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.500
 graphics cards 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.510
 so there was a little problem there 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.720
 it is that I was obliged to 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.070
 shifting is the past in high school but 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.690
 have graphic cards to avoid 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.880
 game over 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.520
 as you see above the 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.350
 sound card that she has that avoids touching 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.220
 to make a bad contact at the level of 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.700
 the watercooling plate of the map 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.360
 graphic 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:22.170
 so here are the pretty little products 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.960
 new equipment the cards are zone 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.950
 so you see the logo that 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.560
 torn up 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:36.630
 it's a very pretty thing so we can 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:40.380
 see one is the level of the principle 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:44.730
 it's in all of outings to 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:48.870
 the back so that's 5 points to 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:51.670
 2.0 for a normal helmet and in seven 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.940
 points so 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:58.180
 on the whole frankly it's about 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.360
 ball so I show you quickly on 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:07.330
 at the level of my screen so we will spend 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:11.560
 on the screen above or my pc so if we 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:14.500
 look good we see that on 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.820
 the screen you have a kind of life 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:22.990
 trinitarian so unpunished land that allows 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:28.180
 to settle some basics so a few 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:30.820
 basic level of play at the level of sound 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.270
 at the level of profiles who is really 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.420
 not bad too that does not hurt is 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:43.260
 that one 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:43.260
 so we can go into fps so less 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:52.960
 so I say he's in 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.289
 the whole seems to be not bad 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.750
 what if we look good 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.610
 so normally I'm going to torch the 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:06.090
 light from the camcorder 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:13.000
 so we see that it's marked action rpg 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:15.479
 rts games music movies and then fps 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.750
 you can also create profiles 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:22.029
 personalized so honestly I have not 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.590
 really had the time to customize 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:31.469
 because I was thoroughly in the game 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:35.409
 in bf3 what happens to the next so 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:38.500
 also you have then moncla you do 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:41.860
 right click on the right click you 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.810
 have all the little gadgets 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.960
 it 's a gadget a detour a 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.690
 sampling you all have you 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.819
 can settle any case if you want 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:56.529
 could do everything and everything everything 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:59.979
 all so you have the micro optics so 

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:04.740
 we can put the headset in 2.0 so there 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:08.180
 I'm going to sleep there we see here it is so 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.529
 I leave you 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.809
 overall I 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:15.749
 I said more for the map 

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:17.749
 are for now what works what 

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:20.899
 with 

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:24.509
 Thiam with my headphones to seven points 

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:26.759
 for now I'm telling you let me 

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:27.659
 the time a few months and then we'll see 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:29.729
 the results 

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:35.729
 we will see if there is something 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:38.459
 silva will it will be girls 

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:40.289
 things that will work more where I 

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:43.169
 know nothing so we'll see soon I 

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:46.259
