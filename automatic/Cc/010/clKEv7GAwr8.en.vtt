00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.549
 do not 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.599
 what I liked most has been 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.689
 especially work with the team when 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.220
 these trumpets butt hours working 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.470
 because in the end this becomes your 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.210
 family the possibility of retaking the 80's 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.250
 already from the personal point of view has 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.949
 been super fun one of the scenes 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.019
 what I liked the most was the demo 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.640
 the persecution that there is that of the 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.440
 people pulled a lot with this make a 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.059
 game very similar to what had already 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.059
 played as a child when he was little 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.370
 blatter to me what bind me 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.160
 obviously in the bistro in his time 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.199
 user a lot the third in the case 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.629
 of the angels and secret games we 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.360
 we mark budgets and calendars 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.340
 typical of the time when they were made 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.350
 it was very fun very stimulating 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.660
 surely the best of the project 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.250
 hamburgers of 500 grams of the book 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.380
 meet commissions when you have 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.700
 faced with an immense problem the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.329
 moment in which they solve those 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.520
 have microsoft studios as the 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.619
 first project of a new study is 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.329
 a dream come true have given us 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.759
 a lot of freedom when it comes to working 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.860
 have respect and support in our 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.360
 philosophy and our state very comfortable 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.360
 with them because it makes everything very easy 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.310
 and the bad things or maybe the worst that 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.230
 many times we had to redo 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.940
 your things only makes more sense 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.890
 uncomfortable have the bookmarks been so 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.290
 because the work process without this 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.970
 ingenious the games especially because 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.010
 has to be able to be very easy on paper 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.960
 then at the time of doing so it starts at 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.000
 realize that a then fails the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.550
 work is the boat and the worst as in 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.500
 all projects there are always 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.620
 situations of tension there are always 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.600
 stress situations we all know 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.610
 just like we beat new voices 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.880
 Some beers are hard to move 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.550
 so many people integrate the artistic part 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.170
 with the technique are artists who 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.790
 they have to move in a very technical world 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.989
 or technicians that have to move the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.709
 very artistic world 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:37.250
 I'm not think they're mention for 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.250
 to transmit 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.780
 past the time to correct them 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.100
 arise very concrete things very 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.500
 quickly in very little time 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.480
 Cançons I think the project is 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.490
 one of the most difficult things of many 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.230
 things that we liked to put and that 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.390
 they have had to give out then because 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.430
 they were not as fun as they sounded 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.470
 the experience was changed too 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.260
 as there was no time to leave them 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.510
 well the artists the designers are 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.570
 is making a living improving itself 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.710
 game by time budget of usa a 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.840
 moment when you have to say until 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.840
 here or with kaká you go more 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.760
 Y 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:37.330
 and I fulfilled this game because if you're 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.730
 act of a kill kills muscle action 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.379
 so and that is a bit massa press 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.629
 this is quota I think we have 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.079
 managed to make a game that has the 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:50.430
 spirit of some games that not only 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.430
 they but many people admire a lot 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.230
 although they are percent only for 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.970
 navigate those scenarios provide with 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.480
 is all environmental I think that I already 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.640
 I brought a classic spirit game with 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.160
 what I think are the graphics 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.519
 most spectacular that have been made 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.120
 so far for a platform as is 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.120
 express life park 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:54.880
 but we have lost 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.040
 It is the best in the world very friendly 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:12.400
 same the gentleman in fact come on I do not 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.400
 I was waiting for someone so young 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.690
 the time when it meets as it 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.820
 same because he also programmed things 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.820
 difficult but no longer 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.620
 and I also have directions
