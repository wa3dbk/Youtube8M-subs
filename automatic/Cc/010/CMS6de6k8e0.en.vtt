00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.010 
for that and if you're gonna use them on
turf<00:01:22.549> be<00:01:23.549> prepared<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:24.630> get<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> lot

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
of scuffs and stuff like that because

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.460 
of scuffs and stuff like that because
the<00:01:26.729> only<00:01:26.909> problems<00:01:27.210> I've<00:01:27.360> heard<00:01:27.570> are<00:01:28.200> from

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
the only problems I've heard are from

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.490 
the only problems I've heard are from
people<00:01:28.619> who<00:01:28.829> use<00:01:28.979> them<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.250> turf<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.409> you<00:01:31.409> know

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
these aren't really built for turf so if

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.080 
these aren't really built for turf so if
you're<00:01:34.470> looking<00:01:34.650> or<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.280> usually<00:01:35.490> play<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.909> lot

you're looking or you usually play a lot
on<00:01:36.210> turf<00:01:36.420> then<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.750> would<00:01:36.900> say<00:01:37.049> go<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> pair

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
on turf then I would say go with a pair

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.370 
on turf then I would say go with a pair
of<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.070> know<00:01:38.159> maybe<00:01:38.369> t-90s<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.270> ctr360<00:01:40.229> s

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
of you know maybe t-90s or ctr360 s

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.740 
of you know maybe t-90s or ctr360 s
since<00:01:41.220> those<00:01:41.430> contain<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.150> know<00:01:42.180> much<00:01:42.479> more

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
since those contain you know much more

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.980

durable<00:01:43.200> studs<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.770> there<00:01:44.299> but<00:01:45.299> overall<00:01:45.600> it's

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
durable studs on there but overall it's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.240
