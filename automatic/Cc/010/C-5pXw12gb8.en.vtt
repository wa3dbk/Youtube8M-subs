00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.600
 I know that a video of how is the 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.860
 better in whites 2 but this is like the 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.530

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.200
 they are going to help you to be better and 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:30.350
 take out streaks of losses and the tips tips 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.899
 that basically is the least good 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.590
 first tip that I'm going to give you is to use 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.220
 muffler 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.030
 when you are a silencer 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.430
 automatically disappearing from the map 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.220
 nobody can see them unless the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.750
 my enemies here I lived and well this 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.580
 silencer technique is useful when 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.170
 You want to be silent and you want me not to 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.640
 have so many enemies at the same time 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.470
 because that's what happens when you do not 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.830
 He used silencer you come all 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.199
 enemies like flies in honey and if nothing and 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.050
 if you kill one the other 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.080
 is coming will kill you and good second guy 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.760
 you have to be focused or you're 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.830
 concentrate is paying attention to what 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.250
 what is happening around you when 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.380
 you do that automatically improve your 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.970
 aim you concentrate you do that your 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.990
 aim is more direct and by killing the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.500
 enemy's death 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.280
 third type runs around how much with 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.340
 your surroundings 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.170
 automatically 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.570
 he got rid of a lot of the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.060
 enemies because basically all of them 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.030
 they go to the middle two enemies go to the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.530
 mean and they have they are fighting 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.750
 the others who are in the middle while 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.759
 you are grabbing them in the back 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.469
 because you're pulling everything around 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.729
 the danger or you're just killing 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:46.979
 one by one and sometimes you're going to bump two 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.600
 but no more than three with the forces 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.390
 winding your map surroundings 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.549
 fourth type do not be campero no camps is 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.509
 because that's all because basically 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.600
 first you're not ruining the 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.250
 community he likes the campers and 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.060
 simply when you change monsters 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.899
 that you are not a good player 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.489
 and apart from changing, it does not feel good 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.830
 only reason why you should change if 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.160
 you are very nervous and you are going to take out 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.920
 a high streak like the orbital visa in 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:24.959
 the dogs I am like that 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.099
 fifth use coast to bias which is 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.349
 basically the same as with the 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.150
 silencer disappear from the map the 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.420
 enemy is moved and it no longer affects you 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.989
 you are invisible if you appear in the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.239
 dot 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.530
 if you appear with a little dot on top 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.470
 the radar 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.870
 that automatically turned into a 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.620
 easy prey for the enemy and you're going to 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.620
 kill very fast 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.970
 keep your eye on the minimum for 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.040
 minimap is super important because 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.800
 because first of all it is revealing 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.260
 the enemy red spots that are us 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.340
 shooting and that tells you where it is 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.030
 the bad guys 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.640
 second 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.400
 If you have a baby that's the best you 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.260
 it can happen apart from the time of talbisa 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.240
 and with him I lived you know more where 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.860
 are the enemies eye there is no that 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.100
 be trusted because some people who 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.209
 use goes as I am saying and if you 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.209
 you trust you will kill you 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.960
 usa 44 is the second best but 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.800
 after silence 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.240
 4 s with the micro point fast and that 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.570
 basically if you're running or if 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.920
 you are walking normally you are going to have 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.330
 a greater advantage over the enemy 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.810
 because you're going to aim faster and 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.270
 last you will win that possible advantage 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.980
 that you will have more precision to the 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.940
 time to shoot because they come together 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.940
 enemy but not tips 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.200
 the eighth exceptional type is not 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.960
 necessarily very important which is 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.550
 do tricks the center can be useful 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.890
 maybe it can not be shelf 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.810
 maybe the fight may win 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.100
 that you may be sheltering the enemy 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.920
 but that depends on you 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.270
 plays the objective when the 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.970
 objective 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.200
 this is to take out the high gusts only 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.420
 you can dominate with what you're going to say 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.800
 buy with hardware games if you 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.140
 play the goal is not only 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.019
 dreaming of the team that is helping itself 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.270
 same for what 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.090
 so you can take out your missed streaks and 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.340
 this is basically playing the goal 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.280
 and well, the last one I can give you 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.080
 is to be careful not to go 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.850
 running all the time that always 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.479
 be careful with the movements that 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:42.720
 do and what types that apply all 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:45.330
 these that I finish them and well they would be 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.949
 All 10 tips that will help us 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.840
 be better at fever and not just in 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.260
 this black ops the fate in all in 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.169
