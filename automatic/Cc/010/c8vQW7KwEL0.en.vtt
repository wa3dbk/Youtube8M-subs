00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.969 
shooting and that's where you can kind
of<00:02:03.119> slow<00:02:03.420> down<00:02:03.450> time<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.349> actually<00:02:04.770> select

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
of slow down time and actually select

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.339 
of slow down time and actually select
your<00:02:05.310> target<00:02:05.750> strategically<00:02:06.750> right<00:02:07.080> in<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
your target strategically right in the

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.949 
your target strategically right in the
head<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.770> then<00:02:08.280> basically<00:02:08.819> execute<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.569> you

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
head and then basically execute and you

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.630 
head and then basically execute and you
know<00:02:10.080> kill<00:02:10.560> them<00:02:10.709> all<00:02:10.860> at<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.130> same<00:02:11.340> time

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
know kill them all at the same time

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.640 
know kill them all at the same time
which<00:02:11.880> is<00:02:11.940> very<00:02:12.330> similar<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.810> Splinter<00:02:13.470> Cell

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
which is very similar to Splinter Cell

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.230 
which is very similar to Splinter Cell
Conviction<00:02:13.830> if<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> play<00:02:14.490> back<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.730> there's

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
Conviction if you play back in there's

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.150 
Conviction if you play back in there's
also<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.599> precision<00:02:16.380> shooting<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.980> just

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
also a precision shooting you just

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.980 
also a precision shooting you just
slightly<00:02:17.580> it's<00:02:18.209> using<00:02:18.540> pulling<00:02:18.840> down<00:02:18.959> the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
slightly it's using pulling down the

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.230 
slightly it's using pulling down the
trigger<00:02:19.260> just<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.709> bit<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.430> not<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:21.120> know

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
trigger just a bit this is not you know

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.880 
trigger just a bit this is not you know
hold<00:02:21.630> your<00:02:21.810> breath<00:02:21.959> aiming<00:02:22.410> this<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.650> kind<00:02:22.860> of

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
hold your breath aiming this is kind of

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.500 
hold your breath aiming this is kind of
like<00:02:23.010> everything<00:02:23.370> slows<00:02:23.670> down<00:02:23.700> if<00:02:24.180> any<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.450> mean

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
like everything slows down if any I mean

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.720 
like everything slows down if any I mean
then<00:02:24.810> for<00:02:25.050> some<00:02:25.200> reason<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.650> makes<00:02:25.680> more<00:02:26.670> sense

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
then for some reason it makes more sense

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.440 
then for some reason it makes more sense
they<00:02:27.360> also<00:02:27.480> have<00:02:27.659> instinct

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
they also have instinct

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.910 
they also have instinct
which<00:02:28.690> is<00:02:28.810> kind<00:02:28.990> of<00:02:29.020> like<00:02:29.170> detective<00:02:29.650> motive

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
which is kind of like detective motive

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.309 
which is kind of like detective motive
Batman<00:02:30.250> yeah<00:02:30.459> it's<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:31.000> when<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.420> go<00:02:31.630> when

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.030 
of cover when the enemy AI spots you
that's<00:06:34.050> when<00:06:34.260> they<00:06:34.350> get<00:06:34.470> really<00:06:34.680> dumb<00:06:34.920> they

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
that's when they get really dumb they

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.800 
that's when they get really dumb they
just<00:06:35.190> start<00:06:35.340> firing<00:06:35.610> anything<00:06:36.330> because<00:06:36.690> of

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
just start firing anything because of

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.140 
just start firing anything because of
that<00:06:36.900> AI<00:06:37.110> problem<00:06:37.680> some<00:06:38.010> missions<00:06:38.400> don't<00:06:38.910> feel

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
that AI problem some missions don't feel

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.570 
that AI problem some missions don't feel
that<00:06:39.360> fulfilling<00:06:40.170> but<00:06:40.500> overall<00:06:40.890> I<00:06:41.340> thought<00:06:41.520> it

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
that fulfilling but overall I thought it

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.820 
that fulfilling but overall I thought it
was<00:06:41.760> fantastic<00:06:42.330> what<00:06:42.480> would<00:06:42.630> you<00:06:43.230> better<00:06:43.410> say
