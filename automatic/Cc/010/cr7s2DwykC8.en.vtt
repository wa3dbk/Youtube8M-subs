to<00:01:59.040> place<00:01:59.250> as<00:01:59.549> real<00:02:00.060> escaping<00:02:00.659> him<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.439> that's

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
to place as real escaping him and that's

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.530 
to place as real escaping him and that's
because<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.130> mean<00:02:02.399> that's<00:02:02.850> why<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.090> don't<00:02:03.270> like

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540

to see like rice skating play skate

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.089 
to see like rice skating play skate
because<00:02:06.329> there's<00:02:06.689> play<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.140> unrealistic<00:02:07.710> they

different<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.500> love<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:14.010> play

skate realistic I love to make my own

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.839 
skate realistic I love to make my own
montage<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.010> that's<00:02:17.190> what<00:02:17.310> kind<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.580> didn't

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
montage and that's what kind of didn't

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.270 
montage and that's what kind of didn't
work<00:02:18.000> about<00:02:18.360> Tony<00:02:19.050> Hawk's<00:02:19.319> program<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.099> you

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
work about Tony Hawk's program that you

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.600 
work about Tony Hawk's program that you
it<00:02:20.640> added<00:02:21.060> like<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.239> video<00:02:21.690> editor<00:02:22.110> but<00:02:22.980> in<00:02:23.280> that

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
it added like a video editor but in that

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.610 
it added like a video editor but in that
video<00:02:23.940> editor<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.780> was<00:02:24.959> like<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.440> have<00:02:25.590> to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
video editor it was like you have to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.070 
video editor it was like you have to
turned<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.459> since<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.599> game<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.780> so

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
turned on and since the game is so

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.780 
turned on and since the game is so
unrealistic<00:02:28.560> already<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.220> mean<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.580> nail

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
unrealistic already I mean the nail

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.650 
unrealistic already I mean the nail
trick<00:02:30.150> who<00:02:30.330> really<00:02:30.720> did<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.200> anyway<00:02:32.660> the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
trick who really did that anyway the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.570 
trick who really did that anyway the
stall<00:02:33.870> game<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.290> unrealistic<00:02:34.769> was<00:02:35.190> really

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
stall game so unrealistic was really

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.240 
stall game so unrealistic was really
like<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.090> point<00:02:36.330> of<00:02:36.450> making<00:02:36.599> like<00:02:37.500> realistic

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
like the point of making like realistic

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.380 
like the point of making like realistic
skate<00:02:38.790> montage<00:02:39.390> video<00:02:40.190> answer<00:02:41.190> no<00:02:41.970> point<00:02:42.269> at

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
skate montage video answer no point at

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.199 
skate montage video answer no point at
all<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.050> because<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:44.130> an<00:02:44.280> asana<00:02:44.730> see<00:02:45.000> it

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
all so because it is an asana see it

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.979 
all so because it is an asana see it
might<00:02:45.510> seem<00:02:45.780> at<00:02:45.930> first<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:47.870> that's<00:02:48.870> what

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
might seem at first and that's what

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.440 
might seem at first and that's what
really<00:02:49.440> killed<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.400> Tony<00:02:50.640> Hawk<00:02:50.850> games<00:02:50.880> EA

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
really killed the Tony Hawk games EA

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.190 
really killed the Tony Hawk games EA
skate<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:53.060> that's<00:02:54.060> partly<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.750> reason<00:02:54.930> why<00:02:55.170> I

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
skate and that's partly the reason why I

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.920 
skate and that's partly the reason why I
made<00:02:55.440> Tony<00:02:56.069> Hawk<00:02:56.280> ride<00:02:56.790> which<00:02:57.299> is<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.690> worst

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
made Tony Hawk ride which is the worst

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.960 
made Tony Hawk ride which is the worst
on<00:02:58.200> how<00:02:58.350> came<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.709> date<00:02:58.890> version<00:02:59.130> not<00:02:59.519> were<00:02:59.730> so

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
tried to be extremely realistic it

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.199 
tried to be extremely realistic it
really<00:03:09.269> like<00:03:09.540> cut<00:03:10.500> all<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:11.430> basic<00:03:11.819> Tony<00:03:12.030> Hawk

stuff you did like kick flips you know
basically<00:03:14.819> how<00:03:15.030> I'm<00:03:15.239> playing<00:03:15.480> now<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:16.140> know

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
basically how I'm playing now you know

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.990 
basically how I'm playing now you know
could<00:03:16.500> play<00:03:16.620> like<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:16.769> in<00:03:17.040> every<00:03:17.400> Neversoft

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
could play like that in every Neversoft

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.960 
could play like that in every Neversoft
Tony<00:03:18.510> Hawk<00:03:18.720> game<00:03:19.130> but<00:03:20.130> there's<00:03:20.310> cut<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:20.760> and

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
Tony Hawk game but there's cut that and

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.270 
Tony Hawk game but there's cut that and
instead<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.720> let<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.049> play<00:03:22.230> in<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.380> board<00:03:22.709> and

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
instead of let you play in a board and

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.800 
instead of let you play in a board and
the<00:03:23.430> game<00:03:23.579> I'm<00:03:23.640> still<00:03:23.850> super<00:03:24.209> unrealized

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
the game I'm still super unrealized

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.800 
the game I'm still super unrealized
because<00:03:25.079> if<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.290> just<00:03:25.730> like<00:03:26.730> tilt<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.630> board

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
because if you just like tilt the board

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.479 
because if you just like tilt the board
up<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.200> down<00:03:28.350> all<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.590> time<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.280> did

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
up and down all the time and it did

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.280 
up and down all the time and it did
random<00:03:29.880> tricks<00:03:30.150> anyway<00:03:30.569> so<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:30.870> know<00:03:31.079> there

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
random tricks anyway so you know there

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.990 
random tricks anyway so you know there
wasn't<00:03:31.590> really<00:03:31.739> any<00:03:31.980> point<00:03:32.220> any<00:03:32.549> challenge

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
wasn't really any point any challenge

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.759 
wasn't really any point any challenge
anyway<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:34.079> know<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.230> didn't<00:03:34.560> know<00:03:34.620> how<00:03:34.709> to

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
anyway you know you didn't know how to

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.949 
anyway you know you didn't know how to
do<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.130> tricks<00:03:35.370> anyway<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:36.000> when<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.540> played<00:03:36.780> it

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
do the tricks anyway is when I played it

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.740 
do the tricks anyway is when I played it
I<00:03:37.140> am<00:03:37.890> still<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.280> board<00:03:38.459> back<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.090> forth<00:03:39.359> to

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
I am still the board back and forth to

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.410 
I am still the board back and forth to

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
get some kind of style net which worked

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.229 
get some kind of style net which worked
but<00:03:42.660> it's<00:03:43.139> not<00:03:43.769> how<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.069> are<00:03:44.430> supposed<00:03:44.850> to

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
think no sorry at least that's what I

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.140 
think no sorry at least that's what I
think<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.859> don't<00:03:50.069> know<00:03:50.220> what<00:03:50.370> Robo<00:03:50.700> mode<00:03:50.940> of

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
think I don't know what Robo mode of

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.780 
think I don't know what Robo mode of
things<00:03:51.389> but<00:03:51.630> that's<00:03:52.560> what<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.799> think<00:03:52.829> so<00:03:53.310> yeah

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
things but that's what I think so yeah

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.940 
things but that's what I think so yeah
and<00:03:56.239> then<00:03:57.239> AES<00:03:57.959> key<00:03:58.049> to<00:03:58.319> and<00:03:58.560> skate<00:03:58.769> freaked

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
and then AES key to and skate freaked

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.500 
and then AES key to and skate freaked
him<00:03:59.100> out<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.430> that's<00:03:59.790> why<00:03:59.940> I<00:03:59.970> don't<00:04:00.060> like<00:04:00.299> ski

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
him out and that's why I don't like ski

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.789 
him out and that's why I don't like ski
3<00:04:00.720> either<00:04:00.840> it's<00:04:01.350> too<00:04:01.590> unrealistic<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:03.380> I<00:04:04.380> mean

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
3 either it's too unrealistic and I mean

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.830 
3 either it's too unrealistic and I mean
it<00:04:05.160> adds<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:05.670> much<00:04:05.819> of<00:04:05.970> new<00:04:06.060> features<00:04:06.540> that

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
it adds so much of new features that

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.259 
it adds so much of new features that
were<00:04:07.380> yes<00:04:07.590> yeah<00:04:07.980> this<00:04:08.519> is<00:04:08.579> too<00:04:08.850> unrealistic

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
were yes yeah this is too unrealistic

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.759 
were yes yeah this is too unrealistic

skate - I had a lot of fun with that and

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.240 
skate - I had a lot of fun with that and
it<00:04:23.640> felt<00:04:23.940> really<00:04:24.210> like<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:24.780> was<00:04:25.349> kind<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:25.770> riding

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
Capel actually you know and the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.100 
Capel actually you know and the
difficulty<00:04:28.380> setting<00:04:28.410> is<00:04:28.770> skate<00:04:29.130> free<00:04:30.110> that

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
difficulty setting is skate free that

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.040 
difficulty setting is skate free that
didn't<00:04:31.470> really<00:04:31.680> matter<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:33.300> was<00:04:33.480> it<00:04:33.720> just<00:04:33.900> made

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
didn't really matter it was it just made

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.770 
didn't really matter it was it just made
it<00:04:34.170> a<00:04:34.200> bit<00:04:34.350> easier<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.940> jump<00:04:35.940> high<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.180> so<00:04:36.600> on

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
it a bit easier to jump high and so on

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.390 
it a bit easier to jump high and so on
you<00:04:37.110> know<00:04:37.230> so<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.680> didn't<00:04:37.920> really<00:04:37.950> matter<00:04:38.160> that

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
you know so it didn't really matter that

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.820 
you know so it didn't really matter that
much<00:04:38.610> at<00:04:39.030> all<00:04:39.360> in<00:04:39.630> fact<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:41.810> so<00:04:42.810> then<00:04:43.650> the

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
much at all in fact and so then the

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.800 
much at all in fact and so then the
people<00:04:43.980> might<00:04:44.220> ask<00:04:44.430> me<00:04:44.670> this<00:04:45.180> problem<00:04:45.570> first

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
people might ask me this problem first

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.230 
people might ask me this problem first
thing<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.020> wonder<00:04:46.350> what<00:04:46.710> do<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:46.920> prefer

thing you wonder what do I prefer
realism<00:04:48.240> or<00:04:48.330> unrealism<00:04:49.020> in<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.350> skipper<00:04:49.740> here

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
realism or unrealism in the skipper here

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.750 
realism or unrealism in the skipper here
it's<00:04:51.510> a<00:04:51.660> real<00:04:51.840> hard<00:04:52.080> question<00:04:52.590> but<00:04:53.190> my<00:04:53.490> answer

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
it's a real hard question but my answer

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.870 
it's a real hard question but my answer
is<00:04:53.790> course<00:04:54.150> unrealism<00:04:54.930> because<00:04:55.530> I<00:04:55.830> like<00:04:56.280> to

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
is course unrealism because I like to

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.000 
is course unrealism because I like to
play<00:04:57.060> like<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.480> Tony<00:04:57.690> Hawk<00:04:57.870> style<00:04:58.230> but<00:04:58.860> I

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
play like the Tony Hawk style but I

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.820 
play like the Tony Hawk style but I
still<00:04:59.400> like<00:04:59.760> EA<00:05:00.060> skate<00:05:00.510> but<00:05:01.230> I<00:05:01.290> don't<00:05:01.590> like

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
still like EA skate but I don't like

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.710 
still like EA skate but I don't like
when<00:05:02.280> EA<00:05:02.490> skate<00:05:02.940> is<00:05:03.210> trying<00:05:03.480> to<00:05:03.630> be

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
when EA skate is trying to be

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.140 
when EA skate is trying to be
unrealistic<00:05:04.260> like<00:05:04.830> in<00:05:05.070> EA<00:05:05.280> skate<00:05:05.610> 3<00:05:05.910> for

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
unrealistic like in EA skate 3 for

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.360 
unrealistic like in EA skate 3 for
example<00:05:06.600> that<00:05:07.169> was<00:05:07.350> real<00:05:07.590> trying<00:05:07.950> it<00:05:08.220> was

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
example that was real trying it was

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.159 
example that was real trying it was
probably<00:05:08.910> trying<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:09.330> be<00:05:09.480> realistic<00:05:09.780> but<00:05:10.080> it

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
probably trying to be realistic but it

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.380 
probably trying to be realistic but it
just<00:05:10.320> became<00:05:10.740> so<00:05:11.340> unreal<00:05:11.700> is<00:05:11.820> because<00:05:12.120> of<00:05:12.270> all

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
just became so unreal is because of all

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.120 
just became so unreal is because of all
different<00:05:12.780> moves<00:05:12.960> you<00:05:13.110> could<00:05:13.260> do<00:05:13.380> and<00:05:14.010> I'd

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
different moves you could do and I'd

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.950 
different moves you could do and I'd
really<00:05:14.430> don't<00:05:14.760> like<00:05:14.910> that<00:05:14.970> that's<00:05:15.600> nobody

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
really don't like that that's nobody

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.170 
really don't like that that's nobody
games<00:05:16.169> made<00:05:16.440> for<00:05:16.490> so<00:05:17.490> yeah<00:05:17.640> then<00:05:17.940> you<00:05:18.030> might

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
games made for so yeah then you might

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.159 
games made for so yeah then you might
think<00:05:18.360> of<00:05:18.480> other<00:05:18.780> skating<00:05:19.410> games<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:21.080> this<00:05:22.080> is

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
think of other skating games and this is

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.080 
think of other skating games and this is
actually<00:05:22.500> what<00:05:22.830> maybe<00:05:23.040> cannot<00:05:23.520> do<00:05:23.970> this

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
actually what maybe cannot do this

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.730 
actually what maybe cannot do this

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310

in<00:06:08.669> a<00:06:08.820> skateboarding<00:06:09.510> game<00:06:09.780> I<00:06:10.500> prefer<00:06:11.310> on

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
in a skateboarding game I prefer on

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.280 
in a skateboarding game I prefer on
realism<00:06:11.820> because<00:06:12.210> that's<00:06:12.479> kind<00:06:12.810> of<00:06:12.870> what<00:06:13.080> they

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
realism because that's kind of what they

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.340 
realism because that's kind of what they
are<00:06:13.320> and<00:06:13.740> what<00:06:14.220> they<00:06:14.370> will<00:06:14.520> always<00:06:14.940> be<00:06:15.290> but<00:06:16.290> I

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
are and what they will always be but I

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.280 
are and what they will always be but I
still<00:06:16.890> like<00:06:17.340> a<00:06:17.640> skate<00:06:18.090> and<00:06:18.390> I<00:06:18.870> don't<00:06:18.930> think

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
still like a skate and I don't think

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.320 
still like a skate and I don't think
there<00:06:19.410> will<00:06:19.470> be<00:06:19.530> a<00:06:19.680> skate<00:06:19.979> for<00:06:20.250> but<00:06:20.610> since<00:06:21.060> rice

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
there will be a skate for but since rice

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.320 
there will be a skate for but since rice

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
some people placed each piece doesn't

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.519 
some people placed each piece doesn't
even<00:06:38.520> know<00:06:38.640> that<00:06:38.669> it's<00:06:38.940> escape<00:06:39.270> or

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:39.529 
even know that it's escape or

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:41.829 
even know that it's escape or
in<00:06:39.739> Canada<00:06:40.159> play<00:06:40.399> because<00:06:40.789> you<00:06:41.209> notice<00:06:41.359> it's

00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:41.839 
in Canada play because you notice it's

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:43.329 
in Canada play because you notice it's
still<00:06:41.959> an<00:06:42.079> addictive<00:06:42.559> kind<00:06:42.979> of<00:06:43.069> thing<00:06:43.219> it

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:43.339 
still an addictive kind of thing it

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.009 
still an addictive kind of thing it
could<00:06:43.489> be<00:06:43.549> a<00:06:43.669> BMX<00:06:43.999> game<00:06:44.269> and<00:06:44.479> they<00:06:44.569> still<00:06:44.899> would

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:45.019 
could be a BMX game and they still would

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:46.659 
could be a BMX game and they still would
feel<00:06:45.199> they're<00:06:45.409> playing<00:06:45.679> same<00:06:45.979> game<00:06:46.249> really

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
feel they're playing same game really

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.929 
feel they're playing same game really
and<00:06:46.849> then<00:06:48.009> but<00:06:49.009> when<00:06:49.129> is<00:06:49.219> he<00:06:49.339> escape<00:06:49.669> the<00:06:49.699> real

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:49.939 
and then but when is he escape the real

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:50.889 
and then but when is he escape the real
feel<00:06:50.209> like<00:06:50.359> they're<00:06:50.539> playing<00:06:50.719> a

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:50.899 
feel like they're playing a

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:55.599 
feel like they're playing a
skateboarding<00:06:51.469> game<00:06:51.979> and<00:06:52.839> I<00:06:54.039> think<00:06:55.039> that<00:06:55.249> the

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:55.609 
skateboarding game and I think that the

00:06:55.609 --> 00:06:57.759 
skateboarding game and I think that the
whole<00:06:55.759> thing<00:06:55.819> that<00:06:56.449> II<00:06:56.659> escaped<00:06:57.079> came<00:06:57.379> that's

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:57.769 
whole thing that II escaped came that's

00:06:57.769 --> 00:06:59.769 
whole thing that II escaped came that's
what<00:06:58.009> ruins<00:06:58.249> its<00:06:58.519> on<00:06:58.639> Hawk<00:06:58.819> franchise<00:06:59.329> because

00:06:59.769 --> 00:06:59.779 
what ruins its on Hawk franchise because

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:02.499 
what ruins its on Hawk franchise because
then<00:07:00.049> it<00:07:00.679> put<00:07:00.889> a<00:07:00.919> lot<00:07:01.099> of<00:07:01.219> pressure<00:07:01.369> on<00:07:01.789> it<00:07:01.879> like

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:02.509 
then it put a lot of pressure on it like

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:04.839 
then it put a lot of pressure on it like
oh<00:07:02.749> we<00:07:03.499> should<00:07:03.529> maybe<00:07:03.829> make<00:07:04.099> the<00:07:04.399> game<00:07:04.579> a<00:07:04.609> bit

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:04.849 
oh we should maybe make the game a bit

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:07.089 
oh we should maybe make the game a bit
more<00:07:05.059> realistic<00:07:05.809> maybe<00:07:06.139> we<00:07:06.319> should<00:07:06.589> and<00:07:06.919> that

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:07.099 
more realistic maybe we should and that

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:09.609 
more realistic maybe we should and that
was<00:07:07.279> like<00:07:07.489> before<00:07:07.939> they<00:07:08.509> knew<00:07:08.689> how<00:07:08.959> much<00:07:09.139> like

00:07:09.609 --> 00:07:09.619 
was like before they knew how much like

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:12.669 
was like before they knew how much like
fans<00:07:09.979> would<00:07:10.609> be<00:07:10.639> waiting<00:07:10.939> for<00:07:11.179> a<00:07:11.359> remake<00:07:11.779> like

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:12.679 
fans would be waiting for a remake like

00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:14.649

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:14.659 
now and I'm not waiting for a remake I
