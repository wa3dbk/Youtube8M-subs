in the stream again it's kind of hard to
describe<00:03:27.329> weird<00:03:28.329> shapes<00:03:28.629> mostly<00:03:29.139> stuffs<00:03:30.069> that

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
describe weird shapes mostly stuffs that

I<00:03:30.280> haven't<00:03:30.489> seen<00:03:30.790> in<00:03:30.969> the<00:03:31.030> cradle<00:03:31.560> sometimes<00:03:32.560> I

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
I haven't seen in the cradle sometimes I

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.589 
I haven't seen in the cradle sometimes I
see<00:03:32.920> places<00:03:33.219> that<00:03:33.609> aren't<00:03:33.790> inside<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.269> cradle

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
see places that aren't inside the cradle

at<00:03:34.719> all<00:03:35.069> that's<00:03:36.069> the<00:03:36.400> most<00:03:36.579> confusing<00:03:37.060> part

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
at all that's the most confusing part

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.979 
at all that's the most confusing part
now<00:03:38.889> that's<00:03:39.579> a<00:03:39.730> dream<00:03:39.909> of<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.299> heard<00:03:40.599> one<00:03:40.780> I

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.960 
now that's a dream of I heard one I
think<00:03:41.409> that<00:03:41.530> justifies<00:03:41.859> the<00:03:42.129> saying<00:03:42.340> only<00:03:42.639> in

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
think that justifies the saying only in

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.409 
think that justifies the saying only in
your<00:03:43.090> dreams<00:03:43.950> James<00:03:44.950> is<00:03:45.129> right<00:03:45.159> Adam<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:46.269> know
