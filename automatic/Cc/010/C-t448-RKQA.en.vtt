that's the throttle position angle some

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.319 
that's the throttle position angle some
vehicles<00:01:44.270> even<00:01:44.659> have<00:01:44.899> a<00:01:46.060> system<00:01:47.060> where<00:01:47.270> you

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
vehicles even have a system where you

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.260 
vehicles even have a system where you
don't<00:01:47.869> open<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.469> throttle<00:01:48.979> to<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.000> full

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
don't open the throttle to the full

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.929 
don't open the throttle to the full
wide-open<00:01:50.990> position<00:01:51.500> until<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.430> vehicle

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
wide-open position until the vehicle

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.359 
wide-open position until the vehicle
reaches<00:01:53.659> approximately<00:01:53.860> 20<00:01:54.860> miles<00:01:55.070> an<00:01:55.280> hour

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
reaches approximately 20 miles an hour

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.639 
reaches approximately 20 miles an hour
this<00:01:55.700> means<00:01:55.969> that<00:01:56.149> if<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.299> depress<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.469> gas

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
this means that if you depress the gas

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.950 
this means that if you depress the gas
to<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.040> floor<00:01:58.340> if<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:59.090> car<00:01:59.329> is<00:01:59.479> only<00:01:59.689> at<00:01:59.869> about

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
to the floor if the car is only at about

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.590 
to the floor if the car is only at about
10<00:02:00.289> miles<00:02:00.530> an<00:02:00.710> hour<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.280> it<00:02:01.549> does<00:02:01.939> not<00:02:02.119> open<00:02:02.360> the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
10 miles an hour so it does not open the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.289 
10 miles an hour so it does not open the
throttle<00:02:02.810> plate<00:02:03.110> out<00:02:03.320> of<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:03.500> way<00:02:04.119> what<00:02:05.119> the

throttle plate out of the way what the
Sprint<00:02:05.840> booster<00:02:06.289> does<00:02:06.500> is<00:02:06.939> it<00:02:07.939> conditions<00:02:08.869> the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
Sprint booster does is it conditions the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.510 
Sprint booster does is it conditions the
signal<00:02:09.680> that<00:02:10.369> comes<00:02:11.360> from<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.960> pedal<00:02:12.350> and
