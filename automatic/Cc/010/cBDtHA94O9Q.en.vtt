 body of the phone and it is made of a very plastic 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.360
 elastic that does not convey much 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.950
 feeling of hardness or durability 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.840
 finishing is not premium but neither

 situation thinking to be full hd the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.500
 reading on it and daily use is very 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.690
 nice inside we found a 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.429
 Non- removable lithium battery slot 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.720
 for the sim and a slot for a 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.610
 micro sd card 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.740

 how many downloads as curious data 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.380
 comment that the micro usb charging and 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.940
 synchronization is in a 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.560
 lateral of the lower part and not in the 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.539

 original touch to your photos 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.840
 an interesting feature is the 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.890
 smile mode once activated when the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.510
 mobile detects a smile 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.510
 it will automatically shoot a photo 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.810
 an essential panoramic option that 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.200
 allows you very interesting photos like 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.200

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.560
 the video recording stays in full 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.500
 hd at 25 frames per second 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.360
 Enough for the day to day ahead 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.470
 a 5 megapixel camera that will be more 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.360
 that enough for your selfish 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.980
 definitely a mobile with good 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.360
 benefits without more pretensions than 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.690
 those of being a good smartphone for the 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.690
 day to day
