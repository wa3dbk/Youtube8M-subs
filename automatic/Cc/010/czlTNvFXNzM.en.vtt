this<00:00:20.910> month<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.960> thought<00:00:22.199> we'd<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> video

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
this month we thought we'd do a video

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.939 
this month we thought we'd do a video
that<00:00:23.570> gives<00:00:24.570> people<00:00:24.960> advice<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:25.890> to

that gives people advice on what to

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.679 
that gives people advice on what to
check<00:00:26.340> if<00:00:26.519> they're<00:00:26.699> doing<00:00:26.820> long<00:00:27.150> journeys<00:00:27.570> and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
check if they're doing long journeys and

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.339 
check if they're doing long journeys and
road<00:00:27.930> road<00:00:28.590> trips<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.189> their<00:00:29.550> Figaro's<00:00:30.349> we'll

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
road road trips in their Figaro's we'll

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.870 
road road trips in their Figaro's we'll
start<00:00:31.619> off<00:00:31.769> with<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.009> tires<00:00:32.369> which<00:00:32.700> are

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
start off with the tires which are

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.780 
start off with the tires which are
always<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.149> weak<00:00:33.450> point<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:35.370> figure<00:00:35.550> rose

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
always a weak point on the figure rose

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.690 
always a weak point on the figure rose
now<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:37.020> important<00:00:37.590> things<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.100> check<00:00:38.430> our

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
now the important things to check our

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.299 
now the important things to check our
the<00:00:39.000> pressure<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.290> tread<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.160> we'll

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the pressure and the tread so we'll

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.440 
the pressure and the tread so we'll
start<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:42.770> doing<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> pressure<00:00:44.160> check<00:00:44.550> so

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
start here doing the pressure check so

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.260 
start here doing the pressure check so
you<00:00:45.539> can<00:00:45.780> see<00:00:46.250> you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.430> check<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
you can see you can check it with the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.990 
you can see you can check it with the
hubcap<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.930> Polo<00:00:49.260> cap<00:00:49.530> still<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.640> set<00:00:50.910> them

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
hubcap the Polo cap still on we set them

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.750 
hubcap the Polo cap still on we set them
at<00:00:51.149> 31<00:00:51.780> psi<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.590> round<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.399> see<00:00:53.610> this

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
at 31 psi all round you can see this

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.069 
at 31 psi all round you can see this
tires<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.239> bit<00:00:54.480> flat<00:00:56.660> then<00:00:57.660> more<00:00:58.020> importantly

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
tires a bit flat then more importantly

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.000 
tires a bit flat then more importantly
you<00:00:58.980> need<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.250> check<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.730> tire<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.239> cracking

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
you need to check the tire for cracking

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.100 
you need to check the tire for cracking
hardly<00:01:02.010> ever<00:01:02.280> come<00:01:02.699> across<00:01:02.820> Figaro's<00:01:03.750> where

tire out check it in the same way that
you<00:01:45.420> would<00:01:45.540> check<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.930> tire<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> car<00:01:48.140> you

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
you would check the tire on the car you

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.920 
you would check the tire on the car you
can<00:01:49.320> see<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:49.920> that's<00:01:50.670> given<00:01:51.090> air<00:01:51.240> check<00:01:51.570> the

see on Figaro's when we have to do major
engine<00:03:41.600> work<00:03:41.870> is<00:03:42.170> because<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:42.920> cars<00:03:43.160> had<00:03:43.430> oil

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
engine work is because the cars had oil

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
recommend changing the oil before you do

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.300 
recommend changing the oil before you do
