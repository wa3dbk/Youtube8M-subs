00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
all honesty this deck is probably not

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.630 
all honesty this deck is probably not
that<00:00:49.260> much<00:00:49.440> better<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.010> probably<00:00:50.340> cost<00:00:50.520> about

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
that much better and probably cost about

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.610 
that much better and probably cost about
a<00:00:50.730> hundred<00:00:50.820> dollars<00:00:51.390> more<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.440> keep<00:00:52.559> that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
a hundred dollars more so just keep that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.650 
a hundred dollars more so just keep that
in<00:00:52.770> mind<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.910> budget<00:00:54.270> brew<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.449> I

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
in mind I think that budget brew that I

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.529 
in mind I think that budget brew that I
built<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:55.050> there<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:56.070> great<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
built up there is is is great for the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.599 
built up there is is is great for the
the<00:00:57.899> metagame<00:00:58.199> right<00:00:58.500> now<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.430> just

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the metagame right now and this is just

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.400 
the metagame right now and this is just
again<00:00:59.910> just<00:01:00.149> barely<00:01:00.420> better<00:01:00.840> because<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.289> add

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
again just barely better because you add

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.720 
again just barely better because you add
cards<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:01.800> mutavault<00:01:02.129> they<00:01:02.430> give<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.670> a

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
cards like mutavault they give it a

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.729 
cards like mutavault they give it a
little<00:01:02.850> bit<00:01:03.030> more<00:01:03.149> reach<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.650> cards<00:01:04.650> like

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
little bit more reach and cards like

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.859 
little bit more reach and cards like
boros<00:01:05.040> reckoner<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.060> think<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.540> very

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
boros reckoner that I think are very

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.350 
boros reckoner that I think are very
very<00:01:07.049> good<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> format<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.280> again<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
very good in the format so again the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.820 
very good in the format so again the
this<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.780> pretty<00:01:09.960> much<00:01:10.080> similar<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> one

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
this is pretty much similar to the one

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.320 
this is pretty much similar to the one
drops<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.610> lands<00:01:11.790> are<00:01:11.970> pretty<00:01:12.150> similar

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
drops here the lands are pretty similar

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.149 
drops here the lands are pretty similar
except<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:12.780> mute<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.990> all<00:01:13.110> I've<00:01:13.890> got<00:01:14.130> for

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
double mutable hand with a mountain can

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.380 
double mutable hand with a mountain can
be<00:01:25.110> very<00:01:25.439> very<00:01:25.770> bad<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.700> want<00:01:27.150> more

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
be very very bad and so I want more

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.450 
be very very bad and so I want more
mountains<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.409> that's<00:01:28.590> why<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.740> went<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.009> 22

good card I don't know if I say we
suggest<00:03:03.909> running<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.359> at<00:03:04.599> the<00:03:05.169> like<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.650> said

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
suggest running this at the like I said

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.050 
suggest running this at the like I said
it's<00:03:05.980> going<00:03:06.069> to<00:03:06.129> be<00:03:06.250> about<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.489> hundred<00:03:06.669> dollars

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
it's going to be about a hundred dollars

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.459 
it's going to be about a hundred dollars
more<00:03:07.269> than<00:03:07.329> the<00:03:07.510> budget<00:03:07.930> version<00:03:08.109> that<00:03:08.439> i

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:08.469 
more than the budget version that i

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:10.050 
more than the budget version that i
brewed<00:03:08.739> up<00:03:08.889> probably<00:03:09.549> even<00:03:09.609> more<00:03:09.730> than<00:03:09.879> that

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
brewed up probably even more than that

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.220 
brewed up probably even more than that
now<00:03:10.359> I<00:03:10.389> think<00:03:10.629> about<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.840> because<00:03:10.989> mutavault

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
now I think about it because mutavault

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.770 
now I think about it because mutavault
are<00:03:11.500> like<00:03:11.620> 20<00:03:11.949> 25<00:03:12.579> bucks<00:03:12.849> apiece<00:03:12.969> in<00:03:13.419> between

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
are like 20 25 bucks apiece in between

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.330 
are like 20 25 bucks apiece in between
the<00:03:14.019> range<00:03:14.199> they<00:03:14.379> bounced<00:03:14.650> between<00:03:14.799> 20<00:03:15.159> and<00:03:15.189> 25

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
the range they bounced between 20 and 25

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.300 
the range they bounced between 20 and 25
and<00:03:16.000> broad<00:03:16.870> sectors<00:03:17.109> bounce<00:03:17.439> between<00:03:17.620> like<00:03:17.859> 16

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
and broad sectors bounce between like 16

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.369 
and broad sectors bounce between like 16
to<00:03:18.430> 20<00:03:18.849> and<00:03:19.060> chatters<00:03:19.720> Prime<00:03:19.900> Minister<00:03:20.229> has
