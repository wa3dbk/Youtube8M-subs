00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.330 

I<00:01:32.840> think<00:01:33.380> I've<00:01:33.470> improved<00:01:33.650> a<00:01:33.920> lot<00:01:34.070> of<00:01:34.190> things

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
I think I've improved a lot of things

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.430 
I think I've improved a lot of things
just<00:01:34.640> get<00:01:35.630> enough<00:01:35.930> offense<00:01:36.320> better

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
just get enough offense better

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.310 
just get enough offense better
throughout<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.070> spring<00:01:37.250> of<00:01:37.490> ball<00:01:37.700> camp<00:01:37.970> and

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
throughout the spring of ball camp and

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.020 
throughout the spring of ball camp and
being<00:01:39.320> able<00:01:39.440> to<00:01:39.620> make<00:01:39.770> much<00:01:39.980> quicker<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:40.730> know

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
being able to make much quicker and know

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.180 
being able to make much quicker and know
where<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.240> boat<00:01:41.420> needs<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:41.750> go<00:01:41.900> with<00:01:42.710> blatant

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
where the boat needs to go with blatant

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.080 
where the boat needs to go with blatant
starts<00:01:43.520> I<00:01:43.760> think<00:01:44.450> most<00:01:44.630> things<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:45.020> killed<00:01:45.290> me

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
starts I think most things you killed me

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.580 
starts I think most things you killed me
throughout<00:01:47.090> drop<00:01:47.690> ball<00:01:47.900> can<00:01:48.110> get<00:01:48.800> their

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
throughout drop ball can get their

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.180 
throughout drop ball can get their
covers<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:53.380> thought<00:01:54.380> I<00:01:54.440> would<00:01:54.710> have<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.040> know<00:01:55.070> I

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
covers I thought I would have you know I

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.530 
covers I thought I would have you know I
followed<00:01:55.610> as<00:01:55.700> soon<00:01:55.880> as<00:01:55.940> I<00:01:56.000> got<00:01:56.150> back<00:01:56.210> out<00:01:56.480> there

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
followed as soon as I got back out there

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.790 
followed as soon as I got back out there
in<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:56.780> spring<00:01:56.870> I<00:01:57.200> thought<00:01:57.410> it<00:01:57.530> was<00:01:57.620> going<00:01:57.740> to

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
in the spring I thought it was going to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.080 
in the spring I thought it was going to
really<00:01:58.010> kind<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.370> hinder<00:01:58.640> me<00:01:58.790> and<00:01:58.910> I'd<00:01:58.970> be

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
really kind of hinder me and I'd be

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.030 
really kind of hinder me and I'd be
thinking<00:01:59.420> about<00:01:59.510> it<00:01:59.750> but<00:01:59.960> really<00:02:00.770> when<00:02:00.920> you've

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
thinking about it but really when you've

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.620 
thinking about it but really when you've
been<00:02:01.160> playing<00:02:01.370> football<00:02:01.550> since<00:02:01.790> fourth<00:02:02.540> grade

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
been playing football since fourth grade

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.050 
been playing football since fourth grade
once<00:02:03.200> you<00:02:03.320> get<00:02:03.470> on<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:03.710> field<00:02:03.860> just<00:02:04.400> football

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
once you get on the field just football

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.609 
once you get on the field just football
and<00:02:05.300> you<00:02:05.479> move<00:02:05.690> back<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:06.080> doing<00:02:06.290> what<00:02:06.440> you<00:02:06.470> know

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
and you move back to doing what you know

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.550 
and you move back to doing what you know
how<00:02:06.710> to<00:02:06.740> do<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.220> it's<00:02:07.520> been<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.729> good<00:02:08.060> restaurant
