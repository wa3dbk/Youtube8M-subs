and if you see that the bumper it's
shaped<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.730> little<00:00:59.850> different<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.510> i<00:01:00.870> don't

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
shaped a little different it's i don't

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.439 
shaped a little different it's i don't
know<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.370> shaped<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.969> little<00:01:03.030> different

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
know it's just shaped a little different

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.179 
know it's just shaped a little different
there's<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> little<00:01:03.809> bit<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.199> rise<00:01:04.739> there

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
there's a little bit of a rise there

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.750 
there's a little bit of a rise there
makes<00:01:05.729> things<00:01:06.000> kind<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.689> weird<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.760> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
makes things kind of weird but the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.130 
makes things kind of weird but the
problem<00:01:09.119> people<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.450> having<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.900> they're

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
problem people are having is they're

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.330 
problem people are having is they're
saying<00:01:10.350> they're<00:01:10.470> having<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.799> extend<00:01:11.220> their

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
saying they're having to extend their

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.469 
saying they're having to extend their
finger<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.909> push<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.330> button<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:15.360> i

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
finger and push the button and i

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.820 
finger and push the button and i
understand<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.170> because<00:01:16.380> that's<00:01:16.650> pretty

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
understand that because that's pretty

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.740 
understand that because that's pretty
much<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.130> way<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> old<00:01:17.610> controller<00:01:18.060> worked

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
much the way the old controller worked

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.109 
much the way the old controller worked
even<00:01:19.049> though<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.920> wasn't<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:20.430> high<00:01:20.670> so

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
even though it was it wasn't as high so

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.190 
even though it was it wasn't as high so
it<00:01:21.570> worked<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.900> little<00:01:22.020> bit<00:01:22.200> better<00:01:22.939> but<00:01:24.200> you

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
it worked a little bit better but you

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.780 
it worked a little bit better but you
know<00:01:25.290> what<00:01:25.470> that's<00:01:25.619> because<00:01:26.159> that's<00:01:26.580> not

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
know what that's because that's not

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.940 
know what that's because that's not
really<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.360> right<00:01:27.780> way<00:01:28.229> you're<00:01:28.439> supposed<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
really the right way you're supposed to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.370 
really the right way you're supposed to
use<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.460> you're<00:01:29.700> supposed<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:31.020> able<00:01:31.140> to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
use this you're supposed to be able to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.050 
use this you're supposed to be able to
roll<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:34.310> don't<00:01:35.310> know<00:01:35.400> if<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.670> hear<00:01:35.820> that

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
roll I don't know if you can hear that

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.649 
roll I don't know if you can hear that
but<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:38.310> notice<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.700> actually<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
but if you notice that actually the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.170 
but if you notice that actually the
button<00:01:40.020> goes<00:01:40.259> off<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.829> lot<00:01:40.860> easier<00:01:41.520> from<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
button goes off a lot easier from the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.539 
button goes off a lot easier from the
bottom<00:01:42.780> then<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.320> does<00:01:43.530> pushing<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.130> directly

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
bottom then it does pushing it directly

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.960 
bottom then it does pushing it directly
in<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.409> by<00:01:46.680> design<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.640> actually

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
in and this is by design it's actually

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.289 
in and this is by design it's actually
quicker<00:01:48.689> if<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.770> roll<00:01:50.040> from<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.000> trigger

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
quicker if you roll from the trigger

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.300 
quicker if you roll from the trigger
into<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> bumper<00:01:52.079> say<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.159> is

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
into the bumper say like so this is

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.609 
into the bumper say like so this is
actually<00:01:53.460> quicker<00:01:53.939> than<00:01:54.600> having<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.290> go<00:01:55.470> from

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
actually quicker than having to go from

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.300 
actually quicker than having to go from
the<00:01:55.740> button<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.159> move<00:01:56.250> over<00:01:56.610> here<00:01:57.200> now<00:01:58.310> people

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
the button and move over here now people

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.880 
the button and move over here now people
fear<00:01:59.579> change<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:01.110> probably<00:02:01.439> annoyed<00:02:01.860> a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
fear change and this probably annoyed a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.469 
fear change and this probably annoyed a
lot<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.280> people<00:02:02.430> especially<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:03.090> guess<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
lot of people especially I guess the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.090 
lot of people especially I guess the
pros<00:02:03.750> out<00:02:03.960> there<00:02:03.990> because<00:02:04.380> they're<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:04.829> used

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
pros out there because they're so used

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.280 
pros out there because they're so used
to<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:06.060> know<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.360> being<00:02:06.750> able<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.049> do<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
to you know just being able to do the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.809 
to you know just being able to do the
thing<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.680> I'm<00:02:07.740> sure<00:02:07.950> someone<00:02:08.310> like<00:02:08.459> skills

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
thing and I'm sure someone like skills

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.580 
thing and I'm sure someone like skills
going<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.149> come<00:02:09.300> out<00:02:09.330> with<00:02:09.569> some<00:02:09.690> special<00:02:10.259> new

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
going to come out with some special new

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.200 
going to come out with some special new
bumper<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.099> make<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.370> easier

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
bumper to make it easier

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.080 
bumper to make it easier
but<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.560> know<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.100> actually<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.520> learning

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
but you know this is actually a learning

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.780 
but you know this is actually a learning
curve<00:02:15.590> once<00:02:16.590> you've<00:02:16.770> figured<00:02:17.010> out<00:02:17.220> how<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.520> do

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
curve once you've figured out how to do

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.860 
curve once you've figured out how to do
this<00:02:17.970> role<00:02:18.300> say<00:02:19.020> my<00:02:19.200> finger<00:02:19.500> here<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:20.780> mean<00:02:21.780> that

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
this role say my finger here I mean that

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.420 
this role say my finger here I mean that
buttons<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.440> off<00:02:22.560> every<00:02:22.800> single<00:02:23.070> time<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.220> do

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
buttons going off every single time I do

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.810 
buttons going off every single time I do
that<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.120> incredibly<00:02:24.990> easy<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:26.190> make<00:02:26.580> this

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
that it is incredibly easy to make this

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.080 
that it is incredibly easy to make this
function<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.750> works<00:02:28.080> really<00:02:28.560> well<00:02:29.090> but

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
function it works really well but

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.640 
function it works really well but
there's<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.330> learning<00:02:30.540> curve<00:02:30.780> there<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.410> again

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
there's a learning curve there and again

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.440 
there's a learning curve there and again
like<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.890> said<00:02:32.010> people<00:02:32.490> do<00:02:32.640> for<00:02:32.790> your<00:02:32.910> change<00:02:33.210> so

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
like I said people do for your change so

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.090 
like I said people do for your change so
that's<00:02:33.660> really<00:02:34.020> what's<00:02:34.230> what's<00:02:34.590> causing<00:02:35.010> a

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
that's really what's what's causing a

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.130 
that's really what's what's causing a
lot<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.250> issues<00:02:35.490> right<00:02:35.880> now<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.270> just<00:02:36.300> people

lot of issues right now is just people

haven't figured out that all you need is

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.670 
haven't figured out that all you need is
roll<00:02:39.120> Ralph<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.690> trigger<00:02:39.960> into<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.350> button

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
roll Ralph that trigger into that button

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.830 
roll Ralph that trigger into that button

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
before I found control freaks I was

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.570 
before I found control freaks I was
wearing<00:03:31.080> out<00:03:31.290> my<00:03:31.320> controllers<00:03:31.980> little<00:03:32.280> nubs

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
wearing out my controllers little nubs

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.520 
wearing out my controllers little nubs
on<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.880> pads<00:03:33.120> was<00:03:33.930> getting<00:03:34.170> worn<00:03:34.410> out

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
on the pads was getting worn out

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.200 
on the pads was getting worn out
especially<00:03:34.830> from<00:03:35.370> like<00:03:35.520> Call<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.790> Duty

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
especially from like Call of Duty

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.060 
especially from like Call of Duty
because<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.140> you're<00:03:37.620> always<00:03:37.770> having<00:03:38.010> to

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
because the the you're always having to

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.620 
because the the you're always having to
sprint<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.610> push<00:03:38.790> down<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.240> push<00:03:39.390> down<00:03:39.600> the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
sprint and push down and push down the

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.300 
sprint and push down and push down the
little<00:03:39.900> nubs<00:03:40.170> got<00:03:40.380> worn<00:03:40.620> out<00:03:40.710> and<00:03:40.950> I'd<00:03:41.130> have

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
little nubs got worn out and I'd have

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.550 
little nubs got worn out and I'd have
the<00:03:41.460> smooth<00:03:41.850> Cup<00:03:42.180> in<00:03:42.360> there<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.780> my<00:03:43.320> thumb's

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
the smooth Cup in there and my thumb's

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.140 
the smooth Cup in there and my thumb's
would<00:03:43.770> be<00:03:43.860> spinning<00:03:44.130> around<00:03:44.400> in<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:44.850> smooth

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
would be spinning around in that smooth

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.910 
would be spinning around in that smooth
cup<00:03:45.450> so<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:45.660> had<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:45.900> get<00:03:46.140> something<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.620> put<00:03:46.650> in

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
cup so I had to get something to put in

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.370 
cup so I had to get something to put in
there<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.100> give<00:03:47.310> me<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.490> better<00:03:47.820> grip<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.420> I

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
there to give me a better grip and I

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.560 
there to give me a better grip and I

didn't have discovered control freaks
just<00:03:51.900> yet<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:53.100> found<00:03:53.760> these<00:03:54.570> cheap<00:03:55.200> little

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.430 
just yet so I found these cheap little
things<00:03:55.710> here<00:03:55.920> they're<00:03:56.130> called<00:03:56.310> Griffiths<00:03:56.730> and

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
card is probably more useful than the

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.640 
card is probably more useful than the
actual<00:04:04.500> grip<00:04:05.010> it's<00:04:05.250> in<00:04:05.550> regards<00:04:06.300> to<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:06.900> 360

I think they didn't work with a dam on
the<00:04:51.530> 360<00:04:52.160> because<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.820> knobs<00:04:53.030> were<00:04:53.360> actually

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840
