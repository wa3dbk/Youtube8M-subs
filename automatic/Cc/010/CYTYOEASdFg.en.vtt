go okay this is a drywall taping bucket
that<00:00:04.529> I<00:00:04.589> made<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:05.250> lot<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.730> people<00:00:05.970> are<00:00:06.810> gonna

that I made a lot of people are gonna
try<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.379> use<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.560> fiber<00:00:08.010> tape<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.490> they

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
try and use that fiber tape that they

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.070 
try and use that fiber tape that they
can<00:00:08.730> find<00:00:08.970> they<00:00:09.269> don't<00:00:09.389> make<00:00:09.570> fiber<00:00:09.840> tape

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
can find they don't make fiber tape

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.870 
can find they don't make fiber tape
because<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.290> doesn't<00:00:10.650> work<00:00:10.800> it<00:00:11.250> does<00:00:11.460> work<00:00:11.490> but

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
because it doesn't work it does work but

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.249 
because it doesn't work it does work but
some<00:00:12.090> people<00:00:12.330> find<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.660> they<00:00:12.780> fight<00:00:13.049> the

fiber tape a little bit the fiber tape
is<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.030> stuff<00:00:15.299> with<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:15.960> cross-hatched<00:00:16.680> mash

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
is the stuff with the cross-hatched mash

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.179 
is the stuff with the cross-hatched mash
in<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.730> comes<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.150> roll<00:00:18.800> it<00:00:19.800> comes<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.130> a

underneath<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.520> fiber<00:00:32.730> tape<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.660> easy<00:00:33.899> to

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
underneath the fiber tape it's easy to

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.139 
underneath the fiber tape it's easy to
use<00:00:34.260> one<00:00:34.559> person<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.100> do<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.489> hundred-foot

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
goes and the drywall machines are a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.399 
goes and the drywall machines are a
little<00:01:02.969> bit<00:01:03.120> more<00:01:03.149> money<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.960> what<00:01:04.080> we've<00:01:04.229> made

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
little bit more money so what we've made

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.429 
little bit more money so what we've made
here<00:01:04.739> basically<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> drywall<00:01:05.760> machine<00:01:06.439> this

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
here basically is a drywall machine this

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.130 
here basically is a drywall machine this
is<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.890> bucket<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.869> let's<00:01:09.869> pull<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
is just a bucket that let's pull the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.200 
is just a bucket that let's pull the
drywall<00:01:10.530> compound<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.280> grabbed<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
drywall compound that we grabbed on a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.120 
drywall compound that we grabbed on a
different<00:01:12.540> project<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.560> what<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.799> did<00:01:13.950> was<00:01:14.100> we

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
different project and what we did was we

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.820 
different project and what we did was we
took<00:01:14.340> our<00:01:14.490> circular<00:01:14.909> saw<00:01:15.180> blade<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.680> made

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
took our circular saw blade and we made

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.820 
took our circular saw blade and we made
a<00:01:16.860> cut<00:01:17.189> right<00:01:17.820> here<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:19.140> made<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> cut<00:01:19.590> right

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
a cut right here and we made a cut right

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.200 
a cut right here and we made a cut right
here<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.130> you'll<00:01:20.250> notice<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.820> size<00:01:21.030> of

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
here and you'll notice that the size of

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.990 
here and you'll notice that the size of
that<00:01:21.360> cut<00:01:21.600> equals<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> paper<00:01:22.850> that<00:01:23.850> we're

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
that cut equals the paper that we're

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.120 
that cut equals the paper that we're
gonna<00:01:24.090> use<00:01:24.390> right<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:24.840> now<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.530> paper<00:01:25.830> when

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
gonna use right here now the paper when

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.870 
gonna use right here now the paper when
you<00:01:26.220> pick<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.400> up<00:01:26.580> at<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> lumberyard<00:01:27.150> has<00:01:27.900> a

inside and an outside this goes against

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.770 
inside and an outside this goes against
the<00:01:34.259> drywall<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> mud<00:01:36.090> tape<00:01:36.329> job<00:01:36.600> you

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the drywall so to do a mud tape job you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.719 
the drywall so to do a mud tape job you
want<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.350> mud<00:01:37.590> either<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.490> your

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
want to have your mud either in your

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.429 
want to have your mud either in your
joint<00:01:39.090> which<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.810> difficult<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.320> do

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
joint which is difficult to do

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.039 
joint which is difficult to do
especially<00:01:40.560> when<00:01:40.979> you're<00:01:41.100> working<00:01:41.220> overhead

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
especially when you're working overhead

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.289 
especially when you're working overhead
but<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.200> want<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.649> end<00:01:43.799> up<00:01:44.159> right<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:45.000> here

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
but you want it to end up right on here

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.030 
but you want it to end up right on here
so<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.960> either<00:01:46.110> put<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.350> mud<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.860> your

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
so you can either put the mud in your

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.590 
so you can either put the mud in your
joint<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.579> then<00:01:47.670> go<00:01:47.820> cut<00:01:48.030> some<00:01:48.060> tape<00:01:48.420> and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
joint and then go cut some tape and

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.359 
joint and then go cut some tape and
press<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.020> or<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.470> use<00:01:49.619> something

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
press it in or you can use something

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.700 
press it in or you can use something
similar<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.869> what<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.560> take

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
similar to this so what we do is we take

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.590 
similar to this so what we do is we take
that<00:01:52.920> tape<00:01:53.240> with<00:01:54.240> its<00:01:54.450> end<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.600> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that tape with its end up like that and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.480 
that tape with its end up like that and
we<00:01:57.780> make<00:01:57.960> what<00:01:58.259> amounts<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.920> toilet<00:01:59.219> paper

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
we make what amounts to a toilet paper

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.090 
we make what amounts to a toilet paper
holder<00:01:59.670> in<00:02:00.090> our<00:02:00.210> construction<00:02:00.750> site<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.920> we

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
holder in our construction site and we

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.469 
holder in our construction site and we
run<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.430> tape<00:02:02.670> through<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> bottom<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
run that tape through the bottom of the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.580 
run that tape through the bottom of the
bucket<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.930> like<00:02:04.049> this

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.470 

and<00:02:07.420> then<00:02:08.420> we<00:02:08.509> run<00:02:08.660> it<00:02:08.720> out<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.709> other<00:02:09.860> side

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 
and then we run it out the other side

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.300 
and then we run it out the other side
now<00:02:11.480> for<00:02:11.780> taping<00:02:11.989> you're<00:02:12.920> gonna<00:02:13.040> know<00:02:13.280> that

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
now for taping you're gonna know that

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.830 
now for taping you're gonna know that
you're<00:02:13.670> gonna<00:02:13.790> want<00:02:14.090> your<00:02:14.150> drywall<00:02:14.480> compound

you're gonna want your drywall compound

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.559 
you're gonna want your drywall compound
to<00:02:15.709> have<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.920> little<00:02:16.310> extra<00:02:16.700> liquid<00:02:17.150> in<00:02:17.239> it<00:02:17.330> you

to have a little extra liquid in it you

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.420 
to have a little extra liquid in it you
don't<00:02:17.959> want<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.530> be<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.860> peanut<00:02:19.250> butter

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
don't want it to be that peanut butter

don't want it to be that peanut butter
thickness<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.120> want<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.510> be<00:02:20.630> more<00:02:20.810> of<00:02:20.989> a

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
thickness you want it to be more of a

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.229 
thickness you want it to be more of a

kind of a pudding thickness where it

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.479 
kind of a pudding thickness where it
will<00:02:23.420> run<00:02:23.780> slightly<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.560> just<00:02:25.010> makes<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.280> easier

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
will run slightly I just makes it easier

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.309 
will run slightly I just makes it easier
to<00:02:25.610> get<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.819> holes<00:02:26.060> out<00:02:26.300> look<00:02:26.900> at<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.110> arrow

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
to get the holes out look at the arrow

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.559 
to get the holes out look at the arrow
at<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.069> end<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.430> all<00:02:28.519> so<00:02:29.180> what<00:02:29.330> we've<00:02:29.450> done

mouthfuls of water and we've stirred it

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.920 
mouthfuls of water and we've stirred it
up<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.269> brand<00:02:35.540> new<00:02:35.630> drywall

up and this is brand new drywall
compound<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:36.620> don't<00:02:36.769> want<00:02:36.920> anything<00:02:37.130> that's

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
compound you don't want anything that's

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.160 
compound you don't want anything that's
got<00:02:37.519> you<00:02:38.120> know<00:02:38.239> Punk's<00:02:38.600> in<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:38.870> stuff<00:02:39.080> like

got you know Punk's in it stuff like
that<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:40.100> what<00:02:40.220> we<00:02:40.340> do<00:02:40.489> is<00:02:40.640> we<00:02:40.760> just<00:02:40.790> shovel

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
that and what we do is we just shovel

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.039 
that and what we do is we just shovel
out<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:41.870> here<00:02:42.200> on<00:02:42.980> top<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.580> tape<00:02:43.900> all<00:02:44.900> right

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
out of here on top of the tape all right

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.160 
out of here on top of the tape all right
like<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:46.360> again<00:02:47.360> this<00:02:47.510> bucket<00:02:47.900> isn't

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
like that and again this bucket isn't

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.600 
like that and again this bucket isn't
rocket<00:02:48.319> science<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.860> just<00:02:48.950> take<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.250> circular

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
rocket science you just take a circular

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.910 
rocket science you just take a circular
saw<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.239> you<00:02:51.049> cut<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.349> side<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.769> bucket

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
saw and you cut the side of the bucket

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.890 
saw and you cut the side of the bucket
it<00:02:52.190> gives<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.519> nice<00:02:52.750> somewheres<00:02:53.750> around

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
it gives you a nice somewheres around

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.539 
it gives you a nice somewheres around
1/8<00:02:54.440> than<00:02:54.650> an<00:02:54.739> inch<00:02:54.860> thick<00:02:55.840> cut<00:02:56.840> in<00:02:57.260> there<00:02:57.680> and

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
1/8 than an inch thick cut in there and

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.100 
1/8 than an inch thick cut in there and
then<00:02:58.640> we're<00:02:58.760> gonna<00:02:58.849> load<00:02:59.120> this<00:02:59.450> up<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.959> you

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
then we're gonna load this up and you

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.420 
then we're gonna load this up and you
can<00:03:03.260> see<00:03:03.470> now<00:03:03.620> that<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.890> muds<00:03:04.069> in<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.310> would

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
can see now that the muds in it would

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.610 
can see now that the muds in it would
have<00:03:04.519> been<00:03:04.610> considerably<00:03:05.120> difficult<00:03:05.599> for<00:03:06.530> me

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
have been considerably difficult for me

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.320 
have been considerably difficult for me
to<00:03:06.739> mix<00:03:06.920> my<00:03:07.160> mud<00:03:07.370> in<00:03:07.519> this<00:03:07.640> bucket<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.090> then<00:03:08.239> we

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
to mix my mud in this bucket and then we

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.430 
to mix my mud in this bucket and then we
run<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.480> tape<00:03:08.750> through<00:03:08.959> right<00:03:09.140> up<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.319> up<00:03:09.410> to

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
run the tape through right up and up to

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.180 
run the tape through right up and up to
my<00:03:09.560> arms<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.730> drywall<00:03:11.480> compound<00:03:11.829> and<00:03:12.829> this<00:03:13.010> is

any air make sure that tape is nicely
set<00:06:56.160> in<00:06:56.340> there<00:06:56.990> so<00:06:57.990> we<00:06:58.110> get<00:06:58.230> any<00:06:58.440> air<00:06:58.530> bubbles

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010 
set in there so we get any air bubbles

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.690 
set in there so we get any air bubbles
out<00:06:59.220> from<00:06:59.640> inside<00:07:00.860> and<00:07:01.860> remember<00:07:02.310> this<00:07:02.430> is<00:07:02.580> the
