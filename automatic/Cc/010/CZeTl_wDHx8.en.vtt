00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 of which only a short intro is available today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.319
 three strangers I want to show you the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.719
 are really easy, I can hardly 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.940
 but the ones I lost are the ones that are lost 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.830
 really easy to do and the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.750
 Are you all getting lost? 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.300
 They act with open and once have 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.080
 I put my hair in a pot and mine 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.060
 starting situation here with small crane 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.710
 is now out a few light waves 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.150
 Of course you can smooth it too 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.779
 make hair or with really much 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.210
 Curls 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.769
 Of course I want and yes I wish you 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.260
 Now a lot of fun with the diogenes 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.000
 are the first person needs their 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.410
 nothing more than a small one 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.120
 hair clip of my now easy 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.890
 classic black and then one more 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.719
 couple of hairclips i have now for 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.950
 This hairstyle has a middle parting and 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.420
 bad me first on the one 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.340
 side of the crest a normal 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.960
 small strand down to the bottom 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.190
 and therefore I'm short for you 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.760
 to fix them with a 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.760
 curling grips 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.420
 on the other side I grab myself 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.039
 then just a simple random one 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.899
 medium-sized strands from my approach 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.940
 but now I'm braiding 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.620
 just French that's me 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.300
 always a small strand of hair from me 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.549
 left and right to my three 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.470
 Hauptstrecken to that but you 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.090
 only on head approach otherwise 60 the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.979
 then just pull it down 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.940
 very normal and pixi then also with 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.940
 short hair brace 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.430
 and because you just borg up differently 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.600
 the other side still a thin one 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.890
 braid strands 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.330
 That's why I have it easy 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.710
 you can still do that 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.180
 vary in thickness from the 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.670
 hair strands that always quite cool 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.600
 if these are different in size and 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.010
 then we can do the hairclips 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.750
 actually already removed and the 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.640
 simply find hair with the hair clip 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.490
 actually bring together a great 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.320
 I'm just fit for everyday life 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.790
 find through the braided stand there 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.720
 it still played a little bit us 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.720
 important suisse out 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.799
 you just need the second person 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.360
 only two hair clips and one 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.479
 side vertex is suitable for 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.479
 best 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.899
 then I share the front of the hairline 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.970
 on the forehead just a medium sized hp 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.590
 from the rest of the hair I connect 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.750
 then first back so that they do not 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.180
 continue to disturb and very light this 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.940
 Struggle forwards to the side 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.319
 away and in French so me 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.610
 I have almost my three main 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.590
 streak and then I always take off 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.080
 left and right always small strands 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.580
 to this motherboard front with it 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.569
 this game just completely 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.569
 has flowed 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.640
 and then I put the closed one 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.959
 Just tease the sides of my hair 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.550
 and stick it there with it two 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.319
 hairpins stuck and if I mean 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.000
 then open hair from behind again 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.200
 then they just fall right over 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.680
 These hair clips that we have them 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.680
 conceal 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.130
 and on the other side of the crest 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.660
 I just give myself a little bit 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.520
 Volume spray into it so it does not 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.600
 down flat is yes and then it is 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.110
 second hairstyle actually already 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.110
 finished 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.140
 in the third person you need two 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.610
 hair ties and again one to 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.700
 two hair clips and here you please 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.650
 recommend on the one side apex 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.750
 and I agree here for now 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.400
 the bulk of my hair backwards 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.900
 but at the same time I let go in the neck 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.569
 about a medium sized hair part 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.099
 free and open as the upper hair is 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.620
 I again with a plait combinatorial together 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.269
 to a side pigtail and the hair 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.160
 back in the neck nor open the 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.959
 I then bad myself to one 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.610
 normal braid is together and 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.200
 take and then that would mean one more time 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.290
 with an hour so that we succeed namely 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.760
 then go and this braided 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.650
 plait to how I can go just now 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.720
 still around the hair tie from my side 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.549
 just braid so that the harouni 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.769
 is covered and then fixes the 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.340
 strand at the back of the head with just one 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.340
 curling grips 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.879
 I then read another two ton 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.590
 strive curly so hang out the 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.660
 whole so a bit looser and 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.979
 just does not seem too strict and that 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.979
 already finished this hairstyle 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.060

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:31.740
