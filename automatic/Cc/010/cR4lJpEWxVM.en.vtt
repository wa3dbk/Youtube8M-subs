keep going it's quite a few sound

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.540 
keep going it's quite a few sound
effects<00:02:19.120> if<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:23.560> can<00:02:23.710> hear<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:23.920> harmonizing

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
effects if you can hear it harmonizing

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:38.310

now

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.480 

that's<00:02:39.320> as<00:02:39.470> high<00:02:39.590> as<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:39.740> goes<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.310> then<00:02:40.430> I

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
that's as high as it goes and then I

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.880 
that's as high as it goes and then I
think<00:02:40.580> we're<00:02:40.700> back<00:02:40.790> into<00:02:40.940> sound<00:02:41.180> effects

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
think we're back into sound effects

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.300 
think we're back into sound effects
there<00:02:42.890> we<00:02:42.950> go

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
there we go

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.890 
there we go
so<00:02:43.700> that's<00:02:44.000> local<00:02:44.300> rabbit<00:02:44.570> so<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:44.690> can<00:02:44.810> hear

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
so that's local rabbit so you can hear

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.360 
so that's local rabbit so you can hear
