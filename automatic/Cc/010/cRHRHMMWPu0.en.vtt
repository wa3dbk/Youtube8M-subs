00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.080
 Jacques Bourdin safe meters 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.940
 mirabeau lawyers of dieudonné m miradour 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello hello thank you for being with us 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.840
 this morning 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.610
 dieudonné could not be in custody he is 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.920
 released yesterday I have no late afternoon 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.130
 Thursday 7 pm and make a representation 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.490
 directly he was in custody 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.890
 since yesterday morning 7 am 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.480
 it is to them 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.070
 he had not been to a 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.390
 police summons this is the reason 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.360
 for which the investigators went 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.010
 pick it up 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.360
 yes we did it we had an appointment at 14 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.829
 hours I think they were impatient 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.390
 but in a pinch you have an appointment 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.800
 at 2 pm we had an appointment yesterday at 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.570
 14 hours yeah okay 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.620
 good the investigators went to get 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.400
 good there will be a lawsuit in 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.860
 Corrections 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.559
 that this an audience the an audience where 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.839
 an audience on February 4th I know that 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.610
 before the 16th room in front of the new 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.050
 section that was created almost for him 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.300
 I believe that was created yesterday 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.649
 these contentious setbacks of the apology 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.730
 of terrorism that devolved to the 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.780
 seventeenth bedroom had so much 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.729
 since it is a dispute of the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.300
 press now at is managed by a 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.619
 new room 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.360
 yes I do not know if it was created for 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.009
 at last forgive me but apology 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.420
 of terrorism since Monday in 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.910
 immediate appearance 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.429
 many are judged and some 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.110
 convicts sentenced very severely 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.060
 besides a very severely 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.229
 I saw the convictions that's true 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 fortunately we do not have the crime of 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.259
 apology of stupidity otherwise I believe that 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.460
 a lot of government members will be 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.929
 returned in immediate appearance 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.979
 listen I think this is the moment that 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.990
 does that mean the circumstances are 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.380
 exceptional combining exceptional to 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.250
 your eyes 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.070
 am obviously we had 17 17 dead yes 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.619
 an incredible walk we walked in 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.460
 you but obviously obviously and then 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.500
 after I went to wash my brain 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.979
 to the louvre so that to be totally 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.720
 transparent 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.070
 but obviously so it's always 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.630
 like that in hand a circular and 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.030
 measure that city seeks to curb 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.189
 referred to extinguish destroy perhaps 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.170
 about who come to maintain hatred 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.240
 but now we must condemn with 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.219
 lucidity and not without thinking it's 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.020
 exactly the litigation of the press 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.890
 and words well we'll see we 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.090
 will see what will happen 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.539
 he is received in audience m mirabeau is 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.940
 what he regrets that dieudonné regrets 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.790
 this post on facebook i am charlie 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.200
 coulibaly without betraying the secret of 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.420
 Yesterday's custody report 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.769
 and neither his thought he said very clearly 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.239
 that they regretted if these words 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.340
 had been misunderstood by the way the 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.830
 message was removed very very quickly 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.330
 forgotten not usual since when he 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.130
 wants to cause in any case they leave 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.020
 the message and he assumes until the end in 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.310
 haiti he was drawn lack of humor where 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.040
 he lacked discernment 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.180
 what in my opinion it was not even 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.800
 necessarily humor is a state 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.330
 of unique spirit namely that of a 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.100
 comedian who share the values ​​of 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.630
 newspaper that was hit but that is 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.430
 hunted down as a terrorist for longer 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.310
 of a year she tracks down is finally here he has 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.650
 is kind of the apology of the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.600
 terrorism no yes or no not at all 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.400
 not at all had everything else besides the 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.740
 travis i'm charlie okay 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.940
 coulibaly I am coulibaly must be 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.560
 precise on the words you forget mans 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.450
 charlie he says i feel charlie 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.840
 hill i feel yes ten pages that's 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.880
 worst 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.959
 I feel that's not good because 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.060
 that they are not trying to divert the 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.440
 symbol and that we chanted constant 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.670
 since always and that we protect even 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.200
 until republishing 5 million 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.850
 copies of which he says here I 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.800
 shares the values ​​of chalais charlie 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.240
 but I'm treated like a cruel like 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.310
 a hummingbird he uses the two words 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.020
 as a symbol as a synonym either 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.570
 of freedom be terrorism then 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.880
 remember the law freedom of expression 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.970
 is not absolute she never existed 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.090
 in France has never made absolute 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.040
 antisemitic racists calling for hatred 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.290
 to violence, apologizing for 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.640
 terrorism summer day nor the insult the 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.170
 defamation the police 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.600
 all that stuff that's limiting your 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.890
 public expression is even more 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.209
 serious that they were held in public 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.830
 because we still want to continue 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.200
 private talk but now this 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.940
 is neither terrorists nor water to a 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.500
 government that in reaction and that makes 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.790
 sometimes more or less well his work 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.480
 to set the limits of freedom 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.700
 expression 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.519
 so we can do humor we are 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.350
 well okay the humor and the satire is 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.420
 this is the reason why 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.640
 charlie hebdo won several of these 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.280
 pros it's also in the name of this 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.500
 satire allowed the k2 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.050
 of dieudonné is not quite the 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.640
 even then he that some have compared 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.020
 right now it's not quite 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.790
 legally speaking then 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.260
 legally speaking charlie hebdo 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.000
 it's the caricatures because it's 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.709
 drawing you go while for 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.320
 dieudonned these are words so we are 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.180
 in parody or pastiche so must 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.230
 well differentiate but we are in everything 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.419
 case within the limits of freedom 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.380
 expression in the name of humor in the 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.760
 two cases and besides in history 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.230
 of charlie hebdo and hara kiri 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.180
 there was even a change of name of the 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.530
 journal because of condemnation it's this 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.639
 what did dieudonne do he even changed the 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.150
 name of a show because of a 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.530
 conviction 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.710
 I also recall that French law 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.620
 do not condemn blasphemy 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.390
 maybe except for dieudonne no no no 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.790
 do not say that because dieudonné 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.520
 yes finally it's not blasphemy it's at 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.520
 to say that depends on what we consider 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.110
 sacred at a time and a date in this 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.690
 moment what is sacred is perhaps 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.750
 charline days in which is sacred 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.229
 it's death that man fallen under the 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.229
 terrorist bullets 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.139
 obviously and here I join you all to 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.820
 do I tell you that the notion of sacred 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.010
 and circumstantial and that right now 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.690
 for dieudonned place it exists there 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.610
 will also stop making 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.620
 diode a permanent victim not a 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:23.030
 martyr we are now 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.710
 yesterday month 7 am I was in 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.030
 my bath and I was bothered there 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.590
 the atmosphere is me the victim of yesterday 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.100
 morning yes ok yes finally it's not 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.560
 Too bad 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.910
 I think is sacred to me again yes 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.919
 number of chords put too much mirabeau and 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.340
 no but no, but we're talking 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.340
 things 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.410
 two important things to do 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.720
 humor so it's possible but at 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.729
 condition not to defame not to 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.650
 to apologize for the crime of terrorism 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.180
 or racism that's the limit of the 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.250
 loire well ok we're good because 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.229
 the problem is that depending on the 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.090
 circumstances the court of cassation and 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.550
 sometimes the court of appeal the room that 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.570
 handles the press has been more severe towards 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.830
 the yield is not me who says 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.479
 it is the doctrine that analyzes the 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.400
 decisions regarding dieudonné and 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.510
 sometimes they soften there the 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.530
 problem and real because we have 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.780
 other circumstances that are 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.400
 independent of my client and who are going 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.960
 come give a 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.850
 a vector to the news 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.350
 decisions of the cedh is what we are going 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.180
 to be even more severe for apology 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.130
 terrorism is rambo logis 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.430
 terrorism one is very severe since the 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.889
 d but we are the courts the 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.360
 magistrates are very strict we border the 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.130
 madness since we know very well that 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.449
 mehdi coulibaly who made passages 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.400
 in prison for sentencing 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:30.229
 common turned into the monster or 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.300
 still in a monster we 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:33.320
 know now there are penalties that 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.270
 sell 10 months to four years in prison 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.979
 for people who speak who
