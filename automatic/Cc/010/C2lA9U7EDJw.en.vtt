susceptible<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.360> affect<00:01:46.229> dealer<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.770> chain

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
susceptible to affect dealer and chain

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.990 
susceptible to affect dealer and chain
dist<00:01:47.549> all<00:01:47.759> those<00:01:48.000> things<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.409> thing<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:50.000> I

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
dist all those things but the thing is I

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.649 
dist all those things but the thing is I
think<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.899> card<00:01:52.110> very<00:01:52.170> good<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:53.040> force<00:01:53.369> out

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
think this card very good to force out

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.639 
think this card very good to force out
there<00:01:54.659> traps<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.259> know<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:56.540> if<00:01:57.540> they<00:01:57.840> just

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
there traps you know and if they just

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.670 
there traps you know and if they just
whip<00:01:59.040> out<00:01:59.189> an<00:01:59.340> effect<00:01:59.610> behind<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.680> then

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
whip out an effect behind this then

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.440 
whip out an effect behind this then
that's<00:02:01.860> one<00:02:02.130> less<00:02:02.159> effectively<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.270> can

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
that's one less effectively that you can

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.889 
that's one less effectively that you can
use<00:02:03.689> on<00:02:03.930> my<00:02:04.140> dragonfly<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:04.950> centipede<00:02:05.670> or<00:02:05.969> you

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
use on my dragonfly or centipede or you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.469 
use on my dragonfly or centipede or you
know<00:02:06.990> I'm<00:02:07.170> saying<00:02:07.429> it's<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.819> good<00:02:09.030> bait<00:02:09.270> if

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
know I'm saying it's it's good bait if

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.089 
know I'm saying it's it's good bait if
you<00:02:09.690> will<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.319> they<00:02:10.440> don't<00:02:10.560> baler<00:02:10.830> this

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
you will and if they don't baler this

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.160 
you will and if they don't baler this
then<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.430> plus<00:02:11.670> its

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
then you plus its

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.380 
then you plus its
pretty<00:02:12.440> simple<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:13.069> you'll<00:02:13.910> have<00:02:14.120> usually

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
pretty simple and you'll have usually

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.150 
pretty simple and you'll have usually
you'll<00:02:14.840> have<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.170> your<00:02:15.290> hand<00:02:15.470> traps<00:02:15.800> or<00:02:16.040> you

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
you'll have like your hand traps or you

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.130 
you'll have like your hand traps or you
can<00:02:16.280> have<00:02:16.459> like<00:02:16.670> your<00:02:16.849> back<00:02:17.120> row<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:17.930> you're

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
can have like your back row so you're

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.979 
can have like your back row so you're
all<00:02:18.290> good<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:18.860> usually<00:02:19.220> they<00:02:19.670> will<00:02:20.120> know<00:02:20.360> TK

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
all good so usually they will know TK

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.680 
all good so usually they will know TK
you<00:02:21.370> like<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.550> can<00:02:22.670> have<00:02:22.790> like<00:02:22.910> a<00:02:23.000> scepter<00:02:23.390> or

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
you like you can have like a scepter or

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.729 
you like you can have like a scepter or
something<00:02:24.080> y'all<00:02:24.290> saying<00:02:26.020> but<00:02:27.020> I<00:02:27.290> mean<00:02:27.590> if

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
something y'all saying but I mean if

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.070 
something y'all saying but I mean if
they<00:02:27.860> want<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.099> Baylor<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.640> then<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.750> just

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
they want to Baylor it then that just

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.250 
they want to Baylor it then that just
forces<00:02:30.650> out<00:02:30.770> there<00:02:30.800> Baylor<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:32.080> that<00:02:33.080> means

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
forces out there Baylor and that means

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.380 
forces out there Baylor and that means
you<00:02:33.830> know<00:02:33.920> your<00:02:34.160> dragonfly<00:02:34.489> your<00:02:34.970> centipede

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
you know your dragonfly your centipede

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.120 
you know your dragonfly your centipede
whatever<00:02:35.780> while<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.440> less<00:02:36.590> chance<00:02:36.830> of<00:02:36.950> being

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
whatever while the less chance of being

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.640 
whatever while the less chance of being
baylard<00:02:37.520> and<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:38.900> course<00:02:39.200> if<00:02:39.410> they<00:02:39.500> don't

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
baylard and of course if they don't

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.280 
baylard and of course if they don't
vaillar<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.069> you<00:02:40.519> get<00:02:40.640> two<00:02:40.760> plus<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.720> I<00:02:42.050> think

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
vaillar it you get two plus so I think

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.620 
vaillar it you get two plus so I think
that's<00:02:42.739> why<00:02:42.980> this<00:02:43.040> card<00:02:43.519> still<00:02:44.269> has<00:02:44.420> such<00:02:44.600> a

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
that's why this card still has such a

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.530 
that's why this card still has such a
good<00:02:44.810> potential<00:02:45.200> even<00:02:46.150> when<00:02:47.150> there's<00:02:47.300> no<00:02:47.420> more

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
good potential even when there's no more

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.930 
good potential even when there's no more
