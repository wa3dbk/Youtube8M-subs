00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.180

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.650
 we play an hour with which we have to 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.050
 cut back trim and recover some 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.210
 old topics with more issues 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.390
 taking advantage of that there is not much time that 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.010
 do not decay, it's a hard year and 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.710

 I am a Christian and the Lord 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:39.360
 music has always filled me 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:43.150
 like rock in spanish so we were 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.630

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.340

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.530

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.360
 that one put on met conditions for 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.000
 nothing basically new kidnapped 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.890
 because the waiters would not follow there and not 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.440
 We knew we were on the bus 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.900
 stuck and people are therefore going 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.430

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.049
 this in the festival live then in a 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.269
 festival like this one I think you have to 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.420
 to click a little bit of everything is to click 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.030
 rock and roll plastic a rock garage 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.760
 electronic fusion fixed rap heavy metal 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.980
 of course live music said he came out 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.049
 in May the balance let's say very positive 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.030
 that is, people keep coming 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.950
 concerts of samples of affection I by 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.250
 the least is the most beautiful thing that I can 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.250
 wear 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.650
 definitely 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.910
 that our past remembers and the 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.910
 future 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.700
 two 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.280
 for me it is the best gift knows this 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.200
 nominated for Latin grammy in the 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.900
 category is like best vocal voice 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.120
 contemporary a house without walls no 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.129
 I knew that I did pop with themes but 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.129
 Go fucking that led the singer 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.549
 427 has gone bus vivita martita 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.030
 two 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.759
 Fruit 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.959
 if we are clear and not like storms 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.750
 I prefer to do things a little more 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.900
 optimistic that I stay there whipping 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.390
 the truth is that there are a lot of very 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.040
 hymn very much to chant not the wave is 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.040
 Brazilian carioca 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.870
 for the composition I think it has been 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:12.900
 much on the trip when I compose them 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.770
 I do not know if it's going to work, not all 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.770
 we want it to work 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.970
 when we started we never thought that 20 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.460
 years later we could continue playing 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.889
 a strange miracle there are still more than 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.289
 record many more unreliable than say so 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:37.370
 that we're going to get a next record in 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.370
 February 2013 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.820
 with the day 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:06:00.800
 I believe that what politicians do and 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.760
 we found out what people did this 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.920
 background 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.600
 I believe that what you have are three 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.480
 first absolutely brutal albums 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.540
 that must be super authentic he 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.490
 you always saw going as is 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.380
 it's good for us it's been this 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.010
 very important disc because let's say almost 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.780
 those 30 years of bus road 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.460
 choose all those songs and like 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.090
 everything to all our followers is 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.090
 very complicated 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.110
 He is not present 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.060
 you had a recording studio and the 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.730
 first time he got to sing they had 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.950
 a quartet were four voices so 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.210
 you have a super exclusive I can not you 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.740
 say nothing the only thing I can say is 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.540
 that I think it's going to surprise quite a 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.950
 musical project that I have in mind what 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.840
 I had a long time ago 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.430
 Clear man covered by your will be 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.900
 my side if you're lending a hand I think 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.120
 that to the end of waiting for 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:19.180

 plus 

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:32.909

 starting from love 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.990
 in the sun and in the wind 

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.990
 starting from love 

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.410
