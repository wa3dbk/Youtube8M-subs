00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.980
 tile and there in lego friends so 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.570
 to arrive cold there is wind but 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.730
 indoor legal hot and so 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.520
 today we see open way 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.590
 comforter on the 14th which here who has 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.470
 actually it's December 14 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.490
 logically we open the 14th March ips so 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.810
 we will see what I will have you 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:38.760
 remember that yesterday we had a magnificent 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:39.660
 stool so it's with water and 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.420
 today we do not see anything 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.620
 a little taste we try we will have a 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.539
 kind of niche in plain 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.989
 so what is an island a niche in 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.449
 outdoors and appeasement 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.070
 it's a list but without the roofs so 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.520
 in clear it is the house of the dogs but 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.559
 for the poor so the niche in full 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.719
 air when the deal is good but we're going 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.900
 take our two pieces twice three 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.500
 as we can see what we will do 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.470
 4 x 3 indeed was still following 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.490
 a beautiful pink piece 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.470
 luckily for them the euro dogs 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.840
 and that we would have white and then blue 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.790
 heaven that is my faith very pretty colors 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.729
 so we will take parts in her 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.990
 surface is a little bigger and a little 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.490
 smoother thank you here 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.470
 and makes it his business either with 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.680
 parts they are normal either in 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.720
 corner since we are here it's for me 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.640
 are quite rare but it's an old 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.159
 coup de pieces and we do not go either 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.780
 end without a good little bones which 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.990
 cellars well separately a niche in full 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.360
 air it would be more a basket I would say 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.220
 after that actually have a basket 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.020
 who also careca the colors too 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.210
 flashy it's a little weird often in 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.920
 breakdown and we see more in wood in 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.240
 wicker kind of thing what is not 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.649
 really pink plastic so that's it 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.409
 so badly to us knew nothing of 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.119
 new but at least that's fine 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.420
 did a few constructions I 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.590
 mean and that's good 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.180
 and as olivia 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.310
 is now 18 years old with his little dog 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.080
 the completely tickets 31 500 notebook 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.629
 who is well he will have his niche of gold 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.080
 here is go everyone forgot 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:28.019
 pledged admit here here I am 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.390
 bad so far there's plenty of room 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:34.769
 there is no place lalonde that he goes there 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.450
 tie everything it's true it's not 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.360
 very very much 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.799
 in a diverse scene and lots of stuff 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.450
 who are going to who are going inside 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.129
 what but problem is that the inter 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.620
 that's it and the inter this tool what 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.660
 so as can see al hajja olivia 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.459
 do not know where to go 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.709
 I do not have to procrastinate anymore 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.769
 long on the go calendar design 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.630
 friends but that actually I 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.239
 hang up example we say I think the 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.569
 so that's thanks to questions from 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.760
 comments on the model of the day on 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.190
 the models of the other 14 nba players 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.120
 do not hesitate to deposit I will answer 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.299
 with great pleasure 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.860
 and then I can I think I can say 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.220
 with certainty that we find ourselves 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.260
 tomorrow for the fifteen who is here we go 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.940
 attack the beach is it's great and 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.139
 so the greens we'll see if we have a 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.700
 new structure with 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:28.670
 construction also on the counter 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.670
 just one or two pieces go to more
