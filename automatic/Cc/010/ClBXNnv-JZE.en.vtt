00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
gonna say his back in 2012 I made a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.450 
gonna say his back in 2012 I made a
fully<00:00:18.000> automatic<00:00:18.560> melon<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.830> pumpkin<00:00:20.189> farm

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
fully automatic melon and pumpkin farm

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.730 
fully automatic melon and pumpkin farm
and<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.880> worked<00:00:21.119> off<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.330> itself<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.590> did

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
and it worked off of itself and it did

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.009 
and it worked off of itself and it did
really<00:00:22.920> nice<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:24.269> decided<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.720> come<00:00:24.840> back

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
really nice and I decided to come back

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.560 
really nice and I decided to come back
to<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.380> idea<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:26.279> make<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.730> really<00:00:27.330> tiny

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
to that idea but make a really tiny

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.210 
to that idea but make a really tiny
version<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.289> because<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> other<00:00:28.859> one<00:00:29.039> was

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
version of it because the other one was

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.389 
version of it because the other one was
humongous<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.420> was<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.599> huge<00:00:30.900> design<00:00:31.369> so<00:00:32.369> I

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
humongous it was a huge design so I

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.889 
humongous it was a huge design so I
decided<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.759> make<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> little<00:00:33.059> tiny<00:00:33.329> version<00:00:33.780> of

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
decided to make a little tiny version of

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.139 
decided to make a little tiny version of
it<00:00:34.020> um<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.559> haven't<00:00:34.739> done<00:00:34.950> enough<00:00:35.219> tests<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.000> it

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
it um I haven't done enough tests on it

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.430 
it um I haven't done enough tests on it
to<00:00:36.239> tell<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.690> sure<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.290> hundred

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
to tell you for sure if it's a hundred

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.880 
to tell you for sure if it's a hundred
percent<00:00:37.649> working<00:00:38.430> correctly<00:00:38.670> um<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.530> one

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
percent working correctly um I have one

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.280 
percent working correctly um I have one
hopper<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:42.239> will<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.660> getting<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
hopper here that will be getting the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.389 
hopper here that will be getting the
items<00:00:44.040> towards<00:00:44.719> this<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.890> don't<00:00:47.070> know<00:00:47.190> for

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
items towards this and I don't know for

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.549 
items towards this and I don't know for
sure<00:00:47.430> if<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:48.300> always<00:00:48.870> gonna<00:00:48.989> get<00:00:49.170> items

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
sure if it's always gonna get items

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.680 
sure if it's always gonna get items
stalked<00:00:49.950> inside<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.270> that's<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.539> one

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
stalked inside of it so that's just one

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.270 
stalked inside of it so that's just one
thing<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.050> look<00:00:52.289> out<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.829> might<00:00:53.070> not<00:00:53.219> be

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
thing to look out so it might not be

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.040 
thing to look out so it might not be
fully<00:00:53.610> functional<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.300> I'm<00:00:54.360> not<00:00:54.510> gonna<00:00:54.660> put<00:00:54.930> it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
fully functional so I'm not gonna put it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.709 
fully functional so I'm not gonna put it
up<00:00:55.140> as<00:00:55.410> fully<00:00:55.649> functional<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:57.090> yet<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.570> can

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
up as fully functional just yet you can

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.479 
up as fully functional just yet you can
comment<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.530> fully<00:00:58.829> functional<00:00:59.100> but

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
comment if it is fully functional but

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.979 
comment if it is fully functional but
right<00:00:59.609> now<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.789> don't<00:01:00.030> know<00:01:00.210> for<00:01:00.390> sure<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.809> just

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
right now I don't know for sure I just

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.290 
right now I don't know for sure I just
have<00:01:01.109> some<00:01:01.230> items<00:01:01.590> stored<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:02.300> but

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
have some items stored up in here but

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.410 
have some items stored up in here but
basically<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.899> does<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.589> once<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.159> item

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
basically what it does is once the item

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.640 
basically what it does is once the item
loses<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.630> um<00:01:07.310> ability<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> stay<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:09.119> it

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
loses it um ability to stay going it

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.070 
loses it um ability to stay going it
disappears<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.950> then<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.210> Pistons<00:01:12.869> come

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
disappears and then the Pistons come

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.020 
disappears and then the Pistons come
down<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.619> break<00:01:13.920> stuff<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.549> then<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.760> mine

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
down and break stuff and then this mine

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.999 
down and break stuff and then this mine
cart<00:01:15.360> comes<00:01:15.840> by<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.439> sucks<00:01:16.740> everything

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
cart comes by and just sucks everything

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.429 
cart comes by and just sucks everything
up<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:18.090> I'm<00:01:18.450> gonna<00:01:18.570> go<00:01:18.750> ahead<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.990> take<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
up so I'm gonna go ahead and take the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.070 
up so I'm gonna go ahead and take the
item<00:01:19.560> from<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.520> spot<00:01:20.880> that's<00:01:21.750> already<00:01:21.990> in

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
item from the spot that's already in

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.570 
item from the spot that's already in
here<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.729> um<00:01:24.500> as<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.860> see<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.100> breaks<00:01:26.340> it

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
here and um as you can see it breaks it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.890 
here and um as you can see it breaks it
and<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.060> all<00:01:27.150> gets<00:01:27.299> sucked<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.110> um

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
and then it all gets sucked up and um

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.569 
and then it all gets sucked up and um
yeah<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.610> I'm<00:01:32.610> gonna<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.810> should<00:01:34.140> um<00:01:34.579> work

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
yeah so I'm gonna I it should um work

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.569 
yeah so I'm gonna I it should um work
you<00:01:35.880> know<00:01:36.000> with<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.240> minecart<00:01:36.810> uh<00:01:37.189> if<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.310> put

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
you know with the minecart uh if I put

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.480 
you know with the minecart uh if I put
things<00:01:38.970> here<00:01:39.180> they<00:01:39.360> will<00:01:39.600> go<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.350> um<00:01:40.650> but

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
things here they will go to this um but

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.880 
things here they will go to this um but
it<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> matter<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.210> chance<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.200> if<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
it is a matter of chance and that if the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.429 
it is a matter of chance and that if the
stuff<00:01:44.130> breaks<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.700> right<00:01:44.880> spots<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:46.079> um

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
stuff breaks in the right spots but um

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.819 
stuff breaks in the right spots but um
for<00:01:47.189> how<00:01:47.369> much<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.329> uses<00:01:48.720> at<00:01:48.930> times<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.649> don't

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
for how much it uses at times I don't

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.350 
for how much it uses at times I don't
think<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.100> should<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.280> too<00:01:50.520> bad<00:01:50.729> if<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.119> just

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
think it should be too bad if you just

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.179 
think it should be too bad if you just
stock<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.750> up<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.020> little<00:01:52.170> bit<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.619> it'll<00:01:53.070> be

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
stock it up a little bit and it'll be

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.590 
stock it up a little bit and it'll be
able<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.399> restock<00:01:53.759> itself<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.420> won't

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
able to restock itself and I won't

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.749 
able to restock itself and I won't
really<00:01:54.780> go<00:01:54.960> down<00:01:55.170> too<00:01:55.560> much<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.579> does

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
really go down too much and if it does

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.310 
really go down too much and if it does
