00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.689 

so<00:00:19.170> today<00:00:19.470> we're<00:00:19.680> going<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.070> look<00:00:20.250> at<00:00:20.460> using

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
so today we're going to look at using

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.410 
so today we're going to look at using
IMC<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.900> check<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.949> credentials<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.150> is

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
IMC to check the credentials that it is

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.349 
IMC to check the credentials that it is
using<00:00:24.930> on<00:00:25.080> your<00:00:25.769> devices<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.400> why<00:00:27.029> do<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.269> need

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
using on your devices so why do we need

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.349 
using on your devices so why do we need
to<00:00:27.480> do<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.720> well<00:00:27.930> SNMP<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:30.240> not

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
to do this well SNMP is it's just not

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.330 
to do this well SNMP is it's just not
enough<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.929> be<00:00:31.019> honest<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.740> great<00:00:31.920> it's

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
enough to be honest it's it's great it's

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.799 
enough to be honest it's it's great it's
a<00:00:32.399> protocol<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.090> gives<00:00:33.300> us<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.450> lot<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.630> things

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
a protocol it gives us a lot of things

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.229 
a protocol it gives us a lot of things
but<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.620> doesn't<00:00:34.920> give<00:00:35.010> us<00:00:35.100> everything<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.820> for

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
but it doesn't give us everything in for

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.880 
but it doesn't give us everything in for
a<00:00:36.270> lot<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> functions<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.770> do<00:00:37.860> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
a lot of functions that we have to do a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.770 
a lot of functions that we have to do a
CL<00:00:38.370> management<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:39.030> instance<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.450> one<00:00:39.690> of

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
CL management for instance is one of

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.639 
CL management for instance is one of
them

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
them

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.709 
them
we're<00:00:40.920> gonna<00:00:41.040> need<00:00:41.250> CLI<00:00:41.730> access<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
we're gonna need CLI access to the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.510 
we're gonna need CLI access to the
devices<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:43.710> want<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.070> make<00:00:44.160> sure<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.460> our

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
devices so we want to make sure that our

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.840 
devices so we want to make sure that our
CLI<00:00:45.030> credentials<00:00:45.629> are<00:00:46.100> accurate<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.309> working

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
CLI credentials are accurate and working

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.840 
CLI credentials are accurate and working
and<00:00:47.969> there's<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.809> way<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.350> OMS<00:00:50.309> so

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and there's a way to do that OMS so

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.770 
and there's a way to do that OMS so
let's<00:00:51.270> take<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> look<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:53.940> here<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.180> are<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
let's take a look so here we are on the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.310 
let's take a look so here we are on the
IMC<00:00:55.550> homepage<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.090> recently<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.289> just

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
IMC homepage here and recently we just

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.040 
IMC homepage here and recently we just
discovered<00:00:59.039> an<00:00:59.219> entire<00:00:59.730> when<00:01:00.420> right<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:00.960> we're

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
discovered an entire when right so we're

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.660 
discovered an entire when right so we're
gonna<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.289> look<00:01:01.469> at<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.590> win<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.129> see<00:01:02.550> those

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
gonna go look at that win and see those

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.780 
gonna go look at that win and see those
devices<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:04.040> we've<00:01:05.040> got<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> whole<00:01:05.549> bunch<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
devices so we've got a whole bunch of

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.950 
devices so we've got a whole bunch of
devices<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.270> here<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.750> have

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
devices in here that we have

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.560 
devices in here that we have
successfully<00:01:07.470> discovered<00:01:08.220> using<00:01:08.549> SNMP<00:01:09.030> now

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
successfully discovered using SNMP now

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.359 
successfully discovered using SNMP now
what<00:01:09.780> does<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:09.960> tell<00:01:10.409> us<00:01:10.590> about<00:01:10.740> whether<00:01:11.250> or

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
what does that tell us about whether or

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.149 
what does that tell us about whether or
not<00:01:11.460> we've<00:01:11.700> got<00:01:12.500> CLI<00:01:13.500> access<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> these

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
not we've got CLI access to these

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.600 
not we've got CLI access to these
devices<00:01:14.420> absolutely<00:01:15.420> nothing<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.610> we're

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
devices absolutely nothing so we're

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.800 
devices absolutely nothing so we're
gonna<00:01:17.729> go<00:01:17.880> check<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.240> now<00:01:18.420> we're<00:01:18.600> gonna<00:01:18.720> use

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
gonna go check that now we're gonna use

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.630 
gonna go check that now we're gonna use
the<00:01:18.900> batch<00:01:19.170> operation<00:01:19.979> check<00:01:20.400> device

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the batch operation check device

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.010 
the batch operation check device
function<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.299> those<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.750> who<00:01:21.840> haven't

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
function so for those of you who haven't

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.800 
function so for those of you who haven't
seen<00:01:22.229> batch<00:01:22.439> operations<00:01:23.070> before<00:01:23.659> we've<00:01:24.659> got

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
seen batch operations before we've got

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.960 
seen batch operations before we've got
nm<00:01:25.110> s<00:01:25.200> parameters<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.950> these<00:01:26.070> are<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
nm s parameters so these are the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.850 
nm s parameters so these are the
parameters<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.450> IMC<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.259> going<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.650> use

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
parameters that IMC is going to use

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.590 
parameters that IMC is going to use
against<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.430> devices<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:29.970> those<00:01:30.090> are<00:01:30.180> IMC

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
against the devices so those are IMC

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.810 
against the devices so those are IMC
things<00:01:30.840> we've<00:01:31.200> got<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.799> check<00:01:32.040> device<00:01:32.340> access

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
things we've got the check device access

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.859 
things we've got the check device access
settings<00:01:33.060> which<00:01:33.180> we're<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.450> use<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
settings which we're going to use and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.600 
settings which we're going to use and
then<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> device<00:01:34.619> configuration<00:01:34.950> which<00:01:35.490> will

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
then the device configuration which will

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.740 
then the device configuration which will
allow<00:01:35.790> us<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:36.060> other<00:01:36.210> things<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.659> we'll

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
allow us to do other things that we'll

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.770 
allow us to do other things that we'll
look<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:37.020> later<00:01:37.400> so<00:01:38.479> in<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.600> particular

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
look at later so in this particular

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.490 
look at later so in this particular
environment

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
environment

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.200 
environment
I<00:01:40.560> know<00:01:40.680> SSH<00:01:41.280> has<00:01:41.430> not<00:01:41.579> configured<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.119> I'm

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
I know SSH has not configured so I'm

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.389 
I know SSH has not configured so I'm
going<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.570> disable<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.409> then<00:01:44.070> I'm<00:01:44.280> gonna

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
going to disable that and then I'm gonna

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.160 
going to disable that and then I'm gonna
go<00:01:44.579> down<00:01:44.759> here<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.299> use<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> query<00:01:45.930> engine

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
go down here and use the query engine

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.100 
go down here and use the query engine
just<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> show<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:46.979> guys<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.430> different<00:01:47.850> way

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
just to show you guys a different way

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.719 
just to show you guys a different way
and<00:01:49.110> then<00:01:49.259> look<00:01:49.439> at<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.799> location<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.549> type

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
and then look at the location and type

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.850 
and then look at the location and type
in<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> word<00:01:51.420> when<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.680> is

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
in just the word when here so this is

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.350 
in just the word when here so this is
the<00:01:52.890> same<00:01:53.189> keyword<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.880> use<00:01:54.180> to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the same keyword that I use to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.539 
the same keyword that I use to
dynamically<00:01:55.079> generate<00:01:55.530> those<00:01:55.770> custom<00:01:56.280> views

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
dynamically generate those custom views

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.630 
dynamically generate those custom views
and<00:01:56.790> custom<00:01:57.210> groups<00:01:57.450> earlier<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:59.159> put<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
and custom groups earlier so put in the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.100 
and custom groups earlier so put in the
word<00:01:59.820> win<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.180> automatically<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.869> will<00:02:00.990> go

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
word win and automatically it will go

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.020 
word win and automatically it will go
out<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.469> check<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.710> assist<00:02:02.250> location<00:02:02.909> of

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
out and check the assist location of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.149 
out and check the assist location of
those<00:02:03.240> devices<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.930> allow<00:02:04.560> me<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.950> select

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
those devices and allow me to select

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.240 
those devices and allow me to select
them<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:06.170> could<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.259> also<00:02:07.380> done<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.770> by<00:02:07.950> view

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
them I could have also done this by view

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.430 
them I could have also done this by view
so<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.520> could<00:02:08.910> use<00:02:09.119> custom<00:02:10.080> view<00:02:10.229> for<00:02:10.410> instance

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
so I could use custom view for instance

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.410 
so I could use custom view for instance
and<00:02:10.830> go<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.069> just<00:02:11.250> look<00:02:11.370> at<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.550> win<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.970> in

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
and go and just look at the win and in

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.610 
and go and just look at the win and in
this<00:02:12.540> case<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.900> extra

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
this case that extra

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.710 
this case that extra
500<00:02:14.129> is<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.459> there<00:02:14.640> which<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:15.120> already<00:02:15.569> know

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
500 is in there which I already know

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.899 
500 is in there which I already know
works<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.200> don't<00:02:16.260> want<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.620> test<00:02:16.830> today<00:02:17.099> so

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
works and I don't want to test today so

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.070 
works and I don't want to test today so
let's<00:02:18.209> just<00:02:18.390> look<00:02:18.510> at<00:02:18.599> these<00:02:18.780> particular

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
let's just look at these particular

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.089 
let's just look at these particular
devices<00:02:21.620> we<00:02:22.620> click<00:02:22.830> ok<00:02:24.500> there<00:02:25.500> we<00:02:25.680> go<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:26.040> now

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
devices we click ok there we go and now

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.460 
devices we click ok there we go and now
we<00:02:26.760> can<00:02:26.940> go<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.330> click<00:02:27.420> ok<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.230> will

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
we can go and click ok and this will

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.250 
we can go and click ok and this will
cause<00:02:29.099> IMC<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:30.060> immediately<00:02:30.690> go<00:02:30.870> out<00:02:30.900> and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
cause IMC to immediately go out and

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.380 
cause IMC to immediately go out and
check<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.980> credentials<00:02:32.489> for<00:02:32.879> those

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
check the credentials for those

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.990 
check the credentials for those
particular<00:02:33.810> devices<00:02:34.430> this<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.489> gonna<00:02:35.700> take

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
particular devices this is gonna take

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.149 
particular devices this is gonna take
depending<00:02:36.659> on<00:02:36.870> on<00:02:37.290> how<00:02:37.500> many<00:02:37.680> devices<00:02:37.890> you're

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
depending on on how many devices you're

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.860 
depending on on how many devices you're
trying<00:02:38.489> to<00:02:38.579> check<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:39.329> could<00:02:39.540> take<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.780> little

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
trying to check this could take a little

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.960 
trying to check this could take a little
while<00:02:40.079> right<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.620> can<00:02:40.739> be<00:02:40.829> very<00:02:41.010> fast<00:02:41.220> on<00:02:41.549> one

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
while right this can be very fast on one

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.759 
while right this can be very fast on one
device<00:02:42.120> or<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.930> could<00:02:43.049> take<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.650> know<00:02:43.680> a

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
device or it could take you know a

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.410 
device or it could take you know a
minute<00:02:43.950> or<00:02:44.099> two<00:02:44.250> or<00:02:44.430> if<00:02:45.030> you're<00:02:45.209> checking

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
minute or two or if you're checking

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.270 
minute or two or if you're checking
thousands<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.109> devices<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.620> may<00:02:46.709> take<00:02:46.950> quite<00:02:46.980> a

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
thousands of devices it may take quite a

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.670 
thousands of devices it may take quite a
bit<00:02:47.400> longer<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:48.870> do<00:02:48.959> all<00:02:49.109> that<00:02:49.140> using<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
bit longer you can do all that using the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.830 
bit longer you can do all that using the
tool<00:02:49.829> though<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.359> we're<00:02:51.359> just<00:02:51.390> gonna<00:02:51.599> wait<00:02:51.780> for

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
tool though so we're just gonna wait for

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.240 
tool though so we're just gonna wait for
this<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.079> finish<00:02:54.680> we're<00:02:55.680> gonna<00:02:55.769> go<00:02:55.950> up<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.099> the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
this to finish we're gonna go up to the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.830 
this to finish we're gonna go up to the
top<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.579> click<00:02:56.760> on<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.090> refresh<00:02:57.450> button<00:02:57.480> and

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
top and click on the refresh button and

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.860 
top and click on the refresh button and
we're<00:02:58.019> gonna<00:02:58.109> see<00:02:58.440> what<00:02:59.190> happened<00:02:59.870> so

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
we're gonna see what happened so

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.470 
we're gonna see what happened so
partially<00:03:01.769> successful<00:03:04.549> so<00:03:05.549> details<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.299> let's

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
partially successful so details so let's

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.270 
partially successful so details so let's
look<00:03:06.540> at<00:03:06.659> this<00:03:06.750> SNMP<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.620> consistent<00:03:08.129> and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
look at this SNMP is consistent and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.800 
look at this SNMP is consistent and
telnet<00:03:08.549> is<00:03:08.760> consistent

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
telnet is consistent

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.449 
telnet is consistent
we<00:03:10.560> add<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.680> little<00:03:10.829> bit<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.099> a<00:03:11.159> problem<00:03:11.340> here

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
we add a little bit of a problem here

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.940 
we add a little bit of a problem here
but<00:03:11.790> that's<00:03:11.879> not<00:03:12.120> unheard<00:03:12.569> of<00:03:12.989> accessing<00:03:13.890> the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
but that's not unheard of accessing the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.819 
but that's not unheard of accessing the
device<00:03:14.959> we<00:03:15.959> just<00:03:16.109> discovered<00:03:16.470> this<00:03:16.560> network

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
device we just discovered this network

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.170 
device we just discovered this network
so<00:03:16.980> for<00:03:17.190> sure<00:03:17.340> there<00:03:17.489> are<00:03:17.609> things<00:03:17.819> wrong<00:03:18.000> so

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
so for sure there are things wrong so

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.430 
so for sure there are things wrong so
we're<00:03:18.269> gonna<00:03:18.359> have<00:03:18.569> to<00:03:18.630> go<00:03:18.720> clean<00:03:19.109> that<00:03:19.230> later

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
we're gonna have to go clean that later

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.409 
we're gonna have to go clean that later
but<00:03:20.370> let's<00:03:21.000> let's<00:03:21.540> take<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.720> look<00:03:21.930> right<00:03:21.959> now<00:03:22.190> so

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
but let's let's take a look right now so

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.940 
but let's let's take a look right now so
you<00:03:24.419> may<00:03:24.569> think<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:24.989> that<00:03:25.109> is<00:03:25.319> actually<00:03:25.709> a

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
you may think that that is actually a

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.349 
you may think that that is actually a
good<00:03:26.130> thing<00:03:26.190> that<00:03:26.340> everything<00:03:26.730> is<00:03:26.819> consistent

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
good thing that everything is consistent

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.379 
good thing that everything is consistent
but<00:03:28.010> sometimes<00:03:29.010> these<00:03:29.280> rules<00:03:29.549> will<00:03:29.940> actually

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
but sometimes these rules will actually

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.699 
but sometimes these rules will actually
lie<00:03:30.569> to<00:03:30.629> you<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.810> little<00:03:30.989> bit<00:03:31.109> they<00:03:31.440> will<00:03:31.590> do

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
lie to you a little bit they will do

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.349 
lie to you a little bit they will do
exactly<00:03:31.889> what<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.489> tell<00:03:32.669> them<00:03:32.849> to<00:03:32.910> do<00:03:33.120> and

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
exactly what you tell them to do and

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.069 
exactly what you tell them to do and
nothing<00:03:33.690> more

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
nothing more

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.789 
nothing more
so<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.980> default<00:03:35.519> would<00:03:36.150> be<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.510> use<00:03:36.799> password

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
so the default would be to use password

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.680 
so the default would be to use password
with<00:03:38.160> no<00:03:38.310> operator<00:03:38.669> but<00:03:38.849> those<00:03:39.120> were<00:03:39.329> all<00:03:39.359> if

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
with no operator but those were all if

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.319 
with no operator but those were all if
you<00:03:39.810> noticed<00:03:40.139> Cisco<00:03:40.680> devices<00:03:41.000> so<00:03:42.000> it's<00:03:42.180> a

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
you noticed Cisco devices so it's a

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.879 
you noticed Cisco devices so it's a
range<00:03:43.199> of<00:03:43.500> Cisco<00:03:45.019> 1841<00:03:46.049> maybe<00:03:46.500> it's<00:03:46.620> in<00:03:46.650> twenty

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
range of Cisco 1841 maybe it's in twenty

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
five sixty switches and Cisco requires

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.210 
five sixty switches and Cisco requires
you<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.760> use<00:03:50.940> an<00:03:51.239> enable<00:03:51.569> password<00:03:51.959> as<00:03:52.139> well<00:03:52.220> so

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
you to use an enable password as well so

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.039 
you to use an enable password as well so
although<00:03:53.790> we<00:03:53.910> were<00:03:54.000> able<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.269> login<00:03:54.480> using<00:03:54.900> the

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
although we were able to login using the

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.629 
although we were able to login using the
normal<00:03:55.349> password<00:03:55.530> we<00:03:55.859> don't<00:03:56.099> have<00:03:56.310> enable

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
normal password we don't have enable

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.640 
normal password we don't have enable
access<00:03:56.790> currently<00:03:57.389> so<00:03:58.169> we're<00:03:58.290> gonna<00:03:58.379> use<00:03:58.560> the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
access currently so we're gonna use the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.610 
access currently so we're gonna use the
batch<00:03:58.799> operation<00:03:59.489> here<00:03:59.760> to<00:04:00.629> set<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.139> telnet

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
batch operation here to set the telnet

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.710 
batch operation here to set the telnet
and<00:04:01.980> we're<00:04:02.699> going<00:04:02.819> to<00:04:02.849> type<00:04:03.030> in<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.510> password

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
and we're going to type in the password

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.629 
and we're going to type in the password
our<00:04:04.169> super-secret<00:04:04.829> password<00:04:04.949> which<00:04:05.609> is

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
our super-secret password which is

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.699 
our super-secret password which is
password<00:04:06.419> right<00:04:06.629> now<00:04:06.750> we'll<00:04:07.230> look<00:04:07.560> at

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
password right now we'll look at

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.830 
password right now we'll look at
changing<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.069> in<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.250> future<00:04:08.459> video<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:08.910> now

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
changing that in a future video and now

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.089 
changing that in a future video and now
we're<00:04:10.019> gonna<00:04:10.109> recheck<00:04:10.680> all<00:04:10.919> those

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
we're gonna recheck all those

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.559 
we're gonna recheck all those
credentials<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.730> make<00:04:11.879> sure<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.209> we<00:04:12.359> don't

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
credentials to make sure that we don't

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.259 
credentials to make sure that we don't
have<00:04:12.810> just<00:04:12.840> telnet<00:04:13.500> initial<00:04:14.190> access<00:04:14.609> but<00:04:14.819> full

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
have just telnet initial access but full

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.810 
have just telnet initial access but full
access<00:04:15.599> all<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.320> way<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:17.130> enable<00:04:17.459> prompt

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
access all the way to the enable prompt

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.129 
access all the way to the enable prompt
in<00:04:18.120> which<00:04:18.269> case<00:04:18.449> we'll<00:04:18.599> be<00:04:18.660> able<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.870> do<00:04:18.930> coffee

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
in which case we'll be able to do coffee

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.949 
in which case we'll be able to do coffee
as<00:04:19.440> well<00:04:19.549> again<00:04:20.549> we<00:04:20.639> will<00:04:20.789> deselect<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.479> SSH

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
as well again we will deselect the SSH

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.180 
as well again we will deselect the SSH
here<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.409> click<00:04:22.890> OK<00:04:23.159> and<00:04:23.840> we're<00:04:24.840> now<00:04:25.020> going<00:04:25.409> to

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
here and click OK and we're now going to

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.070 
here and click OK and we're now going to
to<00:04:26.730> check<00:04:26.910> that<00:04:27.090> this<00:04:27.600> is<00:04:27.660> gonna<00:04:27.840> take<00:04:28.050> a

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
to check that this is gonna take a

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.750 
to check that this is gonna take a
little<00:04:28.230> bit<00:04:28.320> of<00:04:28.440> time<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:28.800> can<00:04:29.310> see<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.460> start

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
little bit of time you can see the start

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.990 
little bit of time you can see the start
time<00:04:29.910> is<00:04:30.060> run<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:31.190> we'll<00:04:32.190> give<00:04:32.370> this<00:04:32.520> a<00:04:32.880> couple

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
time is run and we'll give this a couple

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.490 
time is run and we'll give this a couple
seconds<00:04:34.790> we're<00:04:35.790> gonna<00:04:36.080> click<00:04:37.080> refresh<00:04:37.290> here

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
seconds we're gonna click refresh here

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.000 
seconds we're gonna click refresh here
and<00:04:37.620> keep<00:04:37.740> in<00:04:37.830> mind<00:04:37.860> also<00:04:38.250> that<00:04:38.630> depending<00:04:39.630> on

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
and keep in mind also that depending on

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.100 
and keep in mind also that depending on
how<00:04:41.090> what<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.150> distance<00:04:42.450> is<00:04:42.480> between<00:04:42.630> you<00:04:42.960> and

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
how what the distance is between you and

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.630 
how what the distance is between you and
your<00:04:43.200> device<00:04:43.440> this<00:04:43.740> may<00:04:43.890> take<00:04:44.070> longer<00:04:44.310> as<00:04:44.520> well

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
your device this may take longer as well

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.310 
your device this may take longer as well
that<00:04:44.790> could<00:04:44.910> also<00:04:45.030> affect<00:04:45.240> things<00:04:45.510> so<00:04:46.170> let's

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
that could also affect things so let's

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.110 
that could also affect things so let's
take<00:04:46.500> a<00:04:46.530> look<00:04:46.770> at<00:04:46.920> the<00:04:47.130> details<00:04:47.520> here<00:04:47.790> look<00:04:48.030> at

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
take a look at the details here look at

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.090 
take a look at the details here look at
that<00:04:48.270> all<00:04:48.480> consistent<00:04:49.140> so<00:04:49.380> we<00:04:49.530> now<00:04:49.770> have

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
that all consistent so we now have

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.540 
that all consistent so we now have
access<00:04:50.460> to<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:52.110> complete<00:04:52.410> CLI<00:04:52.980> as<00:04:53.220> well<00:04:53.460> as

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
access to the complete CLI as well as

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.330 
access to the complete CLI as well as
SNMP<00:04:54.030> for<00:04:54.300> these<00:04:54.450> devices<00:04:54.900> and<00:04:55.020> now<00:04:55.890> we're<00:04:56.070> set

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
SNMP for these devices and now we're set

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.410 
SNMP for these devices and now we're set
up<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.520> do<00:04:56.610> some<00:04:56.790> more<00:04:56.880> interesting<00:04:57.000> things

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
up to do some more interesting things

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.320 
up to do some more interesting things
which<00:04:57.600> we'll<00:04:57.750> look<00:04:57.870> at<00:04:58.020> in<00:04:58.080> future<00:04:58.320> videos<00:04:59.330> see
