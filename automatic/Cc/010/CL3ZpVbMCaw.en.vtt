00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
and it will have a serious plot later on

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.929 
and it will have a serious plot later on
because<00:02:57.169> I<00:02:57.290> have<00:02:57.409> had<00:02:57.590> many<00:02:58.159> Furies<00:02:58.579> on<00:02:58.699> the

into<00:03:01.099> that<00:03:01.370> at<00:03:01.579> the<00:03:01.699> moment<00:03:01.939> because<00:03:02.719> it's

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
into that at the moment because it's

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.360
