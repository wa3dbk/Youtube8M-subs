00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.440
 also the portable consoles of 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.750
 nintendo 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.640
 and it is precisely to the video game for 3ds that 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.780
 last year it was a triumph 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.820
 Italian boy 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.489
 arash loved in the master category 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.379
 or those over 15 but there 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.350

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.589
 seniors up to 14 years and junior up to 10 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.659
 years 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.640
 all have earned the invitation to 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.510
 participate in washington here 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.519
 qualifying in the first places in the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.780
 respective national championships or 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.120
 at the European championships 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.460
 many Italians in the race almost 10 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.900
 percent of total competitors and is 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.090
 for them it was an opportunity to live 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.710
 a unique experience in the company of 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.790
 own family brothers sisters 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.680
 parents and grandparents 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.840
 all involved in some way not only 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.040
 as mere spectators but also as 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.110
 volunteers judges or even cosplayers 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.909
 I started when I was little and then 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.380
 I passed this passion on to my father 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:29.700
 which today, for example, arbitrates every 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.090
 let's say city or region has leagues 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.460
 which are practically meeting places 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.110
 daily or weekly depends on where 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.360
 we all find each other again 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.570
 play both carter and video games 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.579
 then there are the city leagues i 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.179
 regional championships the championships 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.890
 national based on their own points in 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.960
 based on the results you make of them 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.720
 tournaments you can get to the championship 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.549
 world 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.110
 every year more than 300 thousand players in 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.180
 the whole world takes part in these 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.340
 organized qualifying tournaments 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.649
 according to the rules of play pokémon ma 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.810
 only 500 between video game card game 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.369
 reach the world finals for whom 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.840
 he had not qualified but he is anyway 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.000
 willing to travel 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.550
 one last chance to qualify remains 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.959
 in a knockout tournament that 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.880
 held the day before the start 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.800
 official of the event and that this year 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.140
 saw a thousand face each other 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.140
 players for very few places in the final 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:30.150
 she pokémon awards to the nations they have 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.189
 the greatest number of players 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.260
 organized by leagues and who carry 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.700
 forward tournaments throughout the year like the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.139
 Italian community 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.090
 this means more 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.049
 seats in the final and trips paid by 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.269
 organization 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.400
 the key to the tournament and fair play 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.439
 we want to be agonistic but without yes 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.900
 transform into stress is an event where 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:51.030
 have fun being sporting tighten the 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.099
 hand to their opponent and make themselves new 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.730
 friends become natural things and we want 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.730
 that remains so 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.840
 this is a very very community 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.909
 friendly than those of others 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.370
 other games 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:08.939
 in short, it is customary to do so before 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.609
 playing always shakes hands and then e 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.409
 later also a rush won the 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.180
 2013 world champion title 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.329
 playing on nintendo ds 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.730
 this year with pokémon x and y si si 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.189
 passed on 3ds but the substance of the game 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.290
 no strategy has changed and a pinch of 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.709
 luck common elements also to the game 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.709
 of collectible cards 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.700
 the strategy and if we want easier to 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.710
 check why you prepare it first 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.480
 of the match with the preparation of the 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.000
 team and during the match with the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.020
 choice of moves the luck component 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.170
 in theory it cannot be controlled though 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.210
 also ligio warm in certain ways e 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.580
 making teams in certain ways 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.260
 that too can be more or less 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.450
 check is up to the best players 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.810
 check your luck and don't lose to 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.250
 I'd guess that he had farms 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.240
 of all this it is opportune to publish 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:08.920
 basic there is fishing the cards and then of course the 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.920
 skill and strategy 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.600
 like everywhere there is the component 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.830
 luck for how I see it if I want to 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.390
 prove to be stronger 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.430
 of the opponent I win also against each 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.590
 opponent against misfortune 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.960
 so yes if you lose and my fault i have 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.860
 wrong I have to say that the other one is 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.860
 he was better than me 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.580
 the game of pokémon is a game very much 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.240
 complex that develops in boys one 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.880
 strong mnemonic ability and develops a 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.410
 great instinct in the strategy are 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.750
 on a street where the boys 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.300
 surely they will develop a very good one 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.440
 there are so many dads and intelligence 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.150
 playing moms who care about that 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.340
 they learn about the rules they become 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.490
 maybe judges because they want to follow 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.039
 up close this passion of the son 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.220
 the advice is really to do 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.530
 just approach all 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.200
 to competition because it is a world 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.900
 completely different from what the is 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.620
 game in itself that at the beginning the pure 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.260
 fun 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.380
 then it becomes much more experience 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.870
 fantastic because you make new friends 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.810
 even with people from other countries and you 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.730
 have fun anyway i 'm super happy to 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.000
 having met the world of pokémon 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.380
 equal pokémon and fun for me and 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 that's enough 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.130
 I wanted to tell you again about the 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.600
 triumph of our colors unfortunately though 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.130
 this time no Italian is 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.120
 qualified among the first eight of the 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.130
 respective categories 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.450
 patience the final victory between the masters 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.310
 in the card game it went to the Canadian 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.960
 andrew and road as far as 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.850
 it's about the video game to triumph is 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.230
 was the Korean session park 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.600
 highly acclaimed by all the public 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.940
 despite its challenging games 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.590
 azzarelli played at home to meet the 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.820
 Italian community pokémon was 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.169
 for me the real event in the event 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.120
 the enthusiasm of these young people 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.740
 Pokémon coaches is amazing and 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.150
 now begins a new run-up to the 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.950
 next world championship 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.590
 the new one will be released in November 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.510
 chapter for 3ds with many new pokémon 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.910
 which have already come to be 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:12.590
 more than 700 in other words it is not finished 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.590
 never to catch them all
