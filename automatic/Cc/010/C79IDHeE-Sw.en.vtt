00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.330
 it would seem to look for practicality in b 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.920
 class is like transporting 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.740
 furniture use trolley and 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.870
 supermarket but ford fusion at one time 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.810
 proved that even a small car 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.560
 can be quite practical truth 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.779
 dress code 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.240
 this hard worker didnâ€™t really fit 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.470
 time so I had to send it 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.080
 well deserved rest 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.170
 as it is known ford b-max replaced 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.809
 fusion models frankly 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.339
 practicality in fusion in class not 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.710
 it was his only problem 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.400
 there was this homely appearance pretty 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.089
 boring 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.239
 interior bimax surpassed fusion 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.890
 practicality and made a great contribution here 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.360
 including kinetic design now 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.699
 the car looks really 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.760
 beautiful and not only outside but also 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.670
 inside the interior is fully consistent 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.799
 corporate style photo design study 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.110
 quality of materials and quantity 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:03.659
 the options available are really impressive 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.700
 considering the class of the car is tight and 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.010
 seat with good lateral support and 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.530
 an abundance of adjustments make landing for 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.580
 driving very comfortable 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.160
 the only thing that can complain 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.930
 drivers whose height is under two meters so this 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.500
 nano is not enough pillow length 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.440
 the seats 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.080
 all the rest will obviously be convenient and 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.810
 spacious including the back row 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.480
 where access is greatly facilitated by 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.580
 perhaps one of 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.710
 the main features yes that there one of 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.760
 main main feature ford b-max 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.420
 is of course a complete absence 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.950
 as you see the central rack of course 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.110
 many of you may say this 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.630
 negative impact on body rigidity 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.190
 because the design is supposedly weakened 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.470
 and accordingly may suffer 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.600
 safety but ford engineers 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.310
 I state that they did a good job. 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.950
 this issue and with security 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.330
 body rigidity all right how are you 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.920
 You understand this claim 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.720
 we can not leave without checking 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.390
 so in order to find out 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.400
 how good is everything here or vice versa 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.100
 not so we will chase 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.630
 this car is relatively uneven 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.640
 surface to grow 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.440
 body load and here's the tank we and 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.810
 check if the doors 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.390
 easy to absolutely open and 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.460
 closing means no skewing no 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:28.170
 and designs really have the right 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:31.530
 stiffness and so as you see we are completely 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.060
 hung the rear wheel to the ground somewhere 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.430
 10-15 centimeters 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.140
 which means that the load on the body is clearly 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.209
 more than when the car is on 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.430
 smooth surface and that's it in such 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.580
 condition we will try as well 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.690
 the doors open and so 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.910
 driver's easy passenger too 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.720
 easy to open and easy to do 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.370
 closes at all without straining 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.720
 by the way do the same with the trunk 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:05.500
 check how it opens in the same way 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.540
 absolutely easy and it closes ie 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.600
 even the slightest hint of curvature 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.700
 no body so it means to believe ford 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.520
 sky stiffness engineers 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.470
 bimax full order actually 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.280
 the middle stand is not completely 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.770
 missing 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.590
 it's just integrated into the door which 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.930
 Made from high strength steel one 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.050
 this kid's safety word was 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.880
 very close attention paid 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.880
 that's why bimax went all 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.950
 crash tests perfectly well 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.350
 lack of a central rack on the body 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.740
 and displays the practicality of such a compact 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.810
 car to a completely different level 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.880
 as we know from the simax rear model 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.230
 sliding door is very convenient with it 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.090
 not only on those become parking for 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.570
 landing-disembarking but also for loading 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.640
 something pretty voluminous but all too 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.209
 notorious lack of central 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.640
 racks 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.950
 makes these opportunities even more and if 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.230
 consider that the seat back folds down 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.000
 it is just incredible 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.750
 space what is called gruz not 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.910
 I want naturally in bimax is provided and 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.100
 comfortable rear seat transformation 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.540
 perhaps the only thing here is not 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.440
 Enough for the highest score 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.390
 practicality 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.660
 so this is the longitudinal adjustment of the rear 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.160
 the couch even though we are already picking on it 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.760
 in this class hardly anyone can 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.169
 boast even such opportunities 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.270
 the trunk is able to accommodate a little more 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.169
 300 liters and with folded rear 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.390
 the seat volume increases almost to 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.970
 1400 the same cargo bay has 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.229
 double gender and this adds to the piggy bank 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.440
 practicality and bimax 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.030
 one more plus considering that it is ford 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.640
 what is synonymous with good 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.890
 manageability to the same bimax case 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.710
 platform with fiesta i as we know fiesta 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.150
 excellent rulitsya turns out that with all 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.569
 its practicality by the magician is able 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.869
 give more pleasure from you 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.869
 not 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.789
 in our case, under the hood installed 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:11.159
 atmospheric four petrol at 1600 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.979
 cubes running in paris 6 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:16.110
 speed robot polashki in our opinion 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.199
 this is probably the most optimal 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.860
 combination for family micro in dynamics 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.729
 enough in the city and beyond 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.400
 automatic box mode allows 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:29.009
 don't think about choosing the right gear that 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.110
 especially like girls but if 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.509
 let's say the head of the family wants to sometimes 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.599
 play racer then for this case 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:39.449
 transmissions there is a manual mode and drive 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:42.150
 at least a little but obviously want to 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:44.280
 flying machine gambling steering 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.800
 pretty accurate yes and at speeds above 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.349
 a hundred kilometers per hour bimax behaves 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.719
 surely really quite frankly 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.560
 the alert system will not fool around 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.599
 stabilization 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.710
 as if hinting that in general it 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:57.870
 family car 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.419
 whose mission is to be safe and 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.849
 comfortable for the last just 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:06.180
 responds perfectly tuned chassis and 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:08.340
 good insulation and so ford b-max 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.139
 proved that even small in appearance 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.479
 the car can be very 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.840
 roomy incredibly practical and 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:16.270
 safe 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.470
 at the same time as a bonus you get 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.570
 great design 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.449
 excellent running characteristics and 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.010
 good level of comfort 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.490
 combination of all these qualities and makes 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.260
 bimax 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.260
 perfect urban family car
