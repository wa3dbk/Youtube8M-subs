00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
not ready we can still see some green

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.770 
not ready we can still see some green
poking<00:00:53.399> through<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.329> we're<00:00:54.449> going<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> leave

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
poking through so we're going to leave

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.479 
poking through so we're going to leave
it<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.140> bit<00:00:55.170> longer<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.309> that's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it for a bit longer you can see that's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.790 
it for a bit longer you can see that's
pretty<00:00:57.480> thoroughly<00:00:57.809> blackened<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> whole

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
pretty thoroughly blackened the whole

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.680 
pretty thoroughly blackened the whole
way<00:00:58.980> around<00:00:59.239> put<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.600> boil<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.410> bowl

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
way around put this in a boil in a bowl

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.520 
way around put this in a boil in a bowl
and<00:01:04.790> keep<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.909> lid<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.350> is

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and keep a lid on it so what this is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.080 
and keep a lid on it so what this is
going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.680> do<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.040> pepper<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.520> pretty<00:01:08.820> hot

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
going to do this pepper is pretty hot

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.750 
going to do this pepper is pretty hot
right<00:01:09.119> now<00:01:09.439> a<00:01:10.439> lot<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.040> steams<00:01:11.400> going<00:01:11.700> to

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
right now a lot of steams going to

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.880 
right now a lot of steams going to
condense<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.390> here<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.810> loosen<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.470> skin

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
condense on here and loosen up the skin

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.010 
condense on here and loosen up the skin
so<00:01:14.460> when<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.850> take<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.180> off<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.630> slips

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
so when we go to take it off it slips

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.580 
so when we go to take it off it slips
off<00:01:16.200> really<00:01:16.530> easily<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:18.720> tomatoes<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.200> don't

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
off really easily the tomatoes you don't

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.960 
off really easily the tomatoes you don't
really<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.310> try<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.729> them<00:01:20.880> on

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
really have to like try to get them on

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.830 
really have to like try to get them on
all<00:01:21.360> four<00:01:22.290> sides<00:01:22.970> really<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> top<00:01:24.600> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
all four sides really just the top and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.010 
all four sides really just the top and
the<00:01:25.200> bottom<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:27.150> you'll<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> tomatoes

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the bottom and you'll see the tomatoes

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.929 
the bottom and you'll see the tomatoes
do<00:01:28.200> go<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> bit<00:01:28.650> faster<00:01:29.070> than<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> peppers<00:01:29.729> do

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
do go a bit faster than the peppers do

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.950 
do go a bit faster than the peppers do
it's<00:01:30.930> beautifully<00:01:31.619> cooked<00:01:33.500> in<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:36.030> bowl<00:01:36.240> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
it's beautifully cooked in the bowl and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.929 
it's beautifully cooked in the bowl and
then<00:01:37.020> if<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.650> look<00:01:37.680> look<00:01:38.430> how<00:01:38.520> fast<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
then if we look look how fast the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.950 
then if we look look how fast the
tomatoes<00:01:39.360> went<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:40.189> fraction<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.369> time<00:01:41.960> you

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
tomatoes went a fraction of the time you

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.380 
tomatoes went a fraction of the time you
can<00:01:43.110> easily<00:01:43.380> see<00:01:43.860> where<00:01:44.159> bit<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.579> skin<00:01:44.939> has

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
can easily see where bit to the skin has

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.109 
can easily see where bit to the skin has
gone<00:01:45.659> from<00:01:45.899> red<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.950> kind<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.399> burnt<00:01:47.820> orange

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
gone from red to kind of a burnt orange

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.600 
gone from red to kind of a burnt orange
color<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:49.320> means<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.710> ready<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.009> slip<00:01:50.399> off

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
color that means it's ready to slip off

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.760 
color that means it's ready to slip off
you<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.930> here<00:01:52.140> next<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.500> some<00:01:52.680> of

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
you can see that in here next to some of

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.859 
you can see that in here next to some of
the<00:01:52.829> black<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.560> bowl<00:01:56.689> we're<00:01:57.689> going<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
the black in the bowl we're going to

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.929 
the black in the bowl we're going to
leave<00:01:58.049> these<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> few<00:01:59.820> minutes

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
leave these like this for a few minutes
