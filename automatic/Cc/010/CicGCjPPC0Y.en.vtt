00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
antenna so yeah um let's see regular in

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.699 
antenna so yeah um let's see regular in
tohoku<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:06.700> fixed<00:03:07.900> variable<00:03:08.900> output

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
tohoku a fixed variable output

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.460 
tohoku a fixed variable output
it's<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.780> manufacture<00:03:11.780> date<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:12.050> believe<00:03:12.080> it

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
it's the manufacture date I believe it

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.570 
it's the manufacture date I believe it
was<00:03:12.650> something<00:03:13.340> like<00:03:14.230> 1979<00:03:15.230> not<00:03:15.650> sure<00:03:15.880> um<00:03:18.580> now

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
was something like 1979 not sure um now

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.390 
was something like 1979 not sure um now
down<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.300> the<00:03:20.450> amp<00:03:22.239> it's<00:03:23.239> got<00:03:23.420> one<00:03:23.800> AC<00:03:24.800> plug<00:03:25.220> in

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
down to the amp it's got one AC plug in

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.199 
down to the amp it's got one AC plug in
there

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
there

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.470 
there
JVC<00:03:26.810> as<00:03:27.080> I<00:03:27.230> believe<00:03:27.530> two<00:03:27.830> or<00:03:28.010> three

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.199 

let's<00:03:32.480> see<00:03:32.630> regular<00:03:33.640> inputs<00:03:34.640> and<00:03:34.790> outputs

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
let's see regular inputs and outputs

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.470 
let's see regular inputs and outputs
actually<00:03:35.780> pretty<00:03:36.019> much<00:03:36.170> as<00:03:36.320> input<00:03:37.190> some<00:03:37.519> much

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
actually pretty much as input some much

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.740 
actually pretty much as input some much
more<00:03:38.660> cleaner<00:03:38.900> than<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.200> JVC<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.800> course<00:03:40.100> and

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
more cleaner than the JVC of course and

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.820 
more cleaner than the JVC of course and
speaker<00:03:42.190> outputs<00:03:43.190> right<00:03:43.340> here<00:03:43.489> front<00:03:43.790> rear

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
speaker outputs right here front rear

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.430 
speaker outputs right here front rear
rear<00:03:45.830> I<00:03:45.860> never<00:03:46.160> noticed<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:47.049> but<00:03:48.049> anyways

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
rear I never noticed that but anyways

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.170 
rear I never noticed that but anyways
yeah<00:03:48.650> that's<00:03:48.860> pretty<00:03:49.010> much<00:03:49.130> it

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
yeah that's pretty much it

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.470 
yeah that's pretty much it
I'll<00:03:50.630> have<00:03:50.810> it<00:03:50.840> hooked<00:03:51.049> up<00:03:51.290> to<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.500> speaker

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
I'll have it hooked up to a speaker

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.620 
I'll have it hooked up to a speaker
maybe<00:03:53.739> tomorrow<00:03:54.739> or<00:03:54.799> something<00:03:55.390> well<00:03:56.390> I

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
maybe tomorrow or something well I

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.940 
maybe tomorrow or something well I
already<00:03:56.840> had<00:03:57.080> it<00:03:57.200> hooked<00:03:57.290> up<00:03:57.470> but<00:03:57.620> I<00:03:57.709> took<00:03:57.769> it

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
already had it hooked up but I took it

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.620 
already had it hooked up but I took it
apart<00:03:58.160> just<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.400> do<00:03:58.489> this<00:03:58.640> video<00:03:58.790> because<00:03:59.180> I

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
apart just to do this video because I

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.550 
apart just to do this video because I
didn't<00:04:00.350> have<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.560> proper<00:04:01.090> cables<00:04:02.440> you<00:04:03.440> know

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
didn't have the proper cables you know

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.190 
didn't have the proper cables you know
so<00:04:03.980> it<00:04:04.040> didn't<00:04:04.489> work<00:04:04.640> very<00:04:04.670> well<00:04:05.090> but<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:05.959> still

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
so it didn't work very well but it still

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.150 
so it didn't work very well but it still
sounded<00:04:06.500> better<00:04:06.680> than<00:04:06.739> JVC<00:04:07.450> but<00:04:08.450> yeah

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
sounded better than JVC but yeah

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.259 
sounded better than JVC but yeah
currently<00:04:10.160> my<00:04:10.310> JVC<00:04:10.700> is<00:04:10.850> sitting<00:04:11.090> right<00:04:11.239> over

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
currently my JVC is sitting right over

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:19.539 
currently my JVC is sitting right over
there

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.129 

and<00:04:20.549> so<00:04:20.880> yeah<00:04:21.060> that's<00:04:21.299> pretty<00:04:21.510> much<00:04:21.600> it<00:04:21.720> have

will be getting a Samsung receiver
similar<00:04:30.660> to<00:04:30.780> this<00:04:30.900> from<00:04:31.680> my<00:04:32.580> teacher<00:04:32.820> um

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
similar to this from my teacher um

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.420 
similar to this from my teacher um
another<00:04:33.990> thing<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.320> talk<00:04:34.500> about<00:04:34.680> these<00:04:34.830> two

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
another thing to talk about these two

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.500 
another thing to talk about these two
units<00:04:36.180> here<00:04:36.650> back<00:04:37.650> then<00:04:38.000> my<00:04:39.000> teacher<00:04:39.180> told<00:04:39.419> me

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
units here back then my teacher told me

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.790 
units here back then my teacher told me
this<00:04:39.740> they<00:04:40.740> kind<00:04:40.979> of<00:04:41.100> copied<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:42.500> design<00:04:43.500> of

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
this they kind of copied the design of

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.840 
this they kind of copied the design of
Pioneer<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:45.050> you<00:04:46.050> know<00:04:46.199> it<00:04:46.860> turned<00:04:47.310> out<00:04:47.460> great

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
Pioneer and you know it turned out great

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.909 
Pioneer and you know it turned out great
but<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:48.780> guess<00:04:49.169> they<00:04:49.290> stopped<00:04:49.530> making<00:04:49.830> them

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
but I guess they stopped making them

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.920 
but I guess they stopped making them
because<00:04:50.160> not<00:04:50.580> too<00:04:50.729> many<00:04:50.850> people<00:04:51.060> I'm<00:04:51.540> not<00:04:51.720> sure
