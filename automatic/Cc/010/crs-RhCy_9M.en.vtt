00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
is the FAMAS gonna be at that amazing

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.590 
is the FAMAS gonna be at that amazing
thousand<00:00:19.920> RPM<00:00:20.430> which<00:00:20.699> makes<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.270> weapon

thousand RPM which makes that weapon

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.390 
thousand RPM which makes that weapon
unique<00:00:21.869> they're<00:00:22.320> bringing<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.740> down<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.369> I

believe 900 I'm not a hunter percent

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.759 
believe 900 I'm not a hunter percent
certain<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:26.970> 900<00:00:27.689> stat<00:00:28.140> because<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.619> is

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
certain on that 900 stat because this is

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.169 
certain on that 900 stat because this is
the<00:00:28.890> CTE<00:00:29.189> server<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> little

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the CTE server and it is a little

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.389 
the CTE server and it is a little
difficult<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.869> pinpoint<00:00:31.410> or<00:00:31.590> exact<00:00:32.009> stats

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
difficult to get pinpoint or exact stats

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.549 
difficult to get pinpoint or exact stats
but<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.000> did<00:00:33.180> test<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.540> from<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.110> original

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
but I did test it from the original

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.780 
but I did test it from the original
battle<00:00:34.800> before<00:00:34.920> what<00:00:35.250> everyone<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.640> playing

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
battle before what everyone is playing

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.580 
battle before what everyone is playing
right<00:00:36.000> now<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.600> FAMAS<00:00:37.020> compared<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
right now and that FAMAS compared to the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.639 
right now and that FAMAS compared to the
CTE<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.370> CTE<00:00:38.730> version<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.899> has<00:00:40.110> been

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
CTE the CTE version and it has been

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.979 
CTE the CTE version and it has been
reduced<00:00:41.280> when<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.000> first<00:00:42.300> learned<00:00:42.570> about<00:00:42.690> these

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
reduced when I first learned about these

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.869 
reduced when I first learned about these
changes<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.739> was<00:00:44.070> like<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.340> hell<00:00:44.610> guys

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
changes I was like what the hell guys

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.420 
changes I was like what the hell guys
come<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.390> like<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> FAMAS<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.469> cz<00:00:46.680> 3a1

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
come on like the FAMAS and the cz 3a1

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.940 
come on like the FAMAS and the cz 3a1
yes<00:00:47.940> they<00:00:48.180> had<00:00:48.360> amazing<00:00:48.870> kill<00:00:49.320> potential<00:00:49.770> up

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
yes they had amazing kill potential up

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.920 
yes they had amazing kill potential up
close<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.550> thousand<00:00:51.149> rpm<00:00:51.570> was

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
close like that thousand rpm was

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.619 
close like that thousand rpm was
incredibly<00:00:52.530> deadly<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.039> those<00:00:53.250> circumstances

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
incredibly deadly in those circumstances

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.880 
incredibly deadly in those circumstances
but<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> also<00:00:54.840> required<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.379> lot<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.559> skill<00:00:55.860> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
but it also required a lot of skill to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.799 
but it also required a lot of skill to
use<00:00:56.070> those<00:00:56.489> guns<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.120> don't<00:00:57.270> think<00:00:57.449> anyone

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
use those guns like I don't think anyone

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.150 
use those guns like I don't think anyone
in<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.020> battlefield<00:00:58.410> community<00:00:58.559> was

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
in the battlefield community was

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.040 
in the battlefield community was
complaining<00:00:59.730> about<00:00:59.850> these<00:01:00.120> two<00:01:00.359> weapons<00:01:00.570> like

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
complaining about these two weapons like

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.110 
complaining about these two weapons like
sure<00:01:01.379> they<00:01:01.859> were<00:01:01.920> amazing<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:02.969> they<00:01:03.059> were

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
sure they were amazing but they were

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.270 
sure they were amazing but they were
also<00:01:03.270> required<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.870> lot<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.110> finesse<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> lot

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
also required a lot of finesse and a lot

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.640 
also required a lot of finesse and a lot
of<00:01:05.309> skill<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.820> do<00:01:05.970> well<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.420> them<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.439> my

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
of skill to do well with them and so my

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.410 
of skill to do well with them and so my
first<00:01:07.799> reaction<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:09.030> was<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.360> a

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
first reaction was that this was just a

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.240 
first reaction was that this was just a
blatant<00:01:09.810> nerf<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.170> couldn't<00:01:10.560> understand<00:01:11.040> why

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
blatant nerf I couldn't understand why

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.469 
blatant nerf I couldn't understand why
and<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.640> didn't<00:01:11.939> think<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.150> they<00:01:12.270> were<00:01:12.360> gonna

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
and I didn't think that they were gonna

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.359 
and I didn't think that they were gonna
compensate<00:01:13.140> for<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.590> reduction<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
compensate for this reduction in the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.170 
compensate for this reduction in the
rounds-per-minute

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
rounds-per-minute

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.010 
rounds-per-minute
that<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.470> not<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.189> case<00:01:17.400> at<00:01:17.759> all<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.570> FAMAS

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
that is not the case at all the FAMAS

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.620 
that is not the case at all the FAMAS
right<00:01:19.409> now<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:20.159> these<00:01:20.400> changes<00:01:20.820> could

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
right now with these changes could

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.200 
right now with these changes could
possibly<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.439> one<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.310> best<00:01:23.700> weapons<00:01:23.939> in

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
possibly be one of the best weapons in

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.850 
possibly be one of the best weapons in
the<00:01:24.330> game<00:01:24.479> right<00:01:24.689> now<00:01:24.750> at<00:01:25.049> least<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.530> CTE

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the game right now at least on the CTE

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.280 
the game right now at least on the CTE
server<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.880> instead<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.210> having<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.930> normal

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
server so instead of having the normal

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.499 
server so instead of having the normal
26<00:01:28.799> rounds<00:01:29.009> which<00:01:29.430> makes<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.939> which<00:01:30.180> made<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
26 rounds which makes the which made the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.260 
26 rounds which makes the which made the
FAMAS<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.020> unique<00:01:31.380> they<00:01:31.770> bumped<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.159> up<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> 31

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
FAMAS so unique they bumped it up to 31

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.880 
FAMAS so unique they bumped it up to 31
so<00:01:33.509> basically<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.170> standard<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.740> all

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
so basically the standard that all

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.469 
so basically the standard that all
assault<00:01:35.220> rifles<00:01:35.549> have<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.030> they've<00:01:36.299> also

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
assault rifles have and they've also

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.749 
assault rifles have and they've also
reduced<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.259> recoil<00:01:37.740> where<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.430> thing<00:01:38.729> is

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
reduced the recoil where this thing is

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.330 
reduced the recoil where this thing is
laser<00:01:39.630> beam<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.320> accurate<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.189> don't

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
laser beam like accurate and you don't

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.980 
laser beam like accurate and you don't
even<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.820> deal<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.000> any<00:01:42.420> horizontal

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
even have to deal with any horizontal

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.740 
even have to deal with any horizontal
recoil<00:01:43.470> at<00:01:43.829> all<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.220> shot<00:01:44.850> at<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> wall<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.659> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
recoil at all I shot at a wall just a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.510 
recoil at all I shot at a wall just a
blank<00:01:46.020> wall<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.530> front<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.829> me<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.399> goes

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
blank wall in front of me and it goes

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.880 
blank wall in front of me and it goes
almost<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.210> hundred<00:01:48.360> percent<00:01:48.600> straight<00:01:49.500> up<00:01:49.680> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
almost a hundred percent straight up and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.770 
almost a hundred percent straight up and
down<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.369> here's<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.790> comparison<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:51.570> it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
down and here's a comparison of what it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.840 
down and here's a comparison of what it
is<00:01:51.810> right<00:01:52.170> now<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.710> normal<00:01:53.009> server<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.670> got

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
is right now on normal server it's got

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.580 
is right now on normal server it's got
that<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.540> know<00:01:54.570> up<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> right

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
that you know up and then to the right

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.240 
that you know up and then to the right
and<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.640> CTE<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.899> thing<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.560> crazy

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
and so for CTE this thing is crazy

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.609 
and so for CTE this thing is crazy
accurate<00:02:00.119> it's<00:02:00.689> still<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.140> course<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.590> going

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
accurate it's still of course not going

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.590 
accurate it's still of course not going
to<00:02:01.979> out-compete<00:02:02.399> something<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.360> star

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
to out-compete something like the star

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.359 
to out-compete something like the star
are<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.930> lower<00:02:04.200> round<00:02:04.469> per<00:02:04.649> minute<00:02:04.890> guns<00:02:05.100> at<00:02:05.340> a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.459 
are the lower round per minute guns at a
distance<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.810> would<00:02:06.930> assume<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.229> there

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
distance but you would assume that there

distance but you would assume that there
would<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.680> little<00:02:07.979> bit<00:02:08.160> more<00:02:08.280> recoil<00:02:08.489> that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
would be a little bit more recoil that

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.130 
would be a little bit more recoil that
you<00:02:08.940> would<00:02:09.030> have<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.270> compensate<00:02:09.539> for<00:02:09.869> for<00:02:10.110> a

guns<00:03:08.620> feel<00:03:08.890> unique<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.549> would<00:03:09.940> hope<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.150> they

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
guns feel unique I would hope that they

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.569 
guns feel unique I would hope that they
wouldn't<00:03:10.690> go<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.200> easy<00:03:11.410> way<00:03:11.769> out<00:03:11.799> just<00:03:12.400> not

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
wouldn't go the easy way out just not

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.369 
wouldn't go the easy way out just not
being<00:03:12.819> able<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.120> fix<00:03:13.390> their<00:03:13.599> net<00:03:13.840> code<00:03:14.049> because

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
being able to fix their net code because

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.170 
being able to fix their net code because
clearly<00:03:14.620> if<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.069> is<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.340> issue<00:03:15.489> it<00:03:15.790> is<00:03:15.819> a<00:03:15.940> net

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
clearly if that is the issue it is a net

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.000 
clearly if that is the issue it is a net
code<00:03:16.359> problem<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:16.959> not<00:03:17.079> a<00:03:17.109> weapon<00:03:17.380> problem

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
code problem and not a weapon problem

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.879 
code problem and not a weapon problem
and<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.910> they<00:03:19.180> go<00:03:19.690> back<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.319> original

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
and that they go back to the original

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.890 
and that they go back to the original
way<00:03:21.040> that<00:03:21.250> these<00:03:21.370> guns<00:03:21.670> performed<00:03:22.299> because

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
way that these guns performed because

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.390 
way that these guns performed because
they<00:03:23.049> were<00:03:23.109> so<00:03:23.440> unique<00:03:23.739> like<00:03:23.769> they<00:03:24.069> fit<00:03:24.370> a

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
they were so unique like they fit a

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.610 
they were so unique like they fit a
niche<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:25.239> a<00:03:25.299> lot<00:03:25.600> of<00:03:25.630> other<00:03:25.870> guns<00:03:26.200> just

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
niche that a lot of other guns just

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.309 
niche that a lot of other guns just
simply<00:03:27.069> don't<00:03:27.310> fulfill<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.510> have<00:03:28.720> them<00:03:29.079> be

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
simply don't fulfill and to have them be

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.990 
simply don't fulfill and to have them be
changed<00:03:29.859> simply<00:03:30.250> because<00:03:30.549> they're<00:03:30.730> not<00:03:30.849> able

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
changed simply because they're not able

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.449 
changed simply because they're not able
to<00:03:31.150> get<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.389> netcode<00:03:31.750> fixed<00:03:32.680> would<00:03:33.250> be<00:03:33.430> a

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
to get the netcode fixed would be a

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.849 
to get the netcode fixed would be a
little<00:03:33.849> disappointing<00:03:34.660> this<00:03:35.349> brings<00:03:35.560> me<00:03:35.650> to

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
little disappointing this brings me to

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.050 
little disappointing this brings me to
the<00:03:35.950> next<00:03:36.069> topic<00:03:36.220> that<00:03:36.579> I<00:03:36.639> wanted<00:03:36.819> to<00:03:36.880> talk

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
the next topic that I wanted to talk

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.349 
the next topic that I wanted to talk
about<00:03:37.090> is<00:03:37.599> yeah<00:03:38.349> these<00:03:38.980> guns<00:03:39.340> are<00:03:39.549> no<00:03:40.000> longer

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
about is yeah these guns are no longer

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.690 
about is yeah these guns are no longer
unique<00:03:40.810> anymore<00:03:41.440> like<00:03:41.620> what<00:03:41.889> made<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.430> the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
unique anymore like what made the the

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.409 
unique anymore like what made the the
FAMAS<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.599> cz<00:03:43.959> 3<00:03:44.200> a1<00:03:44.319> and<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.799> mp7<00:03:45.160> unique<00:03:45.849> was

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
FAMAS the cz 3 a1 and the mp7 unique was

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.089 
FAMAS the cz 3 a1 and the mp7 unique was
that<00:03:46.450> higher<00:03:46.810> rounds<00:03:47.230> per<00:03:47.440> minute<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.980> the

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
that higher rounds per minute and the

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.589 
that higher rounds per minute and the
higher<00:03:48.310> amount<00:03:48.669> of<00:03:48.760> recoil<00:03:49.180> like<00:03:49.419> if<00:03:49.540> you

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
higher amount of recoil like if you

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.539 
higher amount of recoil like if you
wanted<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:49.959> do<00:03:50.049> well<00:03:50.319> with<00:03:50.500> those<00:03:50.650> weapons<00:03:50.859> you

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
wanted to do well with those weapons you

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.370 
wanted to do well with those weapons you
had<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.790> compensate<00:03:52.299> for<00:03:52.450> that<00:03:52.599> recoil<00:03:52.989> but<00:03:53.290> if

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
had a compensate for that recoil but if

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.720 
had a compensate for that recoil but if
you<00:03:53.500> were<00:03:53.620> able<00:03:53.799> to<00:03:53.919> master<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:54.579> you<00:03:54.639> were

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
you were able to master it and you were

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.059 
you were able to master it and you were
able<00:03:54.880> to<00:03:55.060> lock<00:03:55.630> these<00:03:55.840> weapons<00:03:56.319> down<00:03:56.530> you

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
able to lock these weapons down you

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.559 
able to lock these weapons down you
could<00:03:57.220> have<00:03:57.400> some<00:03:57.639> incredible<00:03:58.060> kill<00:03:58.269> streaks

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
could have some incredible kill streaks

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.720 
could have some incredible kill streaks
I've<00:03:59.109> mentioned<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.590> past<00:03:59.799> that<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.400> FAMAS

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
I've mentioned the past that the FAMAS

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.789 
I've mentioned the past that the FAMAS
is<00:04:01.060> is<00:04:01.450> one<00:04:01.720> of<00:04:01.840> my<00:04:01.900> favourite<00:04:02.290> weapons<00:04:02.620> in<00:04:02.739> the

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
is is one of my favourite weapons in the

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:03.180 
is is one of my favourite weapons in the
game

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
game

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.620 
game
I've<00:04:03.280> almost<00:04:03.430> got<00:04:03.579> a<00:04:03.700> thousand<00:04:04.180> kills<00:04:04.389> with<00:04:04.599> it

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
I've almost got a thousand kills with it

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.360 
I've almost got a thousand kills with it
it's<00:04:04.900> one<00:04:05.109> of<00:04:05.230> my<00:04:05.319> top<00:04:05.380> tier<00:04:05.799> guns<00:04:06.160> in

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
it's one of my top tier guns in

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.280 
it's one of my top tier guns in
battlefield<00:04:06.760> 4<00:04:06.819> but<00:04:07.569> as<00:04:07.660> soon<00:04:07.870> as<00:04:07.989> you<00:04:08.109> drop

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
battlefield 4 but as soon as you drop

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.159

that<00:04:08.560> rpm<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.250> 900<00:04:09.970> you<00:04:10.150> make<00:04:10.329> its<00:04:10.540> recoil<00:04:10.930> more

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
that rpm to 900 you make its recoil more

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.960 
that rpm to 900 you make its recoil more
manageable<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:11.739> you<00:04:11.799> put<00:04:11.950> 31<00:04:12.370> rounds<00:04:12.579> in<00:04:12.819> its

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970

here<00:04:25.569> and<00:04:25.749> there<00:04:25.930> I<00:04:26.169> get<00:04:26.740> it<00:04:26.919> it<00:04:27.129> is<00:04:27.159> gonna<00:04:27.400> be

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
here and there I get it it is gonna be

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.550 
here and there I get it it is gonna be
difficult<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.270> make<00:04:28.449> it<00:04:28.599> every<00:04:29.020> single<00:04:29.379> weapon

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
difficult to make it every single weapon

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.709 
difficult to make it every single weapon
in<00:04:29.830> battlefield<00:04:30.129> unique<00:04:30.849> and<00:04:31.120> different

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:31.719 
in battlefield unique and different

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:33.570 
in battlefield unique and different
because<00:04:32.020> you<00:04:32.169> want<00:04:32.409> to<00:04:32.499> have<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.949> some<00:04:33.129> variety

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
because you want to have of some variety

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.390 
because you want to have of some variety
there<00:04:33.819> but<00:04:34.210> also<00:04:34.590> competitive<00:04:35.590> you<00:04:35.889> have<00:04:35.919> so

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
there but also competitive you have so

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.769 
there but also competitive you have so
many<00:04:36.580> weapons<00:04:36.819> in<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.180> game<00:04:37.210> where<00:04:37.659> it's

00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:37.779 
many weapons in the game where it's

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:39.689 
many weapons in the game where it's
almost<00:04:38.050> impossible<00:04:38.379> like<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:39.219> best<00:04:39.340> example

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
almost impossible like the best example

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.269 
almost impossible like the best example
that<00:04:39.759> I<00:04:39.909> can<00:04:39.969> think<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.389> is<00:04:40.569> the<00:04:41.289> type<00:04:41.499> 95<00:04:42.009> be

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:42.279 
that I can think of is the type 95 be

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:45.029 
that I can think of is the type 95 be
it's<00:04:42.759> a<00:04:42.939> carbine<00:04:43.389> with<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.020> slow<00:04:44.319> rounds<00:04:44.800> per

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
it's a carbine with the slow rounds per

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:45.390 
it's a carbine with the slow rounds per
minute

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
minute

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.550 
minute
it's<00:04:45.580> got<00:04:45.729> great<00:04:45.939> hipfire<00:04:46.449> accuracy<00:04:46.840> but

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
it's got great hipfire accuracy but

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.679 
it's got great hipfire accuracy but
those<00:04:47.800> stats<00:04:48.249> together<00:04:48.879> don't<00:04:49.360> make<00:04:49.509> any

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:49.689 
those stats together don't make any

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.080 
those stats together don't make any
sense<00:04:49.960> like<00:04:50.289> slow<00:04:50.529> rpm<00:04:50.770> great<00:04:51.370> recoil<00:04:51.879> you

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
sense like slow rpm great recoil you

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.339 
sense like slow rpm great recoil you
would<00:04:52.330> think<00:04:52.479> it'd<00:04:52.599> be<00:04:52.629> good<00:04:52.779> at<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:52.930> distance

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
would think it'd be good at a distance

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:55.260 
would think it'd be good at a distance
it's<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.830> carbine<00:04:54.249> it<00:04:54.430> has<00:04:54.580> a<00:04:54.610> reduced<00:04:54.909> damage

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
it's a carbine it has a reduced damage

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.450 
it's a carbine it has a reduced damage
model<00:04:55.539> at<00:04:55.629> a<00:04:55.659> distance<00:04:56.110> slow<00:04:56.740> rpm<00:04:56.979> great

challenge to the type 95 be is gonna be

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.379 
challenge to the type 95 be is gonna be
right<00:05:11.889> up<00:05:12.039> your<00:05:12.069> alley<00:05:12.219> but<00:05:13.000> it's<00:05:13.120> not<00:05:13.360> a

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
right up your alley but it's not a

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.809 
right up your alley but it's not a
competitive<00:05:13.960> weapon<00:05:14.139> and<00:05:14.529> so<00:05:14.710> I<00:05:14.740> do<00:05:15.219> get<00:05:15.669> it

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:15.819 
competitive weapon and so I do get it

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:18.689 
competitive weapon and so I do get it
from<00:05:16.000> a<00:05:16.120> design<00:05:16.319> standpoint<00:05:17.430> making<00:05:18.430> the

from a design standpoint making the

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:19.980 
from a design standpoint making the
thousands<00:05:19.270> of<00:05:19.300> different<00:05:19.389> weapons<00:05:19.870> in

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
thousands of different weapons in

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.019 
thousands of different weapons in
battlefield<00:05:20.289> 4<00:05:20.500> unique<00:05:21.219> and<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:21.849> well

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:22.029 
battlefield 4 unique and and well

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.420 
battlefield 4 unique and and well
balanced<00:05:22.539> is<00:05:22.629> not<00:05:22.990> an<00:05:23.169> easy<00:05:23.319> task<00:05:23.589> and<00:05:23.949> that's

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
balanced is not an easy task and that's

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.730 
balanced is not an easy task and that's
the<00:05:24.550> reason<00:05:24.819> why<00:05:24.969> I'm<00:05:25.330> a<00:05:25.389> little<00:05:25.599> annoyed<00:05:26.439> that

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
the reason why I'm a little annoyed that

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.769 
the reason why I'm a little annoyed that
you<00:05:26.919> have<00:05:27.129> these<00:05:27.339> unique<00:05:27.639> weapons<00:05:28.120> like<00:05:28.360> these

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:28.779 
you have these unique weapons like these

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:29.909 
you have these unique weapons like these
three<00:05:29.080> guns<00:05:29.319> that<00:05:29.500> we're<00:05:29.620> talking<00:05:29.740> about

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
three guns that we're talking about

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:30.269 
three guns that we're talking about
today

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:30.279 
today

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.490 
today
we're<00:05:30.789> unique<00:05:31.210> they<00:05:31.539> had<00:05:31.689> their<00:05:31.930> niche<00:05:32.169> they

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
we're unique they had their niche they

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.019 
we're unique they had their niche they
were<00:05:32.560> great<00:05:32.830> for<00:05:32.979> a<00:05:33.009> close<00:05:33.159> encounter<00:05:33.189> combat

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:34.029 
were great for a close encounter combat

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.390 
were great for a close encounter combat
but<00:05:34.449> now<00:05:34.599> that<00:05:34.779> you've<00:05:34.900> reduced<00:05:35.229> that<00:05:35.439> rpm

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
but now that you've reduced that rpm

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.879 
but now that you've reduced that rpm
they<00:05:37.089> just<00:05:37.360> feel<00:05:37.659> like<00:05:38.050> other<00:05:38.259> guns<00:05:38.560> in<00:05:38.770> the

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
they just feel like other guns in the

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.679 
they just feel like other guns in the
game<00:05:38.919> and<00:05:39.370> they<00:05:39.490> don't<00:05:39.729> bring<00:05:40.060> anything<00:05:40.449> new

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:40.689 
game and they don't bring anything new

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:43.800 
game and they don't bring anything new
to<00:05:40.960> the<00:05:41.199> table<00:05:41.560> and<00:05:42.099> so<00:05:42.669> I<00:05:43.029> guess<00:05:43.509> this<00:05:43.689> is

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
to the table and so I guess this is

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.999 
to the table and so I guess this is
where<00:05:43.899> I'd<00:05:44.020> like<00:05:44.139> to<00:05:44.259> get<00:05:44.349> your<00:05:44.500> guys's<00:05:44.830> take

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:45.009 
where I'd like to get your guys's take

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:47.309 
where I'd like to get your guys's take
on<00:05:45.189> this<00:05:45.460> do<00:05:45.819> you<00:05:46.120> like<00:05:46.419> the<00:05:46.659> adjustments<00:05:47.259> that

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
on this do you like the adjustments that

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.499 
on this do you like the adjustments that
they've<00:05:47.529> made<00:05:47.740> to<00:05:47.770> the<00:05:48.129> FAMAS<00:05:48.520> for<00:05:48.819> example<00:05:49.330> I

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 
they've made to the FAMAS for example I

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:51.719 
they've made to the FAMAS for example I
mean<00:05:49.870> personally<00:05:50.289> I<00:05:50.319> think<00:05:50.500> that<00:05:50.889> overall<00:05:51.279> it

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
mean personally I think that overall it

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:53.279 
mean personally I think that overall it
is<00:05:51.939> a<00:05:51.969> better<00:05:52.210> weapon<00:05:52.689> than<00:05:52.719> it<00:05:52.930> was<00:05:53.110> before

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
is a better weapon than it was before

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.860 
is a better weapon than it was before
like<00:05:54.009> yes<00:05:54.370> it<00:05:54.669> doesn't<00:05:55.029> have<00:05:55.180> that<00:05:55.210> instant

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
like yes it doesn't have that instant

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.719 
like yes it doesn't have that instant
kill<00:05:56.080> potential<00:05:56.409> it<00:05:56.740> just<00:05:56.919> it<00:05:57.189> doesn't<00:05:57.339> rip

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
kill potential it just it doesn't rip

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.369 
kill potential it just it doesn't rip
through<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.240> enemies<00:05:58.569> as<00:05:58.719> quickly<00:05:58.930> as<00:05:59.139> it<00:05:59.259> did

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
through the enemies as quickly as it did

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:01.860 
through the enemies as quickly as it did
before<00:05:59.500> but<00:05:59.979> just<00:06:00.610> overall<00:06:01.029> like<00:06:01.539> in<00:06:01.750> the

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
before but just overall like in the

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.019 
before but just overall like in the
grand<00:06:02.139> scheme<00:06:02.349> of<00:06:02.620> things<00:06:02.860> it's<00:06:03.339> a<00:06:03.490> better<00:06:03.699> gun

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:04.029 
grand scheme of things it's a better gun

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:06.360 
grand scheme of things it's a better gun
in<00:06:04.300> every<00:06:04.509> type<00:06:05.139> of<00:06:05.169> combat<00:06:05.740> scenario<00:06:06.279> it

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
in every type of combat scenario it

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.139 
in every type of combat scenario it
doesn't<00:06:06.610> matter<00:06:06.729> if<00:06:06.849> they're<00:06:06.969> medium
