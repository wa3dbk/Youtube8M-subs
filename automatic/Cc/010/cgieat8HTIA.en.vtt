put um max soft / paint pot and it does
show<00:04:28.780> up<00:04:28.900> I<00:04:29.080> thought<00:04:29.230> pretty<00:04:29.620> well<00:04:29.740> but<00:04:30.400> I

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
show up I thought pretty well but I

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.940 
show up I thought pretty well but I
really<00:04:30.940> like<00:04:31.150> this<00:04:31.390> brown<00:04:31.750> color<00:04:32.140> it's<00:04:32.740> very

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
really like this brown color it's very

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.240 
really like this brown color it's very
soft<00:04:35.580> there<00:04:36.580> it<00:04:36.730> is<00:04:36.760> right<00:04:37.240> there<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:39.010> think

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
soft there it is right there and I think

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.570 
soft there it is right there and I think
this<00:04:39.370> set<00:04:39.610> was<00:04:39.760> 299<00:04:40.630> or<00:04:41.100> somewhere<00:04:42.100> around<00:04:42.310> the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
this set was 299 or somewhere around the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.600 
this set was 299 or somewhere around the
three<00:04:42.790> dollar<00:04:42.940> range<00:04:43.180> my<00:04:44.020> advice<00:04:44.260> is<00:04:44.290> this<00:04:44.740> if

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
three dollar range my advice is this if

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.970 
three dollar range my advice is this if
you're<00:04:46.570> starting<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.170> get<00:04:47.260> into<00:04:47.500> makeup<00:04:47.590> and

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
you're starting to get into makeup and

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.170 
you're starting to get into makeup and
you<00:04:48.070> want<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.310> experiment<00:04:48.640> with<00:04:48.790> a<00:04:48.910> lot<00:04:49.090> of

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
you want to experiment with a lot of

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.780 
you want to experiment with a lot of
colors<00:04:49.570> you're<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.500> teenager<00:04:50.920> or<00:04:51.490> you<00:04:51.670> just

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
colors you're a teenager or you just

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.520

don't<00:04:51.910> have<00:04:52.030> a<00:04:52.120> lot<00:04:52.150> of<00:04:52.240> money<00:04:52.330> I<00:04:52.780> think<00:04:53.440> this

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
don't have a lot of money I think this

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.790 
don't have a lot of money I think this
line<00:04:53.740> is<00:04:53.950> definitely<00:04:54.520> worth<00:04:55.180> it<00:04:55.390> just<00:04:55.630> to<00:04:55.840> get

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
line is definitely worth it just to get

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.580 
line is definitely worth it just to get
into<00:04:57.070> makeup<00:04:57.220> and<00:04:57.700> play<00:04:57.940> with<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.180> colors<00:04:58.330> and
