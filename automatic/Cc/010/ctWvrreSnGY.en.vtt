the super poser we were to look closely

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.570 
the super poser we were to look closely
at<00:01:38.509> his<00:01:38.690> eyes<00:01:38.979> they're<00:01:39.979> not<00:01:40.070> completely

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
at his eyes they're not completely

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.520 
at his eyes they're not completely
painted<00:01:41.300> in<00:01:41.569> at<00:01:41.959> least<00:01:42.140> on<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:42.380> one<00:01:44.470> now<00:01:45.470> the

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
painted in at least on this one now the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.219 
painted in at least on this one now the
buck<00:01:45.800> night<00:01:46.479> and<00:01:48.009> just<00:01:49.009> like<00:01:49.580> Sonic<00:01:50.330> he<00:01:51.050> looks

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
buck night and just like Sonic he looks

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.210 
buck night and just like Sonic he looks
exactly<00:01:51.560> like<00:01:51.770> Sonic<00:01:52.280> singing<00:01:52.940> my<00:01:53.030> problem

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
exactly like Sonic singing my problem

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.620 
exactly like Sonic singing my problem
except<00:01:55.220> though<00:01:55.369> he<00:01:55.550> has<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.700> metal<00:01:55.940> glove

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.200 

near<00:02:08.590> sonic

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.150 

he's<00:02:12.210> still<00:02:12.960> even<00:02:13.260> put<00:02:13.440> treads<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.010> one

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
he's still even put treads on this one

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.080 
he's still even put treads on this one
as<00:02:14.250> well<00:02:14.960> move<00:02:15.960> is<00:02:16.050> exactly<00:02:16.500> like<00:02:16.590> Sonic<00:02:17.250> just

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
as well move is exactly like Sonic just

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.430 
as well move is exactly like Sonic just
with<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.870> glove<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.470> sword<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:21.630> now<00:02:22.200> with

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
with the glove and sword and now with

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.680 
with the glove and sword and now with
tails<00:02:28.130> probably<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.250> best<00:02:29.460> this<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.450> best

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
tails probably the best this is the best

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.490 
tails probably the best this is the best
tails<00:02:30.960> figure<00:02:31.260> as<00:02:31.380> I've<00:02:31.530> seen<00:02:33.410> except<00:02:34.410> though

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
tails figure as I've seen except though

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.710 
tails figure as I've seen except though
he<00:02:34.650> got<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.920> kind<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.310> big<00:02:35.460> ears<00:02:35.760> well<00:02:36.600> that

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
he got the kind of big ears well that

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.770 
he got the kind of big ears well that
doesn't<00:02:36.990> really<00:02:37.020> matter<00:02:38.180> here<00:02:39.180> are<00:02:39.330> his<00:02:39.450> tails

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
doesn't really matter here are his tails

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.420 
doesn't really matter here are his tails
and<00:02:41.150> well<00:02:42.150> turns<00:02:42.959> out<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.170> tails<00:02:43.380> don't<00:02:43.800> twist

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
and well turns out the tails don't twist

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.199 
and well turns out the tails don't twist
they<00:02:45.240> originally<00:02:45.930> up<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.950> tip<00:02:47.370> right<00:02:47.790> here

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
they originally up the tip right here

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.000 
they originally up the tip right here
was<00:02:48.780> originally<00:02:49.290> up<00:02:49.440> here<00:02:49.680> at<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.800> head<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:52.010> I

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
was originally up here at the head and I

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.530 
was originally up here at the head and I
thought<00:02:53.220> they<00:02:53.459> could<00:02:53.490> twist<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.180> broke<00:02:54.390> them

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
thought they could twist and broke them

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.240 
thought they could twist and broke them
so<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.810> ended<00:02:55.080> up<00:02:55.170> just<00:02:55.410> going<00:02:55.620> them<00:02:55.800> on<00:02:55.950> the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
so I ended up just going them on the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.960 
so I ended up just going them on the
correct<00:02:56.520> way<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:56.850> at<00:02:57.240> least<00:02:57.360> he<00:02:57.480> could<00:02:57.630> stand

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
correct way so at least he could stand

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.140 
correct way so at least he could stand
moves<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.980> don't<00:03:01.980> know<00:03:02.100> about<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.640> this

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
moves I don't know about this this

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.550 
moves I don't know about this this
figure<00:03:04.050> that<00:03:04.380> jazwares<00:03:05.220> made<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.910> him<00:03:06.560> the

other<00:03:07.680> one<00:03:07.890> at<00:03:08.130> least<00:03:08.570> but<00:03:09.570> this<00:03:09.750> one<00:03:10.050> moves

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
other one at least but this one moves

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.800 
other one at least but this one moves
pretty<00:03:10.980> good<00:03:11.220> same<00:03:12.120> points<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.540> our<00:03:12.660> key
