 good friends from youtube this time 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.519
 I come to bring a paid application 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.210
 of the homeland of free with the patch 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:14.480
 for clear root user 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.140
 that the patch needs 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.590
 you keep hash but I do love them 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.759
 avoid the hassle that I have a 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.870
 then the application that I'm going to 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:30.440
 show this is called phase tuning 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:33.740
 how do you see here when you are not with the 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.050
 patch can not open the letter photos 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.970
 of good license verification here 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.460
 as in I can choose the photo that I 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.380
 want 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.550
 to edit all functions 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.550
 for example to soften 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.530
 soften 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.270
 as you can see 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.270
 the whole function comes out 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.820
 then I hope you like it 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:08.200
 well let's look at the k that has more 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.240
 has the details 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.020
 did not start in small mini tutorial of 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.020
 how to do it 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.100
 as you can see 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.200
 all functions 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:27.230
 here is this is 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.730
 well then here I show 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.420
 Here I show you how they have to 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.420
 to do 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.570
 good because as well you can leave 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.850
 this file that is called falset a 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.260
 patch 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.940
 then two files come in there 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.620
 they decompress it 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.390
 and you will have these two files 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.360
 good 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.190

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:06.300
 normal application and where I come here this 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:10.380
 they are and they give him copy or cut and what 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.150
 pass to the root of your phone in data and 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.400
 in here they stick it 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.680
 they have stuck 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.030
 I do not hit it because I already have it but 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.450
 that 's all 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.110
 and start the application 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.450
 make an application and there it goes goes 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.900
 to install the patch and they will have easy 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:36.360
