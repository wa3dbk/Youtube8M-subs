00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.550
 Dr if already on this come on it 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.590

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.520
 stimulate soundly 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.210

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.970
 us the band together 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.070
 the DSW in Berlin 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.070
 RTL sends representatives 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.540
 My role model is 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.850
 calculate the price 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.850
 "Mine too, Vale is empty 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.150
 my appearance 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.650
 in the finish in the tray 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.510
 quietly come to light 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.650
 for PÃ¤nz is not at all 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.650
 80 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.650

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.440
 this band of course me 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.640
 One or more course, of course 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.150
 before we got the invitation here, we are alerted 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.500

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.830
 come here 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.730
 before that, it was a protest to lead a success 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.260
 and last week, but not in the fight, it's obviously about who won 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.820
 horny thing they have our play in the woods 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.830
 and we are very critical 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.130
 Gina he is also my next question with the church what he has there with 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 everything 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.639
 I think 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.309
 a classic 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:14.769
 On the stock market, 1 2 gave a really great deal for the pillow content 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.169
 What happens to him after life? 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.509
 but we also have not come to a very good conclusion what's going on there 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.870
 and then as I said this competition always won in the church 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.389
 in Mannheim 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.019
 Reason to give up 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.949
 what are we all so true Christians 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.389
 in the church at least on the 2 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:35.819
 Jardel 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.729
 and numbers church tax 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.939
 BAER's music was once a little bit of a taste and we now describe who it is 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.149
 that is necessary too 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:47.629
 the church does not consider permissible 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.629

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.069
 the modern sounds of a white dress appeared 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.899
 focussed 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:15.319

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.299
