00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.330 

first<00:00:04.960> we<00:00:05.140> will<00:00:05.230> be<00:00:05.380> cutting<00:00:05.740> the<00:00:05.830> top<00:00:06.069> surface

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:06.340 
first we will be cutting the top surface

first we will be cutting the top surface
out<00:00:06.670> using<00:00:06.970> a<00:00:07.149> router<00:00:07.359> you<00:00:07.860> can<00:00:08.860> see<00:00:09.219> here<00:00:09.520> that

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
out using a router you can see here that

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.430 
out using a router you can see here that
we<00:00:09.790> have<00:00:09.820> placed<00:00:10.120> a<00:00:10.299> piece<00:00:10.450> of<00:00:10.510> 12<00:00:10.990> millimeter

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
we have placed a piece of 12 millimeter

we have placed a piece of 12 millimeter
MDF<00:00:12.039> under<00:00:12.400> the<00:00:12.490> worktop<00:00:12.959> this<00:00:13.959> is<00:00:14.110> used<00:00:14.379> to

MDF under the worktop this is used to

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.289 
MDF under the worktop this is used to
seal<00:00:14.740> the<00:00:14.889> bottom<00:00:15.070> of<00:00:15.369> the<00:00:15.459> cutout<00:00:15.670> as<00:00:16.059> the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
seal the bottom of the cutout as the

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.029 
seal the bottom of the cutout as the

bottom of the worktop this seal helps

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.499 
bottom of the worktop this seal helps
the<00:00:21.070> routers<00:00:21.429> extraction<00:00:22.000> system<00:00:22.359> and

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
the routers extraction system and

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.529 
the routers extraction system and
minimizes<00:00:23.349> the<00:00:23.470> spread<00:00:23.740> of<00:00:23.769> debris<00:00:24.539> the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
minimizes the spread of debris the

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.140 
minimizes the spread of debris the
router<00:00:25.810> bit<00:00:26.080> may<00:00:26.349> well<00:00:26.560> touch<00:00:26.859> the<00:00:27.070> MDF<00:00:27.460> and<00:00:27.640> so

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
router bit may well touch the MDF and so

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.269 
router bit may well touch the MDF and so
this<00:00:28.330> piece<00:00:28.539> is<00:00:28.599> purely<00:00:29.019> sacrificial<00:00:29.769> but<00:00:30.130> can

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:06.990 

we<00:01:05.560> would<00:01:05.710> suggest<00:01:05.890> that<00:01:06.280> this<00:01:06.430> is<00:01:06.609> done<00:01:06.820> with

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
we would suggest that this is done with

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.680 
we would suggest that this is done with
at<00:01:07.119> least<00:01:07.240> two<00:01:07.600> passes

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.080 

as<00:01:14.750> with<00:01:15.410> all<00:01:15.560> router<00:01:15.830> processes<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.880> key

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
as with all router processes the key

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.180 
as with all router processes the key
here<00:01:17.390> is<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:17.600> keep<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.990> constant<00:01:18.260> even<00:01:18.710> pressure

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
here is to keep a constant even pressure

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:28.789 
here is to keep a constant even pressure
on<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.580> router

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.609 

once<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.969> router<00:01:30.149> has<00:01:30.329> cut<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> worktop<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
once the router has cut the worktop the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.349 
once the router has cut the worktop the
debris<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.219> then<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.549> removed<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
debris can then be removed and the

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:42.770 
debris can then be removed and the
internal<00:01:33.869> edge<00:01:34.079> checked<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.679> sharpness<00:01:41.780> we

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
internal edge checked for sharpness we

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.450 
internal edge checked for sharpness we
would<00:01:42.929> recommend<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.679> jig<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.009> set<00:01:44.280> up

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
would recommend that the jig is set up

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.309 
would recommend that the jig is set up
so<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.090> router<00:01:45.299> guide<00:01:45.659> Bush<00:01:45.719> can<00:01:46.200> be

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
so that the router guide Bush can be

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.800 
so that the router guide Bush can be
changed<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.310> final<00:01:47.700> full<00:01:47.969> face<00:01:48.240> trim<00:01:48.600> can

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
changed and a final full face trim can

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.809 
changed and a final full face trim can
be<00:01:48.929> performed<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.679> ensure<00:01:49.979> an<00:01:50.130> accurate<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
be performed to ensure an accurate and

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.460 
be performed to ensure an accurate and
even<00:01:51.179> finish

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.380 

the<00:01:55.470> easiest<00:01:55.890> way<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.159> remove<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.759> cutout<00:01:57.150> is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
the easiest way to remove the cutout is

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.630 
the easiest way to remove the cutout is
to<00:01:57.780> attach<00:01:58.049> one<00:01:58.320> sucker<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.040> seaming<00:01:59.430> tool

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
to attach one sucker of the seaming tool

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.300 
to attach one sucker of the seaming tool
to<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.970> and<00:02:00.150> gently<00:02:00.659> lift<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.140> out<00:02:01.290> making<00:02:02.100> sure

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
to it and gently lift it out making sure

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.889 
to it and gently lift it out making sure
that<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.610> do<00:02:02.729> not<00:02:02.759> catch<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.360> edge<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
that you do not catch the edge of the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.160 
that you do not catch the edge of the
cutout<00:02:04.229> as<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.590> do<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:06.360> excess<00:02:06.750> cutout

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170

cutout as you do so the excess cutout
material<00:02:07.710> should<00:02:07.860> be<00:02:07.920> left<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.429> site<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.970> case
