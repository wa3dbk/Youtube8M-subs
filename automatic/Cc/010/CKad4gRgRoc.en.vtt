00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
so we have here self is always running

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.950 
so we have here self is always running
on<00:00:03.419> n<00:00:03.510> 950<00:00:05.029> we<00:00:06.029> start<00:00:06.390> from<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.779> lock<00:00:06.930> screen

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
on n 950 we start from the lock screen

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.500 
on n 950 we start from the lock screen
so<00:00:07.830> we<00:00:08.040> have<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.340> lock<00:00:08.490> screen<00:00:08.610> we<00:00:09.150> see<00:00:09.360> the

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
so we have the lock screen we see the

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.240 
so we have the lock screen we see the
notification<00:00:09.750> for<00:00:10.320> example<00:00:10.650> missing<00:00:10.980> calls

knew<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.360> new<00:00:12.570> messages<00:00:13.080> answer<00:00:13.730> we<00:00:14.730> see<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
knew that new messages answer we see the

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.540 
knew that new messages answer we see the
clock<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.750> for<00:00:16.320> example<00:00:16.650> here<00:00:16.830> we<00:00:17.070> can<00:00:17.369> see

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
clock and for example here we can see

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.240 
clock and for example here we can see
the<00:00:17.730> mute<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.199> device<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.710> on<00:00:19.800> mute<00:00:20.010> at

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the moment or silent mode we change the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.740 
the moment or silent mode we change the
profile<00:00:22.859> just<00:00:23.250> by<00:00:23.400> tracking<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.820> screen<00:00:24.570> and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
profile just by tracking the screen and

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.870 
profile just by tracking the screen and
getting<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.470> pool<00:00:25.650> menu<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:26.550> see<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
getting the pool menu and we see the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.810 
getting the pool menu and we see the
highlighting<00:00:27.420> there<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.789> activate<00:00:29.789> the

highlight but releasing the touch so now

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.430 
highlight but releasing the touch so now
we<00:00:32.070> see<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.640> mute<00:00:33.420> when<00:00:33.899> they<00:00:34.050> went<00:00:34.350> away

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
we see that the mute when they went away

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.970 
we see that the mute when they went away
when<00:00:35.070> be<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> normal<00:00:35.969> profile<00:00:36.750> then<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:37.710> when<00:00:37.950> we

by<00:01:22.560> pushing<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:23.220> course<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.880> don't<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.180> that

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
by pushing of course I don't have that

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.910 
by pushing of course I don't have that
more<00:01:24.689> than<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:24.960> at<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> moment<00:01:25.320> installed

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
more than this at the moment installed

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.120 
more than this at the moment installed
but<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.729> would<00:01:26.909> extend<00:01:27.210> from<00:01:27.750> from<00:01:28.229> here<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
but it would extend from from here the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.480 
but it would extend from from here the
same<00:01:29.430> vertical<00:01:29.759> movement<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.250> again<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
same vertical movement and again in the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.359 
same vertical movement and again in the
bottom<00:01:32.790> there's<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.180> full<00:01:33.930> menu<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.189> can

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
bottom there's a full menu that I can

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.660 
bottom there's a full menu that I can
use<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.759> get<00:01:35.909> back<00:01:36.119> back<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> home<00:01:36.750> screen

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
use to get back back to the home screen

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.960 
use to get back back to the home screen
then<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:39.479> going<00:01:39.990> more<00:01:40.200> deeply<00:01:40.590> into<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
then going going more deeply into the

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.260 
then going going more deeply into the
home<00:01:41.970> home<00:01:42.270> view<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.750> we<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
home home view so we have on the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.639 
home home view so we have on the
currently<00:01:45.270> running<00:01:45.450> six<00:01:45.810> applications<00:01:46.200> here

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
currently running six applications here

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.319 
currently running six applications here
and<00:01:46.860> these<00:01:47.220> applications<00:01:47.820> are<00:01:47.909> actually

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and these applications are actually

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.690 
and these applications are actually
smart<00:01:49.259> covers<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.549> actually

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
smart covers so you can actually

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.130 
smart covers so you can actually
interact<00:01:51.119> with<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> applications<00:01:52.049> in

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
interact with the applications in

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.069 
interact with the applications in
different<00:01:52.170> ways<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:53.490> with<00:01:53.960> using<00:01:54.960> these

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
different ways with with using these

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.950 
different ways with with using these
smart<00:01:55.710> cover<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.759> more<00:01:57.240> convenient<00:01:57.810> way

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
smart cover so the more convenient way

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.499 
smart cover so the more convenient way
is<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.439> tapping<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.130> application<00:01:59.640> which

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
is just tapping the application which

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.690 
is just tapping the application which
actually<00:02:00.719> wants<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.259> application<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
actually wants the application to the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.240 
actually wants the application to the
previous<00:02:03.240> view<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.600> was<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.960> then<00:02:04.860> if<00:02:05.040> we

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
previous view it was in then if we

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.340 
previous view it was in then if we
minimize<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.850> application<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.200> same

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
minimize the application and at the same

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.050 
minimize the application and at the same
time<00:02:07.530> when<00:02:07.740> we<00:02:07.890> minimize<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.399> application<00:02:08.910> we

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
time when we minimize the application we

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.639 
time when we minimize the application we
connect

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
connect

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.440 
connect
see<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.510> it<00:02:11.510> is<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:12.200> peaking<00:02:12.709> mode<00:02:13.220> of<00:02:13.489> our<00:02:13.730> OS

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
see that it is a peaking mode of our OS

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.390 
see that it is a peaking mode of our OS
so<00:02:14.659> we<00:02:14.780> can<00:02:14.930> actually<00:02:15.019> pick<00:02:15.439> from<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.280> any

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
so we can actually pick from to any

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.789 
so we can actually pick from to any
application<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.750> desktop<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.470> seeded

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
application to the desktop and seeded

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.330 
application to the desktop and seeded
time<00:02:19.489> and<00:02:19.870> start<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:20.959> information<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.739> at

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
time and start this information and at

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.580 
time and start this information and at
the<00:02:22.459> same<00:02:22.579> time<00:02:22.640> it's<00:02:23.000> hides<00:02:23.269> their<00:02:23.569> hides<00:02:24.349> the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
the same time it's hides their hides the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.280 
the same time it's hides their hides the
weak<00:02:25.310> ones<00:02:25.549> icons<00:02:25.970> so<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.329> actually<00:02:26.599> moves<00:02:26.930> we

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
weak ones icons so it actually moves we

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.160 
weak ones icons so it actually moves we
can<00:02:27.439> see<00:02:27.560> here<00:02:27.829> he<00:02:28.459> actually<00:02:28.579> moves<00:02:28.939> the<00:02:29.239> home

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
can see here he actually moves the home

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.410 
can see here he actually moves the home
screen<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.500> bit<00:02:30.709> so<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:31.549> we<00:02:31.819> can<00:02:31.970> actually<00:02:32.090> with

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
screen a bit so so we can actually with

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.059 
screen a bit so so we can actually with
one<00:02:32.750> peeking<00:02:33.140> we<00:02:33.260> can<00:02:33.439> see<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.739> running

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
one peeking we can see the running

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.380 
one peeking we can see the running
applications<00:02:34.609> and<00:02:34.760> also<00:02:34.849> there's<00:02:35.209> all<00:02:35.329> this

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
applications and also there's all this

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.780 
applications and also there's all this
information<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:38.420> about<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.019> active<00:02:39.290> covers

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
information so about the active covers

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.309 
information so about the active covers
so<00:02:40.790> for<00:02:41.269> for<00:02:41.629> this<00:02:41.780> dialer<00:02:42.170> application

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
so for for this dialer application

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.220 
so for for this dialer application
there's<00:02:42.829> two<00:02:42.980> different<00:02:44.079> functionality<00:02:45.079> here

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
there's two different functionality here

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.920 
there's two different functionality here
so<00:02:45.500> when<00:02:45.980> we<00:02:46.579> go<00:02:46.730> left<00:02:46.940> we<00:02:47.450> actually<00:02:47.750> launched

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
so when we go left we actually launched

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.780 
so when we go left we actually launched
the<00:02:48.019> dialer<00:02:48.560> application<00:02:48.739> with<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.370> key<00:02:49.579> bed

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
the dialer application with the key bed

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.110 
the dialer application with the key bed
and<00:02:51.040> when<00:02:52.040> we<00:02:52.220> go<00:02:52.370> right<00:02:52.579> we<00:02:52.819> actually

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
and when we go right we actually

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.509 
and when we go right we actually
launched<00:02:53.329> the<00:02:53.739> dialer<00:02:54.739> application<00:02:54.980> with

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
launched the dialer application with

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.809 
launched the dialer application with
with<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:55.970> contacts<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.310> can<00:02:58.489> actually

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
with the contacts so you can actually

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.149 
with the contacts so you can actually
search<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.569> contacts<00:02:59.959> contacts<00:03:00.560> list<00:03:00.739> you

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
search the contacts contacts list you

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.660 
search the contacts contacts list you
have<00:03:01.189> under<00:03:01.670> your<00:03:01.700> device<00:03:03.159> most<00:03:04.159> interesting

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
have under your device most interesting

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.399 
have under your device most interesting
part<00:03:04.879> for<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.209> active<00:03:05.450> cover<00:03:05.659> c<00:03:05.840> is<00:03:06.170> for

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
part for the active cover c is for

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.800 
part for the active cover c is for
example<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:06.950> media<00:03:07.579> player<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.120> when<00:03:08.689> we

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
example the media player so when we

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.789 
example the media player so when we
start<00:03:09.079> playing<00:03:09.260> media<00:03:09.980> or<00:03:10.730> music<00:03:11.150> on<00:03:11.329> the

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
start playing media or music on the

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.729 
start playing media or music on the
device<00:03:12.799> we<00:03:13.430> actually<00:03:13.790> can<00:03:14.590> minimize<00:03:15.590> the

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
device we actually can minimize the

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.069 
device we actually can minimize the
application<00:03:16.190> here<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:16.639> play<00:03:17.449> the<00:03:17.510> music<00:03:17.690> and

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
application here and play the music and

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.689 
application here and play the music and
then<00:03:18.500> we<00:03:18.590> can<00:03:18.799> actually<00:03:18.949> pause<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.609> music

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:19.699 
then we can actually pause the music

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.180 
then we can actually pause the music
here<00:03:20.180> from<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.810> cover<00:03:21.049> and<00:03:21.319> also<00:03:21.709> get<00:03:21.919> to<00:03:22.069> the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
here from the cover and also get to the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.270 
here from the cover and also get to the
next<00:03:22.340> song<00:03:22.579> from<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.269> cover<00:03:23.480> so<00:03:24.379> this<00:03:24.980> is<00:03:25.099> very

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
next song from the cover so this is very

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.710

very nice functional you don't need to

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.960 
very nice functional you don't need to
open<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.109> application<00:03:27.620> just<00:03:27.829> to<00:03:28.099> like<00:03:28.699> pause

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
this to the network you actually just

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.410 
this to the network you actually just
push<00:04:09.200> it<00:04:09.230> aside<00:04:09.530> and<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:10.220> shares<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.640> to<00:04:11.300> the

push it aside and it shares it to the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.800 
push it aside and it shares it to the
network<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:12.670> we<00:04:13.670> can<00:04:13.820> actually<00:04:13.940> check<00:04:14.450> that
