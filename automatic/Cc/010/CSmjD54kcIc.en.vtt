this is just going to change the light
it's<00:02:32.900> going<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.440> help<00:02:33.800> smooth<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.730> almost

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
it's going to help smooth it almost

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.360 
it's going to help smooth it almost
smooth<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.630> down<00:02:35.660> in<00:02:36.200> appearance<00:02:36.620> how's<00:02:37.220> the

smooth it down in appearance how's the
last<00:02:37.610> step<00:02:37.970> I'm<00:02:38.210> going<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.930> lightly<00:02:39.770> tap<00:02:40.220> some

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880

just<00:02:43.700> enough<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.180> really<00:02:44.390> set<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:45.050> coverage

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
just enough to really set that coverage

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.320 
just enough to really set that coverage
but<00:02:45.710> not<00:02:45.920> really<00:02:46.280> enough<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.730> sort<00:02:46.880> of<00:02:46.940> change
