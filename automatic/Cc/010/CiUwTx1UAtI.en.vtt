00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.109
 hello very good to all and my phrases 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.460
 we are here one more day and good as the 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.769
 people wanted a jungle tier live what 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.660
 I leave background but what came to speak 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.360
 today is a bit of the orientation of the 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.449
 channel bad state commenting a lot of people 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.550
 about the chronicles about the direct 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.630
 then I started doing a video 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.580
 Sincerely before applying 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.720
 comment for comment so people 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.340
 interested can watch the video 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.529
 directly and you will know the reasons 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.720
 why do you stop doing direct and for 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.910
 what the chronicles are taking so much 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.309
 space between one another well as 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.930
 you know, I work and I work for 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.410
 the afternoons but the schedule that I 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.840
 changed about a month ago that is a 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.910
 17 o'clock in the evening therefore 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.820
 you drown at 12 at night almost 11 and 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.140
 peak and if I say busted by the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.390
 tomorrow it does not come to me 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.649
 expiration to write and hence not 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.420
 have time to do direct because 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.800
 a live in the morning the people just 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.079
 there's that way is in the institute 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.829
 they are in college and there would be 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.449
 just people to see the live and the 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.580
 chronicles well you really know that 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.440
 you need to have a mental and physical state 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.940
 optimal to write well then if 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.850
 it's not that shit that really is 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.320
 the chronicles that I have to publish the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.940
 written almost almost a couple of times 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.950
 and they do not really convince me I have the 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.930
 things clear in the head but like 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.520
 I am all the little step to the day that is and 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.830
 working and so I can not 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.670
 organize them well and I can not write it 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.340
 I would like that 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.320
 So good for luck is that the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.140
 Monday is my birthday and in theory I 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.880
 have said that for this week long 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.980
 of next week they will change me from 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.180
 schedule start work in the morning 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.980
 start healing from 10 to 2 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.560
 therefore I will arrive home at 3 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.150
 I will have all afternoon free all afternoon 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.610
 to fly in the chronicles to fly 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.740
 direct etc etc. then well what 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.990
 I wanted to tell you that I feel that there 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.720
 there was so much space between a chronicle and 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.280
 another but possibly and hopefully 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.290
 that if they have not yet said anything clear 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.790
 but he told me it's 90% safe 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.229
 that they change me throughout the week 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.520
 that comes will return to normal a 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.050
 little of when I started the channel that I 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.000
 when I started the channel they were in the 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.290
 same site and the schedule that they are going to put 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.820
 now that is, there is no problem either 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.560
 to write chronicles there's no problem 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.360
 to serve you to play 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.880
 more games like just in the afternoon and 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.700
 to make them direct 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.020
 The only thing I have a doubt is that I 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.580
 I would like to consult with you what 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.500
 you want me to do with the direct ones 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.450
 there are really two types of direct 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.040
 I can not do the director is only qy 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.450
 the direct with subscribers in games 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.800
 in event event the magic roll 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.840
 against not his as he did from the beginning 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.950
 I would like to resume those events 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.250
 I would like to resume those games 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.630
 subscribers but as for the single q 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.000
 you know what I play much better with 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.470
 music and that was much better if 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.690
 I have then it is something of bottom to be able 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.790
 listening on youtube raises a 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.470
 problem because if you put a 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.540
 song is going to skip a stress for 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.500
 copyright that I'm going to eat it but 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.570
 whole then I have thoughts if 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.520
 it seems good to you I do not tell you to leave it 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.300
 comments and it seems good that the 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.410
 events with subscribers and the 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.450
 subscribe parties upload them youtube 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.950
 as youtube live but the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.630
 direct from just making them tweets 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.340
 because in tweets it allows me to put the 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.570
 music comes out of the balls remember 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.830
 that I have a twitter account of 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.330
 a lot of time in fact I started the 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.040
 direct in tweets when not yet 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.380
 had the partner and could not do them in 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.750
 youtube and it would be a bit of 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.270
 directors or what more intimate roll 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.010
 in quotes with a rock that 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.000
 that's why I women on twitter 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.190
 without notice that a director makes 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.930
 neurologist I get the same I put the 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.490
 Like no camera and I get it alone q 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.840
 with little music quietly and a little 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.820
 as we did at the beginning when I started 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.770
 to the channel I think it 's going to be 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.940
 quite beneficial for people who 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.860
 he sees me normally that he wants to see me 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.150
 playing run that ideally then I 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.770
 allows me to get my full potential 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.080
 you know I play a lot better with 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.450
 music because for me the music is very 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.740
 important has always been and 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.630
 when I have the music I'm a little bit more 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.160
 concentrated although talk less I'm 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.170
 much more concentrated and I have much more 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.220
 vision of game with many more capacity 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.690
 to concentrate 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.610
 in fact the games that I play 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.770
 promotion the game all the game with 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.030
 music is something that has to record them and 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.860
 Well, it was a bit that I wanted 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.870
 say a little the sense of the channel the 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.370
 journey will take I will continue to do 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.320
 the series in fact I'm going to start a 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.090
 series with wu that people have 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.300
 asked also enough to have a 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.920
 I would like the three series of 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.660
 starts with champions that are the 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.700
 smooth the vila de CV with equal in 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.830
 possible future like I would start to the 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.260
 of pantheon or the one of harvard but 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.450
 really with those three toys by 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.460
 climb perfectly to platinum I do not think 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.540
 I need more jungle and with my ivory 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.520
 from top you know that I can not live without him 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.230
 and well it was a little bit that the video 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.520
 today there is no live today is a little 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.760
 bundled with the counter peak and is 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.870
 doing the fashions of why I 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.390
 I really like this video that I'm going to do 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.430
 you see him deal with surely about 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.560
 fashions that there is top fashion double 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.810
 and the fashion of the intern at the top and the 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.720
 tank fashion a little analyzing both 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.220
 good both the three so to speak and 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.170
 comparing one with another to see what is 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.620
 more beneficial and which does not then 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.900
 said people thank you for being there from there 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.580
 we are already 13000 eufrasio more than 13 thousand 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.030
 that the truth that is a pretty figure 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.990
 good and good people, what is said 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.670
 surely if there is an event in 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.130
 madrid or whatever coming and going 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:13.520
 we are thinking about and asocial nats and 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.780
 we can go and I 've said people if you 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.490
 liked this video town of always 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.550
 shared his friends like it does a little 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.650
 an informative video and then tomorrow 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.630
 we return to normal moon at las 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.410

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.940
 finished will return the live will return the 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.400

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.509
 re make the guides just for you to 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.479
 are valid for this edition 4 on 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:40.789
 everything I think that of the one thousand units 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.440
 it is necessary to do them again but 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:44.889
 I will do all over again so that the people 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.479
 who sees the channel and usually says 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:50.180
 try to improve that you have some kind of 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.190
 guide and a people what has been said if it has 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.449
 liked layman do not have friends follow 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.220
