00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:11.709
 billiards I shoot as I shoot no and 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.750
 customer and client 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.750
 good afternoon hello motor 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.930
 tell me how much your cost will be 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.930
 services for 10 hours 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:01:25.740
 you know that you pay me very much 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:01:27.840
 liked to talk about cement if 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.280
 the person was expecting just he is looking for where 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.020
 cheaper one now hang rub 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.940
 why should I continue the conversation with my not 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.600
 I now decided to my clients with two phrases 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.600
 question my client 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.979
 but after he with how I tell him two 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.150
 once told me that the higher you 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.070
 you understand, we need an important question, but if 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.960
 he is still interested in my quality 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.900
 and I did not say that I have a high 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.830
 the price is sometimes so people say that even 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.330
 by the way among groups the photographer writes letters 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.140
 I just watched the answers 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:08.580
 most famous streams and they write u 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.799
 me very high prices and if if you 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.659
 suddenly it will be expensive then I can give you 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.659
 recommend your students to the deck 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:29.700
 relation to the lowest is a provocation on 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.709
 the lower demand was calculated something 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.910
 completely positioning there these y 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:39.270
 I have on 33 you goof off 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.290
 give up the loot and so here it is very 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.959
 good promise 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.910
 very good Paz but it is designed for 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.440
 the bottom will take if for taking that 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.569
 when you say such a phrase or 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.430
 like times you write no man 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.709
 self respecting politely premium never 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.030
 will not ask for these courts 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.640
 never because his scalpel and already 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.040
 at this stage it looked exactly 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.650
 insult is unworthy now when 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.310
 I tell you the first sentence I told you 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.130
 that until you know went to pay or 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.980
 afraid to be high it means that 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.840
 my price is adequate to that quality and what 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.440
 apparently the quality of my services is enough 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.890
 high 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.040
 I brought this thought and mladich to the question 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:24.330
 how can i find out what i am crying for and this 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.980
 already prompts to ask ask 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.370
 let's play i already told you this 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.650
 the phrase 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:34.530
 Further I can not find out 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.530
 your qualities and the same word wanted 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.609
 classic celebration painting 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:55.959
 walk Russian restaurant and to you 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:58.480
 I wanted beautiful pictures I looked 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.409
 I really liked your photos 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:06.129
 computers 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:10.569
 and in what style of art 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:17.019
 interesting pictures to watch the method and to 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:20.410
 I take you the most important photos you 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.180
 shoot before the transfer of emotions back from 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.130
 bones aesthetic pleasure 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.830
 sufficient meaning I understand correctly 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.900
 which is very important for you what will be 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.570
 Photo 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.210
 This form seems to me that then it has 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.690
 sense to discuss it meet and 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.550
 discuss because weddings are weddings you 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.680
 You know, I, too, take something 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.500
 once life and i just like you 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.210
 serious about this question in order 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.349
 so that we have the opportunity to devote 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:55.479
 this is enough attention 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:59.159
 I think it makes sense to meet me 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:01.990
 I solved the question 1 phone I found out 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:05.949
 can you pay or not you 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:11.289
 I realized that I would be cheap but I still 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:14.430
 Questions now decided although I could answer 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:17.260
 quite differently as in the classic 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.280
 how much I am or is there the last 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.200
 master class to say 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:27.040
 let's play how much services cost 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:30.340
 a man no more than money took it for nothing I 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:34.340
 on the lip I start dragged out what the garbage 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.630
 you don't go there do you understand that when you are so 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.450
 tell the man if he really 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:43.130
 I wanted a beautiful photo session for the phrase 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:56.810
 no more money I will continue to say bro yes 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:58.550
 okay does not burn you immediately determine 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.010
 format say the word immediately expose 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.340
 vector communication and immediately a person understands 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.650
 what are you talking to ? 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.690
 weight is it ready yes well with these phrases 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.669
 Why did I go through TV magic 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.550
 well these phrases give you the opportunity 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.560
 immediately understand your buddy and not your what 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.840
 it is important to the quality of your services or 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.479
 he is looking for where is cheaper if where is cheaper 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:24.080
 why do you need such a person you do not need 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:25.640
 this is not your client could then why 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.140
 I began to ask further questions I 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:32.830
 I can immediately meet then 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:34.970
 why I didn't make it more understandable 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:38.350
 look did you notice whose 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:41.560
 territory this conversation is gone 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:44.810
 do you understand who do the midst 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.590
 you understand who in this case thought 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.710
 above the answers 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:52.180
 have you seen it all and who most often in 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:55.400
 talk thinks over answers 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.380
 the seller is of course the seller because to him 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.810
 knows his question in an awkward situation and 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:04.100
 he starts to think and he searches like this 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:07.400
 unscrew did studied I sat watched 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.689
