torture calm I'm here today to talk to

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.880 
torture calm I'm here today to talk to
you<00:00:18.939> a<00:00:18.970> little<00:00:19.060> bit<00:00:19.270> about<00:00:19.360> the<00:00:19.720> new<00:00:20.560> exhaust

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
you a little bit about the new exhaust

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.740 
you a little bit about the new exhaust
system<00:00:21.040> for<00:00:21.490> mozzies<00:00:21.849> incorporated<00:00:22.570> and

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
system for mozzies incorporated and

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.679 
system for mozzies incorporated and
that's<00:00:22.930> for<00:00:23.529> the<00:00:23.590> Grizzly<00:00:23.950> 700<00:00:24.669> this<00:00:25.480> is<00:00:25.660> a

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
that's for the Grizzly 700 this is a

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.450 
that's for the Grizzly 700 this is a
stainless<00:00:26.259> system<00:00:26.650> from<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:27.189> exhaust

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
stainless system from the exhaust

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.660 
stainless system from the exhaust
manifold<00:00:28.119> back<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.599> the<00:00:28.689> can<00:00:28.930> it<00:00:29.670> incorporates

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
manifold back to the can it incorporates

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.820 
manifold back to the can it incorporates
all<00:00:30.820> stainless<00:00:31.449> construction<00:00:31.599> so<00:00:32.439> it<00:00:32.619> gives

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
all stainless construction so it gives

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.430 
all stainless construction so it gives
you<00:00:32.920> better<00:00:33.720> scavenging<00:00:34.720> effects<00:00:35.110> for

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
you better scavenging effects for

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.340 
you better scavenging effects for
exhaust<00:00:35.860> heat<00:00:36.330> increases<00:00:37.330> horsepower<00:00:38.290> a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
exhaust heat increases horsepower a

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.310 
exhaust heat increases horsepower a
little<00:00:38.559> bit<00:00:38.730> also<00:00:39.730> inhibits<00:00:40.330> corrosion<00:00:40.750> and

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
little bit also inhibits corrosion and

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.729 
little bit also inhibits corrosion and
rust<00:00:41.980> from<00:00:42.309> your<00:00:42.489> old<00:00:42.640> dust<00:00:42.970> stain<00:00:43.600> the<00:00:44.049> carbon

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
rust from your old dust stain the carbon

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.160 
rust from your old dust stain the carbon
steel<00:00:44.920> exhaust<00:00:45.159> so<00:00:45.640> don't<00:00:46.449> have<00:00:46.570> to<00:00:46.690> worry<00:00:46.870> too

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
steel exhaust so don't have to worry too

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.469 
steel exhaust so don't have to worry too
much<00:00:47.199> about<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.949> you<00:00:48.820> know<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.119> system

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
much about the you know the system

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.109 
much about the you know the system
rusting<00:00:49.930> it<00:00:50.739> is<00:00:51.190> a<00:00:51.309> very<00:00:51.580> good<00:00:51.760> sounding

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:52.119 
rusting it is a very good sounding

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:55.350 
rusting it is a very good sounding
system<00:00:52.360> and<00:00:53.080> adds<00:00:53.409> a<00:00:53.680> couple<00:00:53.979> more<00:00:54.360> horsepower

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
system and adds a couple more horsepower

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.710 
system and adds a couple more horsepower
to<00:00:55.540> you
