an American twist more with keeping with

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.410 
an American twist more with keeping with
how<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:10.920> traditionally<00:00:11.490> done<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:14.299> wanted<00:00:15.299> to

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
how it is traditionally done I wanted to

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.300 
how it is traditionally done I wanted to
add<00:00:15.570> dimension<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.560> look<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:16.949> first

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
add dimension to the look so I first

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.370 
add dimension to the look so I first
parted<00:00:17.699> my<00:00:17.850> hair<00:00:17.880> into<00:00:18.210> six<00:00:18.600> sections<00:00:18.840> three

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
parted my hair into six sections three

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.410 
parted my hair into six sections three
on<00:00:19.560> each<00:00:19.770> side

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.340 

and<00:00:26.160> within<00:00:27.160> each<00:00:27.550> of<00:00:27.580> those<00:00:27.760> sections<00:00:28.180> I<00:00:28.780> made

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
and within each of those sections I made

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:38.319 
and within each of those sections I made
another<00:00:29.680> horizontal<00:00:30.070> part

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.410 

then<00:00:39.329> split<00:00:40.020> each<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.470> those<00:00:40.620> two<00:00:40.950> parts

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
then split each of those two parts

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.660 
then split each of those two parts
diagonally<00:00:42.420> creating<00:00:43.110> two<00:00:43.829> triangles<00:00:44.520> of

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
diagonally creating two triangles of

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.780 
diagonally creating two triangles of
sorts

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:01.940 

you

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.310 

so<00:01:02.790> prepare<00:01:02.970> for<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.390> protective<00:01:03.900> style<00:01:04.140> I

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
so prepare for this protective style I

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.230 
so prepare for this protective style I
did<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.680> peanut<00:01:05.010> butter<00:01:05.220> DC<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> day<00:01:06.030> before

and<00:01:25.070> this<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.250> what<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:26.640> section<00:01:27.060> looks<00:01:27.270> like

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
and this is what one section looks like

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:35.460 
and this is what one section looks like
all<00:01:27.720> ready<00:01:27.960> for<00:01:28.200> threading

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.660 

you

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.840 

okay<00:01:39.540> after<00:01:40.200> several<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.830> I<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:40.950> mean<00:01:41.280> several

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
okay after several and I do mean several

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.520 
okay after several and I do mean several
attempts<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.360> thread<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.810> loose<00:01:42.990> strands<00:01:43.320> I

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
attempts to thread on loose strands I

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.859 
attempts to thread on loose strands I
decided<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.400> first<00:01:44.640> braid<00:01:44.939> my<00:01:45.150> hair<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.570> then

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
decided to first braid my hair and then

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.350 
decided to first braid my hair and then
thread<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.470> top<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.040> also<00:01:47.729> my<00:01:47.880> parts<00:01:48.240> were

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
thread on top of that also my parts were

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.600 
thread on top of that also my parts were
way<00:01:48.600> too<00:01:48.630> big<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.439> split<00:01:49.799> each<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.399> half

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
way too big so I split each one in half

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.160 
way too big so I split each one in half
on<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:53.100> right<00:01:53.310> side<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.880> my<00:01:54.030> braids<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.659> on

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
on the right side on my braids and on

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.020 
on the right side on my braids and on
the<00:01:55.320> opposite<00:01:55.860> or<00:01:56.039> braids<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.820> been

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the opposite or braids that have been

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.270 
the opposite or braids that have been
threaded

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:12.580 

another<00:02:04.280> look<00:02:04.580> in<00:02:04.729> better<00:02:05.000> lighting

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.190 

you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.720 

because<00:02:18.200> it's<00:02:18.380> difficult<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:19.040> see<00:02:19.250> black<00:02:19.520> on

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
because it's difficult to see black on

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.730 
because it's difficult to see black on
black<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:20.180> will<00:02:20.360> demonstrate<00:02:20.570> using<00:02:21.110> my<00:02:21.380> minis

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
black I will demonstrate using my minis

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.740 
black I will demonstrate using my minis
I<00:02:21.950> look<00:02:22.130> at<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.520> actual<00:02:22.940> african<00:02:23.180> thread

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
I look at the actual african thread

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.650 
I look at the actual african thread
which<00:02:24.260> is<00:02:24.440> ironically<00:02:25.010> made<00:02:25.310> in<00:02:25.460> china<00:02:25.760> ok

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
which is ironically made in china ok

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
which is ironically made in china ok
let's<00:02:26.930> begin

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.460 

first<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.890> nodded<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.550> thread

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.050 

first<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:44.650> put<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.980> thread<00:02:45.220> against<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.820> braid

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
first I put the thread against the braid

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.630 
first I put the thread against the braid
and<00:02:46.300> won<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.260> around<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.740> few<00:02:47.770> times<00:02:48.010> making

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
and won it around a few times making

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.640 
and won it around a few times making
sure<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.240> is<00:02:49.360> not<00:02:49.570> too<00:02:49.810> tight<00:02:50.080> but<00:02:50.380> still

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
sure it is not too tight but still

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.809 
sure it is not too tight but still
secure

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.569 

and<00:02:58.909> around<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.079> around<00:03:00.140> we<00:03:00.439> go<00:03:00.469> I<00:03:00.890> tried<00:03:01.430> to

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
and around and around we go I tried to

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:02.979 
and around and around we go I tried to
keep<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.879> thread<00:03:02.090> as<00:03:02.269> close<00:03:02.510> together<00:03:02.749> as

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
keep the thread as close together as

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.619 
keep the thread as close together as
possible<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:04.159> closer<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.609> thread<00:03:04.939> the<00:03:05.420> more

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
possible the closer to thread the more

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.479 
possible the closer to thread the more
rigid<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.109> breed<00:03:06.319> and<00:03:06.530> firstly<00:03:06.920> they<00:03:07.280> lose

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
rigid the breed and firstly they lose

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:17.630 
rigid the breed and firstly they lose
the<00:03:07.790> thread<00:03:07.999> the<00:03:08.450> more<00:03:08.629> pliable<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.290> breed

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:31.700 

you

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.250 

the<00:03:32.280> finish<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.940> loop<00:03:33.240> the<00:03:33.420> thread<00:03:33.450> back<00:03:33.870> close

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
the finish I loop the thread back close

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.440 
the finish I loop the thread back close
to<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.530> end<00:03:34.800> of<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.160> braid<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.610> round<00:03:36.240> and

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
to the end of the braid and round and

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.780 
to the end of the braid and round and
round<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.840> go<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:37.800> I<00:03:37.830> passed<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.430> end<00:03:38.640> of

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
round I go and so I passed the end of
