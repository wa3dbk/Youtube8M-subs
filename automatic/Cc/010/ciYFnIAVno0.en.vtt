middlings<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.590> that<00:01:49.590> there's<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.100> certain<00:01:50.340> way

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
middlings is that there's a certain way

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.429 
middlings is that there's a certain way
that<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.299> cut<00:01:51.540> through<00:01:51.750> them<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.110> actually

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
that we can cut through them to actually

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.690 
that we can cut through them to actually
make<00:01:52.590> little<00:01:52.860> ribbons<00:01:53.159> which<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.490> appropriate

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
make little ribbons which is appropriate

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.819 
make little ribbons which is appropriate
for<00:01:53.970> holiday<00:01:54.420> season<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.500> what<00:01:55.619> we're<00:01:55.710> going

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
for holiday season so what we're going

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.620 
for holiday season so what we're going
to<00:01:55.920> do<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.340> we're<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.640> stack<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.360> our

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
to do is we're going to stack up our

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.780 
to do is we're going to stack up our
mint<00:01:58.140> leaves<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.950> know<00:01:59.100> these<00:01:59.729> are

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
mint leaves and you know these are

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.850 
mint leaves and you know these are
fairly<00:02:00.390> large<00:02:00.810> mint<00:02:01.140> leaves<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.680> can

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
fairly large mint leaves so you can

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.740 
fairly large mint leaves so you can
actually<00:02:02.009> get<00:02:02.250> smaller<00:02:02.610> ones<00:02:02.909> as<00:02:03.060> well<00:02:03.090> but

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
actually get smaller ones as well but

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.190 
actually get smaller ones as well but
just<00:02:03.990> stack<00:02:04.290> them<00:02:04.320> up<00:02:04.770> and

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
just stack them up and

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.029 
just stack them up and
show<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:05.469> what<00:02:05.649> we<00:02:05.799> do<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:07.420> i<00:02:07.479> have<00:02:07.750> about

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
show you what we do so i have about

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.559 
show you what we do so i have about
let's<00:02:09.039> say<00:02:09.160> about<00:02:09.399> five<00:02:09.700> or<00:02:09.879> six<00:02:10.090> mint<00:02:10.420> leaves

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
let's say about five or six mint leaves

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.570 
let's say about five or six mint leaves
here<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.290> then<00:02:11.950> what<00:02:12.040> we're<00:02:12.160> going<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.340> do<00:02:12.489> is

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
here and then what we're going to do is

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.520 
here and then what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:12.700> going<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.849> roll<00:02:13.150> them<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:14.349> we're<00:02:14.440> going

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
we're going to roll them so we're going

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.630 
we're going to roll them so we're going
to<00:02:14.650> roll<00:02:14.860> them<00:02:15.129> into<00:02:15.900> kind<00:02:16.900> of<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:17.110> little

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
to roll them into kind of a little

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.350 
to roll them into kind of a little
little<00:02:18.640> roll<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:20.849> then<00:02:21.849> what<00:02:22.000> we're<00:02:22.120> going<00:02:22.239> to

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
little roll and then what we're going to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.759 
little roll and then what we're going to
do<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:22.599> we're<00:02:22.690> going<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.840> slice<00:02:23.170> through<00:02:23.200> that

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
do is we're going to slice through that

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.490 
do is we're going to slice through that
role<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.040> when<00:02:24.340> we<00:02:24.459> do<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:26.290> actually

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
role and when we do that it's actually

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.430 
role and when we do that it's actually
going<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:26.830> make<00:02:27.010> little<00:02:27.400> mint<00:02:27.959> ribbons<00:02:28.959> little

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
going to make little mint ribbons little

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.309 
going to make little mint ribbons little
strips<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.980> mint<00:02:30.250> which<00:02:31.060> makes<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.660> kind<00:02:32.290> of

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
strips of mint which makes it kind of

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.830 
strips of mint which makes it kind of
prettier<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.220> little<00:02:33.819> easier<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.299> put<00:02:34.629> into

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
prettier and a little easier to put into

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.370 
prettier and a little easier to put into
the<00:02:35.260> dates<00:02:36.360> let's<00:02:37.360> just<00:02:37.390> slice<00:02:37.870> through<00:02:38.110> those

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
the dates let's just slice through those

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.870 
the dates let's just slice through those
pieces<00:02:39.040> of<00:02:39.250> mint<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.780> now<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:42.489> can<00:02:42.640> see<00:02:42.849> that

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
pieces of mint so now you can see that

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.910 
pieces of mint so now you can see that
we've<00:02:43.120> got<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.930> know<00:02:44.019> sort<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.290> these<00:02:44.440> ribbons

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
we've got you know sort of these ribbons

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.420 
we've got you know sort of these ribbons
of<00:02:45.220> mint<00:02:46.079> so<00:02:47.079> then<00:02:47.260> we<00:02:47.380> start<00:02:47.650> assembling<00:02:48.190> so

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
of mint so then we start assembling so

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.650 
of mint so then we start assembling so
the<00:02:48.519> next<00:02:48.700> thing<00:02:48.849> we're<00:02:49.090> going<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.269> do<00:02:49.450> then<00:02:49.630> is

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
the next thing we're going to do then is

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.180 
the next thing we're going to do then is
we're<00:02:49.930> going<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.079> take<00:02:50.170> these<00:02:50.500> with<00:02:50.709> this<00:02:50.890> mint

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
we're going to take these with this mint

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.960 
we're going to take these with this mint
and<00:02:51.790> we're<00:02:52.120> just<00:02:52.269> going<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.420> take<00:02:52.630> maybe<00:02:53.970> three

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
and we're just going to take maybe three

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.210 
and we're just going to take maybe three
to<00:02:55.060> four<00:02:55.299> ribbons<00:02:55.660> at<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.989> most<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.560> put

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
to four ribbons at the most and put

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.970 
to four ribbons at the most and put
ribbons<00:02:57.700> inside<00:02:58.239> each<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.079> each<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.560> the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
ribbons inside each of the each of the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.080 
ribbons inside each of the each of the
dates<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.620> we<00:03:02.739> have<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:03.040> nice<00:03:03.370> these<00:03:03.849> nice

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
dates so we have this nice these nice

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.180 
dates so we have this nice these nice
green<00:03:04.390> ribbons<00:03:04.780> going<00:03:05.110> through<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.440> bottom

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
green ribbons going through the bottom

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.030 
green ribbons going through the bottom
of<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:07.239> date<00:03:07.450> inside<00:03:08.079> that<00:03:08.319> little<00:03:08.440> slip<00:03:08.860> that

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
of the date inside that little slip that

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.000 
of the date inside that little slip that
we<00:03:09.220> created<00:03:11.280> we<00:03:12.280> have<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.579> be<00:03:12.730> all<00:03:14.010> perfect

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
we created we have to be all perfect

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.129 
we created we have to be all perfect
about<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:15.459> just<00:03:15.579> get<00:03:15.880> them<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.299> there<00:03:16.600> it's

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
about it just get them in there it's

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.240 
about it just get them in there it's
actually<00:03:17.230> kind<00:03:17.410> of<00:03:17.560> nice<00:03:17.709> when<00:03:17.859> some<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.160> the

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
actually kind of nice when some of the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.129 
actually kind of nice when some of the
green<00:03:18.549> kind<00:03:19.180> of<00:03:19.269> sticks<00:03:19.510> out<00:03:19.630> a<00:03:19.690> little<00:03:19.840> bit

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
green kind of sticks out a little bit

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.770 
green kind of sticks out a little bit
because<00:03:20.380> then<00:03:20.769> you<00:03:20.889> can<00:03:21.100> actually<00:03:21.850> see<00:03:22.269> the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
because then you can actually see the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.009 
because then you can actually see the
color<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:24.100> we're<00:03:24.250> going<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.430> put<00:03:24.579> that<00:03:25.019> green

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
color so we're going to put that green

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.140 
color so we're going to put that green
mint<00:03:26.290> in<00:03:26.500> there<00:03:26.680> now<00:03:27.220> what<00:03:27.519> we're<00:03:27.670> going<00:03:27.850> to<00:03:27.970> do

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
mint in there now what we're going to do

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.500 
mint in there now what we're going to do
is<00:03:28.530> we're<00:03:29.530> going<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.310> take<00:03:30.609> our<00:03:30.670> pomegranate

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
is we're going to take our pomegranate

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.800 
is we're going to take our pomegranate
seeds<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.079> place<00:03:32.739> on<00:03:32.980> top<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.370> this<00:03:33.489> now<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:35.370> am

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
seeds and place on top of this now I am

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.840 
seeds and place on top of this now I am
not<00:03:37.810> very<00:03:38.079> skilled<00:03:38.560> when<00:03:39.040> it<00:03:39.160> comes<00:03:39.459> to

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
not very skilled when it comes to

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.620 
not very skilled when it comes to
actually<00:03:40.450> seeding<00:03:40.959> an<00:03:41.079> actual<00:03:41.530> pomegranate

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
actually seeding an actual pomegranate

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.449

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
that have already been seated so that's

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.910 
that have already been seated so that's
what<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:57.970> do<00:03:58.030> that's<00:03:58.120> my<00:03:58.389> little<00:03:58.599> my<00:03:59.349> lord<00:03:59.590> cheat
