00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:21.450
 because all the villas when they give you their 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.790
 mobile and the flames all have 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.820
 exactly the same exactly what 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.820
 same 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.220
 why 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.050
 you're the only bastard who would support me 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.340
 and then I would not call back when 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.340
 it's only true and also 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.960
 no way 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.780
 when you step on tv3 cooking 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.690
 because if you do not get up 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.400
 fifty 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.900
 yes 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.900
 this is something very different 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.700
 with this 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:51.329
 like windows windows home search 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.329
 all files or folders 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:06.960
 hence the name and there you did not find it 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.960
 with what we are benton explained 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.740
 It is ideal to look for a life without having 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.740
 bodies 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:29.810
 and because 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.239
