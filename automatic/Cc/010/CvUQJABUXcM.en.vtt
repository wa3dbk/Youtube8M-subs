you will never burn out and this is

you will never burn out and this is
because<00:00:06.750> full<00:00:07.109> body<00:00:07.319> training<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.890> hundred

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
because full body training is a hundred

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.440 
because full body training is a hundred

matters is time intervals all right with
full<00:00:31.199> body<00:00:31.320> training<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.160> train<00:00:32.430> every<00:00:32.669> 48

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
full body training you train every 48

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.180 
full body training you train every 48
hours<00:00:33.300> ok<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.140> if<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.530> feel<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.040> you're<00:00:35.160> not

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
hours ok and if you feel that you're not

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.160 
hours ok and if you feel that you're not
recovering<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.180> time<00:00:36.390> frame<00:00:36.630> guess<00:00:36.930> what

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
recovering that time frame guess what

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.619 
recovering that time frame guess what
you<00:00:37.710> take<00:00:37.920> another<00:00:38.160> day<00:00:38.370> off<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:39.480> you're

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
you take another day off and then you're

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.630 
you take another day off and then you're
all<00:00:39.780> good<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.649> that's<00:00:40.800> not<00:00:41.070> enough<00:00:41.219> well

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
all good what if that's not enough well

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.250 
all good what if that's not enough well
guess<00:00:41.820> what<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.090> take<00:00:42.239> another<00:00:42.480> day<00:00:42.690> off<00:00:42.809> you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
guess what you take another day off you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.380 
guess what you take another day off you
see<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.309> way<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.879> respect

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
see so in that way in that respect

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.779 
see so in that way in that respect
you're<00:00:46.079> getting<00:00:46.379> maximum<00:00:46.789> training

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
you're getting maximum training

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.330 
you're getting maximum training
frequency<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> could<00:00:49.230> train<00:00:49.410> Monday<00:00:49.829> right

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
frequency so I could train Monday right

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.670 
frequency so I could train Monday right
I<00:00:50.370> rest<00:00:50.850> 48<00:00:51.180> hours<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.629> Wednesday<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.320> then

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
I rest 48 hours is Wednesday and then

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.130 
I rest 48 hours is Wednesday and then
maybe<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.309> rest<00:00:53.640> another<00:00:53.820> 48<00:00:54.210> hours<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.600> Friday

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
maybe I rest another 48 hours is Friday

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.770 
maybe I rest another 48 hours is Friday
it<00:00:55.500> looks<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.309> I'm<00:00:56.579> rigidly<00:00:56.969> doing<00:00:57.420> Monday

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
it looks like I'm rigidly doing Monday

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.420 
it looks like I'm rigidly doing Monday
Wednesday<00:00:58.140> Friday<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:58.649> as<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.829> matter<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.129> fact

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
Wednesday Friday but as a matter of fact

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.540 
Wednesday Friday but as a matter of fact
I'm<00:00:59.640> just<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.870> by<00:01:01.140> my<00:01:01.289> own<00:01:01.469> recovery<00:01:01.829> now

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
I'm just going by my own recovery now

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.340 
I'm just going by my own recovery now
this<00:01:02.910> could<00:01:03.030> obviously<00:01:03.420> change<00:01:03.719> let's<00:01:04.170> say<00:01:04.290> I

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
this could obviously change let's say I

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
this could obviously change let's say I
train<00:01:04.680> Monday<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.369> then<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.760> takes<00:01:05.939> me<00:01:06.090> more

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
train Monday and then it takes me more

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.730 
train Monday and then it takes me more
than<00:01:06.420> 48<00:01:06.780> hours<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> train<00:01:07.560> on

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
than 48 hours so I have to train on

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.620 
than 48 hours so I have to train on
Thursday<00:01:08.040> well<00:01:08.460> that's<00:01:08.610> fine<00:01:08.850> too<00:01:09.090> but<00:01:09.330> guess

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
Thursday well that's fine too but guess

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.440 
Thursday well that's fine too but guess
what<00:01:09.960> by<00:01:10.650> training<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.220> style<00:01:11.580> I'm<00:01:11.909> fully

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
what by training this style I'm fully

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.240 
what by training this style I'm fully
recovered<00:01:12.659> but<00:01:13.439> I'm<00:01:13.560> still<00:01:13.860> getting<00:01:13.979> more

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
recovered but I'm still getting more

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.880 
recovered but I'm still getting more
frequency<00:01:14.909> than<00:01:15.180> any<00:01:15.420> upper<00:01:15.689> lower<00:01:16.020> or<00:01:16.409> split

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
frequency than any upper lower or split

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.640 
frequency than any upper lower or split
routine<00:01:17.220> combined<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:18.229> know<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.380> sounds

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
