00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.660
 the situation in the Canary Islands at the beginning 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.070
 of the 20th century was not especially serious 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.200
 since on the islands it was 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.540
 producing at that time a boom 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.180
 economic growth thanks to the expansion of 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.230
 tomato cultivation banana or potato 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.439
 and according to newspaper of the time 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.369
 in this country the worker earned a lot 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.419
 money the worker was 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.920
 rewarded his work that was a 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.940
 very hard work in many cases were 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.949
 humble people who were extremely 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.360
 exploited 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.239
 Canary immigration in those years 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.220
 had a high capacity to return the 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.500
 70 percent of migrants Acuba 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.140
 they returned to the islands 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.720
 the ship starred in another curious act 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.250
 when performing revolving maneuvers for 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.489
 leave the pier of santa cruz de la 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.210
 palm in full maneuver in the process of 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.730
 retirement occurs an unusual event is 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.710
 loses the chain and loses the anchor 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.070
 that are left at the bottom of the fence 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:11.560
 holy cross of the palm and the day came in 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.560
 We left for Santiago de Cuba 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.080
 Santiago de Cuba is the second city 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.120
 most important of the Republic of Cuba 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.400
 located east of the island was capital 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.560
 of the old eastern province and 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.610
 currently it is from the province of 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.140
 same name 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.200
 my grandfather since I was little 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.270
 story that from his departure from there 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.300
 Spain and its arrival in Cuba 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.009
 he left there when the 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.130
 service and the call to service 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.189
 military on the balvanera ship 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.009
 and when I enter santiago de cuba the 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.500
 fence they got off and we headed 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.049
 to the provincial historical archive of 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.630
 Sancti SpÃ­ritus where very kindly 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.130
 Access our request to see 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:03.850
 the phoenix diary 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.850
 Friday, September 19 , 1919 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.069
 the tragic news is confirmed and 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.769
 unfortunately what we always knew 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.440
 of him is that he took his life because he 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.780
 could live without his family because he said 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.180
 that they had not seen it so 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.099
 believes that he died in the wreck and 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.470
 when you submerge yourself there you get into that 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.750
 world seems as if it will move you in the 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.720
 weather 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.940
 and really just to tell it , it seems that 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.910
 They make your hair stand on end and 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.580
 many times the port closes 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.320
 and in others it does not get to close but 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.900
 I even recommend it to captains 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.170
 let the tragedy of the sea go to sea 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.300
 valvanera must not fall into oblivion is 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.340
 a chapter that helps to understand the 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.360
 sufferings and anguish of the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.360
 Canary emigration
