the success of the chaturbate what we

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.799 
the success of the chaturbate what we
tried<00:00:34.769> to<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:35.309> tried<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.580> take<00:00:35.699> the<00:00:36.480> best

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
tried to do is we tried to take the best

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.020 
tried to do is we tried to take the best
aspects<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> chaturbate<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.400> make<00:00:38.879> it

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
aspects of the chaturbate and make it

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.250 
aspects of the chaturbate and make it
even<00:00:39.180> better<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.540> that's<00:00:39.750> what<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.019> came<00:00:40.199> up

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
even better and that's what we came up

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.500 
even better and that's what we came up
with<00:00:40.589> with<00:00:40.830> the<00:00:40.949> lover<00:00:41.159> and<00:00:41.400> if<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.150> look<00:00:42.330> at

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
with with the lover and if you look at

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.539 
with with the lover and if you look at
it<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.839> kind<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.830> sort<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.250> looks<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.430> a

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:44.549 
it it kind of sort of looks like a

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:46.070 
it it kind of sort of looks like a
vibrating<00:00:45.059> jig<00:00:45.269> but<00:00:45.479> it's<00:00:45.570> got<00:00:45.720> a<00:00:45.750> little<00:00:45.870> bit

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
vibrating jig but it's got a little bit

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.469 
vibrating jig but it's got a little bit
different<00:00:46.379> concept<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.670> key<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:47.970> this

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:48.479 
different concept but the key on this

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:51.380 
different concept but the key on this
bait<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.500> position<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.220> lip<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:51.150> bite

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
bait is the position in the lip the bite

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.570 
bait is the position in the lip the bite
the<00:00:51.659> vibration<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.949> ability<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.460> get

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
the vibration and the ability to get

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.250 
the vibration and the ability to get
through<00:00:53.790> cover<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:54.720> you<00:00:54.809> look<00:00:54.989> at<00:00:55.110> that

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
through cover so if you look at that

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.200 
through cover so if you look at that
thing<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:56.040> can<00:00:56.190> see<00:00:56.400> it's<00:00:56.519> got<00:00:56.670> kind<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.059> what

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
thing you can see it's got kind of what

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.600 
thing you can see it's got kind of what
i<00:00:57.239> call<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.659> reverse<00:00:58.140> lip<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.979> what<00:00:59.460> that

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
i call a reverse lip on it and what that

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.590 
i call a reverse lip on it and what that
thing<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.820> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.089> do<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.390> going<00:01:00.420> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
thing is going to do it's going to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.570 
thing is going to do it's going to
provide<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.170> vibration<00:01:01.799> but<00:01:02.400> more

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
provide the vibration but more

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.250 
provide the vibration but more
importantly<00:01:03.089> than<00:01:03.150> that<00:01:03.269> it's<00:01:03.839> going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.229> a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
importantly than that it's going to be a

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
importantly than that it's going to be a
deflector<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.610> look<00:01:05.760> at<00:01:05.909> that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
deflector you know if you look at that

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.300 
deflector you know if you look at that
thing<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.720> kind<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.080> looks<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.650> shovel<00:01:08.220> or

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
thing it kind of looks like a shovel or

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.090 
thing it kind of looks like a shovel or
a<00:01:08.430> sled<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.510> imagine<00:01:09.810> what<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> shovel<00:01:10.469> or<00:01:10.710> sleds

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
a sled so imagine what a shovel or sleds

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.069 
a sled so imagine what a shovel or sleds
going<00:01:11.219> to<00:01:11.430> do<00:01:11.520> coming<00:01:11.909> through<00:01:12.060> cover<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.960> if

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079 
going to do coming through cover so if

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.010 
going to do coming through cover so if
its<00:01:13.229> wood<00:01:13.530> if<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:14.250> rock<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:14.789> it's<00:01:14.939> docks<00:01:15.270> that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
its wood if it's rock if it's docks that

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.020 
its wood if it's rock if it's docks that
thing's<00:01:16.289> going<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> deflect<00:01:16.950> i<00:01:17.219> can<00:01:17.789> tell<00:01:17.969> you

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
thing's going to deflect i can tell you

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.999 
thing's going to deflect i can tell you
i<00:01:18.090> started<00:01:18.509> using<00:01:18.689> prototypes<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.649> this<00:01:19.799> thing

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
i started using prototypes of this thing

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.310 
i started using prototypes of this thing
about<00:01:20.219> a<00:01:20.280> year<00:01:20.579> ago<00:01:20.609> and<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.570> fact<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> latest

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
about a year ago and in fact the latest

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.230 
about a year ago and in fact the latest
version<00:01:22.469> i<00:01:22.770> use<00:01:22.979> at<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.189> flw<00:01:23.880> turn<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.149> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
version i use at the flw turn on the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.539 
version i use at the flw turn on the
potomac<00:01:24.750> i<00:01:24.960> almost<00:01:25.500> want<00:01:25.829> it<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.250> bait

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
potomac i almost want it with this bait

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.179 
potomac i almost want it with this bait
and<00:01:26.789> the<00:01:27.210> whole<00:01:27.420> key<00:01:27.719> was<00:01:28.350> letting<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.829> love<00:01:29.070> or

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
and the whole key was letting it love or

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.580 
and the whole key was letting it love or
get<00:01:29.399> into<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.729> grass<00:01:29.969> using<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.049> lip<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.560> a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
get into the grass using that lip as a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.069 
get into the grass using that lip as a
deflector<00:01:32.219> and<00:01:32.399> then<00:01:32.789> ripping<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:33.359> you

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
deflector and then ripping it out you

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.010 
deflector and then ripping it out you
know<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> small<00:01:34.829> compact<00:01:35.219> bait<00:01:35.789> that<00:01:36.390> cast<00:01:36.719> like

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
know a small compact bait that cast like

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.230 
know a small compact bait that cast like
