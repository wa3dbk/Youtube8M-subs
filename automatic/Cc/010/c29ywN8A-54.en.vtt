 rounds using only cups 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.980
 disposable plastic 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.810

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.590
 improvised ways you make the 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.130
 four 180 ml disposable cups and 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.619
 thirty- two plastic cups of 50 ml 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.200
 It should be remembered that packages with 100 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.330
 units of each glass costs between three and 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.580

 big glass with strawberry juice 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.250
 the remaining liquid should be stored 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.989
 in the refrigerator because we're going to use it 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:24.050
 then in box a stack in the 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.730
 center of each glass with juice bruni all 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.260

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.870
 the juice is still soft go back to the freezer 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.090
 for another 20 minutes and if you are very 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.310
 frozen you can put a bit of 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.750
 warm water in the cups to facilitate the 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.400
 process

 space so you can end with 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.800
 bone that is stored in the refrigerator 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.900
