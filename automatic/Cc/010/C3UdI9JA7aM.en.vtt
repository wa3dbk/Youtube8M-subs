00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.150 

this<00:01:39.750> foundation<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:40.410> buildable<00:01:41.010> so

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
this foundation is really buildable so

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.620 
this foundation is really buildable so
I'd<00:01:41.250> recommend<00:01:41.400> doing<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.000> thin<00:01:42.150> layer<00:01:42.330> first

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
I'd recommend doing it thin layer first

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.750 
I'd recommend doing it thin layer first
and<00:01:42.960> then<00:01:43.080> adding<00:01:43.470> more<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.860> want<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.250> when

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
and then adding more if you want to when

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.980 
and then adding more if you want to when

I<00:02:15.980> personally<00:02:16.940> find<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.450> if<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.630> frown<00:02:17.900> it's

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
I personally find that if I frown it's

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:27.880 
I personally find that if I frown it's
easier<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.590> find<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.920> arch

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.510 
and then to soften the powder that I've
just<00:02:29.780> applied<00:02:30.170> I'm<00:02:30.650> going<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.010> use<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.370> brown

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520

rhythm<00:02:33.260> again<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.650> find<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:33.920> this<00:02:34.069> just<00:02:34.340> makes

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520
