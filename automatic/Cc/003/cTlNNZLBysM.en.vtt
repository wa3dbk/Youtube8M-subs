00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.280 
intact the plastic is so thin and often
shatters<00:00:36.760> and<00:00:36.910> shipping<00:00:37.180> so<00:00:37.780> you<00:00:37.809> can<00:00:37.989> end<00:00:38.170> up

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
shatters and shipping so you can end up

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.229

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
are both a bit odd one is a big monitor

are both a bit odd one is a big monitor
that<00:03:52.670> shows<00:03:52.940> John<00:03:53.240> Blackstar<00:03:53.900> however<00:03:54.740> it

that shows John Blackstar however it
almost<00:03:55.550> looks<00:03:55.760> like<00:03:55.850> a<00:03:55.940> big<00:03:56.180> portrait<00:03:56.660> which

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
almost looks like a big portrait which

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.980 
almost looks like a big portrait which
is<00:03:57.590> kind<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:58.010> weird<00:03:58.270> even<00:03:59.270> weirder<00:03:59.690> is<00:03:59.870> the

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
is kind of weird even weirder is the

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.750 
is kind of weird even weirder is the
insert<00:04:00.350> on<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.530> left<00:04:00.860> which<00:04:01.190> has<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.370> drawing

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
of the Vizier on it this easily becomes

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.250 
of the Vizier on it this easily becomes
odd<00:04:04.730> when<00:04:05.000> you<00:04:05.090> have<00:04:05.270> the<00:04:05.390> actual<00:04:05.570> Vizier

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
odd when you have the actual Vizier

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.740 
odd when you have the actual Vizier
standing<00:04:06.770> there<00:04:06.950> like<00:04:07.850> perhaps<00:04:08.450> he<00:04:08.600> has<00:04:08.720> a

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
standing there like perhaps he has a

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.530 
standing there like perhaps he has a
cardboard<00:04:09.350> standee<00:04:09.860> upstairs<00:04:10.390> there's<00:04:11.390> no

elevator or staircase either to get the

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.740 
elevator or staircase either to get the

characters from one level to the other
inside<00:04:15.470> or<00:04:15.739> out<00:04:15.950> so<00:04:16.850> what's<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.180> final

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
inside or out so what's the final

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.690 
inside or out so what's the final
verdict<00:04:17.840> well<00:04:18.620> much<00:04:18.890> like<00:04:18.919> snake<00:04:19.340> mountain

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700
