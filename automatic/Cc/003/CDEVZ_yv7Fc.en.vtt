partially the bang for the blue whale
size<00:00:49.999> their<00:00:50.449> diet<00:00:50.659> consists<00:00:51.140> of<00:00:51.199> tiny<00:00:51.499> little

now<00:00:54.050> as<00:00:54.199> you<00:00:54.319> can<00:00:54.409> imagine<00:00:54.469> whales<00:00:55.010> need<00:00:55.309> tons

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
now as you can imagine whales need tons

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.759 
now as you can imagine whales need tons
of<00:00:55.879> energy<00:00:56.059> to<00:00:56.329> stay<00:00:56.510> healthy<00:00:56.690> I<00:00:57.050> mean<00:00:57.469> they

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
of energy to stay healthy I mean they

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.590 
of energy to stay healthy I mean they
literally<00:00:58.159> have<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.519> heart<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.909> size<00:00:59.089> of<00:00:59.510> a

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
literally have a heart the size of a

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.809 
literally have a heart the size of a
small<00:00:59.899> car<00:01:00.199> so<00:01:00.679> why<00:01:01.039> do<00:01:01.100> they<00:01:01.249> choose<00:01:01.519> some<00:01:01.729> of

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:01.819 
small car so why do they choose some of

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:03.369 
small car so why do they choose some of
the<00:01:01.909> smallest<00:01:02.239> animals<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.989> eat

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
the smallest animals to eat

the smallest animals to eat
blue<00:01:03.649> whales<00:01:03.829> rely<00:01:04.159> on<00:01:04.190> a<00:01:04.370> technique<00:01:04.730> called

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
blue whales rely on a technique called

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.730 
blue whales rely on a technique called
lunge<00:01:05.330> feeding<00:01:05.600> where<00:01:05.930> they<00:01:06.020> race<00:01:06.350> towards<00:01:06.680> a
