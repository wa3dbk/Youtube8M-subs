00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.040
 Well highlighter akin here today would like 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.910
 I have a cheap control monitor 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.910
 show sentence 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.730
 yes, the device is around today 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.279
 is this here that I join 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.210
 ebay bought the there is between 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.939
 25 and 35 euros to buy is actually 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.150
 for the motor vehicle area thought there I take 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.550
 attached to the headrests so that the 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.550
 driver behind any movies 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.970
 or somehow players 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.940
 can connect and play with it 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.140
 This engine is seven inches tall and 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.300
 what is he good for? 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.219
 well in my case it is like that me 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.530
 such an idea that just records me 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.870
 unfortunately, no 3d display has so i 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.609
 I can see myself if I'm in the picture 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.199
 am or if the picture at all 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.850
 is or not 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:02.210
 and on the other hand it is even if it is one 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.630
 3d display would have this powered display 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.400
 of course shows plus 3 inches tall and 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.500
 if you are now a little further to the right 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.420
 with the camera then that is the whole 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.490
 somehow confusing you see yourself 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.800
 Not everything is too small or you 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.120
 the camera somehow keeps me here and 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.180
 then of course you have some 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.950
 information on this display about 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.380
 date time and so on and so forth 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.430
 where then of course the picture was 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.490
 is recorded even smaller times 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.800
 now it is so here it is 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.400
 There are displays that can be so beautiful or 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.840
 Of course, in this case I only have 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.390
 provisionally attached, so to speak 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.680
 the cord can be entertaining now 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.170
 this camera mount 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.820
 then you can start talking and yourself 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.390
 check it now and then 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.490
 this monitor why the whole 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.930
 Of course, control means it is now 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.960
 Of course, no full-fledged 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.630
 control monitor because the professional 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.190
 devices cost from 200 euros upwards 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.140
 then all members have connections 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.750
 from hdmi about composite dvs video everything 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.280
 possible and also a battery in the back so 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.379
 that you have no electricity anywhere 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.410
 then you have to get this device 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:17.520
 even as it is hanging somewhere 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.440
 screw because they too 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.840
 tripod thread on it below have underneath 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.340
 and then of course we can talk about it 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.340
 In this case, it is so here 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.080
 his avatar has that is here then 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.560
 connected cable of the way in the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.350
 scope of delivery with it this leads then 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.360
 to such composite plug in this 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.790
 case it is two or ballenstedter like 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.740
 you always want to call although 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.200
 because I can do two here 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.750
 Connect recording devices and 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.760
 could then over this button here 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.420
 between these two 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.790
 Switching devices switch 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.010
 as is a remote control in the same way 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.720
 scope of supply thereby one thereby possibly 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.630
 if now the whole far away 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.100
 is zack zack inconspicuous presses one 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.710
 on it and then sees each one 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.180
 Camera as records or how must I 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.880
 put me down with that too 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.820
 The whole thing goes on then 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.340
 here and that to this stream and 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.460
 Cable this must normally 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.200
 on the car to the circuit of the synonymous 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.030
 we are connected here 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.850
 Unfortunately, in the apartment in the apartment no 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:25.290
 car that's why I have it all here 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:28.650
 such a power supply to these then with 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.000
 a shrink also secured with it there 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.390
 nothing can happen 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.450
 and so important is a power supply that 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.850
 you actually look at every electrical shop for 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.620
 Paul could buy around 50 my case was 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.510
 it so that he had a home at random 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.459
 that you just take care that this 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.160
 output 12 volt direct current and 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.290
 at least the amper number has this 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:59.240
 motor of course does not need closes 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:59.240
 now just this here and now 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:09.739
 and now you see that of course 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:13.910
 monitor is running now if this 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:16.340
 Composite also plug in the cable 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.109
 brings what belongs in this camera 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:26.690
 and that is here 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:38.960
 this av slot and here ours 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:43.160
 yellow cable a moment please now 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.430
 can you be yourself I show 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.470
 now for a short time also the 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.220
 difference so the difference is 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.410
 Of course, here you have much more 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.580
 picture in contrast stand here now 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.340
 can you imagine 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.110
 this distance is where now that 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.340
 whole zoomed in here should be yes 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.370
 still imagine that you can still 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.560
 is a bit further away and so 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.630
 then of course that is much more comfortable 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.120
 you can just go on how 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.700
 It is just under the camera 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.639
 so that weber himself in the monitor 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.340
 so that the viewer himself looks in 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.780
 this case has not been sitting since her 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.599
 that we are actually there from that 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.729
 image looks out and is clear when I 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.560
 Now a bigger monitor TV 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.510
 or anything will stand where 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.970
 Of course that's stupid if I'm constantly 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:36.050
 I have to turn around so I can completely 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:38.150
 easy on it to look here just that 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.710
 problem is all these cables 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.479
 So that bothers me frankly 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.000
 a little more would be better if I did 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.500
 could find a battery solution here what 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.950
 Of course I will also be here now 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.710
 I think there is something like me on the 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.450
 can do the best and I am therefore 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.599
 I'll have another solution again 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.669
 about it in that sense if you 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.620
 we keep asking here have or 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.310
 anything else is just setting me up 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.360
 the questions 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.360
 see you soon
