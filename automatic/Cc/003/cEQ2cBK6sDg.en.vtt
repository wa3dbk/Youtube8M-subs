00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
idea if I'm pronouncing that right and

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.799 
idea if I'm pronouncing that right and
if<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.620> had<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.889> guess<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.280> wouldn't<00:00:14.790> be<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.240> am

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
if I had to guess I wouldn't be I am

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.790 
if I had to guess I wouldn't be I am
using<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.760> dlc<00:00:17.760> for<00:00:18.170> gemstone<00:00:19.170> version<00:00:19.680> of

using the dlc for gemstone version of

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.980 
using the dlc for gemstone version of
this<00:00:19.949> gun<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:20.699> called<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.970> citrine<00:00:21.539> die

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
this gun so it's called a citrine die

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.620 
this gun so it's called a citrine die
OOP<00:00:22.199> but<00:00:22.890> I'm<00:00:23.010> using<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.519> with<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:24.000> damaged

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
OOP but I'm using it with a damaged

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.560 
OOP but I'm using it with a damaged
prefix<00:00:25.109> as<00:00:25.350> well<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> only

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
prefix as well and so this is the only

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.450 
prefix as well and so this is the only
gun<00:00:27.840> i'm<00:00:27.960> going<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.170> use<00:00:28.380> other<00:00:28.769> than<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
gun i'm going to use other than the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.250 
gun i'm going to use other than the
trespasser<00:00:29.970> which<00:00:30.269> I've<00:00:30.420> already<00:00:30.539> got<00:00:31.050> done

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
trespasser which I've already got done

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.530 
trespasser which I've already got done
using<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.980> knock<00:00:32.250> off<00:00:32.460> beats<00:00:32.730> face<00:00:33.000> shield<00:00:33.329> and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
using to knock off beats face shield and

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.600 
using to knock off beats face shield and
then<00:00:34.200> i'll<00:00:34.320> go<00:00:34.469> ahead<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:35.130> try<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.370> kill

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
then i'll go ahead and just try to kill

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.360 
then i'll go ahead and just try to kill
Pete<00:00:36.140> you<00:00:37.140> know<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> whole<00:00:37.500> way<00:00:37.710> down<00:00:37.739> using

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
Pete you know the whole way down using

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.340 
Pete you know the whole way down using
critical<00:00:38.820> ascension<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.480> zeros<00:00:40.110> other

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
critical ascension and zeros other

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.970 
critical ascension and zeros other
sniping<00:00:40.920> boost<00:00:41.180> now<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.750> gun<00:00:43.020> isn't<00:00:43.320> optimal

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
sniping boost now this gun isn't optimal

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.760 
sniping boost now this gun isn't optimal
obviously<00:00:44.700> because<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.300> doesn't<00:00:45.629> fire<00:00:46.440> too

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
obviously because it doesn't fire too

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.770 
obviously because it doesn't fire too
fast<00:00:47.039> obviously<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.879> single<00:00:48.180> fire<00:00:48.360> weapon

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
fast obviously it's a single fire weapon

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.680 
fast obviously it's a single fire weapon
but<00:00:49.379> because<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.610> flat<00:00:51.120> off<00:00:51.300> barrel

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
but because it is the flat off barrel

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.540 
but because it is the flat off barrel
Jacobs<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.590> still<00:00:52.800> fire<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.219> pretty

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
Jacobs I can still fire it pretty

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.910 
Jacobs I can still fire it pretty
quickly<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.140> try<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> keep<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.800> online

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
quickly and I can try to keep it online

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.549 
quickly and I can try to keep it online
as<00:00:56.340> well<00:00:56.489> as<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.329> don't<00:00:57.840> get<00:00:58.020> good<00:00:58.199> slack

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
as well as I can I don't get good slack

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.310 
as well as I can I don't get good slack
luck<00:00:58.859> early<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.489> fight<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.719> did

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
luck early in this fight but I did

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.930 
luck early in this fight but I did
pretty<00:01:01.500> well<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.010> end<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> fight<00:01:02.489> once

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
pretty well at the end of the fight once

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.820 
pretty well at the end of the fight once
I<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.300> all<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.600> critical<00:01:03.899> asim<00:01:04.170> context<00:01:04.589> but

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
I have all the critical asim context but

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.270 
I have all the critical asim context but
I<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.010> go<00:01:05.970> ahead<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.210> pick<00:01:06.360> up<00:01:06.659> hearing<00:01:06.990> this

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
I do go ahead and pick up hearing this

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.570 
I do go ahead and pick up hearing this
it<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.490> good<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.090> don't<00:01:09.750> run<00:01:09.960> out<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.110> ammo

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
it is good that I don't run out of ammo

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.730 
it is good that I don't run out of ammo
during<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.700> fight<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.840> don't<00:01:13.380> even<00:01:13.470> have

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
during this fight I just don't even have

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.499 
during this fight I just don't even have
to<00:01:13.830> pick<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.159> any<00:01:14.369> extra<00:01:14.610> ammo<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.360> had

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
to pick up any extra ammo because I had

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.840 
to pick up any extra ammo because I had
enough<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.950> simple<00:01:17.220> stockpile

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
enough with just a simple stockpile

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.450 
enough with just a simple stockpile
relic<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.830> works<00:01:20.009> out<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.189> well

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
relic and so that works out really well

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.219 
relic and so that works out really well
and<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.090> don't<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.540> bother<00:01:21.780> with<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
and you don't have to bother with the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.980 
and you don't have to bother with the
ammo<00:01:22.590> cases<00:01:23.430> at<00:01:23.580> all<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.970> was<00:01:24.390> actually<00:01:24.570> kind<00:01:24.930> of

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
ammo cases at all I was actually kind of

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.480 
ammo cases at all I was actually kind of
expecting<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.830> bother<00:01:26.100> with<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
expecting to have to bother with the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.490 
expecting to have to bother with the
ammo<00:01:26.759> cases<00:01:27.150> but<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> was<00:01:27.930> able<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.290> stack

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
ammo cases but I was able to stack

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.990 
ammo cases but I was able to stack
critical<00:01:28.920> ascension<00:01:29.310> pretty<00:01:29.520> efficiently

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
critical ascension pretty efficiently

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.030 
critical ascension pretty efficiently
with<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.420> gun<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.619> reason<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:32.009> doing

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
with this gun and the reason I'm doing

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.010 
with this gun and the reason I'm doing
this<00:01:32.310> kill<00:01:32.640> today<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.090> someone<00:01:33.479> asked<00:01:33.720> me<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:33.900> I

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
this kill today is someone asked me if I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.230 
this kill today is someone asked me if I
could<00:01:34.049> kill<00:01:34.380> Pete<00:01:34.619> with<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> Jacob<00:01:35.610> single<00:01:36.030> fire

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
could kill Pete with a Jacob single fire

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.910 
could kill Pete with a Jacob single fire
weapon<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.290> figured<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.740> would

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
weapon and I figured this would

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.499 
weapon and I figured this would
definitely<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.640> best<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.299> that

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
definitely be the best one to do that

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.910 
definitely be the best one to do that
