 much of the student artist in several 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.090
 aspects are for example the material 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.890
 it's all special is all produced 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.320
 specifically for this type of 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.690
 work then the specific role of 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.330
 watercolor paints also non-brushes

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.860
 the watercolor classes are weekly and all 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.570
 material is it is acquired at once 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.540
 then the maintenance manners are 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.700
 small but basically the paper that goes 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.380
 spend more and we also have to 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.480
