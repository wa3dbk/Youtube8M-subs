now<00:00:11.870> we're<00:00:12.650> here<00:00:12.740> to<00:00:12.770> show<00:00:12.950> you<00:00:13.010> our<00:00:13.160> muscles

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.550 
now we're here to show you our muscles

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.480 
now we're here to show you our muscles
work<00:00:13.760> and<00:00:14.389> what<00:00:14.750> they<00:00:14.870> do<00:00:14.930> now<00:00:15.770> only<00:00:15.980> one<00:00:16.309> of<00:00:16.340> us

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
work and what they do now only one of us

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.340 
work and what they do now only one of us
has<00:00:16.700> more<00:00:16.880> than<00:00:17.000> 600<00:00:17.240> muscles<00:00:17.540> who<00:00:18.200> do<00:00:18.290> you

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
has more than 600 muscles who do you

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.200 
has more than 600 muscles who do you
think<00:00:18.500> it<00:00:18.590> is<00:00:20.020> obviously<00:00:21.020> it's<00:00:21.230> me<00:00:21.670> no<00:00:22.670> it's<00:00:22.880> me

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
think it is obviously it's me no it's me

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.250 
think it is obviously it's me no it's me
I'm<00:00:23.660> a<00:00:23.720> lean<00:00:24.080> mean<00:00:24.110> muscular<00:00:25.070> machine

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
I'm a lean mean muscular machine

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.779 
I'm a lean mean muscular machine
actually<00:00:27.260> it<00:00:27.770> says<00:00:28.010> that<00:00:28.160> all<00:00:28.250> three<00:00:28.580> of<00:00:28.699> us

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
actually it says that all three of us

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.160 
actually it says that all three of us
have<00:00:28.970> more<00:00:29.150> into<00:00:29.270> six<00:00:29.480> our<00:00:29.630> muscles<00:00:30.020> in<00:00:30.109> our

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
have more into six our muscles in our

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.140 
have more into six our muscles in our
bodies<00:00:30.500> so<00:00:30.920> matter<00:00:31.160> how<00:00:31.340> it<00:00:31.490> looks<00:00:31.699> on<00:00:32.090> the

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
bodies so matter how it looks on the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.549 
bodies so matter how it looks on the
outside<00:00:32.660> we<00:00:32.840> all<00:00:32.960> have<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.140> same<00:00:33.170> number<00:00:33.410> of

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
outside we all have the same number of

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.799 
outside we all have the same number of
muscles<00:00:33.860> on<00:00:33.949> the<00:00:34.040> inside<00:00:34.070> oh<00:00:34.580> yeah<00:00:35.120> these

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
muscles on the inside oh yeah these

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.930 
muscles on the inside oh yeah these
muscles<00:00:36.260> keep<00:00:36.440> us<00:00:36.590> moving<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:37.400> even<00:00:37.580> those<00:00:37.760> do

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
muscles keep us moving and even those do

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.140 
muscles keep us moving and even those do
simple<00:00:38.330> tasks<00:00:38.750> like<00:00:38.780> brush<00:00:39.199> our<00:00:39.379> teeth<00:00:40.150> your

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
simple tasks like brush our teeth your

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.729 
simple tasks like brush our teeth your
biceps<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:41.780> triceps<00:00:41.840> aren't<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:42.590> only

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
biceps and triceps aren't the only

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.850 
biceps and triceps aren't the only
muscles<00:00:43.280> are<00:00:43.460> useful<00:00:44.079> also<00:00:45.079> it<00:00:45.530> says<00:00:45.680> that<00:00:45.800> we

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
muscles are useful also it says that we

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.170 
muscles are useful also it says that we
have<00:00:45.920> three<00:00:46.219> types<00:00:46.430> of<00:00:46.579> muscles<00:00:46.969> we<00:00:47.090> have

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
have three types of muscles we have

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.260 
have three types of muscles we have
smooth<00:00:47.540> cardiac<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:48.350> skeletal<00:00:49.000> whatever<00:00:50.000> I

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
smooth cardiac and skeletal whatever I

smooth cardiac and skeletal whatever I
have<00:00:50.510> cardiac<00:00:50.960> muscles<00:00:51.620> I<00:00:51.680> have<00:00:51.980> smooth

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
have cardiac muscles I have smooth

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.479 
have cardiac muscles I have smooth
muscles<00:00:53.329> one<00:00:54.260> of<00:00:54.379> these<00:00:54.620> beautiful<00:00:55.160> muscles

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
muscles one of these beautiful muscles

those are skeletal muscles skeletal
muscles<00:00:59.930> are<00:01:00.020> also<00:01:00.170> called<00:01:00.530> voluntary

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
muscles are also called voluntary

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.430 
muscles are also called voluntary
muscles<00:01:01.610> you<00:01:02.180> decide<00:01:02.539> when<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:02.989> how<00:01:03.050> to<00:01:03.170> move

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
muscles you decide when and how to move

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.260 
muscles you decide when and how to move
these<00:01:03.680> they<00:01:04.250> don't<00:01:04.430> move<00:01:04.580> them<00:01:04.820> us<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.089> make

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
these they don't move them us to make

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.150 
these they don't move them us to make
them<00:01:05.449> move<00:01:05.690> and<00:01:05.990> then<00:01:06.110> toss<00:01:06.410> your<00:01:06.619> bones<00:01:06.920> like

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
them move and then toss your bones like

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.969 
them move and then toss your bones like
ten<00:01:07.430> by<00:01:07.729> tendons<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:08.869> all<00:01:09.020> together<00:01:09.110> bones

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
ten by tendons so all together bones

tendons and muscles make your body know

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.170 
tendons and muscles make your body know
exactly<00:01:13.399> power<00:01:14.619> now<00:01:15.619> we're<00:01:15.920> talking<00:01:16.430> do<00:01:17.090> you

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
exactly power now we're talking do you

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.460 
exactly power now we're talking do you
know<00:01:17.299> that<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:17.630> move<00:01:17.780> your<00:01:17.900> muscles<00:01:18.020> whatever

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
know that you move your muscles whatever

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.060 
know that you move your muscles whatever
you<00:01:18.619> want

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
you want

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.719 
you want
I<00:01:19.100> do<00:01:20.560> voluntary<00:01:21.560> muscles<00:01:21.920> are<00:01:22.040> controlled<00:01:22.610> by

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
I do voluntary muscles are controlled by

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.120 
I do voluntary muscles are controlled by
parts<00:01:23.420> of<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:23.570> brain<00:01:23.780> like<00:01:24.500> when<00:01:24.680> you<00:01:24.799> decide

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
parts of the brain like when you decide

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.399 
parts of the brain like when you decide
the<00:01:25.280> move<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.850> move<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.600> brain<00:01:26.900> sends<00:01:27.259> an

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
the move to move the brain sends an

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.990 
the move to move the brain sends an
electrical<00:01:27.890> signal<00:01:28.100> through<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.490> spinal

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
electrical signal through the spinal

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.539 
electrical signal through the spinal
cord<00:01:29.210> via<00:01:29.780> nerves<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.500> muscles<00:01:31.009> causing

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
cord via nerves to the muscles causing

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.510 
cord via nerves to the muscles causing
them<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.850> contract<00:01:31.970> oh<00:01:32.770> yeah<00:01:33.770> I<00:01:34.040> remember<00:01:34.159> this

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
them to contract oh yeah I remember this

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.820 
them to contract oh yeah I remember this
from<00:01:35.330> minami<00:01:35.659> class<00:01:36.049> with<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.350> wonderful

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
from minami class with the wonderful

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.100 
from minami class with the wonderful
mrs.<00:01:37.009> capper<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.450> starts<00:01:38.720> on<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.869> small

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
mrs. capper so it starts on a small

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.050 
mrs. capper so it starts on a small
scale<00:01:39.350> with<00:01:39.590> individual<00:01:40.130> muscle<00:01:40.460> fibers<00:01:40.850> on

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
scale with individual muscle fibers on

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.370 
scale with individual muscle fibers on
or<00:01:41.799> myofibrils<00:01:42.939> here<00:01:43.939> let<00:01:44.390> me<00:01:44.450> show<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:44.689> so<00:01:45.229> it

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
or myofibrils here let me show you so it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.660 
or myofibrils here let me show you so it
starts<00:01:45.680> with<00:01:45.829> a<00:01:45.890> small<00:01:45.979> scale<00:01:46.369> with<00:01:46.579> the
