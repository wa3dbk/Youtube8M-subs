there's the application so let's go

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.289 
there's the application so let's go
ahead<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.470> use<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.829> picture<00:01:38.729> we'll<00:01:39.090> just

take a photo whatever's behind me we'll
use<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.759> that'll<00:01:42.630> work

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
use that that'll work

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.679 
use that that'll work
and<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.460> resize<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.299> like<00:01:45.450> that

and you can resize it just like that
we'll<00:01:46.380> make<00:01:46.530> sure<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.070> whole<00:01:47.310> square<00:01:47.700> is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
we'll make sure that the whole square is

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.469 
we'll make sure that the whole square is

or<00:01:55.409> draw<00:01:55.710> hi<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.009> guess<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.520> should<00:01:56.670> say<00:01:56.880> save

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
or draw hi I guess I should say save

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.010 
or draw hi I guess I should say save
that<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.670> then<00:01:59.670> down<00:01:59.850> here<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.420> where<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.990> can

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.770 
that and then down here is where you can
actually<00:02:01.649> type<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.520> icon<00:02:02.969> title<00:02:03.540> or<00:02:03.719> the

actually type in the icon title or the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.619 
actually type in the icon title or the
name<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> app<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.340> we'll<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.450> type<00:02:06.689> music

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
name of the app so we'll just type music

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.180

tunes

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.260 

and<00:02:13.420> this<00:02:14.420> is<00:02:14.600> where<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:14.870> can't<00:02:15.910> resize<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.180> or

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
music so I have a password on my music

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.520 
music so I have a password on my music
just<00:03:07.490> because<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:07.790> put<00:03:08.450> an<00:03:08.570> app<00:03:08.690> on<00:03:08.930> there<00:03:09.140> that

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
just because I put an app on there that

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.400 
just because I put an app on there that
locks<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.070> bunch<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.370> stuff<00:03:10.610> but<00:03:10.820> so<00:03:11.510> that's

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
locks a bunch of stuff but so that's

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.230 
locks a bunch of stuff but so that's
pretty<00:03:12.620> much<00:03:12.710> it<00:03:12.830> that's<00:03:13.220> what<00:03:13.460> I<00:03:13.640> conical

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
pretty much it that's what I conical

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.520 
pretty much it that's what I conical
does<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.780> it's<00:03:14.900> actually<00:03:15.170> pretty<00:03:15.350> cool

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
does and it's actually pretty cool

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.070 
does and it's actually pretty cool
especially<00:03:15.800> if<00:03:16.190> you<00:03:16.420> accidentally<00:03:17.420> upgraded

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
especially if you accidentally upgraded

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.220 
especially if you accidentally upgraded
