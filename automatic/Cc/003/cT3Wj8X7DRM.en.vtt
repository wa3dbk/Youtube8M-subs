00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.220
 one of Latin America in this video les 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.519
 I'm going to talk about features that 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.179
 they share all the cells ie 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.180
 common elements either cells 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.850
 vegetable animal bacteria cells 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.160
 Productivist or fungal cells 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.590
 more primitive cells more cells 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.990
 evolved the elements that I'm going 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.470
 to name now are elements that without 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.160
 import the classification of cells that 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.719
 you can do all the stores 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.059
 so that's why I'm going to use a 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.930
 I'm going to make you a very schematic 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.020
 simple for what 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.780
 do not keep in mind 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.780
 and realistic this in this way 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.040
 so that it is fine when it is the first 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.350
 element that all the 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.829
 cells 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.829
 a structure that is called a membrane 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.259
 mobile 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.760
 plasma 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.360
 cell membrane or plasma membrane 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.160
 basically the cell membrane or the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.160
 plasma membrane is a structure 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:28.310
 as the name indicates membranous that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.500
 envelops the entire cell protects the 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.240
 individualist and also allows the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.890
 exchange of substances with the environment 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.740
 external 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.810
 but that is one of the elements that are 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.350
 common to all cells and 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.150
 fundamentally it gives you individuality and 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.430
 gives identity to each of the 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.130
 cells we can say here 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.509
 one cell starts and here the other begins 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.369
 for the limit that it imparts justly 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.180
 this cell membrane your membrane 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.670
 plasma 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.960
 well another of the common elements to 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.640
 all cells is the internal environment 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.300
 which is called cytoplasm 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.220
 the cytoplasm as I just told myself is the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.810
 internal environment that all the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.850
 cells is in the one where they settle 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.580
 all structures that are 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.790
 present in the cells 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.430
 for example the elements for 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.490
 intracellular digestion the elements 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.380
 for cellular respiration is that 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.130
 those elements that are going to allow 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.020
 that cells accumulate substances 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.000
 keep substances classify substances 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.850
 that is to say all the elements that we are going to 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.140
 watch in later videos 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:52.890
 well and finally the last element 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.410
 is what is known as a nucleus that is 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.910
 wherein yellow graphic them here in the 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:03.660
 core the core that can be fine 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.410
 constituted or not so constituted that in 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.420
 reality more than nucleated I this appears 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.610
 in general in books but I in 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:17.150
 I'm really going to change this word 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:20.840
 core by genetic material 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.659
 because the core is already running on a theme of 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.670
 cellular evolution from the most primitive 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.900
 urges the most evolved we will see in 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.180
 a subsequent video that are 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.680
 Primitives do not have a good nucleus 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.720
 defined as the most cells 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.359
 evolved then I instead of 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.599
 talk about kernel would speak promptly 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:41.930
 of genetic material genetic material 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:45.109
 that will allow first control of 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.000
 all cellular functions and second 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.459
 the transmission of the characters 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.980
 hereditary from one cell to the other 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:57.709
 when they reproduce then 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.900
 Without a doubt the three elements that 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.299
 they have in common all the cells without 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.120
 matter I told them the classification 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.099
 one does are outside in 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.819
 the cell membrane or membrane 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:13.340
 plasma the internal environment called 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:18.639
 cytoplasm and the genetic material that 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.639
 finds included in the interior 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.669
 educational I recommend the following 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:26.669
 videos so you can keep learning
