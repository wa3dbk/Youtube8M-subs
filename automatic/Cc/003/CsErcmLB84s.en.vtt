00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
you want to talk about how like what the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.560 
you want to talk about how like what the
protein<00:03:57.340> is<00:03:57.430> originally<00:03:57.820> gonna<00:03:57.910> be<00:03:58.120> low<00:03:58.270> so

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
protein is originally gonna be low so

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.690 
protein is originally gonna be low so
yeah<00:03:59.170> we<00:03:59.320> can<00:03:59.440> do<00:03:59.560> that<00:03:59.590> the<00:04:00.160> protein<00:04:00.550> was

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
yeah we can do that the protein was

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.270 
yeah we can do that the protein was
gonna<00:04:00.850> be<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.390> was<00:04:02.230> always<00:04:02.470> in<00:04:02.680> love<00:04:02.709> with<00:04:03.010> shout

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
like protein 22 is talking about your

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.140 
like protein 22 is talking about your
team<00:04:38.620> going<00:04:38.890> to<00:04:39.100> an<00:04:39.190> event<00:04:39.310> why<00:04:39.669> you<00:04:39.729> should<00:04:40.000> go

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
team going to an event why you should go

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.620 
team going to an event why you should go
what<00:04:40.390> you

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
what you

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.380 
what you
be<00:04:40.690> doing<00:04:41.050> than<00:04:41.620> for<00:04:41.830> example<00:04:41.890> pro<00:04:42.400> scene<00:04:42.640> 24

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
be doing than for example pro scene 24

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.540 
be doing than for example pro scene 24
it<00:04:43.600> could<00:04:43.750> be<00:04:43.900> a<00:04:44.110> shoutcast<00:04:44.650> game<00:04:45.160> throw<00:04:45.400> in

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
it could be a shoutcast game throw in

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.190 
it could be a shoutcast game throw in
there<00:04:45.670> so<00:04:46.630> I<00:04:46.660> think<00:04:46.780> it'll<00:04:47.050> be<00:04:47.080> a<00:04:47.140> good

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
there so I think it'll be a good

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.230 
there so I think it'll be a good
variation<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:48.160> just<00:04:48.340> keep<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.760> pro<00:04:48.970> seen<00:04:49.210> a

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
variation and just keep the pro seen a

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.020 
variation and just keep the pro seen a
lot<00:04:49.510> keep<00:04:49.840> eSports<00:04:50.350> in<00:04:50.470> general<00:04:50.770> alive<00:04:51.030> and

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
lot keep eSports in general alive and

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.120 
lot keep eSports in general alive and
bringing<00:04:52.330> on<00:04:52.450> sharp<00:04:52.810> that<00:04:53.710> was<00:04:53.890> one<00:04:54.010> of<00:04:54.040> the

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
bringing on sharp that was one of the

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.190 
bringing on sharp that was one of the
coolest<00:04:54.370> thing<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:54.610> could<00:04:54.820> do<00:04:54.940> because<00:04:55.200> it's

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
coolest thing I could do because it's

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.840 
coolest thing I could do because it's
not<00:04:56.440> just<00:04:56.500> my<00:04:56.890> perspective<00:04:57.430> me<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:57.730> him

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
not just my perspective me and him

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.030 
not just my perspective me and him
disagreed<00:04:58.300> a<00:04:58.420> lot<00:04:58.630> of<00:04:58.780> stuff<00:04:58.990> me<00:04:59.710> and<00:04:59.860> him<00:04:59.950> will

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
disagreed a lot of stuff me and him will

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.260 
disagreed a lot of stuff me and him will
get<00:05:00.190> into<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.520> about<00:05:00.610> a<00:05:00.730> lot<00:05:00.880> of<00:05:01.000> stuff<00:05:01.180> but

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
get into it about a lot of stuff but

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.900 
get into it about a lot of stuff but
also<00:05:01.420> we<00:05:01.720> agree<00:05:02.020> on<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.290> same<00:05:02.320> stuff<00:05:02.680> so<00:05:02.920> it's

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
also we agree on the same stuff so it's

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.220 
also we agree on the same stuff so it's
good<00:05:04.120> to<00:05:04.150> just<00:05:04.270> play<00:05:04.600> off<00:05:04.720> each<00:05:04.750> other<00:05:05.050> like

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
good to just play off each other like

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.260 
good to just play off each other like
that<00:05:05.440> so<00:05:05.740> that's<00:05:06.670> pretty<00:05:06.820> much<00:05:06.910> all<00:05:07.060> I<00:05:07.120> have

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
that so that's pretty much all I have

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.890 
that so that's pretty much all I have
well<00:05:08.140> I<00:05:08.200> think<00:05:08.260> I<00:05:08.440> remember<00:05:08.650> it<00:05:09.070> like<00:05:09.100> it

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
well I think I remember it like it

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.630 
well I think I remember it like it
started<00:05:10.900> out<00:05:10.960> I<00:05:11.020> think<00:05:11.110> it<00:05:11.380> was<00:05:12.010> maybe<00:05:12.430> an

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
started out I think it was maybe an

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.490 
started out I think it was maybe an
episode<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.210> then<00:05:13.360> went<00:05:13.660> from<00:05:13.840> like<00:05:14.020> holiday

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
doc and then the Golden Boy and then I

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.320 
doc and then the Golden Boy and then I
remember<00:05:17.530> me<00:05:18.040> and<00:05:18.070> you<00:05:18.280> tried<00:05:18.520> doing<00:05:18.700> like

like<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:19.930> OC<00:05:20.380> and<00:05:20.710> just<00:05:20.860> like<00:05:20.950> different

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
like the OC and just like different

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.590 
like the OC and just like different
videos<00:05:21.520> we<00:05:21.730> were<00:05:21.850> like<00:05:21.970> think<00:05:22.210> of<00:05:22.240> like<00:05:22.330> what

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600

with me the idea of like we should just

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.470 
with me the idea of like we should just
do<00:05:27.190> this<00:05:27.370> like<00:05:27.700> twice<00:05:27.940> a<00:05:27.970> week<00:05:28.240> or<00:05:28.390> something

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
like that okay I never thought that the

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.100 
like that okay I never thought that the
person<00:05:31.990> would<00:05:32.110> turn<00:05:32.320> into<00:05:32.500> um<00:05:33.160> a<00:05:33.840> thing<00:05:34.840> to
