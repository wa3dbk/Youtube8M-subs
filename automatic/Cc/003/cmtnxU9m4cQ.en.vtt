your all-mountain or hitting some of
those<00:00:21.900> really<00:00:22.109> big<00:00:22.230> drops<00:00:22.679> as<00:00:22.859> well<00:00:23.039> what

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
those really big drops as well what

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.939 
those really big drops as well what
really<00:00:23.789> sets<00:00:24.179> this<00:00:24.359> bike<00:00:24.630> apart<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
really sets this bike apart is the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.489 
really sets this bike apart is the
crankset<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.880> hammerschmidt<00:00:27.449> setup<00:00:27.839> what

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:28.499 
crankset it's a hammerschmidt setup what

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:29.960 
crankset it's a hammerschmidt setup what
that<00:00:28.679> is<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.369> actually<00:00:29.669> got<00:00:29.849> an

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
that is is that it's actually got an

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.720 
that is is that it's actually got an
internal<00:00:30.630> gear<00:00:31.079> in<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.619> front<00:00:31.730> essentially

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
internal gear in the front essentially

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.270 
internal gear in the front essentially
it's<00:00:33.180> an<00:00:33.329> internal<00:00:33.750> front<00:00:34.079> derailleur<00:00:34.470> what

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
it's an internal front derailleur what

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.220 
it's an internal front derailleur what
that<00:00:35.490> means<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.240> well<00:00:36.540> firstly<00:00:36.930> you've<00:00:37.080> got

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
that means is well firstly you've got

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.540 
that means is well firstly you've got
plenty<00:00:37.470> of<00:00:37.650> ground<00:00:37.860> clearance

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
plenty of ground clearance

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.000 
plenty of ground clearance
secondly<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:39.840> never<00:00:40.140> drop<00:00:40.380> a<00:00:40.410> chain<00:00:40.740> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
secondly you can never drop a chain and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.860 
secondly you can never drop a chain and
it's<00:00:41.340> also<00:00:41.490> got<00:00:41.790> instant<00:00:42.270> shifting<00:00:42.690> whether

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
it's also got instant shifting whether

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.020 
it's also got instant shifting whether
you're<00:00:43.020> backpedaling<00:00:43.440> pedaling<00:00:44.430> forwards<00:00:44.910> or

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
you're backpedaling pedaling forwards or

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.150 
you're backpedaling pedaling forwards or
stationary<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.900> shift<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.920> at<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
stationary you can shift just at the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.870 
stationary you can shift just at the
flick<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.550> button

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
riding style Fox now do the 20 mil

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.389 
riding style Fox now do the 20 mil
through<00:01:40.049> axle<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.649> actually<00:01:40.740> don't<00:01:41.159> need

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
through axle so you actually don't need

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.489 
through axle so you actually don't need
to<00:01:41.460> any<00:01:42.030> tools<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.689> remove<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.200> front<00:01:43.350> wheel

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:43.499 
to any tools to remove the front wheel

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.139 
to any tools to remove the front wheel
so<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:43.950> makes<00:01:44.219> it<00:01:44.340> very<00:01:44.399> easy<00:01:44.520> putting<00:01:44.969> it<00:01:45.060> in

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
so that makes it very easy putting it in

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.029 
so that makes it very easy putting it in
and<00:01:45.329> out<00:01:45.389> of<00:01:45.539> a<00:01:45.600> car<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.469> also<00:01:46.619> finished

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
and out of a car it's also finished

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.969 
and out of a car it's also finished
really<00:01:47.429> nicely<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:47.999> the<00:01:48.350> core<00:01:49.350> components

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
really nicely with the core components
