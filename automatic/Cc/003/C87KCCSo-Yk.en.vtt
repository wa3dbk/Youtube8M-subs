00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:13.979
 "Lords of war" 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.021
 It's a 5 episode adventure 

00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:21.063
 that will prepare the players for the next expansion: 

00:00:21.223 --> 00:00:22.521
 "Warlords of Draenor". 

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.417
 What we try to do with "Lords of war" 

00:00:25.577 --> 00:00:29.167
 is to show who are the lords of war. 

00:00:29.327 --> 00:00:32.325
 They are characters that we created almost 20 years ago 

00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:33.553
 what madness ... 

00:00:33.713 --> 00:00:36.014
 And we also answer why you 

00:00:36.174 --> 00:00:40.459
 As players, you would fight against them and bring them to justice. 

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:42.716
 And that was an adventure. 

00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:44.749
 WAR LADIES THE BASES 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:47.638
 "Lords of War" started like this: 

00:00:47.987 --> 00:00:51.572
 I work in a team 

00:00:51.732 --> 00:00:53.439
 focused on the story. 

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:55.767
 We created arguments for short stories 

00:00:55.927 --> 00:00:57.745
 comics, novels ... 

00:00:57.905 --> 00:01:00.770
 but we did not do video scenes. 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.936
 Our first foray into video scenes 

00:01:05.096 --> 00:01:07.629
 It was the project "The Burdens of Shaohao". 

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:22.852
 "Shaohao" was the first time we left our comfort zone. 

00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:26.736
 We move on to something visual, in movement. 

00:01:26.896 --> 00:01:29.977
 It was not a comic or a story that you can put on the web. 

00:01:30.137 --> 00:01:33.529
 It has a short format, it is a story told in parts. 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.214
 It is thought of as an album of images 

00:01:36.374 --> 00:01:37.599
 that looks unhurried. 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.399
 We developed "Shaohao", we published it and the fans of Pandaria loved it. 

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:46.114
 We opened the door as screenwriters 

00:01:46.274 --> 00:01:48.154
 because it reached a lot of people. 

00:01:48.314 --> 00:01:50.015
 Many people noticed him. 

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:52.322
 "Shaohao" gave us to understand 

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:54.708
 that there is potential and a wider audience 

00:01:54.868 --> 00:01:56.661
 for the stories of "Warcraft" 

00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:58.638
 and not necessarily in books. 

00:01:58.798 --> 00:02:00.975
 They do not have to go between covers. 

00:02:05.502 --> 00:02:07.580
 Using "Shaohao" as a platform 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.538
 We started to conceptualize the product. 

00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:12.977
 To teach the warlords 

00:02:13.137 --> 00:02:15.858
 but also to take them on an incredible journey 

00:02:16.018 --> 00:02:19.303
 that will show how Draenor is 

00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:22.429
 In the meetings we said: what will we do next? 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.440
 How do we want to move forward with this style of narrative? 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:29.203
 The guys got to it and they came with two stories. 

00:02:29.363 --> 00:02:32.985
 Yrel was going to be one of them 

00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:35.179
 and Durotan was going to be the other. 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:38.619
 They were only going to last a few minutes each, that was going to be everything. 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:44.055
 The more we talked about it the more we knew it was a great opportunity 

00:02:44.354 --> 00:02:46.674
 not just to tell great stories 

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:51.137
 but also to present to the bosses that you will see in "Warlords of Draenor". 

00:02:51.297 --> 00:02:53.087
 They wanted to focus on them 

00:02:53.247 --> 00:02:55.650
 because it was not going to be done in the game. 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.501
 We had to present these guys to the public 

00:02:58.661 --> 00:03:02.238
 and that they understood why they should fear them and they should care. 

00:03:02.438 --> 00:03:04.171
 Who are they and where do they come from? 

00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:07.487
 How they became those awesome thugs 

00:03:07.647 --> 00:03:09.584
 whom are we going to want to kill? 

00:03:09.744 --> 00:03:12.363
 The stories that we have built 

00:03:12.523 --> 00:03:14.692
 They are crucial moments in their lives. 

00:03:14.852 --> 00:03:17.762
 The key story that made them 

00:03:17.922 --> 00:03:20.645
 in the monstrosities that are now. 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.665
 King Varian 

00:03:24.488 --> 00:03:26.173
 time is short. 

00:03:26.997 --> 00:03:30.292
 You must sign the declaration of war. 

00:03:32.204 --> 00:03:37.146
 I was only a child when my father faced this enemy. 

00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:41.263
 It had to be something more than the history of the 4 warlords. 

00:03:41.423 --> 00:03:43.565
 There had to be a context for everything 

00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:45.793
 and it occurred to us to include a narrator. 

00:03:45.953 --> 00:03:47.673
 Who would tell the story? 

00:03:47.833 --> 00:03:52.747
 Maraad was ideal because Draenor is his home. 

00:03:52.907 --> 00:03:55.955
 Maraad witnessed the fall of his world. 

00:03:56.115 --> 00:03:57.115
 He saw his people 

00:03:57.275 --> 00:04:00.734
 pursued almost to extinction by the lords of war 

00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:04.004
 a generation before and his demons persecute him. 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.739
 That he arrives and addresses Varian to tell these stories 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:10.228
 makes it a kind of argonaut. 

00:04:10.388 --> 00:04:12.793
 This makes everything square 

00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:14.654
 that fits and makes sense 

00:04:14.814 --> 00:04:17.032
 and are not just 4 desperate stories. 

00:04:17.845 --> 00:04:19.923
 Well, tell me, Maraad. 

00:04:20.597 --> 00:04:22.525
 Tell me your story 

00:04:23.143 --> 00:04:24.996
 In agreement. 

00:04:26.848 --> 00:04:30.199
 Kargath had no clan ... 

00:04:31.322 --> 00:04:35.150
 Crispin Freeman, our Maraad, is fantastic. 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.438
 It brings a lot of character to the character. 

00:04:37.598 --> 00:04:39.285
 It is a pleasure to work with him. 

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:42.663
 He is very patient with us when we make it difficult for him. 

00:04:42.823 --> 00:04:47.913
 Maraad is a vindicator. A title that always sounds interesting. 

00:04:48.073 --> 00:04:50.635
 It means that he is a kind of paladin 

00:04:50.795 --> 00:04:55.267
 that serves a purpose greater than your own desires or needs. 

00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:58.599
 He is a kind of sacred soldier. 

00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:03.287
 In the story, Maraad obviously has the purpose 

00:05:03.447 --> 00:05:07.368
 to explain to the King what they are facing with the warlords. 

00:05:07.528 --> 00:05:11.008
 But then you ask yourself: Why is this Maraad doing? 

00:05:11.168 --> 00:05:14.714
 Why does he have to explain to the King what happens? 

00:05:14.874 --> 00:05:16.519
 What motivates Maraad? 

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:19.440
 Telling those stories is something personal. 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.339
 It is very satisfying 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:25.382
 understand why a character does what he does. 

00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:28.048
 Fortunately we came to discover 

00:05:28.208 --> 00:05:30.819
 what moves Maraad in this case. 

00:05:32.595 --> 00:05:35.291
 I'm very excited about "Lords of War." 

00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:38.885
 It's part of the dream we've always had for Blizzard 

00:05:39.045 --> 00:05:40.706
 and the worlds that we build. 

00:05:40.866 --> 00:05:43.990
 These stories are going to be there for whoever wants to see them. 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.499
 they will be alive on the web 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:48.595
 scenes in movement, with sound. 

00:05:48.755 --> 00:05:51.486
 They are not contained in a book. 

00:05:51.973 --> 00:05:55.752
 Everything has more life. It has dynamism. 

00:05:56.108 --> 00:05:59.524
 In short, everyone here wants to tell good stories 

00:05:59.684 --> 00:06:02.856
 we want to reach people, everyone. 

00:06:03.016 --> 00:06:06.893
 With luck, we will achieve it thanks to this synergistic experience. 

00:06:07.255 --> 00:06:10.679
 It is enormously gratifying to know 

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:15.040
 that this is going to show to the whole world. 

00:06:15.324 --> 00:06:20.821
 I really hope we make more stories like these in the future. 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.190
 This is not the end 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.140
 People keep coming and inhabiting the worlds we build. 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.978
 Products like "Lords of war" will continue to be part of that landscape 

00:06:37.403 --> 00:06:39.460
 and our narrative tradition.
