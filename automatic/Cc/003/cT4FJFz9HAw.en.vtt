we saw that we can play against big
teams<00:00:12.960> our<00:00:13.710> biggest<00:00:14.070> problem<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:15.179> we<00:00:15.360> can

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
teams our biggest problem is that we can

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.519 
teams our biggest problem is that we can
we<00:00:15.990> cannot<00:00:16.410> play<00:00:16.680> against<00:00:17.270> let's<00:00:18.270> say<00:00:18.529> small

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
we cannot play against let's say small

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.470 
we cannot play against let's say small
teams<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.070> mean<00:00:20.220> not<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.490> big<00:00:20.910> time<00:00:21.180> things

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
teams I mean not that big time things

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.320 
teams I mean not that big time things
like<00:00:21.600> Latvia<00:00:22.230> Israel<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.939> gives<00:00:24.180> me

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
like Latvia Israel and that gives me

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.260 
like Latvia Israel and that gives me
confidence<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:25.439> can<00:00:25.619> keep<00:00:25.859> going<00:00:26.160> and

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
confidence that we can keep going and

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.370 
confidence that we can keep going and

Russia which is also great team they

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.670 
Russia which is also great team they
beat

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.770 

freezing<00:00:39.720> in<00:00:40.720> a<00:00:40.870> group<00:00:41.110> in<00:00:41.760> first<00:00:42.760> place<00:00:42.940> so<00:00:43.360> I

can

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
can

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.240 
can
you<00:00:59.880> can<00:01:00.060> set<00:01:00.300> our<00:01:00.510> minds<00:01:00.900> up<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.560> Russia<00:01:01.830> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
you can set our minds up for Russia and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.400 
you can set our minds up for Russia and
try<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> win<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.940> game<00:01:03.240> because<00:01:03.630> it<00:01:04.199> gives

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
try to win that game because it gives

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.950 
try to win that game because it gives
you<00:01:04.620> a<00:01:04.650> better<00:01:04.830> spot<00:01:05.190> to<00:01:05.520> play<00:01:06.090> against<00:01:06.480> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you a better spot to play against the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.500 
you a better spot to play against the
weaker<00:01:07.860> upon<00:01:08.190> let's<00:01:08.700> say<00:01:08.880> weaker<00:01:09.330> because

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
weaker upon let's say weaker because

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.680 
weaker upon let's say weaker because
that's<00:01:09.930> quarterfinal<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.450> nobody's<00:01:12.450> week

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
that's quarterfinal and nobody's week

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.930 
that's quarterfinal and nobody's week
but<00:01:13.230> let's<00:01:13.890> say<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.310> that

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.260 

things<00:01:19.330> to<00:01:19.540> you<00:01:20.290> have<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.680> imagio

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
things to you have the imagio

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.230 
things to you have the imagio
no<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:22.840> didn't<00:01:23.289> feel<00:01:23.439> good<00:01:23.710> my<00:01:24.579> hamstring<00:01:25.090> was

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
no I didn't feel good my hamstring was

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.319 
no I didn't feel good my hamstring was
hurting<00:01:25.659> but<00:01:26.200> you<00:01:26.710> know<00:01:26.920> I<00:01:27.189> finish<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.149> game

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
hurting but you know I finish the game

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.360 
hurting but you know I finish the game
how<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:28.630> finished<00:01:29.170> with<00:01:29.409> a<00:01:29.469> triple<00:01:30.159> and

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
how I finished with a triple and

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.550 
how I finished with a triple and
and<00:01:32.460> two<00:01:33.000> free<00:01:33.270> throws<00:01:33.300> but<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.020> wasn't<00:01:34.350> enough

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
and two free throws but it wasn't enough

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.660 
and two free throws but it wasn't enough
so<00:01:34.970> everything<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:37.170> doesn't<00:01:37.680> matter<00:01:37.830> when

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
so everything is it doesn't matter when

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.810 
so everything is it doesn't matter when
you<00:01:38.790> lose<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> game<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:39.690> at<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> end<00:01:40.670> what<00:01:41.670> is

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
you lose a game but at the end what is

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.770 
you lose a game but at the end what is
important<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:43.220> is<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.490> game<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:45.030> show<00:01:45.420> today

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
important that is the game we show today

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.740 
important that is the game we show today
that<00:01:46.080> we<00:01:46.380> were<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.680> by<00:01:46.860> 13<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:47.580> we<00:01:48.270> cannot<00:01:48.510> lose

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
that we were up by 13 and we cannot lose

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.380 
that we were up by 13 and we cannot lose
in<00:01:49.500> two<00:01:49.980> minutes<00:01:50.280> three<00:01:50.310> minutes<00:01:50.490> all<00:01:51.090> that

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
in two minutes three minutes all that

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.530 
in two minutes three minutes all that
advantage<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.350> at<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> end<00:01:52.910> nothing<00:01:53.910> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
advantage that at the end nothing you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.330 
advantage that at the end nothing you
got<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.930> more<00:01:54.960> focused<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.040> get<00:01:56.220> this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
got to be more focused not to get this

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.750 
got to be more focused not to get this
three-point<00:01:56.760> shot

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.990 

a<00:02:01.820> difficult<00:02:02.330> endeavor

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.780 

we<00:02:08.000> with<00:02:08.479> your<00:02:09.259> team<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:09.800> know<00:02:09.950> we<00:02:10.520> didn't

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
we with your team you know we didn't

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.590 
we with your team you know we didn't
play<00:02:11.260> big<00:02:12.260> competitions<00:02:13.010> lately<00:02:13.550> in<00:02:14.060> past<00:02:14.360> ten

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
play big competitions lately in past ten

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.860 
play big competitions lately in past ten
years<00:02:14.630> we<00:02:15.170> didn't<00:02:15.410> get<00:02:15.560> no<00:02:15.860> medal<00:02:16.220> and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
years we didn't get no medal and

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.300 
years we didn't get no medal and
probably<00:02:17.870> that's<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.380> problem<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.830> this<00:02:19.040> team

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
probably that's the problem of this team

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
probably that's the problem of this team
but<00:02:19.880> we<00:02:20.660> we<00:02:21.410> are<00:02:21.530> improving<00:02:21.890> every<00:02:22.550> game<00:02:22.820> and

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
we we see our chances of course and
