right through the ice melt a hole in the
ice<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.570> course<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.200> didn't<00:00:37.469> do<00:00:37.530> any<00:00:37.710> of

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
ice and of course it didn't do any of

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:49.000 
ice and of course it didn't do any of
those<00:00:37.920> things

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.509 

I<00:00:49.269> was<00:00:50.269> stunned<00:00:50.629> by<00:00:51.109> what<00:00:51.769> it<00:00:51.890> did<00:00:52.070> when<00:00:52.280> it<00:00:52.399> hit

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
I was stunned by what it did when it hit

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.819 
I was stunned by what it did when it hit
the<00:00:52.550> ice<00:00:52.760> then<00:00:53.660> you<00:00:53.719> see<00:00:53.839> the<00:00:53.930> bubbles<00:00:54.260> it

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
the ice then you see the bubbles it

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.200 
the ice then you see the bubbles it
bubbles<00:00:55.160> this<00:00:55.280> big<00:00:55.519> man<00:00:55.699> there's<00:00:55.879> bubbles

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
bubbles this big man there's bubbles

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.060 
bubbles this big man there's bubbles
within<00:00:56.539> bubbles<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.989> scrambled<00:01:00.620> eggs<00:01:00.769> from

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
within bubbles the scrambled eggs from

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.880 
within bubbles the scrambled eggs from
hell<00:01:01.280> is<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:02.479> way<00:01:02.600> it<00:01:02.719> looks<00:01:02.989> in<00:01:03.409> that<00:01:03.649> video

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
hell is the way it looks in that video

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.639 
hell is the way it looks in that video
just<00:01:04.820> took<00:01:05.000> things<00:01:05.180> we<00:01:05.390> just<00:01:05.630> didn't<00:01:06.229> really

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
just took things we just didn't really

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.649 
just took things we just didn't really
expect<00:01:09.250> so<00:01:10.250> why<00:01:10.640> are<00:01:10.700> volcanic<00:01:11.149> bubbles

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
expect so why are volcanic bubbles

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.550 
expect so why are volcanic bubbles
formed<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.970> lava<00:01:14.180> is<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:14.690> hot<00:01:15.049> that<00:01:15.259> when<00:01:15.380> it's

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
formed the lava is so hot that when it's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.130 
formed the lava is so hot that when it's
poured<00:01:15.860> onto<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.520> ice<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:17.299> ice<00:01:17.330> instantly

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
poured onto the ice the ice instantly

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.170 
poured onto the ice the ice instantly
turns<00:01:18.350> not<00:01:18.649> just<00:01:18.890> into<00:01:19.130> water<00:01:19.399> but<00:01:19.789> straight

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
turns not just into water but straight

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.109 
turns not just into water but straight
into<00:01:20.600> steam<00:01:21.020> now<00:01:21.619> this<00:01:21.830> steam<00:01:22.159> has<00:01:22.550> to<00:01:22.880> escape

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
into steam now this steam has to escape

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.930 
into steam now this steam has to escape
so<00:01:23.569> it<00:01:23.720> bubbles<00:01:24.080> through<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.679> lava<00:01:25.130> so<00:01:25.819> while

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
so it bubbles through the lava so while

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.240 
so it bubbles through the lava so while
it<00:01:26.090> looks<00:01:26.270> like<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.600> lava<00:01:26.840> itself<00:01:27.530> is<00:01:27.740> boiling

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
it looks like the lava itself is boiling

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.130 
it looks like the lava itself is boiling
is<00:01:28.399> actually<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.119> steam<00:01:29.420> being<00:01:29.780> produced

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
is actually the steam being produced

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.680 
is actually the steam being produced
that<00:01:30.409> is<00:01:30.530> trying<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:31.069> escape<00:01:31.310> as<00:01:32.179> the<00:01:32.479> lava

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
that is trying to escape as the lava

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.289 
that is trying to escape as the lava
cools<00:01:33.200> we<00:01:33.740> start<00:01:34.009> to<00:01:34.100> get<00:01:34.159> a<00:01:34.220> thick<00:01:34.640> black

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
cools we start to get a thick black

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.990 
cools we start to get a thick black
layer<00:01:35.720> forming<00:01:36.470> on<00:01:36.679> top<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:37.429> it<00:01:37.610> starts<00:01:37.880> to

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
layer forming on top and it starts to

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.359 
layer forming on top and it starts to
trap<00:01:38.479> those<00:01:38.840> bubbles<00:01:39.259> of<00:01:39.409> superheated<00:01:40.100> steam

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
trap those bubbles of superheated steam

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.120 
trap those bubbles of superheated steam
inside<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.630> rock<00:01:41.869> and<00:01:42.170> it's<00:01:42.530> kind<00:01:42.709> of<00:01:42.740> like<00:01:42.950> a

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
inside the rock and it's kind of like a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.380 
inside the rock and it's kind of like a
natural<00:01:43.670> form<00:01:44.000> of<00:01:44.179> glassblowing<00:01:49.240> should<00:01:50.240> it

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
natural form of glassblowing should it

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.740 
natural form of glassblowing should it
melt<00:01:50.750> right<00:01:50.959> through<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.880> formation<00:01:53.330> of<00:01:53.629> all

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
melt right through the formation of all

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.020 
melt right through the formation of all
of<00:01:53.929> this<00:01:54.080> steam<00:01:54.500> helps<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.489> lava<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:56.000> flow

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
of this steam helps the lava to flow

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.479 
of this steam helps the lava to flow
because<00:01:56.929> it<00:01:57.140> means<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.709> it's<00:01:57.830> sitting<00:01:58.129> on

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:58.489 
because it means that it's sitting on

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:01.119 
because it means that it's sitting on
top<00:01:58.580> of<00:01:58.940> a<00:01:59.330> blanket<00:01:59.899> of<00:02:00.050> steam<00:02:00.289> rather<00:02:00.770> than<00:02:01.009> in

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:01.129 
top of a blanket of steam rather than in

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:03.339 
top of a blanket of steam rather than in
contact<00:02:01.580> with<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.789> ice<00:02:01.940> itself<00:02:02.539> this<00:02:03.140> means

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
contact with the ice itself this means

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:04.990 
contact with the ice itself this means
the<00:02:03.470> friction<00:02:03.739> between<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.310> lava<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:04.819> the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
the friction between the lava and the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.669 
the friction between the lava and the
ice<00:02:05.090> service<00:02:05.629> is<00:02:05.780> very<00:02:06.319> low<00:02:07.929> now<00:02:08.929> barb<00:02:09.319> and<00:02:09.470> Jeb

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.830 
ice service is very low now barb and Jeb
are<00:02:09.800> taking<00:02:10.129> things<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.640> next<00:02:10.729> level<00:02:11.000> it's

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
are taking things to the next level it's

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.990 
are taking things to the next level it's
love<00:02:12.200> versus<00:02:13.010> water

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.090 

we've<00:02:17.000> done<00:02:17.390> over<00:02:17.570> a<00:02:17.720> hundred<00:02:18.020> pours<00:02:18.320> into

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
we've done over a hundred pours into

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.900 
we've done over a hundred pours into
