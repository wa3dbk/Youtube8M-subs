00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.940

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.429

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.289
 releasing more great videos on 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.470
 today's video will be dedicated again 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.119
 same in mine here but on the topic of how 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.930
 change the survival mode to creative and 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.349
 back and so let's see what 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.349
 we need to do this 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:41.510
 so you see something I have here by 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:45.030
 its such a big house here in the back 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.789
 backyard let's say it still there and what is built 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.010
 and so on think all this is a dream to do 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.770
 the more ore I mined it all 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.610
 did hatch busan about him calling in creative 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:01.770
 What to do this, we need to teach 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:05.570
 break on iphone or iphone box 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.729
 just the same marriage it will be easier she 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.840
 black background boxing may fail 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.420
 everything works on version 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.909
 not only on 060 and also on another 061 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:24.090
 also people asked me about what 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:25.979
 does dupe work not only at 050 and 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.579
 tell everyone it works that is who 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:35.460
 remembers long take and remove from 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:37.229
 multitasking we go to the file folder 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.100
 with minecraft poket edishn then documents 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.790

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.450
 did need do you two worlds one 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.659
 will be creative 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:58.640
 and the other must be survival so we 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:02:03.960
 we go into the world of creativity in daddy and 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:09.720
 last two files were that old we them 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.520
 we copy go in our world of cases 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.360
 so called me 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.650
 edit and paste rewrite all 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:22.980
 is ready 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:32.600
 we go back minekravt as we see 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:39.210
 I'm already creative well we go to Valya 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:41.960
 Here we have everything in the creativity of authenticity 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.880
 we can still put such blocks 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.880
 let's let's give all the ore and not 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.210
 after that we go back and do it 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.900
 same operation only turn from mode 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.900
 a wish 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.250
 also than to say what i am in the description 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:26.020
 will be my skype since so many people 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:26.020
 also asks him to leave me and soon 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.650
 can you call me write if you have 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.569
 some questions have arisen so we see 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.590
 the fact that just like a small code bug 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:39.739
 that some blocks are not saved 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.050
 such here they must submit so 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:47.060
 now you see what we already cut 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:53.239
 squeezing well, okay, sometimes it is 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:55.730
 happens but I donâ€™t know the reason soon 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.680
 already completes and so generally should 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:03.200
 work for example all of this as exported 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:06.310
 Ruby people so I sent screams here and well, 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.690
