00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
seems to be hiding pretty much all the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.310 
seems to be hiding pretty much all the
time<00:00:29.070> back<00:00:29.519> there<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.060> mean<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> pretty

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
time back there I mean it's a pretty

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.910 
time back there I mean it's a pretty
neat<00:00:31.590> tank<00:00:32.120> but<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:34.200> only<00:00:34.320> problem<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.800> I

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
neat tank but the only problem that I

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.110 
neat tank but the only problem that I
found<00:00:35.190> with<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.460> tank<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
found with this tank is that the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.389 
found with this tank is that the
lighting<00:00:36.510> system<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.110> not<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.559> great<00:00:37.860> it's<00:00:38.309> a

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
lighting system is not that great it's a

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.299 
lighting system is not that great it's a
good<00:00:38.640> tank<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.239> all<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.649> pretty<00:00:40.890> much<00:00:41.010> had

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
good tank and all so I pretty much had

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.180 
good tank and all so I pretty much had
to<00:00:41.340> upgrade<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:42.239> lighting<00:00:43.020> system<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.739> what

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
to upgrade the lighting system and what

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.810 
to upgrade the lighting system and what
I<00:00:44.219> did<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.820> went<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.420> my<00:00:45.539> local<00:00:46.309> pet<00:00:47.309> shop<00:00:47.340> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
know if you guys could tell us this bar

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.670 
know if you guys could tell us this bar
right<00:00:55.739> here<00:00:56.090> that<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.120> pretty<00:00:57.390> much<00:00:57.680> purchased

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
right here that I pretty much purchased

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.680 
right here that I pretty much purchased
it<00:00:59.370> was<00:00:59.550> about<00:00:59.730> $35<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.010> it's<00:01:02.010> pretty<00:01:02.250> neat

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
it was about $35 and it's pretty neat

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.050 
it was about $35 and it's pretty neat
you<00:01:03.690> know<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.840> pretty<00:01:04.379> much<00:01:04.519> bolted<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.610> down<00:01:05.820> on

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
you know I pretty much bolted it down on

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.880 
you know I pretty much bolted it down on
one<00:01:06.270> end<00:01:06.540> right<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:07.290> all<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.590> end

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
one end right here and then all the end

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.950 
one end right here and then all the end
over<00:01:08.130> here<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.850> wouldn't<00:01:09.450> clutter<00:01:09.689> up<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
over here so it wouldn't clutter up the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.440 
over here so it wouldn't clutter up the
system<00:01:10.290> too<00:01:10.680> much<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.780> I<00:01:12.830> also<00:01:13.830> made<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.450> little

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
system too much and I also made a little

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.679 
system too much and I also made a little
refuge<00:01:15.960> room<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> side<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:17.070> some<00:01:17.310> cheeto

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
refuge room on the side with some cheeto

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.749 
refuge room on the side with some cheeto
which<00:01:18.689> helps<00:01:19.470> keep<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.799> nitrate<00:01:20.220> levels<00:01:20.369> down

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
which helps keep the nitrate levels down

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.080 
which helps keep the nitrate levels down
on<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> tank<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.500> marina<00:01:23.340> s10<00:01:23.850> filtration

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
on the tank it's a marina s10 filtration

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.090 
on the tank it's a marina s10 filtration
system<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.960> kind<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.259> liked<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.619> because<00:01:25.770> you

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
system I kind of liked it because you

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.690 
system I kind of liked it because you
know<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.450> has<00:01:27.450> pretty<00:01:27.780> much<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.700> internal

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
know it has pretty much the internal

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.100 
know it has pretty much the internal
pump<00:01:30.000> all<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.210> way<00:01:30.390> inside<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.750> water

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
pump all the way inside the water

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.219 
pump all the way inside the water
downstairs<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.659> you<00:01:33.659> know<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.049> it's

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
downstairs and you know it's like it's

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.749 
downstairs and you know it's like it's
it<00:01:34.470> kind<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.220> makes<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.610> pretty

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
it kind of like you know makes it pretty

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.330 
it kind of like you know makes it pretty
much<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.420> cleaner<00:01:36.869> look<00:01:37.170> am<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.770> painting<00:01:38.220> it

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
much of a cleaner look am I painting it

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.399 
much of a cleaner look am I painting it
now<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.030> fluval<00:01:39.570> heater<00:01:39.840> right<00:01:40.110> here

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
now so I have a fluval heater right here

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.310 
now so I have a fluval heater right here
and<00:01:40.729> as<00:01:41.729> far<00:01:41.939> as<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.090> filtration<00:01:42.360> system<00:01:42.450> goes

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
and as far as a filtration system goes

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.520 
and as far as a filtration system goes
it's<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.860> pretty<00:01:44.520> decent<00:01:44.970> tank<00:01:45.210> also<00:01:45.840> added<00:01:46.409> an

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
it's a pretty decent tank also added an

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.609 
it's a pretty decent tank also added an
extra<00:01:46.680> lighting<00:01:47.100> right<00:01:47.340> here<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.619> for

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
extra lighting right here for the for

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.020 
extra lighting right here for the for
the<00:01:49.649> caedo<00:01:49.979> because<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.579> know<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> kiddo

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the caedo because you know the kiddo

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.630 
the caedo because you know the kiddo
needs<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.390> bit<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.570> lighting<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.110> survive<00:01:52.640> it

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
needs a bit of lighting to survive it

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.370 
needs a bit of lighting to survive it
also<00:01:53.790> has<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> bit<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.390> substrate<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
also has a bit of substrate on the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.429 
also has a bit of substrate on the
bottom<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.909> bit<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.180> sand<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.869> the
