we're making a very simple wooden box
during<00:00:28.720> the<00:00:28.869> making<00:00:29.080> of<00:00:29.289> this<00:00:29.440> video<00:00:29.650> we<00:00:30.130> will

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
during the making of this video we will

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.910 
during the making of this video we will
be<00:00:30.570> using<00:00:31.570> several<00:00:31.960> simple<00:00:32.379> techniques

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
be using several simple techniques

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
doesn't matter if they're not quite the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.770 
doesn't matter if they're not quite the
original<00:01:25.509> dimension<00:01:26.080> as<00:01:26.440> long<00:01:26.770> as<00:01:26.920> these<00:01:27.190> two

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
original dimension as long as these two

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.650 
original dimension as long as these two
sides<00:01:28.780> met<00:01:29.410> these<00:01:29.709> two<00:01:30.009> sides<00:01:32.190> machen<00:01:33.190> sies

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
sides met these two sides machen sies

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.219 
sides met these two sides machen sies
you<00:01:34.660> can<00:01:34.869> see<00:01:35.050> that<00:01:36.660> what<00:01:37.660> I've<00:01:37.780> got<00:01:37.929> it<00:01:38.080> now

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
you can see that what I've got it now

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.490 
you can see that what I've got it now
have<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:38.649> do<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:40.630> give<00:01:40.810> everything<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.289> quick

lamb<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:48.489> that<00:02:49.079> when<00:02:50.079> it<00:02:50.170> all<00:02:50.290> comes<00:02:50.469> together

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
lamb so that when it all comes together

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:57.209 
lamb so that when it all comes together
I<00:02:51.310> know<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.269> these<00:02:52.420> joints<00:02:52.930> are<00:02:53.079> exactly<00:02:56.219> 40

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:57.219 
I know that these joints are exactly 40

I know that these joints are exactly 40
up<00:02:58.409> 90<00:02:59.409> degrees<00:03:00.540> just<00:03:01.540> makes<00:03:01.780> everything<00:03:01.959> a

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
up 90 degrees just makes everything a

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.539 
up 90 degrees just makes everything a
lot<00:03:02.560> easier<00:03:04.560> about<00:03:05.560> using<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.040> square<00:03:06.370> to

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
lot easier about using the square to

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.830 
lot easier about using the square to
keep<00:03:06.730> everything<00:03:07.500> nice<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:09.000> flat<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.359> don't

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
keep everything nice and flat I don't

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.550 
keep everything nice and flat I don't
want<00:03:10.959> to<00:03:11.019> put<00:03:11.139> too<00:03:11.170> much<00:03:11.470> pressure<00:03:11.709> on<00:03:13.560> the

want to put too much pressure on the
joints<00:03:15.099> just<00:03:15.939> enough<00:03:16.239> distance<00:03:16.480> keep<00:03:17.409> it<00:03:17.590> all

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
joints just enough distance keep it all

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.089 
joints just enough distance keep it all
together<00:03:18.579> to<00:03:19.000> run<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.269> blow<00:03:19.450> up<00:03:20.099> obviously

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
together to run the blow up obviously

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.830 
together to run the blow up obviously
you<00:03:21.220> can<00:03:21.370> use<00:03:21.519> any<00:03:21.700> clamping<00:03:22.209> method<00:03:22.569> you<00:03:22.689> want

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
you can use any clamping method you want

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.530 
you can use any clamping method you want
so<00:03:23.829> this<00:03:24.010> is<00:03:24.159> the<00:03:24.280> method<00:03:24.459> I<00:03:24.730> found<00:03:25.030> what's<00:03:25.329> the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
so this is the method I found what's the

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.500 
so this is the method I found what's the
best<00:03:25.780> for<00:03:25.989> me<00:03:27.269> so<00:03:29.579> once<00:03:30.579> I've<00:03:30.819> done<00:03:31.000> these<00:03:31.209> two

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
joys I'm then going to go over to UM the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.059 
joys I'm then going to go over to UM the
