00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:08.460
 the only computer cpu on the computer 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:12.830
 however multiply for whoever you want 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.830
 It was already night in the water 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.520
 today is a new day there we will talk 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.900
 on a very cool subject is a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.960
 controversial game subject 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.300
 I'm all firefighters want to know that 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.519
 want to meet country with the states 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.180
 together what you have to eat is equal to 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.219
 movie is not trustworthy is totally 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:41.660
 take the movie that potato totti is 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:44.579
 so the milk or shut doors spoke 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.680
 about the range but the food and the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.940
 school then come on what they have for 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.170
 eat and drink 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.180
 from my experience I ate at 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.109
 college in queuing to eat 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:03.030
 food there is for these things have to 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:05.790
 china had here I 've never been there is not 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.220
 nor the time you enter that 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.540
 I smelled delicious of chulo because I said 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.100
 This for him started to take snack of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.890
 home is to see after he goes to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:20.009
 So you start there on the menu only. 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.259
 there is hamburger pizza fries is just 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.180
 bad thing for health like for example 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.250
 What I most like about how she is is 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.229
 that cheese noodles relying on the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.799
 canteen ordinary person said that this is a 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.500
 for free on a pizza is very bad, right? 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.720
 Brazilian pizza in bulk so 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.600
 matter is a show of state 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.729
 then takes without filling is good right the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.380
 second question how much does it cost? 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.220
 depending on what you are going to buy or 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.670
 either with a snack basically just the juice 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.890
 or a pizza and a vegetable in a 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:02.170
 lady costing 3 dollars from her 15 is 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.390
 add water is what you want 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.880
 brown and will stay about four 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.729
 dollars but here the scheme is different 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.510
 you do not have much money you have 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.250
 the second only tells their strategy is 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.590
 This kind of complaint is your most 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.739
 cheap and according to what you get 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.420
 third question is yummy is yummy is 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.390
 I think we already said that in the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.980
 trade and now the idea is just this has 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.750
 two types of snacks right not 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.940
 two guards did not find me 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.650
 I have a lot of very professional people. 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.530
 Our school people have to share the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.630
 snack in two parts to arrive in this 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.420
 bbb 10 you're lucky you're leaving 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.700
 You 're lucky you 're going to put a chip in it. 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.970
 Why do I snack? 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.489
 thing here is equal to almost all oil in the 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.040
 There 's a food war, I said. 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.610
 with the fbi making a plate in one foot and 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.230
 She's going to have a lunchtime management. Let's go. 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.650
 show my kiss to the mother with this is just 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.989
 here o 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.989
 direct from portugal around here a lot 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:08.950
 abroad is more than 50% in our 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:12.220
 Latino school is all hispano-brasileiro 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:22.690
 laws must go up to 15 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:24.519
 hence a curiosity they do not give a knife and 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.820
 I ended up studying this one more 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.769
 weekly video I think O 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.579
 It's probably Sunday we go there. 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.450
 Sunday 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.450
 the universal 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.959
 But I think if we go to 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.730
 Leave it to us if we did not go to 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:44.340
 bet the memory then is that the 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.090
 video bread already allowed leave your fan 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.720
 leave the cellphone 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.230
 if you did not like let seletti know 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.230
 What does she want?
