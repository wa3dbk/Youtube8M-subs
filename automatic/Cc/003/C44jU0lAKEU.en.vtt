think you're reading all the markings if

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.050 
think you're reading all the markings if
you<00:04:43.190> pause<00:04:43.430> it<00:04:43.460> if<00:04:44.680> you<00:04:45.680> check<00:04:46.039> the<00:04:46.460> bottom<00:04:46.880> of

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
you pause it if you check the bottom of

this<00:04:47.930> old<00:04:48.139> Shawn<00:04:48.470> it's<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.490> same<00:04:49.820> exact

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
this old Shawn it's the same exact

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.710 
this old Shawn it's the same exact
markings<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:51.289> only<00:04:51.470> thing<00:04:51.880> that<00:04:52.880> I<00:04:52.910> could

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
markings the only thing that I could

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.490 
markings the only thing that I could
think<00:04:53.750> of<00:04:54.139> is<00:04:54.440> that<00:04:54.889> they<00:04:55.310> use<00:04:55.490> same<00:04:55.820> boots<00:04:56.500> the

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
think of is that they use same boots the

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.950 
think of is that they use same boots the
other<00:04:57.620> thing<00:04:57.860> is<00:04:57.979> I<00:04:58.250> was<00:04:58.610> thinking<00:04:58.810> with<00:04:59.810> the

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
other thing is I was thinking with the

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.029 
other thing is I was thinking with the
bottom<00:05:00.260> of<00:05:00.410> fond<00:05:00.650> on<00:05:00.830> those<00:05:01.070> colors<00:05:01.490> are<00:05:01.849> black

bottom of fond on those colors are black

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:06.219 
bottom of fond on those colors are black
so<00:05:04.039> I'm<00:05:04.370> pretty<00:05:05.210> sure<00:05:05.479> they<00:05:05.630> just<00:05:05.660> used<00:05:06.110> a

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
so I'm pretty sure they just used a

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.560 
so I'm pretty sure they just used a
different<00:05:06.380> chest<00:05:06.770> a<00:05:07.039> different<00:05:07.370> head<00:05:07.520> but<00:05:08.479> you

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
different chest a different head but you

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.140 
different chest a different head but you
use<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:08.690> same<00:05:08.810> bottom<00:05:09.669> that's<00:05:10.669> my<00:05:10.849> thoughts

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
use the same bottom that's my thoughts

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.120 
use the same bottom that's my thoughts
on<00:05:11.450> that<00:05:11.630> I'm<00:05:12.500> off<00:05:12.620> for<00:05:12.800> my<00:05:12.860> last<00:05:13.430> thing

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130
