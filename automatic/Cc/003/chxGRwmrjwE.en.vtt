 Welcome to meet presentations Founder who is loud 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.669
 I've already heard that Dekker has to go because you look that way 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.949
 on the ramp Musikmesse 2010 was correspondingly 2 new as the train was 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.520
 presented 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.690
 namely the new IGS class below 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.390
 there would be Sachs 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.410
 Per 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.410
 and that the x 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.550
 both have an optimized network though 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.870
 It was bronze to us 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.870
 which is not everyday that he has to do 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.860
 if that's us 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.860
 Breuer 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.750

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.670
 Dr 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.790
 the Opelans go with it 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.710
 These records are to be played 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.930
 practice practicing on the Mediterranean now should already 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.440
 Flights were able to watch such strange 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.140
 he was a professional instrument resourceful son came with a lot 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.140
 good to play tool addressing and asserting 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.039
 Roger problem by itself but now comes for comparison 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.090
 so that is ultimately both instruments dar that is normal explained that is 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.339
 and marked 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:11.499
 below normally compare the two because 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.539
 we can 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:20.199
 b 519 Aust the Six Group and then suddenly dead and then you could do it yourself 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.089
 decide whether the two sound different or whether the 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:24.949
 us economy 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:27.949
 according to Mayr HÃ¶he stretch saxophonist 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.539
 Percent one 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.029
 Hermann percent 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:44.369
 and around 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:47.369
 Rheine 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.449
 stonewall 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:57.859
 huge different 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.089
 Of course, you can only imagine something 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:01.639
 but OK 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.669
 Bolt becomes one person and the other 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.989
 not everyone should decide for themselves 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.989
 look at us that makes the landesliga spectacular 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.799
 new life kn 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.099
 Lacatus is called action right so a bit smelly trains so 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.359
 large brushed certain species larger 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.519
 And the special here is still that is in any case edition of mother of pearl has 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:27.860
 Country life from to the 4 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.279
 at least, only 20 references to saxophone 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.629
 if something is not so pleasant and won the game 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.170
 I think yes to the biggest difference about image deep 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.679
 and 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:44.279
 that looks different it feels different i do not want to see more blood 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:46.069
