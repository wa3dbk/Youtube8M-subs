00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
but the first thing that you want to do

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.890 
but the first thing that you want to do
is<00:02:17.760> just<00:02:18.240> go<00:02:18.630> on<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.459> like<00:02:20.720> pictures<00:02:21.720> like

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900

I<00:02:26.330> usually<00:02:27.330> like<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.690> use<00:02:27.739> c1<00:02:28.739> or<00:02:29.360> f2<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:31.470> think

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
I usually like to use c1 or f2 I think

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.570 
I usually like to use c1 or f2 I think
when<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.340> edited<00:02:33.000> this<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.959> use<00:02:34.340> MSP<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.370> news

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
when I edited this to use MSP to news

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
when I edited this to use MSP to news
I'm<00:02:35.820> not<00:02:36.000> sure<00:02:36.440> hmm<00:02:37.440> or<00:02:38.010> c1<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.970> think<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.450> use

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
I'm not sure hmm or c1 I think I use

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.630 
I'm not sure hmm or c1 I think I use
this<00:02:39.750> way<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.230> usually<00:02:40.680> don't<00:02:40.980> put<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.310> all<00:02:41.489> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
this way I usually don't put it all the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.810 
this way I usually don't put it all the
way<00:02:41.670> like<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:43.530> 12<00:02:43.860> because<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.310> think<00:02:44.520> that's

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
way like to 12 because I think that's

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.860 
way like to 12 because I think that's
kind<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.120> intense

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
kind of intense

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.110 
kind of intense
so<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.590> usually<00:02:47.010> I'm<00:02:47.340> just<00:02:47.520> going<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.700> go<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.850> 9

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
so I usually I'm just going to go to 9

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.630 
so I usually I'm just going to go to 9
and<00:02:48.830> I'm<00:02:49.830> just<00:02:50.040> going<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.310> change<00:02:50.489> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
and I'm just going to change the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.120 
and I'm just going to change the
orientation<00:02:50.820> of<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.510> picture<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.920> there

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
orientation of the picture I like there

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.940 
orientation of the picture I like there
like<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:55.400> make<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.580> exposure<00:02:57.000> higher

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
like that and make the exposure higher

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.560 
like that and make the exposure higher
it's<00:02:58.950> more<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.520> playing<00:02:59.820> around<00:03:00.030> with<00:03:00.330> it

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
it's more like playing around with it

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.920 
it's more like playing around with it
then<00:03:00.750> actually<00:03:00.900> like<00:03:01.350> following<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.519> set

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
then actually like following a set

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.509 
then actually like following a set
thingy<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.650> don't<00:03:04.980> want<00:03:05.100> this<00:03:05.190> picture<00:03:05.370> to

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
thingy and I don't want this picture to

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.310 
thingy and I don't want this picture to
be<00:03:05.610> more<00:03:05.850> blue<00:03:06.090> toad<00:03:06.330> so<00:03:06.900> I'm<00:03:06.959> just<00:03:07.110> going<00:03:07.230> to

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
be more blue toad so I'm just going to

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.930

put<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.650> negative<00:03:07.980> 1<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.400> temperature

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
put it to negative 1 on the temperature

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.650 
put it to negative 1 on the temperature
and<00:03:09.920> up<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.190> contrast<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:15.360> don't

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
and up the contrast that and I don't

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.660 
and up the contrast that and I don't
really<00:03:15.900> like<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.260> fade<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.650> because<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.070> want<00:03:17.580> to

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
really like to fade it because I want to

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.580 
really like to fade it because I want to
be<00:03:17.790> more<00:03:17.940> colorful<00:03:18.230> so<00:03:19.230> you<00:03:19.320> don't<00:03:19.500> really

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
be more colorful so you don't really

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.120 
be more colorful so you don't really
want<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.890> feed<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.100> and

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
want to feed it and

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.070 
want to feed it and
I<00:03:23.680> used<00:03:24.680> saturation<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.460> lot<00:03:25.730> like<00:03:26.060> that's<00:03:26.930> like

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
I used saturation a lot like that's like

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.630 
I used saturation a lot like that's like
the<00:03:27.170> whole<00:03:27.350> entire<00:03:27.650> like<00:03:27.890> how<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.100> make<00:03:28.460> your
