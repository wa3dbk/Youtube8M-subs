really really exciting result for us
this<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.939> 9mm<00:00:24.180> before<00:00:24.689> we've<00:00:24.869> been<00:00:25.019> releasing

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
this is 9mm before we've been releasing

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.740 
this is 9mm before we've been releasing
tortoises<00:00:25.949> back<00:00:26.250> into<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.640> area<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.390> carried

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
tortoises back into that area we carried

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.370 
tortoises back into that area we carried
out<00:00:27.900> four<00:00:28.410> major<00:00:28.680> releases<00:00:29.099> there<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.230> it's<00:00:31.230> a

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
out four major releases there and it's a

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.620 
out four major releases there and it's a
major<00:00:31.590> component<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.369> our<00:00:32.910> conservation

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
major component of our conservation

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.560 
major component of our conservation
project<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.380> larger<00:00:34.829> tortoises<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:36.360> as<00:00:36.450> you

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
project for larger tortoises but as you

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.569 
project for larger tortoises but as you
can<00:00:36.690> imagine<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:37.140> takes<00:00:37.290> many<00:00:38.190> years<00:00:38.280> for

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
can imagine it takes many years for

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.069 
can imagine it takes many years for
these<00:00:38.760> animals<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.360> reach<00:00:39.600> maturity<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:42.079> so

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
these animals to reach maturity and so

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.869 
these animals to reach maturity and so
we've<00:00:43.320> been<00:00:43.500> waiting<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:43.950> bated<00:00:44.370> breath<00:00:44.399> to

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
we've been waiting with bated breath to

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.060 
we've been waiting with bated breath to
see<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.960> find<00:00:46.559> out<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:46.980> we're

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
see if we can find out and we're

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.619 
see if we can find out and we're
starting<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.579> reproduce<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.570> wild

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
starting to reproduce in the wild

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.770 
starting to reproduce in the wild
because<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.770> any<00:00:49.950> conservation<00:00:50.780> project

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
because for any conservation project

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.479 
because for any conservation project
very<00:00:51.989> reintroduction<00:00:52.860> project<00:00:53.039> that's<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
very reintroduction project that's a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.790 
very reintroduction project that's a
major<00:00:54.379> step<00:00:55.379> forward<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.920> major<00:00:57.410> marker<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
major step forward a major marker of the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.910 
major step forward a major marker of the
success<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> project<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.559> find

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
success of the project and so to find

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.470 
success of the project and so to find
those<00:01:02.129> animals<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.640> wild<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.030> be<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.180> major

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
those animals in the wild to be a major

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.240 
those animals in the wild to be a major
achievement<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:04.320> us<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.680> they're<00:01:04.769> very<00:01:04.920> very

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
achievement for us and they're very very

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.870 
achievement for us and they're very very
exciting

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
exciting

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.710 
exciting
so<00:01:06.869> when<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.140> found<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.500> baby<00:01:07.619> plowshares

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
so when we found the baby plowshares

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.020 
so when we found the baby plowshares
obviously<00:01:10.070> there<00:01:11.070> are<00:01:11.220> very<00:01:11.460> very<00:01:11.549> valuable

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
obviously there are very very valuable

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.390 
obviously there are very very valuable
animals<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.780> us<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:14.270> what<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.390> did<00:01:15.540> was<00:01:15.830> in<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
animals to us so what we did was in the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.590 
animals to us so what we did was in the
short<00:01:17.640> term<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:18.000> put<00:01:18.210> them<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.479> our

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
short term we put them in our

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.899 
short term we put them in our
pre-release<00:01:19.380> protected<00:01:20.100> enclosures

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
pre-release protected enclosures

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.030 
pre-release protected enclosures
these<00:01:21.600> animals<00:01:21.990> are<00:01:22.080> very<00:01:22.200> small<00:01:22.590> they're

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
these animals are very small they're

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.690 
these animals are very small they're
vulnerable<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.610> being<00:01:24.570> placed<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.560> by<00:01:25.830> birds

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
vulnerable to being placed on by birds

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.870 
vulnerable to being placed on by birds
of<00:01:26.880> prey<00:01:27.119> by<00:01:27.600> wild<00:01:28.470> pigs<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.950> well<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.850> we

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
of prey by wild pigs as well and so we

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.630 
of prey by wild pigs as well and so we
wanted<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.299> protect<00:01:30.540> them<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.439> also<00:01:31.829> mark<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
wanted to protect them but also mark the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.179 
wanted to protect them but also mark the
animals<00:01:33.180> individually<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.470> know<00:01:34.680> who<00:01:35.009> they

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
animals individually so we know who they

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.770 
animals individually so we know who they
are<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.610> know<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.210> track<00:01:36.450> them<00:01:36.659> over

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
are we know that we can track them over

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.050 
are we know that we can track them over
time<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.890> track<00:01:38.130> where<00:01:38.159> they're<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:39.000> to

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
time we can track where they're going to

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.260 
time we can track where they're going to
make<00:01:39.240> sure<00:01:39.420> they're<00:01:39.630> safe<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.170> also<00:01:41.270> take

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
make sure they're safe and also take

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.450 
make sure they're safe and also take
blood<00:01:42.479> samples<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.229> later<00:01:43.290> genetic<00:01:43.950> analysis

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
blood samples for later genetic analysis

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.810 
blood samples for later genetic analysis
to<00:01:44.790> confirm<00:01:45.570> who<00:01:45.930> their<00:01:46.140> parents<00:01:46.350> were<00:01:46.820> which

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
to confirm who their parents were which

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.639 
to confirm who their parents were which
is<00:01:47.970> also<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.270> very<00:01:48.329> important<00:01:49.079> factor<00:01:49.409> for<00:01:49.439> us

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
is also a very important factor for us

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.649 
is also a very important factor for us
so<00:01:50.490> we're<00:01:50.850> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.149> tracking<00:01:51.390> these

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
so we're going to be tracking these

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.200 
so we're going to be tracking these
babies<00:01:52.530> closely<00:01:53.220> over<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.640> coming<00:01:53.880> months

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
babies closely over the coming months

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.929 
babies closely over the coming months
and<00:01:54.960> years<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.470> see<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.310> they<00:01:56.460> get<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> best

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
and years to see that they get the best

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.639 
and years to see that they get the best
chance<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.360> survival<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.049> really<00:01:58.409> are<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
chance of survival and really are the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.740 
chance of survival and really are the
first<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.280> new<00:01:59.310> generation<00:01:59.579> of<00:02:00.060> object
