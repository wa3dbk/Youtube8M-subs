00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.010

the<00:04:12.350> look<00:04:12.950> a<00:04:13.130> little<00:04:13.250> bit<00:04:13.490> so<00:04:13.610> it's<00:04:13.730> not<00:04:13.850> like

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
the look a little bit so it's not like

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:21.039 
the look a little bit so it's not like
that<00:04:14.620> dark<00:04:16.630> i'm<00:04:17.630> going<00:04:18.139> to<00:04:18.260> use<00:04:18.829> like<00:04:19.220> one<00:04:20.049> of
