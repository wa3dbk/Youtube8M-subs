like<00:02:18.110> that<00:02:18.140> but<00:02:18.980> we<00:02:19.160> can<00:02:19.340> start<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:20.030> process<00:02:20.480> of

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
like that but we can start a process of

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.720 
like that but we can start a process of
healing

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
healing

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.610

you<00:02:22.730> know<00:02:22.880> politicians<00:02:23.360> have<00:02:23.720> tried<00:02:23.990> for<00:02:24.200> 60

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
you know politicians have tried for 60

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.070 
you know politicians have tried for 60
years<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:25.160> don't<00:02:25.640> think<00:02:25.820> they've<00:02:25.970> got<00:02:26.240> too<00:02:26.960> much

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
years I don't think they've got too much

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.670 
years I don't think they've got too much
power<00:02:27.440> well<00:02:28.130> that's<00:02:28.400> not<00:02:28.610> for<00:02:28.760> me<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.060> decide

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
power well that's not for me to decide

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.610 
power well that's not for me to decide
but<00:02:30.680> let's<00:02:30.950> have<00:02:31.280> another<00:02:31.580> way<00:02:32.210> a<00:02:32.620> spiritual

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
but let's have another way a spiritual

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.880 
but let's have another way a spiritual
way<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:34.270> I<00:02:35.270> think<00:02:35.330> yesterday<00:02:35.750> there<00:02:36.440> was<00:02:36.710> the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
way and I think yesterday there was the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.390 
way and I think yesterday there was the
beginning<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.550> some<00:02:37.940> process<00:02:38.600> of<00:02:38.750> healing

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
beginning of some process of healing

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.100 
beginning of some process of healing
because<00:02:40.400> Hindus<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.120> Muslims<00:02:41.180> were<00:02:41.720> sitting

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
because Hindus and Muslims were sitting

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.450 
because Hindus and Muslims were sitting
together<00:02:42.290> in<00:02:43.210> complete<00:02:44.210> harmony<00:02:45.220> healing<00:02:46.220> and

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
together in complete harmony healing and

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.210 
together in complete harmony healing and
harmony<00:02:47.120> are<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.900> two<00:02:48.110> most<00:02:48.410> important

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
harmony are the two most important

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.420 
harmony are the two most important
factors<00:02:49.690> that<00:02:50.690> we<00:02:50.930> are<00:02:51.080> striving<00:02:51.740> for<00:02:51.950> that's

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
factors that we are striving for that's

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.900 
factors that we are striving for that's
all

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
all

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.160

hood<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.090> may<00:02:59.270> have<00:02:59.360> caused<00:02:59.630> people<00:03:00.050> by

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
hood that you may have caused people by

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.990 
hood that you may have caused people by
keeping<00:03:00.500> it<00:03:00.650> confined<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.280> select<00:03:01.640> you<00:03:01.850> you

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
keeping it confined to select you you

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.970 
keeping it confined to select you you

said next time I'm coming here and it's

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.740 
said next time I'm coming here and it's
going<00:03:04.100> to<00:03:04.160> be<00:03:04.250> in<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.370> stadium<00:03:04.610> did<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.030> wait<00:03:05.570> it
