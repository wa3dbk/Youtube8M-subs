actually<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.030> did<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.270> backwards<00:01:24.830> because

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
actually I did it backwards because

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:35.390 
actually I did it backwards because
these<00:01:26.430> are<00:01:26.670> angled<00:01:32.990> see<00:01:33.990> how<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.320> angled<00:01:34.740> you

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
these are angled see how it's angled you

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.969 
these are angled see how it's angled you
actually<00:01:35.759> put<00:01:36.000> them<00:01:36.180> in

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.569 

so<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.789> they<00:01:41.909> angle<00:01:42.299> upwards<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.259> a

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
so that they angle upwards like that a

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.639 
so that they angle upwards like that a
little<00:01:44.579> bit<00:01:44.700> anyway<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.689> what<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.110> does<00:01:46.320> is

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
little bit anyway so what this does is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.870 
little bit anyway so what this does is
you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:47.130> actually<00:01:47.399> attach<00:01:48.000> or<00:01:48.420> peg<00:01:49.280> this<00:01:50.280> unit

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
you can actually attach or peg this unit

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.219 
you can actually attach or peg this unit

bad<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.579> just<00:02:29.730> looks<00:02:29.880> kind<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.120> silly<00:02:30.329> but

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
bad it just looks kind of silly but

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.300 
bad it just looks kind of silly but
pride<00:02:30.959> actually<00:02:31.440> looks<00:02:31.650> like<00:02:31.829> some<00:02:32.099> kind<00:02:32.280> of

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
pride actually looks like some kind of

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.890 
pride actually looks like some kind of
weapon<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.910> would<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.299> someone<00:02:33.750> would

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
transformed into robot mode is is very

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.479 
transformed into robot mode is is very
very<00:02:38.670> easy<00:02:39.090> for<00:02:39.930> for<00:02:40.530> Mega<00:02:40.680> Sean<00:02:40.920> we'll<00:02:41.190> start

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
very easy for for Mega Sean we'll start

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.009 
very easy for for Mega Sean we'll start
off<00:02:41.610> with<00:02:41.640> just<00:02:41.880> folding<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.480> barrel<00:02:42.750> on<00:02:42.870> the

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
off with just folding the barrel on the

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.740 
off with just folding the barrel on the
stock<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.700> handle<00:02:44.700> up<00:02:44.910> into<00:02:45.239> what<00:02:45.600> will

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
stock and the handle up into what will

become his legs fold unpaid the legs

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.420 
become his legs fold unpaid the legs
from<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.359> these<00:02:51.359> parts<00:02:51.780> take<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.709> entire<00:02:53.040> top

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
from the these parts take the entire top

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.910 
from the these parts take the entire top
of<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.209> gun<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.780> rotate<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.530> on<00:02:55.739> this

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
of the of the gun and rotate it on this

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.370 
of the of the gun and rotate it on this
hinge<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.700> snap<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.569> into<00:02:57.660> place<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.290> then

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
hinge and snap it into place and then

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.559 
hinge and snap it into place and then
it's<00:02:59.069> just<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.370> question<00:02:59.519> of<00:03:00.030> getting

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
it's just a question of getting

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.599 
it's just a question of getting
everything<00:03:00.930> lined<00:03:01.109> up<00:03:01.530> just<00:03:01.859> rotating<00:03:02.430> lights

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
everything lined up just rotating lights

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.670 
everything lined up just rotating lights
down<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.090> lining<00:03:03.359> them<00:03:03.389> up<00:03:03.590> bringing<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
down and lining them up bringing the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.420 
down and lining them up bringing the
arms<00:03:05.040> down<00:03:05.480> flipping<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.630> cannon<00:03:07.530> around<00:03:07.769> and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
arms down flipping the cannon around and

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.650 
arms down flipping the cannon around and
folding<00:03:08.880> up<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.090> head<00:03:09.269> it's<00:03:09.870> very<00:03:10.200> similar<00:03:10.680> to

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
folding up the head it's very similar to

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.080 
folding up the head it's very similar to
legends<00:03:12.660> Megatron<00:03:13.530> except<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.549> Megatron

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
legends Megatron except this Megatron

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.110 
legends Megatron except this Megatron
can<00:03:15.780> actually<00:03:16.170> turn<00:03:16.350> his<00:03:16.560> head<00:03:17.120> possibility

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
can actually turn his head possibility

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.930 
can actually turn his head possibility
on<00:03:18.239> these<00:03:18.420> guys<00:03:18.660> is<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.980> same<00:03:20.310> as<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.549> normal

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
on these guys is the same as a normal

rotation no fist turning but I mean you

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.050 
rotation no fist turning but I mean you
could<00:03:34.440> get<00:03:34.620> some<00:03:34.829> really<00:03:35.040> nice<00:03:35.310> poses<00:03:35.819> out<00:03:35.940> of

could get some really nice poses out of

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.150 
could get some really nice poses out of
this<00:03:36.180> guy<00:03:36.359> the<00:03:36.870> only<00:03:37.109> issue<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.560> have<00:03:37.829> is<00:03:37.980> my

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
this guy the only issue I have is my

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.839 
this guy the only issue I have is my
mega<00:03:38.430> truck<00:03:38.700> mega<00:03:39.000> mega<00:03:39.510> mega<00:03:39.859> chaton<00:03:40.859> his

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
mega truck mega mega mega chaton his

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.780 
mega truck mega mega mega chaton his
hips<00:03:42.120> are<00:03:42.329> a<00:03:42.359> little<00:03:42.569> bit<00:03:43.160> little<00:03:44.160> loose<00:03:44.370> but

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
hips are a little bit little loose but

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.420 
hips are a little bit little loose but
nothing<00:03:45.299> major

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
nothing major

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.710 
nothing major
so<00:03:48.290> legends<00:03:49.340> Megatron<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:51.000> actually<00:03:51.390> smaller

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
so legends Megatron is actually smaller

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.530 
so legends Megatron is actually smaller
as<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.439> can<00:03:52.560> see

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
as you can see

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.170 
as you can see
he's<00:03:54.140> a<00:03:54.170> almost<00:03:54.769> a<00:03:54.980> full<00:03:55.159> head<00:03:55.370> smaller<00:03:55.730> than

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
he's a almost a full head smaller than

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.789 
he's a almost a full head smaller than
the<00:03:56.629> target<00:03:56.810> roid<00:03:58.659> so<00:03:59.659> that's<00:03:59.959> mega<00:04:00.290> shoppin

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
the target roid so that's mega shoppin

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.690 
the target roid so that's mega shoppin
oh<00:04:01.540> one<00:04:02.540> issue<00:04:02.750> I<00:04:02.840> forgot<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.290> mention<00:04:03.439> is<00:04:04.129> he

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
oh one issue I forgot to mention is he

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.819 
oh one issue I forgot to mention is he
is<00:04:04.939> side<00:04:05.390> heavy<00:04:05.720> because<00:04:05.959> of<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.290> gun<00:04:06.500> so<00:04:06.530> I

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
is side heavy because of the gun so I

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.280 
is side heavy because of the gun so I
like<00:04:07.010> to<00:04:07.040> put<00:04:07.129> his<00:04:07.340> leg<00:04:07.489> out<00:04:07.579> like<00:04:07.790> that<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:08.290> the

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
like to put his leg out like that so the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.149 
like to put his leg out like that so the
prime<00:04:09.590> is<00:04:09.920> just<00:04:10.790> as<00:04:10.970> easy<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.299> transform<00:04:12.159> we're

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
prime is just as easy to transform we're

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.330 
prime is just as easy to transform we're
going<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.549> open<00:04:13.879> up<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.239> barrel<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:15.590> fold<00:04:15.980> up

the figure fold them out I just rotate
them<00:04:29.330> around<00:04:29.389> and<00:04:29.930> then<00:04:32.350> flip<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:33.919> head<00:04:34.400> into
