sets<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:35.000> question<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.210> will<00:00:36.420> probably<00:00:36.690> get

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
sets a question that I will probably get

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.350 
sets a question that I will probably get
is<00:00:37.500> how<00:00:37.770> much<00:00:37.980> weight<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.309> I'm<00:00:38.579> using<00:00:38.969> for

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
is how much weight that I'm using for

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.190 
is how much weight that I'm using for
this<00:00:39.480> exercise<00:00:40.020> I'm<00:00:40.680> only<00:00:40.950> using<00:00:41.399> 29<00:00:42.329> kilos<00:00:42.809> so

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
this exercise I'm only using 29 kilos so

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.970 
this exercise I'm only using 29 kilos so
this<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.860> about<00:00:44.730> 60<00:00:45.629> pounds<00:00:46.140> which<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.530> not

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
this is about 60 pounds which is not

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.790 
this is about 60 pounds which is not
really<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> lot<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.300> weight<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.469> end<00:00:49.590> it

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
really a lot of weight but in the end it

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.340 
really a lot of weight but in the end it
will<00:00:49.980> feel<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:50.309> front<00:00:51.059> squatting<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.809> hundred

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
will feel like front squatting a hundred

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.040 
will feel like front squatting a hundred
kilos<00:00:52.770> or<00:00:53.010> even<00:00:53.309> more<00:00:53.579> really<00:00:54.149> if<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.600> think

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
kilos or even more really if you think

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.170 
kilos or even more really if you think
that<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.559> going<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.949> be<00:00:56.070> easy<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:56.760> you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
that this is going to be easy then you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.840 
that this is going to be easy then you
are<00:00:57.390> really<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.890> disappointed<00:00:59.730> in

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
are really going to be disappointed in

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.150 
are really going to be disappointed in
yourself<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.660> use<00:01:01.020> about<00:01:01.199> thirty<00:01:01.829> to

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
yourself so you use about thirty to

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.549 
yourself so you use about thirty to
fifty<00:01:02.430> percent<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.600> maximum<00:01:03.780> amount<00:01:04.350> of

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
fifty percent of the maximum amount of

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.890 
fifty percent of the maximum amount of
weight<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.400> would<00:01:05.580> use<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.689> were

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
weight that you would use if you were

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.539 
weight that you would use if you were
doing<00:01:07.310> your<00:01:08.310> regular<00:01:08.900> workout<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.430> are

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
doing your regular workout so if you are

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.000 
doing your regular workout so if you are
not<00:01:11.820> used<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.240> performing<00:01:12.869> front<00:01:13.260> squats<00:01:13.740> then

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
not used to performing front squats then

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.010 
not used to performing front squats then
you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.369> also<00:01:14.549> perform<00:01:14.970> back<00:01:15.509> squats<00:01:15.900> for

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
you can also perform back squats for

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.740 
you can also perform back squats for
this<00:01:16.520> workout<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:17.880> actually<00:01:18.390> that's<00:01:18.659> not

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
this workout but actually that's not

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.649 
this workout but actually that's not
really<00:01:18.900> convenient<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.670> recommend<00:01:21.360> you

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
really convenient so I do recommend you

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.859 
really convenient so I do recommend you
to<00:01:21.840> use<00:01:21.869> front<00:01:22.439> squats<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.390> if<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.540> are<00:01:24.659> not

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
to use front squats and if you are not

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.289 
to use front squats and if you are not
used<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> performing<00:01:25.560> these<00:01:26.189> then<00:01:26.610> first<00:01:27.090> make

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
used to performing these then first make

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.210 
used to performing these then first make
sure<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.840> know<00:01:27.990> how<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.290> perform<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
sure that you know how to perform the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.390 
sure that you know how to perform the
exercise<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> wouldn't<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.450> going<00:01:30.890> much<00:01:31.890> into

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
exercise I wouldn't be going much into

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.730 
exercise I wouldn't be going much into
detail<00:01:32.970> if<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.360> comes<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.750> technique<00:01:34.259> for<00:01:34.590> this

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
detail if it comes to technique for this

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.890 
detail if it comes to technique for this
exercise<00:01:35.250> first<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.759> all<00:01:35.939> because<00:01:36.360> I'm<00:01:36.659> not

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
exercise first of all because I'm not

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.380 
exercise first of all because I'm not
really<00:01:37.170> an<00:01:37.409> expert<00:01:37.530> with<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.460> exercise<00:01:38.820> I

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
really an expert with this exercise I

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.499 
really an expert with this exercise I
haven't<00:01:40.140> done<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.439> for<00:01:40.740> at<00:01:41.520> least<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:42.210> year

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
haven't done it for at least one year

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.630 
haven't done it for at least one year
now<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.470> technique<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.009> probably<00:01:44.610> a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
now so the technique is probably a

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.580 
now so the technique is probably a
little<00:01:44.909> bit<00:01:45.119> rusty<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.840> didn't<00:01:46.170> know<00:01:46.290> that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
little bit rusty and I didn't know that

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.429 
little bit rusty and I didn't know that
your<00:01:47.460> your<00:01:48.060> wrists<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.840> also<00:01:49.170> your<00:01:49.409> shoulders

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
your your wrists and also your shoulders

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.639 
your your wrists and also your shoulders
will<00:01:50.189> feel<00:01:50.549> quite<00:01:50.880> sore<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.689> well<00:01:52.079> after<00:01:52.530> this

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
will feel quite sore as well after this

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.310 
will feel quite sore as well after this
workout<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.700> because<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.780> position

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
workout this is because the position

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.770 
workout this is because the position
that<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.710> take<00:01:55.979> or<00:01:56.490> at<00:01:56.670> least<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.299> position

that your hands take in the front squat
is<00:02:00.780> different<00:02:01.320> than<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> back<00:02:02.430> squat<00:02:02.729> and

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
is different than for the back squat and

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.090 
is different than for the back squat and
in<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.479> beginning<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.990> will<00:02:04.170> put<00:02:04.500> some<00:02:04.530> stress

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
in the beginning it will put some stress

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.760 
in the beginning it will put some stress
on<00:02:05.310> your<00:02:05.430> wrists

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770

than<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:23.190> long<00:02:23.760> workout<00:02:24.360> on<00:02:24.720> medium<00:02:25.350> intensity

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
than a long workout on medium intensity

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.670 
than a long workout on medium intensity
well<00:02:26.820> first<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.360> all<00:02:27.480> because<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.260> high

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
well first of all because it is a high

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.130 
well first of all because it is a high
intensity<00:02:29.340> rather<00:02:29.760> than<00:02:30.060> medium<00:02:30.420> intensity

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
intensity rather than medium intensity

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.670 
intensity rather than medium intensity
and<00:02:31.320> as<00:02:32.070> an<00:02:32.220> example<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.940> would<00:02:33.000> give<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.810> run<00:02:34.290> so

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
and as an example I would give a run so

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.300 
and as an example I would give a run so
let's<00:02:34.980> say<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.280> will<00:02:35.700> run<00:02:36.000> 10<00:02:36.450> kilometers

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
let's say you will run 10 kilometers

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.330 
let's say you will run 10 kilometers
within<00:02:38.310> one<00:02:38.730> hour<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:39.570> one<00:02:39.900> hour<00:02:40.110> that's<00:02:40.800> quite

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
within one hour so one hour that's quite

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.880 
within one hour so one hour that's quite
a<00:02:41.580> low<00:02:41.790> intensity<00:02:42.390> if<00:02:42.960> it<00:02:43.140> comes<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.590> running

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
a low intensity if it comes to running

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.240 
a low intensity if it comes to running
however<00:02:44.850> if<00:02:45.210> you<00:02:45.390> run<00:02:45.780> those<00:02:46.080> 10<00:02:46.530> kilometers

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
however if you run those 10 kilometers

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.660 
however if you run those 10 kilometers
in<00:02:47.580> let's<00:02:48.090> say<00:02:48.300> 20<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.960> 30<00:02:49.410> minutes<00:02:49.890> then<00:02:50.220> first

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
in let's say 20 to 30 minutes then first

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.910 
in let's say 20 to 30 minutes then first
of<00:02:50.790> all<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.360> would<00:02:51.570> be<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.930> great<00:02:52.290> runner<00:02:52.590> and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
of all you would be a great runner and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.390 
of all you would be a great runner and
second<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.880> would<00:02:54.120> burn<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.630> lot<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:54.930> calories

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
second you would burn a lot of calories

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.520 
second you would burn a lot of calories
the<00:02:56.400> funny<00:02:56.640> part<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.270> that<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.960> doesn't<00:02:58.200> really

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
the funny part is that it doesn't really

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.740 
the funny part is that it doesn't really
matter<00:02:58.740> how<00:02:59.340> fast<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.970> run<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:00.510> same

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
matter how fast you run the same

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.320 
matter how fast you run the same
distance<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.070> distance<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:03.030> will

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
distance it is a distance that will

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.780 
distance it is a distance that will
determine<00:03:03.990> how<00:03:04.620> many<00:03:04.680> calories<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.460> you

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
determine how many calories that you

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.390 
determine how many calories that you
will<00:03:05.970> burn<00:03:06.210> so<00:03:06.600> if<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.960> run<00:03:07.200> 10<00:03:07.470> kilometers<00:03:07.500> in

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
will burn so if you run 10 kilometers in

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.810 
will burn so if you run 10 kilometers in
20<00:03:09.120> minutes<00:03:09.480> or<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:10.020> 60<00:03:11.010> minutes<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.550> amount

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
20 minutes or in 60 minutes the amount

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.330 
20 minutes or in 60 minutes the amount
of<00:03:11.910> calories<00:03:12.210> burned<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:13.110> those<00:03:13.500> 10

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
of calories burned in those 10

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.700 
of calories burned in those 10
kilometers<00:03:15.030> will<00:03:15.390> be<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.960> same<00:03:16.230> for<00:03:16.680> both

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
kilometers will be the same for both

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.479 
kilometers will be the same for both
times<00:03:17.540> at<00:03:18.540> least<00:03:18.900> that's<00:03:19.260> what<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.830> theory

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
times at least that's what the theory

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.449 
times at least that's what the theory
says<00:03:20.880> however<00:03:21.540> in<00:03:22.080> practice<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.830> seems<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:23.310> be

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
says however in practice it seems to be

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.760 
says however in practice it seems to be
slightly<00:03:23.790> different<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.110> only<00:03:25.380> way<00:03:25.590> that

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
slightly different and the only way that

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.130 
slightly different and the only way that
you<00:03:25.950> can<00:03:26.100> find<00:03:26.400> out<00:03:26.640> what<00:03:27.090> works<00:03:27.390> for<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.870> is

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
you can find out what works for you is

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.800 
you can find out what works for you is
by<00:03:28.530> simply<00:03:28.950> trying<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.550> out<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.150> would<00:03:30.510> say

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
by simply trying it out so I would say

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.500 
by simply trying it out so I would say
just<00:03:31.200> give<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.680> go<00:03:31.890> if<00:03:32.130> your<00:03:32.700> endurance<00:03:33.330> is

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
just give it a go if your endurance is

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.470 
just give it a go if your endurance is
also<00:03:33.930> already<00:03:34.170> on<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.739> pretty<00:03:35.310> decent<00:03:35.880> level<00:03:36.270> so

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
also already on a pretty decent level so

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.660 
also already on a pretty decent level so
if<00:03:36.630> you<00:03:36.750> are<00:03:36.840> not<00:03:37.080> a<00:03:37.290> beginner<00:03:37.800> anymore<00:03:38.130> and

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
if you are not a beginner anymore and

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.940 
if you are not a beginner anymore and
just<00:03:38.700> see<00:03:39.540> if<00:03:39.720> it<00:03:39.870> works<00:03:40.140> for<00:03:40.320> you<00:03:40.620> I

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
just see if it works for you I

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.340 
just see if it works for you I
personally<00:03:41.760> think<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.300> this<00:03:42.840> workout

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
personally think that this workout

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.680 
personally think that this workout
workout<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.550> so<00:03:44.730> intense<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.270> it<00:03:45.510> will

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
workout is so intense that it will

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.440 
workout is so intense that it will
really<00:03:45.989> get<00:03:46.320> me<00:03:46.530> in<00:03:46.770> great<00:03:47.130> shape<00:03:47.459> in<00:03:47.700> just

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
really get me in great shape in just

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.710 
really get me in great shape in just
four<00:03:48.840> minutes<00:03:49.020> one<00:03:49.950> or<00:03:50.250> maybe<00:03:50.640> two<00:03:50.820> workouts

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
four minutes one or maybe two workouts

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.220 
four minutes one or maybe two workouts
like<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.200> each<00:03:53.130> week<00:03:53.670> for<00:03:54.300> me<00:03:54.450> personally<00:03:54.780> I

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
like this each week for me personally I

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.610 
like this each week for me personally I
think<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:56.100> one<00:03:56.430> workout<00:03:57.030> for<00:03:57.780> now<00:03:57.989> is<00:03:58.320> more

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
think that one workout for now is more
