direct damage because if it's two
percent<00:04:15.629> for<00:04:16.229> two<00:04:16.470> stacks<00:04:18.139> then<00:04:19.139> that<00:04:19.500> without

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
percent for two stacks then that without

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.760 
percent for two stacks then that without
to<00:04:19.949> be<00:04:20.040> four<00:04:20.250> percent<00:04:20.609> however<00:04:21.060> if<00:04:21.660> it<00:04:22.620> reduces

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
to be four percent however if it reduces

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.469 
to be four percent however if it reduces
the<00:04:23.220> amount<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.460> armor<00:04:23.850> then<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.150> has<00:04:24.300> no

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
the amount of armor then it has no

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.560 
the amount of armor then it has no
effect<00:04:24.510> because<00:04:25.820> condition<00:04:26.820> damage<00:04:27.090> is<00:04:27.330> not

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
effect because condition damage is not

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.450 
effect because condition damage is not
affected<00:04:28.169> by<00:04:29.750> is<00:04:30.750> not<00:04:31.650> affected<00:04:31.979> by<00:04:32.010> toughness

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
affected by is not affected by toughness

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.370 
affected by is not affected by toughness
or<00:04:32.520> armor<00:04:32.850> so<00:04:33.540> like<00:04:33.720> these<00:04:33.870> would<00:04:34.110> have<00:04:34.139> no

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
or armor so like these would have no

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.290 
or armor so like these would have no
more<00:04:34.530> effect<00:04:34.889> than<00:04:35.040> using<00:04:35.729> it<00:04:35.940> on<00:04:36.030> this<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:38.300> of

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
more effect than using it on this and of

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.790 
more effect than using it on this and of
course<00:04:39.570> I<00:04:39.690> chose<00:04:39.900> Lynch<00:04:40.110> forum<00:04:40.380> for<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.620> last

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
course I chose Lynch forum for the last

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.990 
course I chose Lynch forum for the last
one<00:04:41.039> because<00:04:41.250> he<00:04:41.460> doesn't<00:04:41.639> like<00:04:41.820> being

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
one because he doesn't like being

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.320 
one because he doesn't like being
drowned<00:04:42.240> Lich<00:04:42.680> of<00:04:43.680> course<00:04:43.979> I<00:04:44.280> think<00:04:45.060> they<00:04:45.150> need

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330
