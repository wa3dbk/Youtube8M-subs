00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.140
 Then it is next yes 

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:08.140
 51- year-old advertising man aims for new type astronaut 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:17.430
 I became 51 years old last year 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:19.580
 I had not imagined, but I had a chance to become an astronaut 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.590
 The 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:31.630
 Yesterday, Creative Director Taro Takamatsu will be the first Japanese to be 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.630
 It became clear to begin training in Russia to become a civilian astronaut 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:42.740
 All the Japanese astronauts so far including Koichi Wakata 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:47.810
 is a professional to the vocational astronauts in affiliation jaxa 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:53.060
 On the other hand Takamatsu- san's main business is an advertisement creator 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:56.370
 We are aiming to become an astronaut from the Russian Space Agency this time 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.860
 The time when anyone can go to space 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.150
 To spread it 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:10.660
 I think I want to be a new type of astronaut 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:13.620
 That's Takamatsu who had a dream of astronauts from a young age, but of vision at the time of the university problem 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:17.580
 I say that I gave up my dream 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:21.710
 Mr. Takamatsu who worked for an advertising agency afterwards worked 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.710
 Here is a representative commercial 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.320
 The world's first in the world was photographed in space as cm 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.220
 Also in the space of cm of cup ramen with the theme of no border again in space 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.259
 Achieve the annoyance 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.259
 Even in terms of activity other than reporting 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:02.200
 World's first tee held at the National Stadium during the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.789
 Planning public viewing at Far school a 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:10.649
 The word "public viewing" used in the past 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.649
 Wakamatsu says that it is a godmother 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.109
 Such a reason that such Takamatsu aimed at a house 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:24.540
 In order to understand the journey of space, you must first know the space 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.250
 Be yourself first 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:34.900
 Let's go to tone 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:39.480
 Currently working on Takamatsu No.3 Japan's first space travel agency, and the Japanese challenge for space travel in this challenge 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.480
 Also says that there is a thought that say that you want to to those familiar to 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:47.069
 If you look at the current space power, the expensive ones are 10 on the iss International Space Station. 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.550
 Stay for a day 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:56.740
 There is plan of approximately 5.2 billion yen 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:03:04.620
 On the other hand, we can stay for a few minutes in space of Chufu- ken prefecture from Earth 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:06.200
 Recently, prices such as travel have fallen due to damage of about 10 million yen . 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:12.680
 From now on 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:16.450
 To next year because I think that becomes even more affordable but I think it takes a little time 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:22.860
 Because it will be the time when someone goes to space on a daily basis 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:29.820
 I think it will be about two years until space travel becomes familiar 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:31.320
 Mr. Takamatsu will carry out training for about eight months in Russia etc. from next week and carry out astronaut human beings in September 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.950
 It is a mercenary to receive 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.950
 The flight schedule to space is undecided
