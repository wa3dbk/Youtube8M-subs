one horse as well and I thought that was

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
justify making a horse run in a race

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.849 
justify making a horse run in a race
where<00:00:57.059> there's<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.719> good<00:00:57.960> chance<00:00:58.260> it'll<00:00:58.559> die

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
where there's a good chance it'll die

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.549 
where there's a good chance it'll die
away<00:00:59.359> horses<00:01:00.359> die<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.780> Grand<00:01:00.989> National<00:01:01.140> I

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
away horses die in the Grand National I

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.920 
away horses die in the Grand National I
was<00:01:01.829> thinking<00:01:02.129> about<00:01:02.250> how<00:01:02.719> horrible<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.780> is

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
was thinking about how horrible it is

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.109 
was thinking about how horrible it is
that<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.290> exploit<00:01:04.799> animals<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.729> stuff<00:01:05.970> like

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
that we exploit animals and stuff like

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.789 
that we exploit animals and stuff like
this<00:01:06.360> where<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:06.960> what<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> ridiculous

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
this where it's like what a ridiculous

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.399 
this where it's like what a ridiculous
thing<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.369> horses<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.850> die<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.229> then<00:01:10.380> I

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
thing for horses to die for and then I

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.690 
thing for horses to die for and then I
started<00:01:10.799> thinking<00:01:11.100> about<00:01:11.159> all<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> other

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
started thinking about all the other

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.020 
started thinking about all the other
ways<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.510> exploit<00:01:12.990> animals<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:14.030> I

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
ways that we exploit animals and I

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.480 
ways that we exploit animals and I
realized<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.350> dairy<00:01:16.590> industry<00:01:16.740> is

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
realized that the dairy industry is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.910 
realized that the dairy industry is
really<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.630> very<00:01:18.900> nice<00:01:19.110> neither<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> egg

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
really not very nice neither is the egg

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.370 
really not very nice neither is the egg
industry<00:01:20.130> um<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.630> egg<00:01:21.750> industry<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.259> think

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
industry um the egg industry I think

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.359 
industry um the egg industry I think
like<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.909> get<00:01:24.360> genuine<00:01:25.369> free-range

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
like if you can get genuine free-range

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.420 
like if you can get genuine free-range
like<00:01:27.259> wonderfully<00:01:28.259> reared<00:01:28.590> eggs<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.369> is

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
like wonderfully reared eggs that is

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.240 
like wonderfully reared eggs that is
great<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.090> that's<00:01:30.450> probably<00:01:30.840> probably<00:01:31.829> okay

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
great and that's probably probably okay

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.190 
great and that's probably probably okay
the<00:01:32.549> dairy<00:01:32.850> industry<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.840> kind<00:01:34.079> of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the dairy industry is just kind of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.649 
the dairy industry is just kind of
innately<00:01:34.680> cruel<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.520> feel<00:01:35.850> because<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.509> know
