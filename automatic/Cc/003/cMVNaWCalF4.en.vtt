all the highway noise anyway but

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.940 
all the highway noise anyway but
I<00:06:04.750> still<00:06:05.410> think<00:06:05.530> it'd<00:06:05.650> be<00:06:05.740> a<00:06:05.770> perfect

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
I still think it'd be a perfect

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.950 
I still think it'd be a perfect
nightclub<00:06:06.610> or<00:06:06.910> youth<00:06:07.090> gathering<00:06:07.330> place<00:06:07.750> or

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
nightclub or youth gathering place or

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.100 
nightclub or youth gathering place or
something

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
something

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.070 
something
if<00:06:09.439> it's<00:06:09.919> touched<00:06:10.250> inappropriately<00:06:11.080> which

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
if it's touched inappropriately which

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.600 
if it's touched inappropriately which
use<00:06:12.319> for<00:06:12.680> need

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.600 

so<00:06:16.610> I<00:06:16.880> don't<00:06:17.150> know<00:06:17.330> just<00:06:18.260> grand<00:06:18.740> ideas<00:06:19.310> for

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
so I don't know just grand ideas for

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.970 
so I don't know just grand ideas for

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 
buildings that have long decay history

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.970 
buildings that have long decay history
that's<00:06:22.130> been<00:06:22.310> abandoned<00:06:22.940> by<00:06:23.930> the<00:06:24.560> modernity

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
that's been abandoned by the modernity

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.430 
that's been abandoned by the modernity
and<00:06:25.490> the<00:06:25.810> recklessness<00:06:26.810> and<00:06:27.350> the

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
and the recklessness and the

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.090 
and the recklessness and the
frivolousness<00:06:28.630> you<00:06:29.630> know<00:06:29.750> yes<00:06:30.500> I<00:06:30.710> do<00:06:30.770> need<00:06:31.040> to

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
frivolousness you know yes I do need to

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.650 
frivolousness you know yes I do need to
get<00:06:31.340> down<00:06:31.520> to<00:06:31.730> the<00:06:31.820> south<00:06:32.060> side<00:06:32.270> every<00:06:32.480> once

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
get down to the south side every once

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.630 
get down to the south side every once
awhile<00:06:32.810> at<00:06:33.200> sixty-five<00:06:33.740> or<00:06:33.770> seventy<00:06:33.980> miles<00:06:34.430> an

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
awhile at sixty-five or seventy miles an

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.010 
awhile at sixty-five or seventy miles an
hour<00:06:34.820> but<00:06:35.660> I<00:06:36.020> just<00:06:36.830> think<00:06:36.980> the<00:06:37.160> valving<00:06:38.020> could

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
hour but I just think the valving could

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.600 
hour but I just think the valving could
have<00:06:39.110> been<00:06:39.260> done

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
have been done
