00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 Good day to all I want to show a knife 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.880
 what happened like this 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.240
 wedge 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:17.210
 came out such 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.210
 file cup holder 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.980
 I repeat again 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.310
 These things are made of coins. 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.310
 birch bark 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:42.270
 soaked in whether but oil on through 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.270
 riveted here 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.809
 here is such a blade 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:56.260
 It turned out there are small kosyachki until 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:01:00.610
 I know how to do after oiling 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:04.540
 Well, grinding before such knocked out 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:07.020
 here and there dots can be covered later 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:13.600
 some slag or something else 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:17.140
 if someone tells me I would appreciate it 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.009
 while the blade in this state is not yet 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:25.289
 sharpened so there are no tests yet 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:30.700
 not needed yet either just yet 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:33.240
 I show what happened as a result of 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.240
 file 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.810
 in hand is good 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.979
 different grip basically donâ€™t know 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.600
 what about the denominator will be there hand 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.600
 I won't be comfortable with work 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.750
 Well, that's basically what I wanted to show 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:05.600
 well and advice just ask for advice about that 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.670
 as here is what further to cover the bark 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.140
 Well, there are small dimples that's all 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:18.989
 not dimples are some kind of you Blinky 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:22.590
 close up such a wedge 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:27.019
 usually finca or russians I already 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.019
 I do not know what it is called on the right 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:37.489
 here still I will tell still braids which 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.440
 were in the manufacture of this knife 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:44.430
 the first school is that when I 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.030
 pressed the bark on the very same 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.400
 his device stuck it that way we 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.230
 already pressed on it and it was necessary to stick 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.260
 The hotel is old SHR was already well like 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.940
 impaled on epoxy it was necessary from 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.579
 him just when drew with a knife the place 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.299
 that is, he is a little bit of his strength 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.950
 somehow the color shows that it is a little bit like that 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.049
 tilt checks all birch bark respectively 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.290
 went with tilt chock well and back too 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:22.349
 the tip is also well as if for my 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:27.480
 first knife is that is normal that is 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:31.220
 In principle, I am satisfied with the result. 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.220
 keeps tight well nicely but 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.200
 no some pigtails of course exist but 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.600
 I didn't have a full mirror for 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.080
 blade I was absolutely fine 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.840
 sandpaper 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.450
 so so it glitters all well but 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:53.340
 but still it is clear that it is him well, as it were 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.290
 not a complete mirror such there would be 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.130
 believe skin would be full 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.130
 remove the mirror 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.480
 And so very nice to the touch handle 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:09.620
 very much as if not completely smooth 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.110
 such some such as this 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.770
 on waiting for something is very nice sitting in 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:19.810
 The hand is very secure, it does not slip anywhere 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:22.639
 here's a knife all thanks for watching 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.560
 if any comments are advice 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.450
 write 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:31.240
 most interesting there might be something else with 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.240
 make it thank you all bye
