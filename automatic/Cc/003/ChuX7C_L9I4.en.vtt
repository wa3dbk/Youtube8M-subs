right now there's three features that

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.529 
right now there's three features that
are<00:00:27.660> worth<00:00:27.840> noting<00:00:28.560> here<00:00:28.670> first<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.060> new

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
icons and as you saw there was the grid

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.030 
icons and as you saw there was the grid

than the grid of four different ones you
can<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.320> each<00:00:49.530> icon<00:00:49.800> shows<00:00:50.520> up<00:00:50.760> right<00:00:51.059> there

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
can see each icon shows up right there

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.090 
can see each icon shows up right there
okay<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.570> that's<00:00:51.809> one<00:00:51.989> new<00:00:52.140> feature<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.980> other

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
feature deals with the fitness app

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.590 
feature deals with the fitness app
before<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:56.100> need<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.120> dongle<00:00:57.390> in

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
before you need to have like a dongle in

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.450 
before you need to have like a dongle in
order<00:00:57.780> work<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> nike+<00:00:58.620> stuff<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.250> looks

order work with a nike+ stuff it looks

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.670 
order work with a nike+ stuff it looks
like<00:00:59.520> now<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.149> all<00:01:00.300> built<00:01:00.930> right<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.440> has

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
like now this is all built right in has

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.260 
like now this is all built right in has
an<00:01:01.800> accelerometer<00:01:02.070> built<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.059> you'll<00:01:03.149> be

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
an accelerometer built in and you'll be

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.850 
an accelerometer built in and you'll be
able<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.840> without<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.199> wireless

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860

anything like that to be up and running

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.260 
anything like that to be up and running
that's<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> pretty<00:01:10.740> cool<00:01:11.040> feature<00:01:11.270> what's

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that's a pretty cool feature what's

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.910 
that's a pretty cool feature what's
interesting<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.869> was<00:01:13.110> activated<00:01:13.680> just

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
interesting is this was activated just

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.950 
interesting is this was activated just
with<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.340> software<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.060> you're<00:01:15.630> good<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.930> go

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
with the software so you're good to go

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.840 
with the software so you're good to go
there<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.590> last<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.490> clock

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
there and the last one is the clock

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.749 
there and the last one is the clock
faces<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.080> go<00:01:19.259> inside<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:22.759> general

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
faces so if we go inside the the general

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.999 
faces so if we go inside the the general
and<00:01:24.030> then<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.750> date<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.049> time<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.890> see

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
and then the date and time you can see

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.070 
and then the date and time you can see
the<00:01:26.130> different<00:01:26.460> clock<00:01:26.729> faces<00:01:27.119> now<00:01:27.540> when<00:01:27.960> this

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the different clock faces now when this

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.990 
the different clock faces now when this
came<00:01:28.350> out<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:28.950> some<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:29.939> some

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
came out you know some you know some

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.730 
came out you know some you know some
vendors<00:01:30.360> came<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:30.659> with<00:01:30.780> cases<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.590> went

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
vendors came out with cases that went

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.859 
vendors came out with cases that went
around<00:01:31.950> your<00:01:32.759> your<00:01:33.210> wrist<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.630> turn<00:01:33.750> this

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
around your your wrist and turn this

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.440 
around your your wrist and turn this
into<00:01:34.189> basically<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.250> watch<00:01:35.520> pretty<00:01:35.880> cool<00:01:36.090> idea

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
into basically a watch pretty cool idea

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.359 
into basically a watch pretty cool idea
