00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:34.860
 crumble out a try that these 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:42.120

 to save the earth and the mountains 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.870
 crumble 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.989
 euro because she claimed he had 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.900
 a person exactly how can we do so 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.150
 Something yes I say my whole march 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.600
 between us we are here and with us 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:08.730

 perfect or thomassen from egon 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.000
 gone off is a right one 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:26.130
 hammered and slaughtered 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:29.400
 100 is distributed that one sees so rather 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.530

 you give yourself to our religion bon 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.750
 but we are on the right track 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.720
 under pain if we at 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.989
 but he also says that nadir alami 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.660
 clock get the right line on 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:50.400
 mars is the best would be legally 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.769
 who says that they say as human beings 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.030
 are the best but mum says as 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.980
 creator something to people 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.030
 That's why you should be fine with them 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.530
 deal and of course for the 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.780
 complicated when the parents 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.510
 You do not drink alcohol at the table 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.000
 own with them even if you have the 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.120
 alcohol does not grow 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.819
 even if you do not have the alcohol 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.130
 the prophet said together deserved 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.590
 thing the one to the allah and the 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.840
 youngest plopp is not sitting on one 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.110
 shows where the set alcohol 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.020
 that's why you have to distance yourself 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.150
 otherwise there is the flight passengers the 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.440
 Think because you are so in your region 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.940
 You've always been able to notice 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.000
 they do not make any compromises 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.340
 a Muslim may not compromise 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:49.840
 because that's not his religion but 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:53.050
 that we have today, I your you 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.669
 religion perfect what do you want 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.550
 at the dealer or the occasion what would have 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.830
 Change that the religion also Mars 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.280
 and I am satisfied with the religion 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.289
 do you want to change it differently you can do that 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.210
 does not change but you explain his 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.010
 parents in a better way that 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.800
 this is not so practiced by you 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.199
 and that you can not do it in any way 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.389
 but at the same time you have to do it 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.520
 One opponent offered him that to another 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.889
 meetings are best before or after 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.139
 with you also something nice company 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.720
 and one thing i find sad peace 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.360
 who have accepted Islam are after 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.979
 because of islam got worse to theirs 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.470
 parents 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:37.240
 Mobile value of Islam understood nothing 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.729
 Do you know that some parents I saw 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.340
 just accept because they see 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:46.510
 my child won it a lot better to me 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:48.550
 because these did he tell the 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.240
 it was not about before he came 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.759
 so on one 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.550
 because something has changed that can only 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.229
 from the bakom of his religion after all 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.660
 find islam 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.190
 but some people with us before wants to 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.030
 he exhausted his parents 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:08.630
 even if the ko phase for and 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.639
 treated your parents with us fully 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.560
 We are hoping for our own because we too 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.509
 Parents give that something at some point 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.449
 him the islam 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:19.940
 We hope that at all you love yours 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.530
 mother do you love your mother do you love 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.560
 your mother it may be that you 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.810
 No muslims at noon 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.909
 That's the natural love 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.370
 and everyone has prophet himself 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:34.550
 point lived with his mother though 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:37.250
 at least for the time being she is the mayor 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.319
 love siblings and you are allowed one 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.169
 return to his holiday nothing 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:45.349
 give 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:50.810
 not nice but hafs al kabir machmudov 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:52.610
 male one of a son says one 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.300
 Levels is a holiday of the Persians 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.949
 been 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.169
 In any case, no matter which 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:07:00.860
 holiday from the head what if you are 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:04.729
 Only one gift is one and one water 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:09.289
 he worshiped allah 50 years so will 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:11.419
 all his actions because of something 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:14.360
 a hype on what does that mean 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:16.940
 great learned shared you 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.610
 Give someone because where his religion 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:25.300
 confirmed and confirmed to him we are allowed 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:27.319
 that's what makes the region a muslim 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.050
 and you can not do any other religion 

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:32.830
 confirm no matter if your mother or 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:35.960
 the father loves this unbelieving one 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.830
 you have to have that person in your heart 

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.580
 you speak 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:43.490
 that's a farmer that's silly that you 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.380
 It does not matter who it is 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.330
 not that you say what my mother or 

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:50.629
 my father is confirming 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:54.020
 You must never do that as you have to 

00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:55.819
 must not give notification something to her 

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.889
 gifts and certainly not something 

00:07:55.819 --> 00:08:01.759
 which even celebrate her tight 

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:03.969
 no matter but only available for prohibition 

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:03.969
 after mistakes
