female<00:01:12.840> transmog<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.070> cloth<00:01:14.340> version

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
female transmog like a cloth version

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.990 
female transmog like a cloth version
because<00:01:15.030> i<00:01:15.090> would<00:01:15.360> imagine<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:16.049> Thor<00:01:17.000> existed

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
because i would imagine if Thor existed

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.490 
because i would imagine if Thor existed
in<00:01:18.150> world<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.450> warcraft<00:01:18.659> he<00:01:19.080> probably<00:01:19.259> worked

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
in world of warcraft he probably worked

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.830 
in world of warcraft he probably worked
late<00:01:19.880> maybe<00:01:20.880> even<00:01:21.090> mail<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.600> most<00:01:21.750> likely

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
late maybe even mail but most likely

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.670 
late maybe even mail but most likely
plate<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.509> had<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.689> kind<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.170> cloth

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
versions of everything so it's not

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.810 
versions of everything so it's not
exactly<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.530> he<00:01:28.650> would<00:01:28.799> wear<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.670> it's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
