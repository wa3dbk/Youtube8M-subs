maps<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:37.950> actually<00:01:38.040> get<00:01:38.340> into

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
maps and you can actually get into

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.010 
maps and you can actually get into
vehicles<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.150> move<00:01:39.270> around<00:01:39.420> their<00:01:39.810> stuff

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
vehicles and move around their stuff

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.330 
vehicles and move around their stuff
like<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.320> Manta<00:01:40.710> which<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> little<00:01:41.130> hover

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
like the Manta which is a little hover

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.740 
like the Manta which is a little hover
thing<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.880> moves<00:01:42.060> really<00:01:42.210> quickly<00:01:42.329> and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
thing that moves really quickly and

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.080 
thing that moves really quickly and
there's<00:01:42.899> larger<00:01:43.320> slower<00:01:43.680> tanks<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.520> get<00:01:44.729> this

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
there's larger slower tanks you get this

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.240 
there's larger slower tanks you get this
big<00:01:45.390> Walker<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:46.110> will<00:01:46.200> rise<00:01:46.409> up<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.860> kind<00:01:47.159> of

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
big Walker that will rise up and kind of

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.160 
big Walker that will rise up and kind of
just<00:01:47.490> stop<00:01:47.790> across<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> map<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:48.869> lay

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
just stop across the map and just lay

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.260 
just stop across the map and just lay
out<00:01:49.200> these<00:01:49.950> electric<00:01:50.399> beams<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.119> hot

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
out these electric beams of just hot

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.600 
out these electric beams of just hot
death<00:01:51.689> across<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.259> map<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.799> get<00:01:53.250> another<00:01:53.430> one

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
death across the map you get another one

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
squid Walker with a ball you actually

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.929

vehicles that way and then just pull the

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.290 
vehicles that way and then just pull the
tentacles<00:02:06.580> out<00:02:06.700> next<00:02:06.940> time<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.120> want<00:02:07.240> to

change<00:02:07.480> direction<00:02:07.660> or<00:02:08.080> walk<00:02:08.350> a<00:02:08.380> little<00:02:08.590> slower

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
change direction or walk a little slower

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.980

and<00:02:09.190> stuff<00:02:09.369> like<00:02:09.520> that<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:10.509> get<00:02:10.630> something

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
and stuff like that so you get something

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.720 
and stuff like that so you get something
a<00:02:11.050> little<00:02:11.200> more<00:02:11.320> than<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.770> basic<00:02:12.010> variety<00:02:12.700> of

vehicle<00:02:17.230> CTF<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.100> same<00:02:18.310> basic<00:02:18.640> rule<00:02:18.820> you

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
little bit more you can't just go

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.030

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
overall this is the same set of weapons

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.210 
overall this is the same set of weapons
that<00:03:11.230> have<00:03:11.290> stuck<00:03:11.620> with<00:03:11.769> Unreal<00:03:12.190> Tournament

that have stuck with Unreal Tournament

for years now the flak cannon the bio

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
gun the shot rifle all that sort of

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.470 
gun the shot rifle all that sort of
stuff<00:03:18.160> is<00:03:18.430> there<00:03:18.580> there's<00:03:19.120> been<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.239> few

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
stuff is there there's been a few

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.150 
stuff is there there's been a few
balance<00:03:19.959> changes<00:03:20.140> here<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.590> there<00:03:20.739> that<00:03:21.070> if

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
balance changes here and there that if

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.830 
balance changes here and there that if
you're<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.310> long<00:03:21.580> time<00:03:21.880> on<00:03:22.090> Real<00:03:22.269> Player<00:03:22.480> you're

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
you're a long time on Real Player you're

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.170 
you're a long time on Real Player you're
going<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.050> notice<00:03:23.260> so<00:03:24.130> far<00:03:24.340> all<00:03:24.370> this<00:03:24.700> probably

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
going to notice so far all this probably

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.060 
going to notice so far all this probably
sounds<00:03:25.390> pretty<00:03:25.750> standard<00:03:26.350> like<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.680> said<00:03:26.890> it's

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
sounds pretty standard like I said it's

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.340 
sounds pretty standard like I said it's
not<00:03:27.190> really<00:03:27.459> reinventing<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.300> genre<00:03:28.810> but<00:03:29.290> at

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
not really reinventing the genre but at

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.080 
not really reinventing the genre but at
the<00:03:29.410> same<00:03:29.620> time<00:03:29.830> it<00:03:30.070> all<00:03:30.160> comes<00:03:30.459> together<00:03:30.640> in<00:03:31.000> a

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
the same time it all comes together in a

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.420 
the same time it all comes together in a
really<00:03:31.360> solid<00:03:31.959> way<00:03:32.470> that<00:03:32.769> makes<00:03:32.950> for<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.190> lot<00:03:33.370> of

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
really solid way that makes for a lot of

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.970 
really solid way that makes for a lot of
really<00:03:33.880> great<00:03:34.150> multiplayer<00:03:34.660> excitement<00:03:35.530> you

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
really great multiplayer excitement you

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.350 
really great multiplayer excitement you
can<00:03:36.100> jump<00:03:36.310> into<00:03:36.459> a<00:03:36.550> server<00:03:36.760> pretty<00:03:37.150> easily

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
can jump into a server pretty easily

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.870 
can jump into a server pretty easily
with<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.810> standard<00:03:38.410> server<00:03:38.650> browser<00:03:39.010> get<00:03:39.790> in

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
with a standard server browser get in

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.340 
with a standard server browser get in
there<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.060> really<00:03:40.480> start<00:03:40.690> mixing<00:03:40.840> it<00:03:41.080> up<00:03:41.170> I

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
there and really start mixing it up I

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.440 
there and really start mixing it up I
see<00:03:41.500> a<00:03:41.530> good<00:03:41.860> variety<00:03:42.070> of<00:03:42.430> maps<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:43.420> maps

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
see a good variety of maps the maps

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.360 
see a good variety of maps the maps
really<00:03:43.989> are<00:03:44.140> well<00:03:44.680> tailored<00:03:45.130> to<00:03:45.280> the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
really are well tailored to the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.860 
really are well tailored to the
different<00:03:45.640> modes<00:03:45.790> so<00:03:46.269> for<00:03:46.570> something<00:03:46.780> like

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
different modes so for something like

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.330 
different modes so for something like
capture<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.230> flag<00:03:47.320> you<00:03:47.739> get<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:47.980> standard

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
capture the flag you get the standard

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.910 
capture the flag you get the standard
kind<00:03:48.519> of<00:03:48.610> symmetrical<00:03:49.600> bases<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.470> linking

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
kind of symmetrical bases and linking

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
kind of symmetrical bases and linking
them<00:03:50.950> together<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.610> all<00:03:51.730> that<00:03:51.850> stuff

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
them together and all that stuff

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.090 
them together and all that stuff
different<00:03:52.330> pathways<00:03:52.780> through<00:03:53.050> and<00:03:53.350> those<00:03:53.890> all

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
different pathways through and those all

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.680 
different pathways through and those all
work<00:03:54.130> really<00:03:54.519> well<00:03:54.670> same<00:03:55.209> deal<00:03:55.360> for<00:03:55.600> the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
work really well same deal for the

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.360 
work really well same deal for the
larger<00:03:56.050> maps<00:03:56.260> with<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.500> vehicles<00:03:56.950> these<00:03:57.220> are

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
larger maps with the vehicles these are

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.940 
larger maps with the vehicles these are
much<00:03:58.030> larger<00:03:58.360> Maps<00:03:58.840> so<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.500> really<00:03:59.680> gives<00:03:59.739> you

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
much larger Maps so it really gives you

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.440 
much larger Maps so it really gives you
a<00:04:00.010> different<00:04:00.160> sense<00:04:00.459> of<00:04:00.580> scale<00:04:00.790> than<00:04:01.180> you<00:04:01.299> get

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
a different sense of scale than you get

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.449 
a different sense of scale than you get
in<00:04:01.510> deathmatch<00:04:01.959> which<00:04:02.470> is<00:04:02.590> these<00:04:02.950> mostly

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
in deathmatch which is these mostly

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.430 
in deathmatch which is these mostly
smaller<00:04:03.820> maps<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.390> stuff<00:04:04.450> like<00:04:04.660> that<00:04:04.720> there's

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
smaller maps and stuff like that there's

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.870 
smaller maps and stuff like that there's
also<00:04:05.620> stuff<00:04:05.739> like<00:04:06.010> gateway<00:04:06.489> which<00:04:06.730> is<00:04:06.850> a

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
also stuff like gateway which is a

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.580 
also stuff like gateway which is a
deathmatch<00:04:07.120> map<00:04:07.570> that<00:04:07.750> actually<00:04:08.019> has<00:04:08.110> portals

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
deathmatch map that actually has portals

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.470 
deathmatch map that actually has portals
that<00:04:08.769> link<00:04:08.980> together<00:04:09.130> really<00:04:09.820> different

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
that link together really different

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.570 
that link together really different
looking<00:04:10.840> areas<00:04:11.320> so<00:04:11.560> you<00:04:11.620> find<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.100> you<00:04:12.490> know

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
looking areas so you find the you know

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.220 
looking areas so you find the you know
more<00:04:12.790> industrial<00:04:13.360> section<00:04:13.600> then<00:04:13.900> you<00:04:13.990> jump

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
more industrial section then you jump

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.480 
more industrial section then you jump
through<00:04:14.380> a<00:04:14.440> gateway<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:14.920> you're<00:04:15.040> in<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.190> snow

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
through a gateway and you're in the snow

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.660 
through a gateway and you're in the snow
you<00:04:15.730> jump<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.000> another<00:04:16.120> one

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
you jump to another one

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.000 
you jump to another one
in<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.000> middle<00:04:17.360> of<00:04:17.450> a<00:04:17.540> forest<00:04:17.810> it's<00:04:18.590> a<00:04:18.770> really

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
in the middle of a forest it's a really

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.920 
in the middle of a forest it's a really
cool<00:04:19.370> map<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:20.120> you<00:04:20.150> kind<00:04:20.450> of<00:04:20.480> have<00:04:20.630> a<00:04:20.660> lot<00:04:20.900> of

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
cool map and you kind of have a lot of

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.600 
cool map and you kind of have a lot of
little<00:04:21.260> moments<00:04:21.710> like<00:04:21.860> that<00:04:21.890> throughout<00:04:22.370> the

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
little moments like that throughout the

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.550 
little moments like that throughout the
game<00:04:22.760> seeing<00:04:23.120> these<00:04:23.510> unique<00:04:23.930> features<00:04:24.380> these

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
game seeing these unique features these

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.290 
game seeing these unique features these
different<00:04:24.950> maps<00:04:25.130> that<00:04:25.310> really<00:04:25.580> stand<00:04:25.970> out<00:04:26.120> and

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
different maps that really stand out and

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.070
