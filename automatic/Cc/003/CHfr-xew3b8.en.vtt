we're gonna just sink them and see and I

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.819 
we're gonna just sink them and see and I
think<00:00:40.690> we<00:00:40.809> need<00:00:41.020> to<00:00:41.110> repeat<00:00:41.410> that<00:00:41.559> a<00:00:41.620> little

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
think we need to repeat that a little

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.709 
think we need to repeat that a little
bit<00:00:41.980> because<00:00:42.160> so<00:00:42.520> many<00:00:42.610> people<00:00:42.760> do<00:00:43.180> think<00:00:43.570> that

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
bit because so many people do think that

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.750 
bit because so many people do think that
they're<00:00:43.870> fragile<00:00:44.079> I<00:00:44.469> mean<00:00:45.070> they<00:00:45.309> are<00:00:45.399> such

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
see but it's still the root ball is

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
that and then you can see here how just

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.039 
that and then you can see here how just
how<00:01:14.229> deep<00:01:14.560> that<00:01:14.590> hole<00:01:15.100> is<00:01:15.400> and<00:01:15.729> I'm<00:01:16.600> just<00:01:16.840> going

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
how deep that hole is and I'm just going

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.260 
how deep that hole is and I'm just going
to<00:01:17.079> flop<00:01:17.320> it<00:01:17.500> in<00:01:17.650> and<00:01:18.130> you<00:01:18.250> can<00:01:18.460> see<00:01:18.700> if<00:01:18.880> I<00:01:19.060> put

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
to flop it in and you can see if I put

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.010 
to flop it in and you can see if I put
this<00:01:19.479> here

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
this here

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.960 
this here
that<00:01:20.470> we're<00:01:20.650> covering<00:01:21.009> up<00:01:21.189> a<00:01:21.310> good<00:01:21.460> half<00:01:21.820> of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
that we're covering up a good half of

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.899 
that we're covering up a good half of
the<00:01:22.090> plant<00:01:22.450> I<00:01:22.780> would<00:01:23.500> actually<00:01:23.680> go<00:01:24.070> deeper<00:01:24.670> if

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
the plant I would actually go deeper if

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.840 
the plant I would actually go deeper if
it<00:01:25.630> was<00:01:25.960> still<00:01:26.409> above<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.829> water<00:01:27.009> table<00:01:27.369> that

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
it was still above the water table that

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.700 
it was still above the water table that
you<00:01:28.090> can<00:01:28.119> see<00:01:28.540> we<00:01:28.689> have<00:01:28.900> this<00:01:29.049> already<00:01:29.409> done

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
you can see we have this already done

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.580 
you can see we have this already done
yeah<00:01:30.189> so<00:01:30.579> the<00:01:30.759> rule<00:01:30.970> is<00:01:31.390> plant<00:01:31.899> as<00:01:32.079> deep<00:01:32.380> as<00:01:32.560> you

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
yeah so the rule is plant as deep as you

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.999 
yeah so the rule is plant as deep as you
can

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
can

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.190 
can
such<00:01:33.640> that<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.060> roots<00:01:34.270> are<00:01:34.420> still<00:01:34.479> well

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
such that the roots are still well

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.170 
such that the roots are still well
drained<00:01:35.560> so<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.250> more<00:01:36.399> you<00:01:36.490> can<00:01:36.520> do<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:36.939> berm

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
drained so the more you can do to berm

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.300 
drained so the more you can do to berm
it<00:01:37.329> up<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.750> bury<00:01:37.990> it<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.409> better<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:39.250> you

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
it up and bury it the better so you

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.889 
it up and bury it the better so you
don't<00:01:39.579> you<00:01:39.759> know<00:01:39.970> kind<00:01:40.240> of<00:01:40.270> like<00:01:40.390> tomatoes

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
don't you know kind of like tomatoes

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.510 
don't you know kind of like tomatoes
yeah<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.409> really<00:01:41.799> don't<00:01:42.009> have<00:01:42.189> to<00:01:42.399> be

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
yeah you really don't have to be

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.700 
yeah you really don't have to be
concerned<00:01:42.759> with<00:01:43.570> how<00:01:43.630> Dedra<00:01:44.049> plant<00:01:44.259> as<00:01:44.439> long

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
concerned with how Dedra plant as long

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.459 
concerned with how Dedra plant as long
as<00:01:44.860> you<00:01:44.950> got<00:01:45.100> some<00:01:45.369> stuff<00:01:45.610> up<00:01:45.759> there<00:01:45.939> to<00:01:46.060> grow<00:01:46.180> a

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
as you got some stuff up there to grow a

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.249 
as you got some stuff up there to grow a
larger<00:01:47.469> mm-hmm<00:01:47.979> that's<00:01:48.369> it<00:01:48.700> is<00:01:49.119> it<00:01:49.479> is<00:01:49.750> unusual

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
larger mm-hmm that's it is it is unusual

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.780 
larger mm-hmm that's it is it is unusual
yeah<00:01:50.500> for<00:01:50.710> us<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.950> look<00:01:51.070> at<00:01:51.219> it<00:01:51.310> if<00:01:51.430> that<00:01:51.460> feels

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
yeah for us to look at it if that feels

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.080 
yeah for us to look at it if that feels
wrong<00:01:52.210> but<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:52.930> also<00:01:53.110> serves<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.979> not<00:01:54.640> have<00:01:54.850> so

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
wrong but it also serves to not have so

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.300 
wrong but it also serves to not have so
much<00:01:55.270> foliage<00:01:55.829> flapping<00:01:56.829> around<00:01:56.920> in<00:01:57.219> the

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
much foliage flapping around in the

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.639 
much foliage flapping around in the
breeze<00:01:57.460> while<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.180> plant<00:01:58.479> acclimatize<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.409> to

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
breeze while the plant acclimatize is to

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.069 
breeze while the plant acclimatize is to
being<00:01:59.890> in<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.310> bed<00:02:00.549> that<00:02:01.060> is<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:01.570> then<00:02:01.840> by<00:02:02.020> the

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
being in the bed that is and then by the

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.289 
being in the bed that is and then by the
way<00:02:02.170> it's<00:02:02.829> that<00:02:03.039> foliage<00:02:03.579> it's<00:02:03.880> got<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.090> root

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
way it's that foliage it's got a root

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.999 
way it's that foliage it's got a root
system<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:04.719> support<00:02:05.140> it<00:02:05.259> that's<00:02:05.530> so<00:02:05.740> smart

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
system that support it that's so smart

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.560 
system that support it that's so smart
so<00:02:06.549> then<00:02:06.729> you're<00:02:06.850> just<00:02:07.000> going<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.240> fill<00:02:07.450> in

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
so then you're just going to fill in

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.590 
so then you're just going to fill in
