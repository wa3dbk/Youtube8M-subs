00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:08.370
 today we are going to see the pir love fix this is 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:11.089
 an old cube that had to go out there 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.440
 some videos on the internet and I thought 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:18.460
 this has not said good yet it is 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:23.640
 a terra hydro has four sides 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.640
 and it has a pyramid shape that happens to me 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.200
 it is deformed all this is a love 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.190
 fiction 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.789
 then quickly and ready 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.789
 OK 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.800
 and how is this cube solved 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.800
 well our cube really 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.579
 it's not very complicated because the way 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:54.070
 solve it is like two by two by two 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.100
 it's something simpler because the shape 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.420
 how not to be the tetrahedron 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.070
 say how they have to be placed 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.879
 the pieces and usually place at the end 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.879
 so three pieces 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.930
 we go 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.930
 messy to see it and let's solve it 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.259
 once we get the shape of the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.909
 tetrahedron we will place the pieces 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.210
 central with respect to one of the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.210
 vertices 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.860
 we take this reference and go to 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.860
 place the yellow 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.030
 how they are placed 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.960
 here we have it 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.790
 the same with red but we have here 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:51.900
 Y 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.900
 we buy where we have these pieces 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.150
 Well, we thought it was more of a gift 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.940
 what is this piece 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.230
 but not only we have to place these 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.720
 pieces 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.720
 for this we have an algorithm that rotates 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.090
 if this piece here and this piece of 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.390
 here if we turn once this piece is 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.380
 well placed we will demand again here 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.380
 let's see if it looks good 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.030
 s 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.030
 6 this piece transpired and this piece 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.030
 messenger but it is badly placed 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.440
 we are want to turn this piece 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.660
 we will use somewhere else and 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.300
 we use in the bucket 2 x 2 when 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.150
 we wanted to place one of these 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.430
 stones and parked two layers and 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.250
 the two layers have more law and what 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.560
 we have is to flip this piece to place 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.300
 this piece we remember if you have to see 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.300
 the video that we did something like that 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.290
 you see 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.570
 you see this we want to go up 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.570
 in fact 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.490
 let's not lose our as well here 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.130
 we have the two layers 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.710
 what we are going to do is to turn 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.450
 this piece 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.480
 the next layer will be undone 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.840
 yes but only these two and then the 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.840
 we arrange 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.240
 I said 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.250
 and it's still wrong 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.760
 two 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.760
 I said 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.120
 straight 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.220
 right down you see it's fine 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.180
 the whole cube fits us well 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.060
 the other corners that are the central ones 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.160
 let's turn here 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.160
 and it's going to turn here 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.690
 it is terrorism 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.150
 you see 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.650
 we have in him 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.450
 the cube solved I'm going to repeat the 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.450
 steele algorithm turn these two pieces 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.140
 slowly 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.569
 above 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.569
 the fact 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.460
 I have here 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.520
 of the 6 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.490
 our tour out 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.270
 I repeat again 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.270
 It is easy 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.809
 you see emerged again and I repeat it 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.809
 third time 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.280
 Clear 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.430
 well and this is still one more case 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.949
 in the case that we have to 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.699
 exchange these vertices and now the 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.699
 time as it is 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:49.080
 well we have a subscription to see here 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:53.010
 we have here now in this case with this 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:56.419
 vertex the central parts of 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.650
 well placed tetrahedron 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.750
 we are in the case of before we only 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.700
 these two pieces are left 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.020
 we know algorithm to rotate here we are 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.750
 to the group to generate and we know the 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:10.320
 algorithm to rotate only a resemblance to 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:14.120
 of the 2 by 2 that happens if we look at this 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:17.960
 piece here does not correspond 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.080
 like exchange these two 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.080
 pieces 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.180
 what is the algorithm because I'm going to 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.800
 tell 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.409
 we put the peking 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.820
 a kind of the act we give you two of 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:35.130
 six laps and we have this kind 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.240
 we realize that here are the 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.630
 the centers 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.259
 we do not see a position simply 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.710
 really by moving it being what 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:44.710
 we are doing 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:49.350
 12 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.030
 and one 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.510
 we put the centers back in 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.510
 beginning 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.430
 the blue 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.139
 the Red 

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:04.139
 here 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:10.860
 we do not have and did not leave it 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.000
 again it is simply to exchange 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.000
 these two pieces 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.370
 we are placed on this site and 

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:20.830
 we will apply the algorithms again 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:26.370
 choose the role of warning 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:29.600
 and this has been the pinamar fish juice 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.730
 it seemed seems very simple 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:36.020
 it's not that we're complicated is 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:38.620
 entertaining now I remember that from 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.620
 long time 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:45.170
 we said we can also buy and for 

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.740
 practice the 2 by 2 algorithms 

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.790
 points 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.790
 I hope you liked it
