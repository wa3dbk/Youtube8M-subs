put the backwards crossovers now I'm
going<00:00:23.480> to<00:00:23.570> explain<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.830> transition<00:00:25.340> that<00:00:25.369> you

going to explain the transition that you
go<00:00:25.640> through<00:00:25.820> from<00:00:26.240> moving<00:00:26.750> to<00:00:26.930> the<00:00:26.990> left<00:00:27.170> and

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
go through from moving to the left and

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.450 
go through from moving to the left and
then<00:00:27.380> to<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:27.560> right<00:00:27.770> where<00:00:28.100> your<00:00:28.220> weight<00:00:28.340> is

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
then to the right where your weight is

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.359 
then to the right where your weight is
going<00:00:28.490> to<00:00:28.610> be<00:00:28.700> inhabiting<00:00:29.390> feet<00:00:29.599> properly

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
make sure that it's pretty much parallel

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.850 
make sure that it's pretty much parallel
to<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.440> other<00:02:28.560> scale<00:02:28.860> so

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
to the other scale so

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.160 
to the other scale so
like<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.270> keep<00:02:31.420> going<00:02:31.630> that<00:02:31.780> way<00:02:31.840> all

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
like that and to keep going that way all

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.190 
like that and to keep going that way all
you<00:02:32.260> do<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.470> repeat<00:02:32.740> that<00:02:32.920> motion<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:35.020> same

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
you do is repeat that motion the same

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.200 
you do is repeat that motion the same
motion<00:02:35.530> again

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:03:14.620 

you<00:02:40.050> know<00:02:40.890> something<00:02:41.220> like<00:02:41.250> this

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.790 

so<00:03:15.630> we<00:03:15.720> need<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.960> keep<00:03:16.080> in<00:03:16.230> mind<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.620> do<00:03:16.710> the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
so we need to keep in mind and do the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.320 
so we need to keep in mind and do the
back<00:03:16.950> inta<00:03:17.130> crossovers<00:03:17.640> it's<00:03:17.880> almost<00:03:18.180> the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
back inta crossovers it's almost the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330 
back inta crossovers it's almost the
same<00:03:18.480> as<00:03:18.660> just<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.110> backwards<00:03:19.470> drive<00:03:19.710> the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
same as just the backwards drive the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.190 
same as just the backwards drive the
direction<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:20.850> your<00:03:21.060> heels<00:03:21.570> are<00:03:21.720> facing<00:03:22.110> the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
direction that your heels are facing the

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.420 
direction that your heels are facing the
back<00:03:22.350> your<00:03:22.560> skates<00:03:22.800> that's<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.250> direction

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
back your skates that's the direction

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.010 
back your skates that's the direction
that<00:03:23.640> you're<00:03:23.760> going<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:23.910> be<00:03:24.000> going<00:03:24.180> in<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:24.930> you

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
that you're going to be going in so you

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.970 
that you're going to be going in so you
just<00:03:25.170> need<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.320> keep<00:03:25.530> an<00:03:25.650> eye<00:03:25.740> on<00:03:25.770> where

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
just need to keep an eye on where

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.930 
just need to keep an eye on where
they're<00:03:26.130> facing<00:03:26.340> because<00:03:26.550> that's<00:03:26.790> where

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
they're facing because that's where

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.360 
they're facing because that's where
you'll<00:03:27.030> be<00:03:27.120> going

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370
