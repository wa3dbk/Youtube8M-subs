00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.639 
I watched him a little bit you know so
y'all<00:00:42.210> kind<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.480> compliment<00:00:42.780> each<00:00:42.989> other<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.440> I

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:53.819 
y'all kind of compliment each other so I
say<00:00:44.160> y'all<00:00:44.309> did<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.520> really<00:00:44.550> good<00:00:44.940> job

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.099 

first<00:00:54.829> of<00:00:54.980> all<00:00:55.039> the<00:00:55.159> chemistry<00:00:55.519> is<00:00:56.109> amazing

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
first of all the chemistry is amazing

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:03.579 
first of all the chemistry is amazing
between<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:57.589> two<00:01:02.049> we'd<00:01:03.049> say<00:01:03.229> okay

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
between the two we'd say okay

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.229 
between the two we'd say okay
contemporary<00:01:04.280> lyrical<00:01:04.489> we<00:01:04.850> have<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.149> be

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
contemporary lyrical we have to be

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.840 
contemporary lyrical we have to be
completely<00:01:05.540> utterly<00:01:06.080> trained<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.490> help

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
completely utterly trained to the help

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.700 
completely utterly trained to the help
but<00:01:08.240> there's<00:01:08.630> something<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.049> be<00:01:09.170> said<00:01:09.200> about<00:01:09.470> a

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
but there's something to be said about a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.279 
but there's something to be said about a
humaneness<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:10.759> raw<00:01:11.030> quality<00:01:11.659> to<00:01:11.990> movement

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
humaneness and a raw quality to movement

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.219 
humaneness and a raw quality to movement
that<00:01:12.979> that<00:01:13.270> lyrical<00:01:14.270> or<00:01:14.360> contemporary<00:01:14.420> allows

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
that that lyrical or contemporary allows

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.990 
that that lyrical or contemporary allows
to<00:01:15.560> come<00:01:15.799> out<00:01:15.979> you<00:01:16.429> know<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:16.670> I'm<00:01:16.759> saying

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
to come out you know and I'm saying

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.760 
to come out you know and I'm saying
we're<00:01:17.299> in<00:01:17.390> more<00:01:17.600> of<00:01:17.659> an<00:01:17.750> emotional<00:01:17.960> place<00:01:18.500> and

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
we're in more of an emotional place and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.999 
we're in more of an emotional place and
Musa<00:01:19.610> I'm<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.090> proud<00:01:20.299> of<00:01:20.509> you<00:01:20.659> because<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:21.380> you

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
Musa I'm so proud of you because you you

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.370 
Musa I'm so proud of you because you you
embraced<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:22.940> you<00:01:23.090> achieved<00:01:23.479> it<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:23.929> I

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
embraced it and you achieved it and I

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.660 
embraced it and you achieved it and I
and<00:01:24.590> I<00:01:24.679> think

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.210 

like<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.900> balance<00:01:33.290> between<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.710> two<00:01:33.740> of<00:01:34.070> you

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
like the balance between the two of you

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.460 
like the balance between the two of you
with<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.580> rawness<00:01:35.120> and<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.390> humaneness<00:01:35.840> no

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
with the rawness and the humaneness no

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.930 
with the rawness and the humaneness no
the<00:01:36.740> technique<00:01:37.130> wasn't<00:01:37.400> there<00:01:37.520> but<00:01:37.670> you<00:01:37.760> can

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
the technique wasn't there but you can

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.660 
the technique wasn't there but you can
move<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.750> then<00:01:39.290> Nathalie<00:01:39.800> compensates<00:01:40.580> for

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
move and then Nathalie compensates for

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.520 
move and then Nathalie compensates for
the<00:01:40.820> technique<00:01:41.360> in<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.780> strength<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.380> the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
the technique in the strength of the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.050 
the technique in the strength of the
other<00:01:42.650> other<00:01:43.070> aspect<00:01:43.520> I<00:01:43.640> thought<00:01:43.820> it<00:01:43.940> was<00:01:44.030> a

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
other other aspect I thought it was a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.460 
other other aspect I thought it was a
great<00:01:44.300> combination<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:45.020> choreography

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
great combination and the choreography

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.570 
great combination and the choreography
was<00:01:45.590> fabulous<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:46.520> loved<00:01:46.760> it

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.190 

Nigel<00:01:52.580> are<00:01:52.820> you<00:01:53.060> going<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.479> greet<00:01:53.720> with<00:01:53.869> Shane

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200

Amir<00:01:54.759> absolutely<00:01:55.759> this<00:01:56.330> is<00:01:56.390> for<00:01:57.080> me<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:57.440> know

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
Amir absolutely this is for me you know

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.920 
Amir absolutely this is for me you know
it<00:01:57.860> sort<00:01:58.070> of<00:01:58.220> shows<00:01:58.520> what<00:01:59.270> we<00:01:59.390> were<00:01:59.509> trying<00:01:59.750> to

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
it sort of shows what we were trying to

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.570 
it sort of shows what we were trying to
attempt<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.290> do<00:02:00.500> when<00:02:00.710> we<00:02:00.830> put<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.190> partners

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
attempt to do when we put the partners

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.810 
attempt to do when we put the partners
together<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.900> and<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.350> shows<00:02:03.950> exactly<00:02:04.190> what

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
together and and it shows exactly what

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.130 
together and and it shows exactly what
we<00:02:05.030> were<00:02:05.149> trying<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.509> get<00:02:05.690> which<00:02:05.869> is<00:02:05.990> the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
we were trying to get which is the

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.080 
we were trying to get which is the
chemistry<00:02:06.710> between<00:02:06.860> you<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.460> I<00:02:07.729> think<00:02:07.970> we've

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
chemistry between you and I think we've

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.449 
chemistry between you and I think we've
certainly<00:02:08.330> achieved<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:08.989> with<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.500> your

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
certainly achieved it with you to your

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.610 
certainly achieved it with you to your
