00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 [Music] 

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.870
 it is 19h30 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.800
 here is the magazine for us in 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.009
 Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania limitless 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.690
 freedom the art with a paraglider 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:22.289
 take off with it nice evening cordially 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.359
 welcome to the northmagazine a flight over 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.039
 500 kilometers so about from Rostock 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.140
 to frankfurt am main where the pilot 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.820
 no liter of fuel needs but 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.949
 if necessary, a little warm air 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.469
 such ecological achievements 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.239
 can accomplish paragliding 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.260
 of course is and paraglider as 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.000
 Transportation not particularly 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.890
 reliable and you catch it as practicing there 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.690
 first with very modest distances 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.219
 We are close to the exercise site 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.219
 of goods to watch 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.220
 At the very beginning it is very important that 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:58.080
 all the linen here are free if so 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.730
 I then go off the screen 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.160
 properly tearing up and nothing changes 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.140
 and nothing happened to me, johanna 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.630
 Freudental will be here for the first time today 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.590
 climb alone to over 100 meters and 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.690
 fly freely 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.630
 So far, it is not more than ten meters 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.790
 and only on the rope flown flight instructor corner 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:21.300
 Hamel checks one last time and 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:23.040
 harness since then hanging must here of 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.040
 running along the trouser seam 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.180
 and that's right, but here it is 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.020
 right if I cross over here 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.710
 that's what happened to me 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.890
 Now, yes, I have that once 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.660
 competed 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.250
 So I took it anyway 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.490
 which does not bind the clinker 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.479
 really with attached the escape 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.979
 begins with the rise of the market 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.470
 forward now is still relatively much 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.369
 Wind means ours 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.440
 running speed to take off 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.090
 I have not so great were always 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.479
 a bit of bodyweight forward that 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.770
 calls umbrella rise gesture very slowly 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.220
 with the arms up and up 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.020
 running speed to take off 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.180
 a wind at the other end of the square 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:17.790
 the pilots will be in with their umbrellas 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:20.390
 pulled the air and there you always come 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.390
 I was told 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.800
 because wear 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.019
 maybe change 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.879
 Run on the bar made by Johanna 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.140
 is perforation all the time 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.140
 flight instructor connected 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.170
 [Music] 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.209
 meanwhile, there are the others too 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.010
 paragliders went into the air 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.319
 with good thermics come the experienced 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.920
 Pilots here in the north up to 100 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.920
 miles away 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.300
 with the hands 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.300
 stay exactly 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:21.930
 I do not fully understand that 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.570
 absolutely beautiful 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.160
 as soon as you fly so easily and 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:32.480
 is totally exciting because it's all new 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:35.580
 he is totally nice and gentle 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.500
 Johanna has risen to 130 meters 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.190
 and she will do it again next time 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.190
 create again
