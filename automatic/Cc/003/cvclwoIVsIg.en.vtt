 time because the e3 is already approaching that is 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.850
 on June 12, many people asked 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.079
 well the e3 is on June 12 for 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.550
 what I understand if I am 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.640
 wrong then correct less 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.410
 comments the user and cfe link that 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.700
 is a developer of black your 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.920
 studies on the day of yesterday yesterday 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.350
 published some images in relation to 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.859
 tour software 4 I have seen in certain 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.570
 pages this information about this but 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.850
 in most pages only put 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.129
 an image and they put a very information 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.690
 short and I did not want to be short of 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.880
 information and 3 summary 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.640
 minutes talking about the image and now 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.670
 I did not decide to investigate further and 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.380
 bring you more information and be able to 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.050
 so I found him and they're going to listen to him 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.000
 right now, as most of you know, you know 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.970
 studies is responsible for developing 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.460
 the new software we still do not know name 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.190
 but we call x 4 for season 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.250
 good I x 4 will be used in directx 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.620
 12 and on the graphic engine of a real 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.720
 4 good engineer yesterday 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.030
 as I tell you they have filtered well no 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.370
 have leaked this developer has 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.420
 published images regarding 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.920
 software 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.450
 I had seen but did not take him much 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.000
 importance because he said that it's not only 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.650
 an image but then I started to see in 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.300
 forums I started to see on pages that 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.440
 they started talking about this and I said 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.530
 then I will not investigate further 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.720
 and here is the first image that this 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.700
 user showed would be the one they are seeing 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.760
 next in the first image that 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.790
 this person posted says in the study 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.560
 fashionable for the rest of the week or are 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.660
 First of all, you will ask yourself 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.780
 Today is even but it is not good cab 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.550
 mocap would be capture of movement 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.920
 right now, nothing comes to mind 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.510
 but this later in the video what 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.250
 I will explain very well with an example 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.080
 I'm going to make this user good 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.090
 public this image may not come to you 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.500
 nothing to the mind but for people 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.300
 that we have investigated how to 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.090
 they develop videogames well 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.580
 they will know that some scenes are needed 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.880
 real people put on a suit 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.160
 black and in scenarios more or less like that and 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.050
 they start doing movements that will go to 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.200
 video games and a computer the 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.540
 transforms and digitizes it in about 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.400
 dolls and things like that I know 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.560
 that I 'm understanding if we 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.630
 we enter the conversations within 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.550
 of this image we can realize 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.290
 that there is very valuable information that does not 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.030
 I have seen in no pages I have not seen 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.950
 in any forums so be prepared 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.230
 for what the user is going to hear 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.300
 every time he asks this kind of thing 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.470
 that's great photos and updates 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.170
 about what is happening in the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.750
 offices would be surprising to what already 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.519
 who answers if I can I will be uploading 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.030
 photos scenes that puts a face 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.970
 happy 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.950
 louis asks what is that thing that 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.660
 appears in the middle 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.819
 in the center of the image that looks 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.500
 toaster if we analyze very well the 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.030
 image we can realize that there 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.410
 one thing that gets attention and is what 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.599
 what's in between that is like a guy 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.200
 wooden box to what since it 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.970
 Answer is the control panel 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.160
 confirmed for the next and software 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.480
 what I am saying is not a lie 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.280
 they will be able to realize on twitter 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.560
 officer of this person I will leave it in the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.810
 description analyze it very well and you 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.360
 you stay like that but what is 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.879
 let's wait and see much more 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.190
 in very little if we keep reading 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.260
 the conversations we can come across with 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.019
 more interesting things the user and 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.410
 Jonathan asks if they have already 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.599
 at least 65% in the development of the 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.450
 new jeep howard what already 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.970
 they respond I can not share that what 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.220
 I feel and puts a sad face as 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.849
 let's not move on to the next image that 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.980
 who posted how you can realize 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.599
 we can appreciate in the image how it is 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.209
 a wait a kind of team of 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.609
 sound and things like that if we go into 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.830
 the image we do not see many answers 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.000
 interesting on the part of jack but what 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.890
 what do you put in the image 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.600
 it's very interesting and they put a lot 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.300
 attention because this may depend on what 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.490
 of the e3 this user puts in the 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.710
 description of the image and says the 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.490
 audio equipment working on the shoot 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.100
 of mocha as I told you mocha is capture 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.620
 of movement and we could put by 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.770
 example a user dressed in black with 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.720
 certain things attached to the suit the 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.610
 computer digitizes it and what 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.560
 transformed into a doll and so 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.110
 they create some scenes of videogames 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.660
 let's move on to the next image that has 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.570
 relationship with this one that I am showing and 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.000
 as last this image as you can 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.890
 realize this person carries this 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.990
 costume that he had told them he has 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:11.250
 some little things for the computer 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.590
 digital and you are a user as it puts 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.450
 in the description of the image a lot of eye 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.370
 be very careful because starting 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.860
 from now on all the infos the information 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.950
 that is going out is going to be true last 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.440
 shooting day and last day or how many 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.630
 days are rolling this scene or this 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.450
 this teaser or motion capture what 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.210
 that is one of the actors in a suit 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.970
 of mocha as mocap had told them is 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.669
 motion capture and this is used 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.160
 to shoot video games or movies that 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.110
 need to digitize over 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.090
 computer if you do not know what I'm 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.830
 speaking I'm going to put this example and 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.530
 pay close attention because that suit 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.970
 that this person has a lot 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.090
 kinship with what they will see 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.090
 continuation 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.350
 as we can observe this person is 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.890
 puts the same suit and in this scenario 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.360
 makes a series of movements that go 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:08.270
 digitized to the computer and there 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.220
 magic happens and now if we can say 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.740
 that the same thing is happening with these 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.770
 software images already ended 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.110
 filming maybe what they will show in 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.900
 people are dependent on these images not 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.460
 I know wait and without faith or maybe they are already 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.280
 the scenes that are rolling with 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.380
 about whether we enter the 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.020
 image and we read the comments we can 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.900
 see the following the user collie will 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.930
 question go that model looks very good 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.850
 to which since he replies that he does not 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.610
 they could give all the credits to them 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.920
 since peek sends those suits to 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.530
 black your studies that were also 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.440
 used in this what would be the 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.060
 capture of epic games like this 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.800
 what boys and girls are these 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.470
 images that have been published by 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.260
 this user we can conclude we can already 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:00.169
 say that something is being prepared for 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.420
 the good e3 is now finished shooting now 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:05.420
 yes wait for June 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.820
 to see what surprises us and took 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.250
 a breakthrough now we need to see the 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.870
 results so guys and girls if 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.540
 they liked this video I think it 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.580
 did something extensive but well the 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.280
 information were many and I tried 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.320
