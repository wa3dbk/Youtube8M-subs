at<00:04:50.250> this<00:04:50.430> time<00:04:51.200> therefore<00:04:52.200> his<00:04:52.470> ideas<00:04:52.890> about

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
at this time therefore his ideas about

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.800 
at this time therefore his ideas about
the<00:04:53.370> circulation<00:04:53.940> of<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.150> blood<00:04:54.180> were

the circulation of the blood were

the circulation of the blood were
useless<00:04:55.170> in<00:04:55.440> surgery

finally<00:04:57.480> Harvey's<00:04:58.080> ideas<00:04:58.440> were<00:04:58.590> slow<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:58.890> be

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
finally Harvey's ideas were slow to be

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.090 
finally Harvey's ideas were slow to be
accepted<00:05:00.110> because<00:05:01.110> of<00:05:01.530> conservative

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100

how the body's organs functioned and

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.630 
how the body's organs functioned and
therefore<00:05:07.410> physicians<00:05:07.890> were<00:05:08.070> resistant<00:05:08.580> to

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
therefore physicians were resistant to

therefore physicians were resistant to
