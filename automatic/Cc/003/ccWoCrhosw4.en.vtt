00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
paint just sits there it it does what

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.960

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
you tell it to do and it sits there with

you tell it to do and it sits there with
the<00:00:21.060> gloss<00:00:21.330> medium<00:00:21.800> that<00:00:22.800> doesn't<00:00:23.189> happen<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the gloss medium that doesn't happen the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.300 
the gloss medium that doesn't happen the
paint<00:00:23.820> does<00:00:24.000> what<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.449> wants<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.869> do<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.920> in

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
paint does what it wants to do so in

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.359 
paint does what it wants to do so in
which<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.640> fun<00:00:26.939> but<00:00:27.830> the<00:00:28.830> other<00:00:29.010> thing<00:00:29.340> about

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
which is fun but the other thing about

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.490 
which is fun but the other thing about
the<00:00:29.699> gloss<00:00:29.910> medium<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:30.869> more<00:00:31.260> difficult

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
the gloss medium is it's more difficult

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.819 
the gloss medium is it's more difficult
to<00:00:32.189> handle<00:00:33.050> when<00:00:34.050> you're<00:00:34.200> trying<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.530> collage

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
to handle when you're trying to collage

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.430 
to handle when you're trying to collage
with<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.630> we'll<00:00:36.630> get<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.260> minute

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
with it we'll get to that in a minute

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.690 
with it we'll get to that in a minute
but<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.010> want<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.430> let<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.640> know<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.120> now

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
but I do want to let you know that now

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.549 
but I do want to let you know that now
that's<00:00:41.700> just<00:00:41.969> that's<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.899> upside<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that's just that's the upside and the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.220 
that's just that's the upside and the
downside<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:45.239> I'm<00:00:45.450> going<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.660> put<00:00:45.870> some<00:00:46.079> gloss

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
downside so I'm going to put some gloss

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.060 
downside so I'm going to put some gloss
medium<00:00:46.530> out<00:00:48.500> here<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:51.590> you're<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.739> see

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
medium out here and you're going to see

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.910 
medium out here and you're going to see
that<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.640> don't<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:54.149> need<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.809> spread<00:00:55.800> it

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
that I don't really need to spread it

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.560 
that I don't really need to spread it
out<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> spread<00:00:56.940> out<00:00:57.120> all<00:00:57.390> by

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
out it's going to spread out all by

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.900 
out it's going to spread out all by
itself<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:59.390> go<00:01:00.390> where<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.809> wants<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.199> go<00:01:01.910> it'll

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
itself and go where it wants to go it'll

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.990 
itself and go where it wants to go it'll
get<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.300> little<00:01:03.570> bit<00:01:03.780> thinner<00:01:04.110> as<00:01:04.470> as<00:01:05.369> time<00:01:05.670> goes

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
get a little bit thinner as as time goes

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.500 
get a little bit thinner as as time goes
now<00:01:06.600> these<00:01:06.900> will<00:01:07.229> move<00:01:07.439> for<00:01:07.740> hours<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:09.060> you

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
now these will move for hours so you

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.750 
now these will move for hours so you
have<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.049> cognizant<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
have to be cognizant of that you have to

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.280 
have to be cognizant of that you have to
make<00:01:11.939> sure<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.600> them<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> space

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
make sure that you have them in a space

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.320 
make sure that you have them in a space
that<00:01:13.619> they're<00:01:13.950> not<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.610> get<00:01:14.939> on

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that they're not going to get on

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.149 
that they're not going to get on
anything<00:01:15.869> because<00:01:16.170> they<00:01:16.409> will<00:01:16.680> move<00:01:16.890> for

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
anything because they will move for

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.520 
anything because they will move for
hours<00:01:17.549> don't<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.720> think<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.170> go<00:01:19.320> off

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
hours don't just think you can go off

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.460 
hours don't just think you can go off
and<00:01:19.560> leave<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.000> couple<00:01:21.180> days<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.689> come

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
and leave it for a couple days and come

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.219 
and leave it for a couple days and come
back<00:01:22.710> without<00:01:23.580> having<00:01:24.030> checked<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.810> after

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
back without having checked on it after

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.520 
back without having checked on it after
the<00:01:25.409> first<00:01:25.939> two<00:01:26.939> hours<00:01:27.390> you're<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.200> know

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the first two hours you're going to know

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.950 
the first two hours you're going to know
where<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.640> where<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.180> medium<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.840> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
where the where the medium is going to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.830 
where the where the medium is going to
go<00:01:31.140> but<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.400> want<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.610> keep<00:01:32.790> keep<00:01:33.299> that

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
go but you just want to keep keep that

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.800 
go but you just want to keep keep that
in<00:01:34.079> mind<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:36.150> I'm<00:01:36.210> going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> maybe<00:01:36.509> use<00:01:36.780> a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
in mind so I'm going to maybe use a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.380 
in mind so I'm going to maybe use a
little<00:01:36.930> bit<00:01:37.320> more<00:01:37.380> gloss<00:01:37.799> medium<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.520> we're

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
little bit more gloss medium and we're

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.210 
little bit more gloss medium and we're
going<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:39.810> basically<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.979> same

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
going to do basically the same

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.620 
going to do basically the same
techniques<00:01:42.409> but<00:01:43.409> I'm<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> show<00:01:43.979> you

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
techniques but I'm going to show you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.149 
techniques but I'm going to show you
what<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.780> differences<00:01:46.259> are<00:01:46.470> I'm<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.100> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
what the differences are I'm going to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.460 
what the differences are I'm going to
use<00:01:47.340> some<00:01:47.579> different<00:01:47.939> colors<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:49.140> because

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
use some different colors just because

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.300 
use some different colors just because
that's<00:01:49.680> fun<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:51.680> don't<00:01:52.680> wanna<00:01:52.829> use<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.100> same

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
that's fun I don't wanna use the same

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.249 
that's fun I don't wanna use the same
colors<00:01:53.700> over<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.299> over<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:54.869> I'm<00:01:54.930> going<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.110> go

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
colors over and over so I'm going to go

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.069 
colors over and over so I'm going to go
more<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:55.619> Browns<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:58.070> gold's<00:01:59.540> maybe<00:02:00.540> a

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
more with Browns and gold's maybe a

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.490 
more with Browns and gold's maybe a
little<00:02:02.180> buff<00:02:04.100> yellow<00:02:05.630> these<00:02:06.630> are<00:02:06.689> metallic

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.619 
happening because you can see that the
colors<00:03:57.709> are<00:03:57.829> just<00:03:57.889> spreading<00:03:58.430> they're<00:03:59.389> not

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
colors are just spreading they're not

place<00:04:04.269> and<00:04:05.470> they're<00:04:06.470> just<00:04:06.680> going<00:04:06.829> to<00:04:06.889> keep

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
place and they're just going to keep

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.220 
place and they're just going to keep
doing<00:04:07.400> that<00:04:09.069> now<00:04:10.069> different<00:04:10.970> colors<00:04:11.510> react<00:04:12.049> in

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
doing that now different colors react in

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.629 
doing that now different colors react in
different<00:04:12.260> ways<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:13.549> anytime<00:04:14.449> you<00:04:14.840> use<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:15.139> red

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
it is going to be probably spreading

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.060 
it is going to be probably spreading
more<00:04:24.500> than<00:04:24.770> others<00:04:25.159> because<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.539> because

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
more than others because the because

anything like a yellow it's it's going
to<00:04:39.280> be<00:04:39.370> sitting<00:04:40.180> there<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.360> little<00:04:40.570> more<00:04:40.660> but

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
to be sitting there a little more but

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.610 
to be sitting there a little more but
you<00:04:42.880> can<00:04:43.030> see<00:04:43.270> that<00:04:43.540> these<00:04:43.720> colors<00:04:44.020> are<00:04:44.410> really

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
you can see that these colors are really

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.650

starting<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:45.250> move<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.790> they're<00:04:46.450> going<00:04:46.600> to

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
starting to move and they're going to

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.580 
starting to move and they're going to
keep<00:04:46.810> doing<00:04:47.140> it<00:04:47.230> I<00:04:48.450> like<00:04:49.450> putting<00:04:50.110> I<00:04:50.380> like<00:04:50.560> a

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
keep doing it I like putting I like a

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.830 
keep doing it I like putting I like a
lot<00:04:50.830> of<00:04:50.860> contrast<00:04:51.460> you're<00:04:52.030> using<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.570> dark

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
lot of contrast you're using the dark

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.650 
lot of contrast you're using the dark
for<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:53.320> contrast<00:04:57.090> let's<00:04:58.090> try<00:04:58.240> some<00:04:58.480> of<00:04:58.600> this

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
for the contrast let's try some of this

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.320 
for the contrast let's try some of this
tighten<00:04:59.050> buff<00:04:59.230> now<00:04:59.640> the<00:05:00.640> other<00:05:00.850> thing<00:05:01.090> you<00:05:01.210> can

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
tighten buff now the other thing you can

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.850 
tighten buff now the other thing you can
do<00:05:01.510> which<00:05:01.690> I'm<00:05:01.900> not<00:05:02.080> going<00:05:02.230> to<00:05:02.290> do<00:05:02.500> right<00:05:02.830> now

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
do which I'm not going to do right now

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.400 
do which I'm not going to do right now
because<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.970> it<00:05:04.270> takes<00:05:04.870> a<00:05:05.020> little<00:05:05.170> bit<00:05:05.290> of

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
because it it takes a little bit of

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.270 
because it it takes a little bit of
extra<00:05:05.650> time<00:05:05.770> and<00:05:06.490> and<00:05:06.840> I<00:05:07.840> think<00:05:08.410> that<00:05:08.590> you<00:05:09.100> can

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
extra time and and I think that you can

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.120 
extra time and and I think that you can
figure<00:05:09.520> out<00:05:09.670> how<00:05:09.880> to<00:05:09.940> do<00:05:10.150> it<00:05:10.330> is<00:05:12.120> mix<00:05:13.120> the<00:05:13.480> color

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
figure out how to do it is mix the color

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.480 
figure out how to do it is mix the color
with<00:05:15.130> a<00:05:15.370> medium<00:05:16.000> in<00:05:16.410> a<00:05:17.410> paper<00:05:17.620> cup<00:05:17.800> or

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
with a medium in a paper cup or

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.120 
with a medium in a paper cup or
something<00:05:19.360> like<00:05:19.510> that<00:05:19.570> and<00:05:20.050> then<00:05:20.530> pour<00:05:20.920> it

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
something like that and then pour it

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.940 
something like that and then pour it
with<00:05:21.340> a<00:05:21.730> base<00:05:22.030> color<00:05:22.390> so<00:05:23.290> you're<00:05:23.470> taking<00:05:23.680> the

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
with a base color so you're taking the

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.040 
with a base color so you're taking the
color<00:05:24.130> you're<00:05:24.850> putting<00:05:25.330> it<00:05:25.480> in<00:05:25.690> a<00:05:25.780> cup<00:05:26.020> with

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
color you're putting it in a cup with

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.180 
color you're putting it in a cup with
probably<00:05:26.740> about<00:05:27.930> not<00:05:28.930> that<00:05:29.170> much<00:05:29.470> just<00:05:29.500> enough

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
probably about not that much just enough

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.220 
probably about not that much just enough
to<00:05:30.280> color<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.730> medium<00:05:31.090> you<00:05:31.330> don't<00:05:31.780> want<00:05:32.020> to

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
to color the medium you don't want to

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.170 
to color the medium you don't want to
necessarily<00:05:32.460> you<00:05:33.460> don't<00:05:33.490> do<00:05:33.700> it<00:05:33.820> half<00:05:34.030> and

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
necessarily you don't do it half and

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.880 
necessarily you don't do it half and
half<00:05:34.360> I<00:05:34.570> would<00:05:34.690> do<00:05:34.810> mostly<00:05:35.140> medium<00:05:35.560> with<00:05:35.680> just

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
half I would do mostly medium with just

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.100 
half I would do mostly medium with just
some<00:05:36.010> color<00:05:36.220> in<00:05:36.460> it<00:05:36.640> to<00:05:36.790> give<00:05:37.000> it<00:05:37.030> some<00:05:37.180> base

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
some color in it to give it some base

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.860 
some color in it to give it some base
color<00:05:38.410> so<00:05:39.070> then<00:05:39.820> you<00:05:39.970> can<00:05:40.150> put<00:05:40.330> it<00:05:40.420> down<00:05:40.570> and

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
color so then you can put it down and

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.900 
color so then you can put it down and
you<00:05:40.990> can<00:05:41.140> drop<00:05:41.380> colors<00:05:41.770> on<00:05:41.950> top<00:05:42.220> of<00:05:42.400> it<00:05:42.550> it'll

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
you can drop colors on top of it it'll

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.660 
you can drop colors on top of it it'll
act<00:05:43.180> about<00:05:43.630> the<00:05:43.870> same<00:05:44.110> way<00:05:44.320> but<00:05:45.070> you<00:05:45.280> won't

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
act about the same way but you won't

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.810 
act about the same way but you won't
have<00:05:45.880> any<00:05:46.180> white<00:05:46.480> spaces<00:05:47.010> so<00:05:48.010> you<00:05:48.490> can<00:05:48.670> see

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
have any white spaces so you can see

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.190 
have any white spaces so you can see
there's<00:05:49.000> going<00:05:49.120> to<00:05:49.180> be<00:05:49.270> a<00:05:49.330> lot<00:05:49.690> of<00:05:49.720> white

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
there's going to be a lot of white

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.460 
there's going to be a lot of white
spaces<00:05:50.560> in<00:05:50.980> here<00:05:51.370> especially<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:53.110> I'll<00:05:53.260> show

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
spaces in here especially and I'll show

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.090 
spaces in here especially and I'll show
you<00:05:53.500> some<00:05:53.860> later<00:05:54.250> that<00:05:54.520> I<00:05:54.550> did<00:05:54.850> like<00:05:55.000> that<00:05:56.100> but

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
you some later that I did like that but

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.350 
you some later that I did like that but
like<00:05:57.220> I<00:05:57.310> said<00:05:57.370> it<00:05:57.610> takes<00:05:57.730> a<00:05:57.850> little<00:05:57.970> more<00:05:58.150> time

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
like I said it takes a little more time

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.820 
like I said it takes a little more time
so<00:05:58.390> I<00:05:58.810> don't<00:05:59.050> think<00:05:59.230> I'm<00:05:59.320> going<00:05:59.440> to<00:05:59.530> do<00:05:59.710> that

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
so I don't think I'm going to do that

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.060 
so I don't think I'm going to do that
right<00:06:00.040> now<00:06:00.250> so<00:06:01.020> see<00:06:02.020> how<00:06:02.200> different<00:06:02.530> that<00:06:02.770> is

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
right now so see how different that is

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.730 
right now so see how different that is
how<00:06:03.550> different<00:06:03.880> it<00:06:04.270> reacts<00:06:04.660> with<00:06:05.020> the<00:06:05.320> gloss

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
how different it reacts with the gloss

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.420 
how different it reacts with the gloss
medium<00:06:06.130> as<00:06:06.640> opposed<00:06:07.420> to<00:06:07.540> the<00:06:07.690> matte<00:06:07.960> medium

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
medium as opposed to the matte medium

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.590 
medium as opposed to the matte medium
it's<00:06:09.430> just<00:06:09.610> a<00:06:09.700> whole<00:06:09.880> different<00:06:10.210> thing<00:06:10.240> I

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
it's just a whole different thing I

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.390 
it's just a whole different thing I
really<00:06:11.080> like<00:06:11.290> that<00:06:11.590> so<00:06:11.890> I<00:06:11.920> don't<00:06:12.070> think<00:06:12.310> I'm

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
really like that so I don't think I'm

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.870 
really like that so I don't think I'm
going<00:06:12.550> to<00:06:12.640> do<00:06:12.820> anything<00:06:13.300> with<00:06:13.480> it

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
going to do anything with it

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.450 
going to do anything with it
I'm<00:06:14.270> just<00:06:14.450> gonna<00:06:14.630> leave<00:06:14.810> it<00:06:14.960> I<00:06:15.220> like<00:06:16.220> the<00:06:16.250> way

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
I'm just gonna leave it I like the way

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.700 
I'm just gonna leave it I like the way
it<00:06:16.580> is
