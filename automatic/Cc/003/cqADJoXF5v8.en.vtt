so<00:00:06.370> today<00:00:06.640> we're<00:00:06.939> going<00:00:07.029> to<00:00:07.120> insulate<00:00:07.569> an

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
so today we're going to insulate an

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.750 
so today we're going to insulate an
exterior<00:00:08.049> wall<00:00:08.410> with<00:00:08.980> fiberglass<00:00:09.459> insulation

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
exterior wall with fiberglass insulation

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.959 
exterior wall with fiberglass insulation
and<00:00:10.469> there's<00:00:11.469> a<00:00:11.530> lot<00:00:11.830> of<00:00:11.950> things<00:00:12.160> to<00:00:12.340> know<00:00:12.490> I've

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
and there's a lot of things to know I've

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.240 
and there's a lot of things to know I've
split<00:00:13.240> this<00:00:13.420> video<00:00:13.570> into<00:00:13.779> two<00:00:14.320> series<00:00:14.740> first

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
split this video into two series first

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.980 
split this video into two series first
we're<00:00:15.580> going<00:00:15.699> to<00:00:15.760> cover<00:00:16.180> the<00:00:16.330> basics<00:00:16.720> of<00:00:16.810> like

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
we're going to cover the basics of like

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.050 
we're going to cover the basics of like
cutting<00:00:17.410> insulation<00:00:17.980> and<00:00:18.160> getting<00:00:18.850> it<00:00:18.940> into

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
cutting insulation and getting it into

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.240 
cutting insulation and getting it into
place<00:00:19.359> in<00:00:19.630> the<00:00:20.289> second<00:00:20.680> video<00:00:20.890> we're<00:00:21.040> going<00:00:21.160> to

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
place in the second video we're going to

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.770 
place in the second video we're going to
talk<00:00:21.370> about<00:00:21.400> all<00:00:21.850> getting<00:00:22.300> around<00:00:22.510> all<00:00:22.690> the

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:22.780 
talk about all getting around all the

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.960 
talk about all getting around all the
obstacles<00:00:23.110> that<00:00:23.410> walls<00:00:23.740> have<00:00:23.980> pipes<00:00:24.550> plumbing

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
obstacles that walls have pipes plumbing

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.029 
obstacles that walls have pipes plumbing
ducts<00:00:25.450> electrical<00:00:26.289> boxes<00:00:26.650> and<00:00:26.800> all<00:00:26.860> that

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
ducts electrical boxes and all that

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.359 
ducts electrical boxes and all that
stuff<00:00:27.310> so<00:00:27.340> split<00:00:28.330> these<00:00:28.480> videos<00:00:28.840> into<00:00:29.080> two

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
stuff so split these videos into two

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.590 
stuff so split these videos into two
we're<00:00:30.369> going<00:00:30.490> to<00:00:30.550> start<00:00:30.730> right<00:00:30.850> now<00:00:30.880> with<00:00:31.480> the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
we're going to start right now with the

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.410 
we're going to start right now with the
basics<00:00:32.020> now<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.829> overall<00:00:33.010> goal<00:00:33.610> is<00:00:34.000> to<00:00:34.239> make

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
basics now the overall goal is to make

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.770 
basics now the overall goal is to make
sure<00:00:34.449> that<00:00:34.750> you<00:00:34.899> have<00:00:35.110> a<00:00:35.379> nice<00:00:35.860> continuous

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
sure that you have a nice continuous

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.619 
sure that you have a nice continuous
even<00:00:37.780> layer<00:00:37.989> of<00:00:38.319> fiberglass<00:00:39.039> insulation

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
even layer of fiberglass insulation

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.939 
even layer of fiberglass insulation
where<00:00:40.629> it's<00:00:40.780> all<00:00:40.989> nice<00:00:41.230> and<00:00:41.260> fluffy<00:00:41.679> because

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
where it's all nice and fluffy because

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.270 
where it's all nice and fluffy because
fiberglass<00:00:42.640> insulation<00:00:43.260> uses<00:00:44.260> air<00:00:44.469> trapped

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
fiberglass insulation uses air trapped

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.979 
fiberglass insulation uses air trapped
in<00:00:45.429> the<00:00:45.460> air<00:00:45.699> pockets<00:00:46.179> and<00:00:46.359> that's<00:00:46.809> how

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
in the air pockets and that's how

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.979 
in the air pockets and that's how
actually<00:00:47.519> you<00:00:48.519> know<00:00:48.609> slows<00:00:49.120> down<00:00:49.420> heat<00:00:49.780> from

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
actually you know slows down heat from

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.290 
actually you know slows down heat from
transferring<00:00:50.379> through<00:00:50.649> your<00:00:50.800> wall<00:00:51.010> so<00:00:51.940> if<00:00:52.149> you

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
transferring through your wall so if you

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.090 
transferring through your wall so if you
compress<00:00:52.659> the<00:00:52.839> insulation<00:00:53.409> or<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:53.949> just

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
compress the insulation or you just

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.459 
compress the insulation or you just
don't<00:00:54.609> put<00:00:54.819> it<00:00:54.940> in<00:00:54.999> certain<00:00:55.179> spots<00:00:55.600> you<00:00:56.289> could

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
don't put it in certain spots you could

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.950 
don't put it in certain spots you could
sacrifice<00:00:56.679> 20<00:00:57.370> to<00:00:57.460> 25<00:00:57.850> percent<00:00:58.329> of<00:00:58.479> the

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
sacrifice 20 to 25 percent of the

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.809 
sacrifice 20 to 25 percent of the
potential<00:00:59.289> or<00:00:59.589> value<00:00:59.979> of<00:01:00.039> the<00:01:00.129> entire<00:01:00.489> wall

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:00.819 
potential or value of the entire wall

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:03.029 
potential or value of the entire wall
and<00:01:01.149> that's<00:01:01.510> going<00:01:01.690> to<00:01:01.749> cost<00:01:01.929> you<00:01:02.079> money<00:01:02.229> years

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
and that's going to cost you money years

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.100 
and that's going to cost you money years
and<00:01:03.339> years<00:01:03.579> and<00:01:03.639> years<00:01:04.059> from<00:01:04.180> now<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:04.900> you<00:01:04.989> only

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
and years and years from now so you only

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.570 
and years and years from now so you only
get<00:01:05.290> one<00:01:05.440> shot<00:01:05.470> to<00:01:05.680> do<00:01:05.950> this<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.280> you<00:01:06.340> want<00:01:06.520> to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
get one shot to do this and you want to

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.250 
get one shot to do this and you want to
do<00:01:06.700> it<00:01:06.790> right<00:01:06.970> because<00:01:07.240> if<00:01:07.540> you<00:01:07.630> do<00:01:07.810> this<00:01:07.990> wrong

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
do it right because if you do this wrong

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.440 
do it right because if you do this wrong
you're<00:01:08.829> going<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.039> have<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.189> cold<00:01:09.490> room<00:01:09.850> your

you're going to have a cold room your
wife's<00:01:10.630> getting<00:01:10.810> mad<00:01:11.079> at<00:01:11.229> you<00:01:11.409> heating<00:01:12.100> bills

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310

are going to be really high and you're
just<00:01:13.869> going<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.079> waste<00:01:14.289> money<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:15.039> what<00:01:15.159> we're

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
just going to waste money so what we're

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.170 
just going to waste money so what we're
going<00:01:15.369> to<00:01:15.430> do<00:01:15.549> is<00:01:15.670> we're<00:01:15.789> going<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:15.939> need<00:01:16.030> to

going to do is we're going to need to
make<00:01:16.299> sure<00:01:16.329> that<00:01:16.570> all<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:17.170> our<00:01:17.289> pieces<00:01:17.770> that

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
make sure that all of our pieces that

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.380 
make sure that all of our pieces that
we're<00:01:18.039> going<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.189> try<00:01:18.369> to<00:01:18.430> fit<00:01:18.789> into<00:01:18.969> each<00:01:19.210> of

we're going to try to fit into each of
these<00:01:19.479> squares<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:20.680> these<00:01:20.829> wall<00:01:21.039> cavities

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
these squares and these wall cavities

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.240 
these squares and these wall cavities
are<00:01:21.609> going<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.149> be<00:01:22.299> the<00:01:22.420> right<00:01:22.570> size<00:01:23.130> side<00:01:24.130> to

are going to be the right size side to
side<00:01:24.460> top<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.270> bottom<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.810> don't<00:01:26.170> make<00:01:26.409> any

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
side top to bottom you don't make any

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.080 
side top to bottom you don't make any
cuts<00:01:26.740> too<00:01:26.979> short<00:01:27.340> and<00:01:27.490> you<00:01:27.759> don't<00:01:27.909> want<00:01:28.030> to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
cuts too short and you don't want to

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.730 
cuts too short and you don't want to
make<00:01:28.180> any<00:01:28.329> cuts<00:01:28.570> too<00:01:28.810> long<00:01:29.079> and<00:01:29.380> you

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
make any cuts too long and you

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.099 
make any cuts too long and you
especially<00:01:30.009> don't<00:01:30.280> want<00:01:30.399> to<00:01:30.930> compress<00:01:31.930> the

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
especially don't want to compress the

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:33.990 
especially don't want to compress the
insulation<00:01:32.530> sideways<00:01:33.039> and<00:01:33.189> jam<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.670> into<00:01:33.789> any

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
insulation sideways and jam it into any

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.609 
insulation sideways and jam it into any
of<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.179> spaces<00:01:34.659> so<00:01:35.259> what<00:01:35.350> you're<00:01:35.469> going<00:01:35.590> to

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
of the spaces so what you're going to

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.349 
of the spaces so what you're going to
need<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:35.829> do<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.159> best<00:01:36.310> way<00:01:36.759> to<00:01:36.789> do<00:01:37.060> this<00:01:37.210> the

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
need to do the best way to do this the

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.029 
need to do the best way to do this the
fastest<00:01:37.750> way<00:01:37.869> to<00:01:37.929> do<00:01:38.109> this<00:01:38.229> is<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.859> keep

when you really do a whole lot makeup
after<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.190> have<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.340> few<00:02:10.610> put<00:02:10.910> them<00:02:11.030> up<00:02:11.120> into

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
after you have a few put them up into

after you have a few put them up into
the<00:02:11.480> spaces<00:02:11.960> that<00:02:11.990> you<00:02:12.080> couple<00:02:12.500> for<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:13.250> make

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
the spaces that you couple for and make

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.150 
the spaces that you couple for and make
a<00:02:13.490> few<00:02:13.730> more<00:02:13.850> cuts<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.210> do<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.450> same<00:02:14.690> thing

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
a few more cuts to do the same thing

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.230 
a few more cuts to do the same thing
that's<00:02:16.160> going<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.460> keep<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:16.700> moving<00:02:16.820> quickly

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
that's going to keep you moving quickly

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.720 
that's going to keep you moving quickly
and<00:02:17.600> making<00:02:18.110> accurate<00:02:18.650> cuts<00:02:18.890> now<00:02:19.550> here's

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
and making accurate cuts now here's

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.060 
and making accurate cuts now here's
another<00:02:19.970> trick<00:02:20.210> I<00:02:20.510> always<00:02:21.140> add<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.350> half<00:02:21.710> of<00:02:21.890> an

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
another trick I always add a half of an

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.270 
another trick I always add a half of an
inch<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.460> each<00:02:22.870> piece<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.230> cut<00:02:24.530> because<00:02:25.100> I

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
inch to each piece that I cut because I

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.620 
inch to each piece that I cut because I
want<00:02:25.460> to<00:02:25.520> make<00:02:25.640> sure<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.150> have<00:02:26.300> enough

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
want to make sure that I have enough

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.830 
want to make sure that I have enough
insulation<00:02:27.410> for<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:27.890> nice<00:02:28.070> snug<00:02:28.460> fit<00:02:31.720> cut<00:02:32.720> the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
insulation for a nice snug fit cut the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.350 
insulation for a nice snug fit cut the
insulation<00:02:33.020> I'm<00:02:33.410> using<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.920> just<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:34.910> board<00:02:35.240> that

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
insulation I'm using a just a board that

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.090 
insulation I'm using a just a board that
I<00:02:35.420> have<00:02:35.660> scrapped<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> big<00:02:36.500> piece<00:02:36.740> of<00:02:36.770> scrap

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
I have scrapped a big piece of scrap

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.870 
I have scrapped a big piece of scrap
wood<00:02:37.540> put<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.600> on<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.590> fiberglass<00:02:39.920> insulation

push<00:02:41.540> down<00:02:41.900> on<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:43.190> compresses<00:02:43.700> it

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
push down on it and that compresses it

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.870 
push down on it and that compresses it
and<00:02:44.240> makes<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.630> easy<00:02:44.900> for<00:02:45.020> me<00:02:45.230> to<00:02:45.260> get<00:02:45.470> my<00:02:45.620> knife

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
and makes it easy for me to get my knife

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.630 
and makes it easy for me to get my knife
right<00:02:46.880> along<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.330> edge<00:02:47.540> of<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.830> insulation<00:02:49.400> I

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
right along the edge of the insulation I

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.910 
right along the edge of the insulation I
get<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.360> nice<00:02:51.070> clean<00:02:52.180> cut<00:02:53.560> straight<00:02:54.560> down<00:02:54.740> the

get a nice clean cut straight down the
edge<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.880> make<00:02:55.970> my<00:02:56.150> cuts<00:02:56.390> I'm<00:02:56.600> using<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:57.200> tool

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
edge to make my cuts I'm using a tool

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.040 
edge to make my cuts I'm using a tool
called<00:02:57.650> sand<00:02:58.340> leaf<00:02:58.490> at<00:02:58.820> max<00:02:59.150> it's<00:02:59.540> basically<00:02:59.930> a

long edge snap blade knife the long-play
it<00:03:03.170> helps<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:03.470> get<00:03:03.590> through<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:04.010> insulation

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
it helps you get through the insulation

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.199 
it helps you get through the insulation
to<00:03:04.790> make<00:03:05.300> a<00:03:05.330> nice<00:03:05.570> clean<00:03:05.959> cut<00:03:06.230> like<00:03:06.440> that

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
to make a nice clean cut like that

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.670 
to make a nice clean cut like that
well<00:03:08.209> what's<00:03:08.660> even<00:03:08.900> more<00:03:08.930> handy<00:03:09.290> about<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.560> is

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
well what's even more handy about it is

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.250 
well what's even more handy about it is
the<00:03:10.040> blade<00:03:10.280> snaps<00:03:10.820> at<00:03:11.120> these<00:03:11.390> segmented<00:03:12.050> lines

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
the blade snaps at these segmented lines

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.229 
the blade snaps at these segmented lines
I'm<00:03:12.530> not<00:03:12.709> sure<00:03:12.860> if<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:12.980> can<00:03:13.070> see<00:03:13.220> them<00:03:13.400> but

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
I'm not sure if you can see them but

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.360 
I'm not sure if you can see them but

each one we need to starts to get dull

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.070 
each one we need to starts to get dull
just<00:03:16.700> take<00:03:16.850> a<00:03:16.910> pair<00:03:17.090> of<00:03:17.120> pliers<00:03:17.300> to<00:03:17.570> snap<00:03:17.930> it

just take a pair of pliers to snap it
off<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:18.560> then<00:03:18.950> this<00:03:19.100> blade<00:03:19.430> keeps<00:03:19.880> stays

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
off and then this blade keeps stays

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.790 
off and then this blade keeps stays
sharp<00:03:20.450> until<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:20.959> gets<00:03:21.110> back<00:03:21.290> down<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.709> the

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.130 

and<00:03:54.550> cut<00:03:54.849> it<00:03:55.000> like<00:03:55.150> that<00:03:55.209> as<00:03:55.569> fast<00:03:55.750> as<00:03:55.959> they<00:03:56.080> can

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
and cut it like that as fast as they can

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.220

and<00:03:58.680> jam<00:03:59.680> it<00:03:59.830> in<00:03:59.920> there<00:04:00.780> or<00:04:01.780> they<00:04:01.930> don't<00:04:02.020> even

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
and jam it in there or they don't even

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.640 
and jam it in there or they don't even
cut<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:06.510> even<00:04:07.510> worse<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:07.989> they<00:04:08.050> just<00:04:08.200> jam<00:04:08.530> it

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
cut it even worse and they just jam it

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.500 
cut it even worse and they just jam it
and<00:04:08.770> act<00:04:08.980> like<00:04:09.160> that<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:10.030> first<00:04:10.269> thing<00:04:10.390> you

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
and act like that the first thing you

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.240 
and act like that the first thing you
want<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.720> do<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.050> measure<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.620> wall<00:04:11.890> cavity

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
want to do is measure the wall cavity

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.710 
want to do is measure the wall cavity
accurately<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:15.700> then<00:04:15.730> I<00:04:15.880> like<00:04:16.030> to<00:04:16.150> add<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.299> half

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
accurately and then I like to add a half

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.879 
accurately and then I like to add a half
of<00:04:16.870> an<00:04:17.019> inch<00:04:17.290> to<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.650> width<00:04:18.150> all<00:04:19.150> right<00:04:19.829> and<00:04:20.829> a

half of an inch to the height take a
piece<00:04:22.780> of<00:04:22.810> insulation<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.650> you're<00:04:23.770> going<00:04:23.889> to

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
piece of insulation and you're going to

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.650 
piece of insulation and you're going to
need<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:24.070> long<00:04:24.340> straight<00:04:24.910> cutting<00:04:25.210> edge<00:04:25.389> like<00:04:25.630> a

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
need a long straight cutting edge like a

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.820 
need a long straight cutting edge like a
level<00:04:26.139> hook<00:04:26.919> my<00:04:27.100> tape<00:04:27.610> measure<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.710> edge

level hook my tape measure to the edge

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.659 
level hook my tape measure to the edge
of<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.870> level<00:04:31.870> I<00:04:32.050> pull<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.889> level<00:04:33.190> a<00:04:33.400> move

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
of the level I pull the level a move

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.520 
of the level I pull the level a move
level<00:04:34.000> around<00:04:34.180> until<00:04:34.479> I<00:04:34.540> see<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.050> lined<00:04:35.380> up

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
level around until I see it lined up

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.290 
level around until I see it lined up
exactly<00:04:35.680> where<00:04:36.040> I<00:04:36.130> want<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.310> make<00:04:36.460> my<00:04:36.610> cut<00:04:36.820> then

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
exactly where I want to make my cut then

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.550 
exactly where I want to make my cut then
I<00:04:37.360> go<00:04:37.479> to<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.660> other<00:04:37.810> side<00:04:38.050> of<00:04:38.169> the<00:04:38.229> level<00:04:38.380> and

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
I go to the other side of the level and

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.590 
I go to the other side of the level and
do<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.740> same<00:04:38.950> thing<00:04:39.280> then<00:04:40.060> I<00:04:40.120> can<00:04:40.270> make<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.389> nice

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
do the same thing then I can make a nice

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.930 
do the same thing then I can make a nice
clean<00:04:41.110> cut<00:04:41.380> on<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.740> insulation<00:04:42.100> now<00:04:42.760> it's

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
clean cut on the insulation now it's

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.640 
clean cut on the insulation now it's
ready<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.240> put<00:04:43.360> into<00:04:43.510> place<00:04:43.720> it's<00:04:44.440> going<00:04:44.590> to

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
ready to put into place it's going to

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.350 
ready to put into place it's going to
fit<00:04:44.889> exactly<00:04:45.070> it's<00:04:45.729> going<00:04:45.880> to<00:04:45.940> have<00:04:46.030> friction

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
fit exactly it's going to have friction

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.050 
fit exactly it's going to have friction
fit<00:04:46.870> because<00:04:47.500> one<00:04:47.800> side<00:04:48.010> of<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.220> insulation

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
fit because one side of the insulation

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.490 
fit because one side of the insulation
is<00:04:49.300> obviously<00:04:49.720> not<00:04:49.930> going<00:04:50.080> to<00:04:50.139> have<00:04:50.320> the

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
is obviously not going to have the

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.379 
is obviously not going to have the
stapling<00:04:50.889> flange<00:04:51.220> so<00:04:51.790> you<00:04:51.880> have<00:04:52.000> to<00:04:52.120> think<00:04:52.300> you

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
stapling flange so you have to think you

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.150 
stapling flange so you have to think you
want<00:04:52.540> to<00:04:52.570> make<00:04:52.690> sure<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:53.290> fits<00:04:53.620> in<00:04:53.740> there<00:04:53.889> nice

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
want to make sure it fits in there nice

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.719 
want to make sure it fits in there nice
and<00:04:54.190> tight

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
and tight

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.510 
and tight
that's<00:04:55.330> not<00:04:55.570> compressed<00:04:56.020> at<00:04:56.200> all<00:04:56.560> before<00:04:57.490> I

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
that's not compressed at all before I

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.800 
that's not compressed at all before I
staple<00:04:57.910> it<00:04:57.970> I'm<00:04:58.030> going<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.240> fluff<00:04:58.479> it<00:04:58.630> up<00:04:58.690> a

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
staple it I'm going to fluff it up a

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.920 
staple it I'm going to fluff it up a
little<00:04:58.900> bit<00:04:59.970> push<00:05:00.970> the<00:05:01.150> fibers<00:05:01.539> in<00:05:01.690> the<00:05:01.750> fiber

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
little bit push the fibers in the fiber

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.630 
little bit push the fibers in the fiber
less<00:05:02.140> insulation<00:05:02.560> around<00:05:02.979> so<00:05:03.160> they<00:05:03.280> make<00:05:03.490> sure

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
less insulation around so they make sure

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.130 
less insulation around so they make sure
