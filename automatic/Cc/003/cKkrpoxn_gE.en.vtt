00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:12.309
 Good on youtube colleague cars here. 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.590
 once more thinking of your sparrow at 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.010
 environment will now show how it is done 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.830
 a hand pump for people to 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.449
 to save energy is to have more 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:28.140
 final launch income of the same 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.580
 since here we have a corner of 60 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.090
 various gloves knees 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.250
 this reduction is that it may not end 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.350
 here we are going to use a shuttle here 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.140
 or a marble in those 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.989
 Big small will not work with 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.700
 a check valve below 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.930
 We are on this paulo tour that can 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.390
 prevent the water from returning 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.480
 hence its operation it has 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.820
 capacity to throw 1,000 liters in 40 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.420
 minutes until depending on your effort 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.789
 physical of the new season now in power 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:10.720
 suction she has 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:24.240
 here you will see the moment when she 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:24.240
 said the mother 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:51.080
 power tells what was missing with a good 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:54.679
 number of laps sleeve 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.170
 we can mass in Iraq the ace 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:00.799
 grandson a july ball 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.979
 this novel is being assembled here 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.600
 we see here in my post 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:31.060
 you can also make an agreement of 30 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:31.060
 we have the drawer graphic designs 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.299
 I thought it was one more that way. 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.299
 here in the middle is unique 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:51.340
 I do not know if I 'm going up or down. 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.079
 these chance woods like fence 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:02.120
 so that it can be generated in the field 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:03.650
 of stronger air here in a smooth face is 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.060
 a reduction bush 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:14.629
 You pick up the field, then she has. 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:18.650
 that take on screw finish did so 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.370
 a lot of strength and also only when it will be 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.609
 good 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:28.340
 I feel the singular here you stand 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:31.510
 can be a top 10 even will ask James 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.510
 chiton score 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:44.120
 now it is noticed in this scheme here 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:46.129
 even if it is badly done it was with this 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.569
 protest 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.659
 It will work more or less in this 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.530
 scheme that is placed with this one of 50 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.530
 Where are you going to make this move? 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:03.460
 so it's only if you want 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.460
 It's too much to ask questions. 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.340
 I do not like your paranÃ¡ 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:14.140
 the grape and the street a dot with br 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.140
 A big hug, see you later
