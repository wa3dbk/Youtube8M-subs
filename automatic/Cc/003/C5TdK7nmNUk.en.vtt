00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 follow now with harold dutra days 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.940
 picture pearls of the gospel 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.910
 Hello, people , welcome, one more. 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.599
 gospel legs program 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.880
 today giving continuity to our 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.260
 conversation about translation 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.199
 we want to deepen or examine with 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.750
 more detail the translation of the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.130
 bible and for that we need 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.890
 consider both old and 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.469
 the new testament were written by 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.820
 people of the Hebrew people 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.090
 the apostles of jesus were Hebrews 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.600
 living in Israel were dressed as a 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.780
 Hebrew ate like a Hebrew thought 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.449
 with a Hebrew they felt with a Hebrew 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.620
 so do the authors of the old 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.149
 testament 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.370
 but when these books were written 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.549
 in particular, new testaments were 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.549
 written in Greek another culture 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.880
 sometimes the Greeks thought 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:16.560
 totally different from the Hebrews lived 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.500
 without expressing themselves and thinking 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.509
 completely different because the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.450
 Greek is the matrix of the Western world 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:32.130
 that the Hebrews are linked to the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.990
 Eastern world that is very different from 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.159
 Eastern world is different from the world 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.509
 western 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.540
 while the Western world is analytical 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:47.579
 descriptive rational the eastern world is 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:51.170
 intuitive imaginative speech through 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:56.430
 metaphors of symbols and it is for this reason 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:00.390
 that the bible is full to the back planet 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.450
 of metaphors of symbols in the bible god 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.619
 is compared to a shepherd is 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.670
 compared to a cloud is compared to water 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.459
 of rain 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.860
 God is compared to a shadow because 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.220
 shadow because the pilgrim way 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.060
 the nobility feel with the heat what 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.990
 he most wanted was a shadow of moazi 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.590
 for him to calm down for it to cool 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.530
 your body and god as well as cool 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.190
 soul with a calm soul was called 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.830
 a shadow often god was called 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:44.550
 a rock why because the rock 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:47.130
 firm she supports she supports all this 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.890
 symbolism some of them very funny 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:54.180
 for example god is called in psalms in the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:57.270
 literature of the horn sages because the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.630
 ox horn mainly the horn of the 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:04.050
 sheep was where he was strength as god 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.800
 is all powerful as god is strength to 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.530
 maximum strength it was compared to the horn 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.230
 to the horns of a ram 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.340
 all this symbolism 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:21.200
 all this intuitive imaginative way 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.690
 of describing and naha is in the language 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.080
 of biblical texts and represents a 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.040
 great challenge for the producer 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.910
 so when you read the bible 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.220
 think about it 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.430
 it is about a people of pastor of 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.489
 farmer who lived in the desert in 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.299
 therefore be very careful to 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:48.450
 do not interpret literally so you do not 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:52.170
 carry symbols and pictures to the letter 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.049
 that were made to impress the 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.700
 our idea is our imagination as 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.700
 also our feeling
