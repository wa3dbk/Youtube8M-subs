00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.570
 as we are preparing for that day 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.920
 birth something we can not do without beautiful 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.110
 your age 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.750
 the base can be made of cardboard or 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.150
 drawing paper I will do the number and you can 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.780
 make the first letter of your name or 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.180
 the entire name can be any number 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.519
 the size of it all depends on where you go 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.100
 will put after the numbers will be 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.199
 drawn and cut remove all traces 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.379
 pencil on your beautiful cardboard 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.239
 Now we are our cardboard prefabricated 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.970
 decorate with da Vinci 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.850
 I chose a pink cardboard not by chance 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.800
 my numbers and I thought about 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.379
 pink and purple palette 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.899
 apply better this morning across the numbers they 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.020
 along the shorter the line the easier it is to make 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.180
 her smooth and neat I put pink 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.050
 yes vinci color so that there is room 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.869
 for purple sticking tips can 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.330
 smooth fingers but much more comfortable 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.400
 use a special spatula which 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.720
 goes in a set with it you can 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.720
 fix all your shortcomings 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.780
 It was 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.229
 fill the gaps between pink 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.229
 purple lines da vinci 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.710
 at 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.240
 numbers can be hung on the wall 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.270
 insert in the holiday cake 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.070
 I have special long sticks 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.810
 to decorate the cake but you can 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.330
 use and simple tubules 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.030
 glue the tubes into numbers with 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.530
 paper tape the more speed those 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.530
 the construction will be stronger 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.880
 house 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.620
 ready numbers do not mix them up 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.910
 together with mom setting on your 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.460
 birthday cake 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.510
 putting the cake with our numbers on the most 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.510
 prominent in the room
