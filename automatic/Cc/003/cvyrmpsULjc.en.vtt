00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
looking block at the top so maybe they

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.429 
looking block at the top so maybe they

originally<00:01:52.979> thought<00:01:53.310> maybe<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.939> would<00:01:54.090> be

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
originally thought maybe this would be

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.179 
originally thought maybe this would be
some<00:01:54.450> sort<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.750> end<00:01:55.020> village<00:01:55.530> complete<00:01:56.070> with

some sort of end village complete with
creatures<00:01:56.579> living<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.000> those<00:01:57.119> tree<00:01:57.420> houses

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
creatures living in those tree houses

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.440 
creatures living in those tree houses
but<00:01:58.350> remember<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.549> supposed<00:01:59.729> to<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.149> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
but remember this is supposed to be a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.410 
but remember this is supposed to be a
new<00:02:00.750> type<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.110> hostile<00:02:01.950> dungeon<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:03.180> might

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
new type of hostile dungeon you might

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.090 
new type of hostile dungeon you might
also<00:02:03.630> have<00:02:03.930> noticed<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.590> obsidian

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
also have noticed that the obsidian

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.889 
also have noticed that the obsidian
pillars<00:02:05.460> from<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.909> Enderdragon<00:02:06.479> fight<00:02:06.689> are

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
pillars from the Enderdragon fight are

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.990 
pillars from the Enderdragon fight are
missing<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:08.399> leads<00:02:08.610> me<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.970> believe

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
missing and this leads me to believe

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.110 
missing and this leads me to believe
that<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.539> end<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.319> have<00:02:10.470> more

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
that the end is going to have more

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.420 
that the end is going to have more
Islands<00:02:11.510> then<00:02:11.989> we're<00:02:12.230> used<00:02:12.409> to<00:02:12.560> in<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.890> update

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
Islands then we're used to in the update

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.430 
Islands then we're used to in the update
to<00:02:13.849> make<00:02:14.000> room<00:02:14.209> for<00:02:14.269> these<00:02:14.599> new<00:02:14.840> structures

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
to make room for these new structures

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.949 
to make room for these new structures
and<00:02:15.739> remember<00:02:16.549> developer<00:02:17.360> dinner<00:02:17.720> bone

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
and remember developer dinner bone

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.289 
and remember developer dinner bone
already<00:02:18.470> revamped<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.310> dragon<00:02:19.819> fight<00:02:20.090> to

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
already revamped the dragon fight to

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.729 
already revamped the dragon fight to
make<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.599> tougher<00:02:20.989> like<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.379> console

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
make it tougher like the console

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.070 
make it tougher like the console
versions<00:02:22.159> so<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:22.760> doubt<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.390> obsidian<00:02:23.780> pillars

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
versions so I doubt the obsidian pillars

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.289 
versions so I doubt the obsidian pillars
are<00:02:24.319> actually<00:02:24.769> gone<00:02:24.950> for<00:02:25.190> good<00:02:25.340> unless<00:02:25.819> the

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
are actually gone for good unless the

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.089 
are actually gone for good unless the
dragon<00:02:26.659> fight<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:26.959> somehow<00:02:27.260> completely

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
dragon fight is somehow completely

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.030 
dragon fight is somehow completely
reworked<00:02:28.670> we<00:02:29.209> know<00:02:29.390> dinner<00:02:29.659> bone<00:02:29.959> has<00:02:30.590> not

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
reworked we know dinner bone has not

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.100 
reworked we know dinner bone has not
revealed<00:02:31.519> what<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.150> new<00:02:32.299> enter<00:02:32.690> might<00:02:32.870> mobs

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
revealed what the new enter might mobs

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.350 
revealed what the new enter might mobs
from<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.650> last<00:02:33.890> update<00:02:34.400> are<00:02:34.700> going<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.030> do<00:02:35.180> but

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
from the last update are going to do but

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.059 
from the last update are going to do but
they<00:02:35.510> are<00:02:35.659> going<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.900> do<00:02:35.959> something<00:02:36.200> with<00:02:36.829> the

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
they are going to do something with the

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.039 
they are going to do something with the
Ender<00:02:37.370> Dragon<00:02:37.400> egg<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.329> maybe<00:02:38.599> that<00:02:38.959> will

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
Ender Dragon egg so maybe that will

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.410 
Ender Dragon egg so maybe that will
finally<00:02:39.349> come<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.860> fruition<00:02:40.099> in<00:02:40.579> the<00:02:41.090> combat
