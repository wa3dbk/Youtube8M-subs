00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.030 
ps3 version well look here there's the
shadow<00:01:42.659> something<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.649> doesn't<00:01:43.950> really

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
shadow something that doesn't really

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.850 
shadow something that doesn't really
make<00:01:44.220> sense<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.700> me<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.390> jak<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.470> daxter

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
make sense to me is that jak and daxter

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.980 
make sense to me is that jak and daxter
collection<00:01:46.890> made<00:01:47.610> by<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.790> same<00:01:47.880> people<00:01:48.119> it

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
collection made by the same people it

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.719 
collection made by the same people it
had<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> shadow<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.860> video<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.520> don't

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
had a shadow on the video so I don't

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.039 
had a shadow on the video so I don't
know<00:01:50.820> what<00:01:50.909> they're<00:01:51.030> doing<00:01:51.299> here<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.659> just

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
know what they're doing here and just

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.660 
know what they're doing here and just
for<00:01:52.259> some<00:01:52.439> more<00:01:52.649> proof<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.100> slide<00:01:53.399> collection

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
for some more proof the slide collection

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.359 
for some more proof the slide collection
made<00:01:54.180> by<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.390> people's<00:01:54.750> hands<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.140> sanzu<00:01:55.619> who

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
made by the people's hands the sanzu who

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.819 
made by the people's hands the sanzu who
made<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.939> psychopath<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.840> time<00:01:58.259> they<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.799> a

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
made the psychopath in time they have a

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.280 
made the psychopath in time they have a
shadow<00:01:59.159> right<00:01:59.820> there<00:01:59.850> uz<00:02:00.659> they<00:02:00.840> got<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> shadow

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
shadow right there uz they got a shadow

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.319 
shadow right there uz they got a shadow
and<00:02:01.530> my<00:02:01.740> friend<00:02:02.100> who<00:02:02.250> actually<00:02:02.460> purchased<00:02:03.180> a

and my friend who actually purchased a

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.899 
and my friend who actually purchased a
sly<00:02:03.540> collection<00:02:03.780> says<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.310> really

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
sly collection says that it's really

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.389 
sly collection says that it's really
good<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.570> well<00:02:06.869> made<00:02:07.170> despite<00:02:07.979> having<00:02:08.190> to

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
good it's well made despite having to

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.520 
good it's well made despite having to
download<00:02:08.550> digital<00:02:09.300> download<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.899> third<00:02:10.140> sly

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
download digital download the third sly

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.030 
download digital download the third sly
it's<00:02:10.860> still<00:02:11.310> very

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
it's still very

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.429 
it's still very
a very<00:02:12.700> well<00:02:12.939> made<00:02:12.969> port<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.750> what<00:02:14.260> exactly

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439 
a very well made port so what exactly

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.429 
a very well made port so what exactly
does<00:02:15.159> this<00:02:15.459> mean<00:02:15.939> the<00:02:16.329> fact<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:16.959> they<00:02:17.140> took

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
does this mean the fact that they took

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.039 
does this mean the fact that they took
out<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.980> shadow<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.730> another<00:02:19.450> port<00:02:19.870> they're

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
out the shadow and another port they're

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.140 
out the shadow and another port they're
doing<00:02:20.379> after<00:02:21.069> that<00:02:21.099> other<00:02:21.400> port<00:02:21.760> with<00:02:22.000> the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
doing after that other port with the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.660 
doing after that other port with the
shadow<00:02:22.420> was<00:02:22.689> poorly<00:02:22.989> made<00:02:23.319> hmm<00:02:23.890> let's<00:02:24.579> think

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
shadow was poorly made hmm let's think

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.050 
shadow was poorly made hmm let's think
about<00:02:24.879> that<00:02:25.030> stumped<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.230> hope<00:02:26.890> not<00:02:27.129> this<00:02:27.579> means

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
about that stumped I hope not this means

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.240 
about that stumped I hope not this means
they're<00:02:28.780> struggling<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:29.530> much<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.920> make<00:02:30.099> the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
they're struggling so much to make the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.149 
they're struggling so much to make the
port<00:02:30.519> again<00:02:30.849> so<00:02:31.750> they're<00:02:32.170> like<00:02:32.319> oh<00:02:32.530> let's<00:02:32.950> take

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
port again so they're like oh let's take

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.830 
port again so they're like oh let's take
out<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.340> shaft<00:02:33.700> in<00:02:33.819> this<00:02:33.939> next<00:02:34.209> part<00:02:34.480> won't<00:02:34.659> be

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
out the shaft in this next part won't be

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.050 
out the shaft in this next part won't be
as<00:02:35.049> bad<00:02:35.079> and<00:02:35.650> we<00:02:35.739> won't<00:02:35.799> get<00:02:35.980> so<00:02:36.189> much<00:02:36.370> hate<00:02:36.400> so

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
as bad and we won't get so much hate so

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.399 
as bad and we won't get so much hate so
now<00:02:37.299> the<00:02:37.470> sacrificing<00:02:38.470> game<00:02:39.269> graphics<00:02:40.269> game<00:02:40.989> I

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
now the sacrificing game graphics game I

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.199 
now the sacrificing game graphics game I
don't<00:02:41.650> know<00:02:41.739> how<00:02:42.129> to<00:02:42.219> put<00:02:42.489> it<00:02:42.519> like<00:02:42.879> shadow

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
don't know how to put it like shadow

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.879 
don't know how to put it like shadow
stuff<00:02:43.569> I'm<00:02:43.870> sure<00:02:44.109> they<00:02:44.290> dumb<00:02:44.560> down<00:02:44.709> the

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
stuff I'm sure they dumb down the

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.160 
stuff I'm sure they dumb down the
graphics<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.430> lot<00:02:45.609> too<00:02:45.909> just<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:46.930> they<00:02:47.109> could

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
graphics a lot too just so they could

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.830 
graphics a lot too just so they could
fit<00:02:47.500> this<00:02:47.709> crap<00:02:48.099> and<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:48.909> it<00:02:48.970> doesn't<00:02:49.299> play<00:02:49.599> bad

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
fit this crap and so it doesn't play bad

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.839 
fit this crap and so it doesn't play bad
like<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:50.709> jak<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.099> daxter<00:02:51.310> collection<00:02:51.340> did

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
like a jak and daxter collection did

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.659 
like a jak and daxter collection did

doing that the fact that I don't have a

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.470 
doing that the fact that I don't have a
shadow<00:03:02.950> that's<00:03:03.159> already<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.549> sign<00:03:03.819> that<00:03:03.849> there

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
shadow that's already a sign that there

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.179 
shadow that's already a sign that there
can't<00:03:04.930> get<00:03:05.169> it<00:03:05.260> all<00:03:05.409> in<00:03:05.590> there<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.950> they<00:03:06.010> want
