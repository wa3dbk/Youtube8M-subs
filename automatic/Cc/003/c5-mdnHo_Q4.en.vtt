$20<00:03:14.320> but<00:03:14.620> it's<00:03:15.489> worth<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:16.060> because<00:03:16.239> it's<00:03:16.690> not

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
$20 but it's worth it because it's not

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.180 
$20 but it's worth it because it's not

like every other lip liner I've ever

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.710 
like every other lip liner I've ever
used<00:03:18.580> where<00:03:18.820> I<00:03:18.850> have<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.150> sharpen<00:03:19.480> it

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
used where I have to sharpen it

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.580 
used where I have to sharpen it
literally<00:03:20.260> every<00:03:20.709> time<00:03:20.950> these<00:03:21.580> are<00:03:21.730> so

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.620 
use it and I don't have to sharpen every
time<00:03:27.700> because<00:03:27.940> that's<00:03:28.060> what<00:03:28.239> makes<00:03:28.450> lip

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
time because that's what makes lip

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.539
