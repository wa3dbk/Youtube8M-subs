 10 things you did not know about sugar 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.000
 Sugar is addictive about 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.410
 researchers in 2007 discovered with 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.050
 the rats projected to cocaine 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.090
 they preferred as a reward before this 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.650
 the sugar the sugar is in almost all 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.780
 food even in those with 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.770
 imaginary as are the salty the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.289
 chicken that you are going to buy at 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.550
 supermarket or a can of tomato this 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.529
 it's because the food industry 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.470
 It interests us to be addicted to their 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.539
 products because sugar feeds 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.519
 cancer a study conducted in 2013 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.869
 at the university of copenhagen 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.570
 discovered that sugar helps the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.700
 growth of malignant cells the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.380
 Sugar not only causes obesity but also 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.719
 It also affects all our organs 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.090
 it spoils our teeth our skin and 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.829
 our sugar ages before our brain 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.930
 does not contain any nutritional value is 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.390
 purely energetic but not everything is 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.280
 bad eating sweet makes our body 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.260
 create endorphins that makes us 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.629
 we feel happier the first news 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.280
 written that we have about the existence 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.559
 of the sugar was thanks to an admiral 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.160
 'alejandro magnno' upon arriving in india 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.010
 but it was not introduced in europe until 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.960
 of many years since first it 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.150
 used honey to sweeten all 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.620
 the food the sugar is necessary 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.270
 so that our body has enough 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.640
 energy to work our brain 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.580
 above all you need a lot of energy not 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.310
 talk about the current sugar the white 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.860
 but I 'm talking about the sugar that comes 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.380
 of the natural things glucose by 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.479
 example of the fruits the sugar comes 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.700
 of the sugarcane the natural one is 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.670
 brown color and the white color that is 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.009
 which we all know is refined by 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.570
 an industrial process this is the one 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.970
 has all the properties above all 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.920
 negative that I said before a family 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.890
 and for the one-year sugar-free challenge 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.890
 well, he tried to make every month just 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.360
 they could eat a sweet this family every 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.520
 day then every week 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.860
 I wanted that candy that day would come 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.470
 but after months of each 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.159
 they wanted it less and even breastfeeding 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.950
 he felt much better 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.409
 when the dessert day arrives when eating it 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.390
 they were wrong very bad then 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.490
 they decided to leave it totally because 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.209
 they just needed the natural sugar that 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.470
 comes from fruits and other foods 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.209
 good and these are the 10 things that are not 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.110
 you knew about sugar so see you 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.110
