the first crazy quicks we saw a
phenomenal<00:01:23.549> traction<00:01:24.000> since<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:24.990> been

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
phenomenal traction since then it's been

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.899 
phenomenal traction since then it's been
pretty<00:01:25.380> alright<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.979> wish<00:01:26.430> there<00:01:26.610> dooper

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
pretty alright I wish there dooper

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.609 
pretty alright I wish there dooper
grooves<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.360> outsole<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.229> there<00:01:28.500> was

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
grooves on the outsole so that there was

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.530 
grooves on the outsole so that there was
more<00:01:28.799> durability<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.450> when

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
more durability for it but and when

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.999 
more durability for it but and when
terms<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.930> playing<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.530> think<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.950> is

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
terms of playing I do think it is

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.050 
terms of playing I do think it is
something<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.369> would<00:01:32.430> get<00:01:32.579> worse<00:01:32.729> over<00:01:33.030> time

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
something that would get worse over time

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.030 
something that would get worse over time
but<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.780> good<00:01:33.930> out<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> box<00:01:34.350> when<00:01:34.740> comparing

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
but it's good out the box when comparing

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.560 
but it's good out the box when comparing
to<00:01:35.159> last<00:01:35.189> year's<00:01:35.549> crazy<00:01:35.759> lie<00:01:35.970> boost<00:01:36.210> model

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570

lockdown<00:01:36.990> was<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> bit<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.500> disappointment

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
lockdown was a bit of a disappointment

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
lockdown was a bit of a disappointment
now<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.759> year<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.060> see<00:01:39.210> prominent<00:01:39.720> which

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
now this year we see prominent which

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.630 
now this year we see prominent which
aesthetically<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.530> beautiful<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.220> looks

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
aesthetically is beautiful and looks

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.580 
aesthetically is beautiful and looks
very<00:01:41.850> nice<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> court<00:01:42.540> last<00:01:43.079> year<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.409> saw

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
very nice on the court last year we saw

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.800 
very nice on the court last year we saw
more<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.009> Sprintweb<00:01:44.369> mesh<00:01:44.850> upper<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.659> was

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
more of a Sprintweb mesh upper that was

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.330 
more of a Sprintweb mesh upper that was
definitely<00:01:46.200> softer<00:01:46.409> than<00:01:46.680> previous<00:01:47.070> crazy

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
definitely softer than previous crazy

definitely softer than previous crazy
lights<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:48.060> did<00:01:48.180> not<00:01:48.299> breathe<00:01:48.570> well<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.290> plus

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
lights but did not breathe well the plus

the<00:01:51.930> downside<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.470> there's<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.799> lot<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.130> room<00:01:53.280> in

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
the downside is there's a lot of room in

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.010 
the downside is there's a lot of room in
the<00:01:53.460> toe<00:01:53.610> box<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.090> does<00:01:54.240> not<00:01:54.420> lock<00:01:54.659> down<00:01:54.899> her

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020

the toe box and does not lock down her
stay<00:01:55.229> quite<00:01:55.530> as<00:01:55.619> tight<00:01:55.829> as<00:01:56.009> previous<00:01:56.399> years

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
stay quite as tight as previous years

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.399 
stay quite as tight as previous years
and<00:01:57.000> running<00:01:57.180> we've<00:01:57.450> seen<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.689> adizero<00:01:58.020> prime

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
and running we've seen the adizero prime

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.830 
and running we've seen the adizero prime
boost<00:01:58.649> debut<00:01:59.280> prominent<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.060> boost<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840

running<00:02:01.170> shoe<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.770> was<00:02:01.829> kind<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> same

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
running shoe it was kind of the same

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.399 
running shoe it was kind of the same
thing<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.969> looked<00:02:03.210> nice<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.719> felt<00:02:03.899> good<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.290> it

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
thing it looked nice it felt good but it

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.050 
thing it looked nice it felt good but it
did<00:02:04.530> not<00:02:04.619> snug<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.130> tight<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.490> not<00:02:05.549> perform<00:02:05.939> as

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
did not snug as tight and not perform as

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.999 
did not snug as tight and not perform as
well<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.450> later<00:02:06.899> iterations<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.649> running<00:02:07.890> we

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
well in later iterations and running we

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.619 
well in later iterations and running we
see<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> ultra<00:02:08.580> boost<00:02:08.789> which<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.179> doing<00:02:09.450> very

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
see the ultra boost which is doing very

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.860 
see the ultra boost which is doing very
well<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:10.259> snug<00:02:10.619> lockdown<00:02:11.069> fit<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
well for snug lockdown fit and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.420 
well for snug lockdown fit and
the<00:02:11.930> length<00:02:12.140> boosts<00:02:12.379> cushioning<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.010> think

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
the length boosts cushioning I think

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.740 
the length boosts cushioning I think
we're<00:02:13.549> eventually<00:02:13.909> gonna<00:02:14.000> see<00:02:14.239> this<00:02:14.420> take<00:02:14.599> the

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
we're eventually gonna see this take the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.270 
we're eventually gonna see this take the
basketball<00:02:15.200> but<00:02:15.650> right<00:02:15.830> now<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.040> looks<00:02:16.099> like

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
basketball but right now it looks like

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.130 
basketball but right now it looks like

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
and cosmetically they do scuff a little

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.180 
and cosmetically they do scuff a little
easier<00:03:00.530> than<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.739> thought

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
easier than I thought
