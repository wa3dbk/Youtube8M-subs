for the club called you rather be
playing<00:00:13.750> straight<00:00:14.199> away<00:00:14.670> nothing<00:00:15.670> is<00:00:15.760> ever<00:00:15.910> a

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
playing straight away nothing is ever a

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.150 
playing straight away nothing is ever a
good<00:00:16.240> time<00:00:16.299> to<00:00:16.720> consider<00:00:17.199> go<00:00:17.410> so<00:00:17.650> late<00:00:17.800> but<00:00:18.100> I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
good time to consider go so late but I

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.029 
good time to consider go so late but I
think<00:00:19.119> it's<00:00:19.300> always<00:00:19.510> important<00:00:20.170> to<00:00:20.199> go<00:00:20.410> into

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.039 
think it's always important to go into

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.710 
think it's always important to go into
an<00:00:21.220> international<00:00:21.460> break<00:00:21.970> on<00:00:22.210> the<00:00:22.390> back<00:00:22.539> of<00:00:22.570> a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
an international break on the back of a

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.359 
an international break on the back of a
win<00:00:22.900> because<00:00:23.259> it<00:00:23.349> gives<00:00:23.560> good<00:00:23.769> feeling<00:00:24.130> to<00:00:24.249> the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
win because it gives good feeling to the

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.130 
win because it gives good feeling to the
players<00:00:24.609> you<00:00:24.880> leave<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.269> camp<00:00:25.509> and<00:00:25.749> they<00:00:25.960> go

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
players you leave the camp and they go

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.159 
players you leave the camp and they go
with<00:00:26.320> to<00:00:26.470> the<00:00:26.560> relevant<00:00:27.070> countries<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:29.140> that

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
with to the relevant countries so that

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.000 
with to the relevant countries so that
was<00:00:29.409> disappointing<00:00:29.529> but<00:00:30.039> you<00:00:30.909> know<00:00:31.060> I<00:00:32.010> just

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
was disappointing but you know I just

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.840 
was disappointing but you know I just
feel<00:00:33.280> that<00:00:34.020> we're<00:00:35.020> in<00:00:35.140> a<00:00:35.290> strong<00:00:35.860> team<00:00:36.070> we<00:00:36.700> have

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
feel that we're in a strong team we have

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.420 
feel that we're in a strong team we have
an<00:00:37.000> outstanding<00:00:37.500> midfield<00:00:38.500> line<00:00:38.710> that<00:00:39.220> needs

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
an outstanding midfield line that needs

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.920 
an outstanding midfield line that needs
to<00:00:39.550> contribute<00:00:39.850> goals<00:00:40.240> everybody<00:00:40.720> keeps

talking about our lack of strikers but
we<00:00:42.520> need<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:42.820> get<00:00:43.120> more<00:00:43.270> goals<00:00:43.510> from<00:00:43.630> midfield

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
we need to get more goals from midfield

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.270 
we need to get more goals from midfield

since the summer wars you may give them

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.600 
since the summer wars you may give them
so<00:01:02.860> far<00:01:04.019> they<00:01:05.019> look<00:01:05.170> slightly<00:01:05.350> different<00:01:05.610> you

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
so far they look slightly different you

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.890

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
know the new manager is trying to put

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.770 
know the new manager is trying to put
his<00:01:07.990> own<00:01:08.140> sort<00:01:08.590> of<00:01:08.770> tilt<00:01:09.460> on<00:01:09.670> on<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.330> tactics

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
his own sort of tilt on on the tactics

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.700 
his own sort of tilt on on the tactics
and<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.380> way<00:01:11.500> they<00:01:11.680> play<00:01:13.320> their<00:01:14.320> forward<00:01:14.560> line

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
and the way they play their forward line

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.310 
and the way they play their forward line
has<00:01:14.860> changed<00:01:15.280> dramatically<00:01:16.140> they<00:01:17.140> have<00:01:17.230> good

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
has changed dramatically they have good

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.720 
has changed dramatically they have good
players<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:17.740> players<00:01:18.040> that<00:01:18.340> we<00:01:18.430> know<00:01:18.550> well

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
players and players that we know well

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.320 
players and players that we know well
perrelet<00:01:19.420> we<00:01:19.540> know<00:01:19.690> because<00:01:20.020> we<00:01:20.229> scouted

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
perrelet we know because we scouted

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.940 
perrelet we know because we scouted
llaman<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.659> I've<00:01:23.110> seen<00:01:23.290> partly<00:01:23.590> many<00:01:23.770> many

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
llaman and I've seen partly many many

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.330 
llaman and I've seen partly many many
times<00:01:24.220> he's<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.490> good<00:01:24.700> player<00:01:24.820> and<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:27.220> know

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
times he's a good player and you know

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.940 
times he's a good player and you know
for<00:01:27.909> us<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.360> think<00:01:29.020> it's<00:01:29.170> very<00:01:29.260> important<00:01:29.920> that

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
for us I think it's very important that

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.820 
for us I think it's very important that
we<00:01:30.400> control<00:01:31.000> part<00:01:31.479> of<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.630> game<00:01:31.810> when<00:01:32.710> they

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
we control part of the game when they

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.170 
we control part of the game when they
won<00:01:32.979> at<00:01:33.070> West<00:01:33.220> damn<00:01:33.430> i<00:01:33.460> think<00:01:33.850> they<00:01:33.970> had

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
won at West damn i think they had

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.149 
won at West damn i think they had
perhaps<00:01:34.450> too<00:01:35.110> much<00:01:35.140> control<00:01:35.500> and<00:01:35.979> that's

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
perhaps too much control and that's

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.670 
perhaps too much control and that's
something<00:01:36.370> we<00:01:36.580> want<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:36.820> take<00:01:36.970> away<00:01:37.210> from<00:01:37.390> them

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
something we want to take away from them

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.840 
something we want to take away from them
snidely<00:01:38.680> I<00:01:38.860> think<00:01:39.130> it's<00:01:39.220> important<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.670> them

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
snidely I think it's important to them

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.610 
snidely I think it's important to them
so<00:01:40.090> there<00:01:40.479> are<00:01:40.600> still<00:01:40.810> got<00:01:41.110> some<00:01:41.290> very<00:01:41.440> very

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
so there are still got some very very

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.469 
so there are still got some very very
good<00:01:41.830> players<00:01:42.040> because<00:01:42.729> of<00:01:42.850> all<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.060> changes

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
good players because of all the changes

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.789 
good players because of all the changes
from<00:01:43.630> your<00:01:43.810> point<00:01:43.990> of<00:01:44.140> view<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.500> make<00:01:44.650> them

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
from your point of view to make them

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.359 
from your point of view to make them
harder<00:01:45.190> to<00:01:45.340> assess<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.030> maybe<00:01:46.420> last<00:01:46.659> season

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
harder to assess and maybe last season

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.120 
harder to assess and maybe last season
um<00:01:48.369> yeah<00:01:48.790> I<00:01:48.970> think<00:01:49.090> it's<00:01:50.080> slight<00:01:50.560> unknown

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
um yeah I think it's slight unknown

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.830 
um yeah I think it's slight unknown
about<00:01:51.340> them<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.670> little<00:01:51.940> bit<00:01:52.180> they've<00:01:52.479> been<00:01:52.690> up

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
about them a little bit they've been up
