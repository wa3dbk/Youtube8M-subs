00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.380
 the prestige object for everyone 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.660
 Automobile manufacturer is a purebred 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.460
 sports car of the r8 is audis 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.460
 interpretation of this type of vehicle 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:34.350
 the ingredients provocative optics mid-engine 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:40.460
 four-wheel drive high speed v8 its 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.460
 a test of the dsf engine track test 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.870
 Of course, a sports car is one of them 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.760
 hack dynamics and therefore the first thing 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.079
 Do it by car if it is the name 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.879
 sports car really from the beginning 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.469
 because we try what he does 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.469
 hectic no esp out 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.850
 the volley proved courage and the r8 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.530
 a hack-heavy quattro drive 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.510
 including lock 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.670
 I think that's the first audi like 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.670
 you really can stop drive straight 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.880
 So sports car 's to-do list number 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.880
 one ticked off 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.570
 second category, of course 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.340
 sports car of need a constantly relapsing 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.010
 on the chain from after second gear and 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.440
 a maritime brush press down 4.2 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.440
 liter v8 machine forward 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.510
 1004 within five to six hectares of the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.510
 seat press 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.660
 and that always stops me 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.880
 feeling that keeps pushing like it 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.030
 then the switching point has come 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.140
 and that only starts at 8250 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.140
 turns noticeable 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:13.070
 Third, important for the sports car 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:13.070
 Of course the brakes are neat 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.830
 which is very good fit with the brake on 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.069
 feedback 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.379
 I can dose wonderfully great 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:28.060
 pressure point feels exactly like it car 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:29.860
 reacts that it solved well then count 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.769
 the three chapters together 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.920
 and out comes Audi has a sports car 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.920
 built 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.640
 and as of this, the r8 will too 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.319
 perceived when the car is almost there 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.689
 a year in germany if she does 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.799
 but still very few the letters 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.079
 the all towards the cars 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.879
 But that's the advantage right now 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.560
 car has a passing prestige on the 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.599
 Highway on arrival 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.700
 Everyone has made room because that sees 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.950
 just want to see and that's what it's like 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.750
 that currently makes power right now 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.290
 Giant joy with the audi r8 on the 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.290
 highway to drive 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.360
 The R8 seems to have all the prerequisites too 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.080
 have top of the list 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.150
 to place and that is less important 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.000
 the optics than at its inner 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.010
 with a top speed of 301 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.599
 km / h is the r8 member of an elite 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.150
 clubs of vehicles 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:32.540
 thanks to allrad are the 100 km h in unter 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.640
 achieved five seconds 420 hp 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.819
 the v8 's maximum torque is at 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.549
 430 Newton meters capacity 42 meters 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:44.950
 weight 1560 kilograms 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.950
 its basic price is 107,000 euros 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.030
 now it will be serious against the race 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.910
 on the course of the luk driving center 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.030
 is on 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.030
 Vienna 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.070
 the topspeed measurement on the 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.570
 straight is giving a first 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.470
 information about how the audi 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.470
 Is on the way 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.010
 189 4 8 km h fast 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:07.550
 the goal is a 10 848 on the clock 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:09.949
 that's enough for third place in the dsf 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.509
 best of the list 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.899
 ingolstädter just has to be porsche 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:17.169
 gt3 rs and the ktm crossbow hit 

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:17.169
 give 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.490
 I'm always with my audi for 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.320
 dentist the tracks of audio tracks 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.090
 and always offered me a nice kauleiste 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.920
 that hurts and that's why it's always like this 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.660
 a bit to the sympathy in front 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.200
 no sympathies 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.200
 so so 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.530
 but then you can do it 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.070
 I 'm the first time in the 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.390
 drove eight and really a yes so 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.930
 with the car you can do it right 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.930
 burn 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.830
 Hall says it's usually rather good 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.450
 5 finds a sports car 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.770
 maybe not necessarily the optimum 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.690
 because he is always this 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.670
 understeer problem-forth very strong 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.190
 but that one simply lifts you up 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.050
 distribution so sensationally solved that 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.150
 At least if you are in sports mode 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.840
 actually drives almost no 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.840
 understeer 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.639
 when I spend a hundred thousand euros 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.199
 would have been for sports cars so far 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.320
 actually only the name porsche for 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:25.150
 meanwhile , he came to me 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.110
 and that's probably the biggest praise you can get 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.240
 audi can do 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.650
 the r8 may not be a porsche 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.320
 killer but a serious one 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.570
 alternative optically as well as technically 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.840
 the only downer is his price 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:40.630
 our test car brings it to 135,000 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.190
 euro with just under 2,000 registrations in 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.509
 germany remains this ingolstädter 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.509
 an exotic
