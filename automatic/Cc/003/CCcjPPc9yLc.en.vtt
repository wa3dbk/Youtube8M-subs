00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.930
 Hi everyone, how are you, my best? 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.110
 I came to record a tag the tag that the 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.300
 enderson sanchez tagged me with people is a 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.910
 super nice person special to

 me he has a channel here on youtube he 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.520
 lives there in New York so the name of the tag 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.240
 It's the life of a foreigner, right. 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.790
 tell 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.490
 Let's talk a little bit, we 're 20. 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.440
 questions and I'll tell you a little bit 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.370
 of my experience here in the states 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.890
 United 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.570
 good the first question age country that 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.810
 You live, and I'm 36 years old. 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.580
 My goodness, how old I am, 36 years old. 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.220
 and do you live in the united states? 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.690
 I'm living here for 13 years my 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.600
 adaptation phase here in the states 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.960
 together it was very complicated in the beginning I 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.690
 I really missed my family, I 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.030
 I felt that my God I have everything and in 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.240
 end I have nothing because I do not 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.700
 I had a full house with my relatives. 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.790
 It's what scared me the most in the culture. 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.790
 American 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.780
 I do not know, I really like culture. 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.460
 American 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.770
 I like people to be more 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.079
 cautious I think they are more 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.450
 discreet I like very much then what I 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.369
 More in American culture 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.710
 I like everything I like everything I 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.960
 As I said earlier I like that 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.899
 they are more cautious I think 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.240
 they are more discreet people I 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.479
 I like them not to be so invasive. 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.850
 do not ask I would not call the 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.149
 American a cold person I call it is 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.490
 an extremely cautious person with 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.170
 common sense what I least enjoy in 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.689
 American culture 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.819
 we do not have nothing has nothing 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.549
 Nothing here I remembered now that I did not 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.499
 liked it is a tourist spot here in 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.590
 my city I live in north chicago 

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:05.600

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.630
 It has some huge sculpture or as is 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.600
 be a shape of a whole bean 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.270
 mirrored and people whenever and 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.140
 if accepted and in my city of 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.970
 Chicago 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.549
 there in the center of town they sure 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.750
 go there at this tourist point brings some 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.480
 difficulty starting 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.870
 the difficulty is greater it was clear that the 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.960
 language is still and with 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.900
 sure the distance that is mine 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.810
 family and one is an achievement 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.430
 here is for me to tell a conquest of 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.530
 dear, I believe that here we 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.420
 United States was certainly my 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.360
 american citizenship 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.240
 what many people are afraid to do there 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.200
 proof I was also suddenly afraid of my 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.690
 My husband, what do I know? 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.480

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.480
 test in three months is my god 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.790
 How is it that in three months I'm going to learn 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.239
 the history of the United States because 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.489
 in this test besides talking to you 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.100
 less the basics of English you have to 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:18.320
 know the history of the United States that 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.330
 is this president state as a flag to 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.700
 wartime in his that at the time of 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.590
 Trojan work war of very much 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.989
 thing and I had three months to learn 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.010
 all thanks to God who gave 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:34.549
 right and a shop for baby indicated 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.680

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.890

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.049

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.360
 Palettes on So Find Makeup 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.340
 is also to indicate three products for 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.370
 buy here in the united states 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:00.680
 It's certainly cosmetic and that's what 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.670
 lip balm is that it is the very lip balm 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.760
 cool 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.430
 we also have that hair cream 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.620
 which gives the se that you leave there three 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.870
 in the hair and makes a 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.690
 wonderful hydration amazing with 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.709
 it costs less than $ 3 down there 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.799
 marketing 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:22.850
 we also have electronic nÃ© 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:26.180
 a nice and nice bbg restaurant 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.210
 people I have an american food and lobster 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.509
 red 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.520
 is going right this is a food for you 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:36.900
 try here in the united states 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.810
 surely I will pay for it 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.870
 that the Brazilian should not do here is 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.240
 for example is our Brazilian culture 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.889
 is very different from our own culture 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.490
 American is right 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:53.160
 So, for example, you arrive and I live in 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.789
 a condominium in a gated community 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.550
 Then suddenly I open the suitcase. 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.729
 my car open my car door and 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.680
 I called the sound in the heights people with 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:08.370
 sure you should not do it because 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.650
 you'll find it strange and it's 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.020
 some of them call the police. 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.690
 for you to lower that volume if you have 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.930
 in a way that bothers a fashion 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.810
 Strange, I'll also say that it's the 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.840
 same as me enderson sanchez said is 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.690
 that the American mainly the afro 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.780
 He has that way of him. 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.180
 his jeans are so down there 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.479
 they are down there and sometimes it's in the 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.419
 half or below the butt and gets very 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:42.659
 ugly and it stays out I do not know if it's 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:45.870
 Such a time is short from below 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:48.599
 Or is it just the underwear but I already know that 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.820
 It's a law to leave or it's already gone. 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:52.860
 really can not anymore because this is 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.710
 very ugly this is very strange very 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.990
 I'm embarrassed what I need 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.820
 I miss there from Brazil to 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.740
 sure is to eat people 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.440
 the family is unclear, but not after 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:08.400
 I love to pay and I love these things. 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:11.310
 have to dough 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.560
 I love you so much, you have no home trying 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.719
 so give and say anything worth 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.699
 Worth seeing here in the states 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:19.860
 united many things are worth coming

 buy women's and women's handbag 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.930
 certainly very worthwhile is to have the 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.330
 brand bag is not a fever in Brazil 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.180
 a fever here too and the price with 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.860

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.760
 A Brazilian kiss for who I have
