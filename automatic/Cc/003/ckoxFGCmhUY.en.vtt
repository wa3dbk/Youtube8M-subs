00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.620
 how do you deal with this relationship when 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.750
 he was married 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.940
 and it was very hard because in this kind of 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.940
 matters everyone is right 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.039
 his ex-wife as that is a great woman 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.349
 and it's a great lady what 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.839
 because simply the couples sometimes the 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.239
 people sometimes get married and something happens in 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:29.840
 the way that something breaks and you 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.920
 they begin to distance and 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.920
 and so 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.870
 let's say that 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.230
 you will never hear Roberto talk to talk 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.769
 evil of her, much less her children are 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.989
 extraordinary then 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:47.899
 I believe that many people know them as 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.579
 taken the criticism loving I felt 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.649
 very bad because I did not understand the 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.780
 society I said while the Lord lives 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.519
 in his house and he puts the horns all the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.190
 time to his wife everywhere here and 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.710
 out of here every time I was not going to 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.730
 the tours 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:07.360
 what a brute then I 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.430
 in the hall of the dressing rooms I give the 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.500
 back with the other giving a kiss with 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.100
 someone and I was still courting all 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.950
 ways then this one I say that you 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.450
 it seems good to society, that is, 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.350
 Follow her husband and her children not 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.940
 it matters that he does not live in holiness because 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.310
 holiness is not going to mass all the 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.690
 Sundays but really live in family 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:35.710
 and be part of your family really of 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.110
 the family be one with your partner and not 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.030
 Now that he is one with me and now that 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.259
 he is not unfaithful because I could put him 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.210
 hands on fire so we 're not going 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.920
 he told me that when a glass is 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.450
 full you do not need anything else if you 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.560
 I think 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.820
 and now that he lives a quiet life 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.179
 stable turns out that that's what it is 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.159
 bad but if we add much we left 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.560
 give interviews we hide from the 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.100
 means we 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.869
 We did not attend shows although 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.550
 there would be awards and things like that 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:15.910
 Well we were like five years living 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:19.000
 so a little like high line to hidden 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.860
 but without hiding because all the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.250
 come days we go together to work in 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.330
 everyone knew that we lived together and 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.670
 suffering because each one by hand the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.300
 the change and the transition for the two 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.020
 it was a big change I knew that 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.700
 logically it was 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.680
 repudiated by many people and maybe 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.380
 even hated at any given time by their 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.280
 children I do not think I do now they hate me 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.750
 On the contrary I think they are so good 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.150
 people that I do not think are capable of 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.580
 hate nobody the roberto when I get to 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.060
 my life and I was vasectomy 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.770
 but he does not what he says is true when 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.710
 a glass is full, you do not need anything 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.380
 more I would have loved to have a son 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.590
 but he fills my life in such a way 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.680
 what 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.640
 that is everything is also my son is 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.550
 all 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.990
 but then if I had to take that 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.150
 decision and I put it in the balance and no longer 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.850
 I was so young I was 28 years old 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.670
 that the decision was already coldly 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.180
 calculated they were not the vapor or 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.530
 is what I know is , every woman 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.690
 We want to have that 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.580
 experience not having children in fact 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.440
 I keep melting for the children and for 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.440
 his grandchildren and I love his grandchildren
