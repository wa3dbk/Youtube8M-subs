00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.950
 Hello everyone 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.360

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.920
 video to crack cinema 4d art 14 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.320
 so if you remember I put you 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.509
 of judges had published something about 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.050
 the chain telling you to create a 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:32.529
 count on ccg worse but I believe it 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:34.690
 not walk I believe on this on this site 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.539
 ccg worse times it works times they 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.770
 walk goes blind from time to time 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.809
 good bah it goes by people changed so 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.059
 I will not show you it's not serious 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.300
 so I told you how it was 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:50.379
 it works and that every 72 hours 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.449
 of each month to actually register 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.030
 so in fact I wanted to do this 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.199
 video before but I had the wind and 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.879
 I have not really had the time to 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.620
 do and with all the studies and where I have 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.550
 not really had time so I 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.769
 you fate her today 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.449
 so as we are bartering and that's 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.620
 soon the end of the month or if you do not 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.500
 not created the account this will be the opportunity 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.729
 for you to create an account 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.479
 so I will put the link for you 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.860
 create an account 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.869
 but I for cinema 4d r14 the dmg who is going 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.250
 point me to install it I will not put 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.000
 read in the description except the lia 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.470
 of the bull on the site 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.049
 otherwise I will put the cake end as 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.030
 if you already have a cinema image 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.180
 4d art 14 you can have which guen 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.430
 to create you to create your keys 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.040
 activation 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.500
 so we'll start first we go 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.020
 to install cinema kader 14 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.439
 So here I am, this is under this 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.740
 form 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.060
 so I tried the r14 that gm does not 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.799
 not work for windows there is the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.360
 autorun for windows media not the 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.440
 exe file 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.790
 so I do not know how 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.980
 we installed it so surely 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.760
 other apps finally I try to 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.500
 find for windows as soon as I can 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:09.430
 so we'll start the set up all of 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.990
 then France and this way then 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.240
 here he saw that the site does 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.660
 not work ibug so let's do 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.240
 continue so you see that I have 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.890
 already a license I do not know how the 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.000
 take off so we're going to throw the guen 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.880
 yeah that's all that you just have 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.370
 an application to the louvre and so the 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.650
 country games is not at all what 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.120
 that to see I do not know so you can 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.920
 do not believe that it changes 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.560
 great thing what will happen to us 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.430
 interest this generalist cereal 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.460
 so there we see that it is flat of 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.910
 cereals the problem is that it basically 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.500
 screen 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.450
 finally the bottom of the color and the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.250
 color of the selection so it's very 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.760
 very difficult to pinpoint when we 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.550
 selected 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.320
 so we want the studio so we go 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.850
 select studio which you see his 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.489
 seleccion nothing but it's not my faith 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.250
 it's like that to do right click 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.290
 you see who scored look up which 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.040
 the only fit and that we cut so done 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.230
 just copy you do past so I 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.480
 put my name I put spaces for not 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.800
 to return the glÃ©nan and home was prof or 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.250
 that you want you do not want it 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.950
 not serious 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.440
 do continue type of installation 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.940
 but also maquettes dr 14 cm can and 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.350
 just so here is optional this sealed the 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.560
 thing we do not care you check well 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.570
 especially the application makes him install 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.470
 you accept once again that we do 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.600
 with that the stages 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:44.690
 and so here is this 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:47.069
 so go the password d so here is 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.629
 So 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.280
 I'm going to take a break on the video 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.019
 until the end of installation because 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.280
 it still takes 15 minutes so I 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.659
 will not make you 15 minutes for 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:03.269
 the for the stuff so I tell you 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:04.909
 just a little later for the and so that's it 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.889
 now the installation 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.090
 it's over so you see that the 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:15.150
 station has quickly place 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:19.430
 start if mac and business end a 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.430
 little recording thing down know that 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.310
 so here you see that I have me 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.800
 I use the studio around 14 h 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.720
 this is the dirtiest of the best 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.979
 use 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.139
 studios are often the best 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.669
 deadlines in junior cinemas because 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.009
 that it really has the essence 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.419
 to make the introductions finally do 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.930
 what am I doing what others 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.120
 all you want to do is 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.880
 frankly it's the best version 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:50.270
 so we're waiting for them to start 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.270
 you can inject the little stuff 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.750
 so here we have so I'll put you 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.380
 viaduc igen to download it when 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:06.710
 you want without going through a website 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:08.009
 of sites and I will put you the link of 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.150

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:16.919
 when the site will work for 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.490
 access in fact so tuba takes his 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.900
 time to get started 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:25.220
 uh yeah that's it's a copy of 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.220
 files so it takes a little while 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.939
 good this is the first time he takes 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.500
 too much time to sense and I'm really 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:40.340
