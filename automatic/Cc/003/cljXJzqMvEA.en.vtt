00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
over trees and things like that hey when

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.820 
over trees and things like that hey when
you<00:02:43.690> get<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:44.019> this<00:02:44.170> side<00:02:46.410> we're<00:02:47.410> just<00:02:47.590> going<00:02:47.769> to

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
you get to this side we're just going to

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:57.380 
you get to this side we're just going to
take<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.900> add<00:02:49.900> him<00:02:51.840> last<00:02:52.840> chunk

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.360 

then<00:02:58.080> I'm<00:02:58.230> going<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.440> switch<00:02:58.590> my<00:02:58.860> hand<00:02:59.069> holes

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
then I'm going to switch my hand holes

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.130 
then I'm going to switch my hand holes
just<00:02:59.610> to<00:03:00.030> let<00:03:00.180> him<00:03:00.270> on<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.600> right<00:03:00.750> side<00:03:01.020> of<00:03:01.110> my

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
just to let him on the right side of my

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.120 
just to let him on the right side of my
head<00:03:01.640> makes<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.790> easier<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.150> braid<00:03:04.069> now<00:03:05.069> you

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
head makes it easier to braid now you

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.270 
head makes it easier to braid now you
can<00:03:05.370> see<00:03:05.580> here<00:03:05.850> where<00:03:06.510> my<00:03:06.810> hair<00:03:07.140> ends<00:03:07.470> my<00:03:08.069> real

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
can see here where my hair ends my real

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.880 
can see here where my hair ends my real
hair<00:03:08.490> see<00:03:08.910> these<00:03:09.030> will<00:03:09.150> pop<00:03:09.330> out<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:10.530> if<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.770> were

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
hair see these will pop out so if I were

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.320 
hair see these will pop out so if I were
doing<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.220> on<00:03:11.459> my<00:03:11.490> rail<00:03:11.760> here<00:03:11.940> my<00:03:12.120> braid

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
doing this on my rail here my braid

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.730 
doing this on my rail here my braid
would<00:03:12.510> end<00:03:12.720> there<00:03:12.990> which<00:03:13.200> would<00:03:13.319> be<00:03:13.440> kind<00:03:13.680> of

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
would end there which would be kind of

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.180 
would end there which would be kind of
short

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
short

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.150 
short
which<00:03:14.490> is<00:03:14.670> why<00:03:14.850> I've<00:03:15.000> added<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.630> few<00:03:16.160> extensions

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
which is why I've added a few extensions

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.180 
which is why I've added a few extensions
but<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.640> could<00:03:17.940> in<00:03:18.120> fact<00:03:18.470> do<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.950> leave

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
but you could in fact do that and leave

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.120 
but you could in fact do that and leave
it<00:03:20.660> short<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:23.250> actually<00:03:24.709> probably<00:03:25.709> will

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
it short and I actually probably will

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.770 
it short and I actually probably will
later<00:03:26.310> post<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.790> video<00:03:26.880> on<00:03:27.239> how<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.420> do<00:03:27.600> this

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780

I<00:04:12.780> saw<00:04:12.989> they<00:04:13.140> were<00:04:13.260> a<00:04:13.290> little<00:04:13.440> softer<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.310> on

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
I saw they were a little softer and on

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.360 
I saw they were a little softer and on
another<00:04:15.540> video<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.440> saw<00:04:16.709> they<00:04:16.919> looked<00:04:17.220> like

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
another video I saw they looked like

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.440 
another video I saw they looked like
they<00:04:17.519> had<00:04:17.640> wet<00:04:17.790> them<00:04:17.910> down<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.209> kind<00:04:18.390> of

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
they had wet them down and kind of

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.190 
they had wet them down and kind of
scrunch<00:04:18.750> them

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
scrunch them

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.530 
scrunch them
so<00:04:19.560> either<00:04:19.950> way<00:04:20.250> finish<00:04:20.820> your<00:04:20.970> bangs<00:04:21.150> off<00:04:21.359> is
