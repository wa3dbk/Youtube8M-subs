like<00:02:01.780> mixed<00:02:02.280> perceptions<00:02:03.280> from<00:02:03.340> people

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
like mixed perceptions from people

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.610 
like mixed perceptions from people
people's<00:02:04.540> initial<00:02:04.960> reaction<00:02:05.350> is<00:02:05.440> always

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
people's initial reaction is always

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.920
