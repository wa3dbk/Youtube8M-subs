360 the graphics the arm the gameplay
just<00:00:26.640> everything<00:00:27.119> about<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.570> game<00:00:27.750> feels

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
just everything about the game feels

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.109 
just everything about the game feels
completely<00:00:28.619> different<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.279> improved<00:00:29.760> its

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
completely different and improved its

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.720 
completely different and improved its
kind<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.869> weird<00:00:31.230> actually<00:00:31.800> because<00:00:32.160> when

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
kind of weird actually because when

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.510 
kind of weird actually because when
playing<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> 360<00:00:33.809> at<00:00:34.140> times<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.340> kind<00:00:35.489> of

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
playing on the 360 at times it kind of

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.549 
playing on the 360 at times it kind of
felt<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.820> little<00:00:36.030> bit<00:00:36.239> slow<00:00:36.660> because<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.320> don't

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
felt a little bit slow because I don't

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.049 
felt a little bit slow because I don't
think<00:00:37.710> there<00:00:37.829> was<00:00:37.890> enough<00:00:38.160> people<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.850> map

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
think there was enough people on the map

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.700 
think there was enough people on the map
um<00:00:39.980> but<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.160> still<00:00:41.550> was<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> fun<00:00:42.149> game<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:42.750> then

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
um but it still was a fun game but then

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.760 
um but it still was a fun game but then
you<00:00:44.100> try<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.910> xbox<00:00:45.570> one<00:00:45.840> version<00:00:46.260> or<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.410> ps4

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
you try the xbox one version or the ps4

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.910 
you try the xbox one version or the ps4
version<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> next<00:00:47.730> generation<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:49.289> feels

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
version the next generation and it feels

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.049 
version the next generation and it feels
like<00:00:50.219> an<00:00:50.480> insanely<00:00:52.489> different<00:00:53.489> game<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.670> feels

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
like an insanely different game it feels

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.540 
like an insanely different game it feels
almost<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.890> completely<00:00:55.890> new<00:00:56.160> game<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
almost like a completely new game and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.029 
almost like a completely new game and
it's<00:00:56.670> weird<00:00:56.910> because<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.379> same<00:00:58.620> game

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
it's weird because it is the same game

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.160 
it's weird because it is the same game
but<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.989> flow<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:02.399> graphics<00:01:03.170> everything

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
but the flow the graphics everything

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.280 
but the flow the graphics everything
about<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.439> has<00:01:04.799> been<00:01:04.979> enhanced<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.840> just

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
about it has been enhanced so it's just

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.789 
about it has been enhanced so it's just
as<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:08.070> much<00:01:08.340> more<00:01:08.610> fun<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.409> next

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
as so much more fun in the next

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.310 
as so much more fun in the next
generation<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.610> 60<00:01:12.270> frames<00:01:12.570> per<00:01:12.720> second

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
generation it's 60 frames per second

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.109 
generation it's 60 frames per second
compared<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> previous<00:01:14.250> 30<00:01:14.670> frames<00:01:15.030> per

tremendously<00:01:41.579> especially<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.210> map<00:01:42.420> this

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
tremendously especially on a map this

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.670 
tremendously especially on a map this
big<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.590> battlefield<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.299> with<00:01:46.290> all<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
explosions going on and since there's so

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.260 
explosions going on and since there's so
much<00:01:49.079> action<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:50.130> change<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.579> 30<00:01:50.790> frames<00:01:51.090> of

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
much action the change of 30 frames of

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.780 
much action the change of 30 frames of
60<00:01:51.570> frames<00:01:51.869> makes<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.159> much<00:01:53.310> more<00:01:53.369> fluid

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
60 frames makes it so much more fluid

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.440 
60 frames makes it so much more fluid
and<00:01:54.149> just<00:01:54.360> overall<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:55.290> better<00:01:55.710> experience
