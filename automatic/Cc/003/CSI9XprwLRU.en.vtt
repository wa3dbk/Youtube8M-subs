00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.930 
and teach other people how to get better
at<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.770> game<00:03:43.950> because<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.310> realized<00:03:44.640> that<00:03:44.790> not

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
at the game because I realized that not

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.580 
at the game because I realized that not
many<00:03:45.090> people<00:03:45.210> did<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.840> at<00:03:45.990> the<00:03:46.110> time<00:03:46.320> and

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
many people did that at the time and

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.200 
many people did that at the time and
nobody<00:03:47.040> did<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.310> as<00:03:47.670> like<00:03:47.820> a<00:03:47.850> full-time

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
nobody did that as like a full-time

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.450 
nobody did that as like a full-time
YouTube<00:03:48.810> thing<00:03:49.140> that's<00:03:49.470> why<00:03:49.710> people<00:03:49.950> started

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
YouTube thing that's why people started

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.460 
YouTube thing that's why people started
watching<00:03:50.580> my<00:03:50.850> videos<00:03:51.210> to<00:03:51.450> get<00:03:51.750> better<00:03:52.050> at<00:03:52.320> the

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
watching my videos to get better at the

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.340 
watching my videos to get better at the
game<00:03:52.710> and<00:03:52.890> that's<00:03:53.310> something<00:03:53.580> that<00:03:54.350> that's

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
game and that's something that that's

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.380 
game and that's something that that's
always<00:03:55.710> what<00:03:56.040> I've<00:03:56.130> just<00:03:56.160> assumed<00:03:56.940> people

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
always what I've just assumed people

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.690

watched me for to get better at the game

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.700 
watched me for to get better at the game
not<00:03:59.910> necessarily<00:04:00.720> because<00:04:00.900> they<00:04:01.230> liked<00:04:01.470> my

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
not necessarily because they liked my

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.630 
not necessarily because they liked my

it's<00:04:02.730> really<00:04:02.970> difficult<00:04:03.300> to<00:04:03.690> tell<00:04:03.960> where

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
it's really difficult to tell where

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
just for being a personality not just to

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.620

just wake up and know one day it's this
it's<00:04:20.820> such<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.060> gradual<00:04:21.570> transition<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:22.320> can

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
it's such a gradual transition you can

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.750 
it's such a gradual transition you can
never<00:04:22.620> really<00:04:22.800> tell<00:04:23.070> there's<00:04:23.340> a<00:04:23.430> difference

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
at all and it really is almost

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.080 
at all and it really is almost
impossible<00:04:26.010> to<00:04:26.220> tell<00:04:26.460> if<00:04:26.730> you've<00:04:26.880> actually

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
impossible to tell if you've actually

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
think my videos are at a point where

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.280 
think my videos are at a point where
I've<00:06:20.580> been<00:06:20.880> making<00:06:21.060> videos<00:06:21.630> that<00:06:21.660> I<00:06:21.900> don't

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
I've been making videos that I don't

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.800 
I've been making videos that I don't
really<00:06:22.560> know<00:06:22.950> how<00:06:23.700> to<00:06:23.730> make<00:06:24.150> them<00:06:24.390> right

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
really know how to make them right

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.200 
really know how to make them right
because<00:06:25.200> there<00:06:25.560> aren't<00:06:25.860> really<00:06:26.010> anyone<00:06:26.490> there

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
because there aren't really anyone there

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.730 
because there aren't really anyone there
aren't<00:06:27.419> really<00:06:27.540> any<00:06:27.690> other<00:06:27.870> personalities

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
aren't really any other personalities

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.320 
aren't really any other personalities
especially<00:06:29.280> in<00:06:29.400> the<00:06:29.490> league<00:06:29.669> community<00:06:29.880> that

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
especially in the league community that

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.000 
especially in the league community that
make<00:06:30.480> the<00:06:30.600> kind<00:06:30.780> of<00:06:30.870> videos<00:06:31.140> that<00:06:31.169> I<00:06:31.350> make<00:06:31.620> but

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
make the kind of videos that I make but

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.230 
make the kind of videos that I make but
I<00:06:32.040> guess<00:06:32.220> that's<00:06:32.370> a<00:06:32.520> good<00:06:32.550> thing<00:06:33.000> right<00:06:33.030> that

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
I guess that's a good thing right that

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.210 
I guess that's a good thing right that
means<00:06:33.630> I'm<00:06:33.780> making<00:06:34.080> unique<00:06:34.410> content<00:06:34.980> that<00:06:35.130> no

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220
