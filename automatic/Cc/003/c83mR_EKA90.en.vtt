00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.040
 good day community today I bring you the 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.149
 romex gamer this round in the tragedy not 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.170
 bad memory 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:15.860
 this the interesting thing about this rom like 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.140
 I mentioned them called ex-gamer because they bring 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.060
 nothing from the services of google other 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.760
 play store do not bring anything even 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.099
 gaps then therefore leaves us a 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.230
 free memory stream to play 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.240
 because what is left is the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.060
 memory that you regularly have if you 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.260
 they fix this they stay alive the one of adjustments 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.970
 and the keyboard 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.870
 the ssd own is the one that I'm using 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:42.090
 to to record this and so 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.879
 the interesting thing about this as I said 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.239
 Well, as I know, I do not play 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.270
 on the cell phone but this is a very good 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.390
 option 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.660
 what I always recommend you do here 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:59.330
 It is who will build number you 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.550
 give about five or six taps until 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.620
 this options option appears 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.710
 development enter 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.510
 as it is for gamers I what they 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.940
 I recommend on the animation scale is 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.080
 that deactivates it will feel super 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.560
 fluid and gap ok probably come by 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.020
 defect comes in one then activate and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.720
 well, they 're going to have the transitions 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.390
 more fluid without animation and nothing the rom 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.180
 not the nolan or adapt it because it was 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.130
 pretty or why not bla bla bla 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.690
 adapt for them to play and for the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.370
 try and you tell me if you 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.760
 it works for games 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.280
 then you can think about doing this 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.470
 version 2 of the mixer that is either a 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.650
 little bit more aesthetic 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.480
 but with the architecture of this is a 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.170
 project that we have pending there 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.090
 yet for the time being I was telling them they do not bring 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.340
 plays thor do not bring drawer 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.640
 applications this that you see here is the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.640
 phone 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.640
 the phone is functional there is no 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.540
 no problem 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.319
 so he receives calls without fights 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.959
 they have the browser here 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.870
 It is also fully functional and 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.310
 apart is the chrome I think there is no 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.709
 problem why 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.709
 and here they have the courier service 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.769
 that is they are basic services go with 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.450
 this is how he mentioned them it is not 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.299
 esthetic 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.939
 to me personally if I like but not 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:39.599
 is aesthetic is not beautiful does not have that 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:41.670
 transitions very very parents precisely 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.970
 because it is designed to release the greatest 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.260
 amount of ram possible 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.870
 the rom well in English come in here and what 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.660
 change for that there is no problem and 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.590
 now I have working this I got him 1 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.590
 ball be this but if it is slow 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.590
 then this is at your discretion if you 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.710
 They want to change his name to 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.450
 launcher or leave it this if you install in 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.100
 anything is going to appear here 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.350
 here is the application drawer 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.190
 to put it that way 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.190
 this is the gallery 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.590
 that something else something very basic well 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.450
 basic before I pass the foundry 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.459
 I put them on but only some modules 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.980
 they work here the green does not work and 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.689
 fire does not work because it does not have 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.239
 google services then this me 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:35.340
 I suppose this from my point of view that 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.019
 there is a crash there between him and between 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.459
 green and fai services that seek 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.280
 hibernate something but never will 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.319
 find because it has nothing google 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.480
 then it does not have play store does not bring 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.269
 preloaded facebook does not bring preloaded 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.120
 whatsapp do not bring anything if they want something 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.090
 I left the black mart 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.890
 this black mark most of those who 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.810
 we play and we have time in this we know 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.209
 that here are the payment applications 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.310
 without any problem they are running without 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.909
 Then I will leave this in 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.370
 instead of the place thor to something else 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:12.239
 important as I mentioned is gamer 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:17.420
 again gamer gamer gamer the rom 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:21.140
 I put a cache swap of 512 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.360
 I'm going to ask you please , are you going to 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.760
 install this rom make sure that in your 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.970
 internal memory in the memory of 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.810
 cellular have free more than a gig of 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:35.450
 1.2 gigas of memory if you do not have it 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.820
 free in that way they will be encouraged 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.040
 a jet the cell phone because this soft 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.090
 touch this one goes for internal memory 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:47.870
 so if you look here I have 1.4 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.760
 free here in data 1.4 live free and 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.680
 it works for me normal I know it works for me 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.200
 fairly good 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.840
 in itself the rom is already this has been 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.450
 gives to free ram with the swap or les 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.200
 it's going to be great that something else is 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.510
 important 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.690
 good another important thing is that no 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:09.410
 has this super youser the rom for 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.210
 defect accepts all processes 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.060
 If you want to download one and put on 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.440
 but I really do not recommend it 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.810
 because it's supposed that if you do 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.670
 superuser because it is to apply this one 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.250
 to run applications that are 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.980
 superuser then well and good 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.460
 you will know 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:30.430
 that something else check nothing is the 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.960
 rom please check the games of the 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.720
 heavy games that suddenly do not 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.640
 runs no other I suppose that in 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.380
 this must run them as I turn them 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.530
 I repeat not play in cell 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.090
 I like this type of roms because I 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.280
 they give a lot of performance that's why 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.340
 development but I really do not use them 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.560
 to play never ever on the cell 2 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.780
 there they go giving him a check obviously 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.180
 as they do not have this google services 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:06:00.460
 the contacts of your consell loves your 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.140
 account of the place lathe are going to appear 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.250
 here then do if a backup of 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:10.030
 your contacts and keep it as vf of 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.310
 I think it's called this happens in the in the in 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.050
 the sd card and from there they matter 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.430
 to have them or if they have them in 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.449
 the sim card then if you are going to read them 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.550
 that's not no quarrel 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.849
 what else then nothing will change 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.809
 The time 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:24.809
 it's okay 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:31.550
 Date and Time 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:35.129
 same and you put this up if you 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:38.459
 they fix this is another row that brings 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:40.739
 we can not change it now directly 

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:44.330
 It gives us close gives us force this closure 

00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:44.330
 everything I do is this 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.870
 he deactivated it and I put the time 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:53.040
 I'm right now , it avoids us, it's 9 46 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.040
 the morning for me 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:59.050
 I think so and the loan date is already 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.219
 four actors normally already and there 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.189
 they have the time change is not 

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:04.960
 complicate a lot as I mentioned no 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:08.830
 look for aesthetics or look for beautiful things 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.240
 there this is to play nothing else if he runs 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.550
 the facebook if it runs whatsapp and 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.439
 obviously correct inter this but we 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.089
 it comes preloaded if they want to look for 

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:18.849
 the application and from the install because 

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:20.860
 google play services is a montage 

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:23.319
 what else do I say good? 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:26.139
 subscribe to the channel for which 

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:27.520
 they are watching the review on youtube below 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:31.330
 there is the channel link and there we have 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:34.089
 marrons this out there I'm seeing others 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:36.069
 projects that is the hydro that that hydro 

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:38.759
 gamer that is totally mine is 

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:42.939
 cooked totally my own 

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:44.589
 this for me but still still not going to 

00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:48.129
 leave that one will take a little longer 

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:50.199
 we are seeing the legal stock this 

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:51.689
 is giving us fights there what is the 

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:53.580
 TV 

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:55.860
 so that's why we're stopping a 

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:58.919
 but today little for now I 

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:02.629
 Interested in trying this and see what 

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:02.629
 games they run as they tell me to
