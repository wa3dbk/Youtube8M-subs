00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
here at any time but again here's a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.870 
here at any time but again here's a
quick<00:00:28.380> shot<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.039> map<00:00:29.250> where<00:00:29.760> it's

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
quick shot of it on the map where it's

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.120 
quick shot of it on the map where it's
at<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.300> I'm<00:00:30.960> supposed<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.260> come<00:00:31.470> here<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.890> get

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
at so I'm supposed to come here and get

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.069 
at so I'm supposed to come here and get
the<00:00:32.309> witches<00:00:32.700> head<00:00:32.910> technically<00:00:33.690> just<00:00:33.809> one

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610

and and try to kill the rest of them

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.910 
and and try to kill the rest of them
