00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 welcome to a new edition of 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.460
 jackos bakery we will be today 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.589
 together a spelled bread in a wood oven 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.189
 We make a first bake 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.990
 advantage 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.049
 which made from rye flour 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.429
 wholegrain flour and water is the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.440
 You can also find ingredients in the 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.900
 description and in the video faded in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.369
 We now give the flour and water in 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.090
 a bowl and leave this well 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.039
 knead thoroughly 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.210
 if you do not have a kitchen machine 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.630
 you can of course with the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.630
 make a hand 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.770
 after five minutes is the whole 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.770
 kneaded 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.410
 the dough is still fast underwear 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.800
 so I better refrigerator him in the 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.800
 bring 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.310
 and off with it for a day in the 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.259
 fridge 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.299
 we need it the next day 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.000
 a little more ingredients namely the vorteig 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.140
 spelled wholemeal spelled wheat sourdough 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.850
 honey salt and water almonds hazelnuts 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.850
 and apple pieces 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.119
 First, the owners must be smaller 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.560
 become 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.720
 We will put it in a plastic bag 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.049
 and then smash them with one 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.049
 bottle 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.030
 when this is done we need 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.390
 again a slightly larger dough machine 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:24.050
 surround the ingredients first moved into the 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.050
 then mail the advantage 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:41.050
 salt cinnamon a yeast 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.640
 the sourdough 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.010
 the honey 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.870
 and the water 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.910
 The whole thing is about five now 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.560
 Knead for ten minutes and then give 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.560
 the nuts and apple pieces to it 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.980
 another five minutes kneading around the 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.980
 then remove dough 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.760
 the dough now one to two hours 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.760
 let go 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:43.519
 Now take the dough out of the bowl and 

00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:43.519
 start forming the poles 

00:04:58.489 --> 00:05:03.119
 This is a very sticky and wet 

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:04.469
 That's why the hands feared 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:22.049
 the medium does not stick last 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:25.789
 and will be about 60 grams piece 

00:05:22.049 --> 00:05:25.789
 made and put into a form 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.130
 because here only one form would be best 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.130
 Baked just like that 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.440
 I 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:29.100
 if the boats are shaped they must 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.100
 go for another 20-30 minutes 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.110
 after they go upstairs 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.130
 cut in to prevent them 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.130
 travel unchecked 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:57.060
 now they are injected and, depending on 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.330
 Heat in the oven for about 40 minutes 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.330
 to let 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.129
 The products are ready when they are already 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.509
 bigger and when knocking on the 

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:24.509
 bottom slightly hollow sound 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.650
 so I hope you liked it a lot 

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.830
 fun while copying and let yourself 

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.830
 taste
