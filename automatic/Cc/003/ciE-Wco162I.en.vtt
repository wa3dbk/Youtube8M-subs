old ram to the Viper extreme ram it was
definitely<00:01:28.920> there's<00:01:29.520> definitely<00:01:29.579> an

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
definitely there's definitely an

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.940

improvement I thought you know the the
boot<00:01:32.100> up<00:01:32.220> time<00:01:32.250> was<00:01:32.610> faster<00:01:33.409> just<00:01:34.409> open<00:01:35.159> up

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
boot up time was faster just open up

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.030 
boot up time was faster just open up
program<00:01:35.909> seems<00:01:36.360> smoother<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.960> faster<00:01:37.170> so

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
program seems smoother and faster so

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.380 
program seems smoother and faster so

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
catch er sticker on the back so these

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.410 
catch er sticker on the back so these
importance<00:02:21.100> of<00:02:21.190> are<00:02:21.310> exactly<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.760> same<00:02:21.790> to

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
importance of are exactly the same to

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.210 
importance of are exactly the same to
both<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.810> same<00:02:23.170> style<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:26.350> as<00:02:26.710> you<00:02:26.860> can<00:02:26.950> see<00:02:27.130> it

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
both the same style so as you can see it

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.790 
both the same style so as you can see it
is<00:02:27.310> they're<00:02:27.430> very<00:02:27.640> very<00:02:28.510> nice<00:02:28.750> very<00:02:29.650> ethical

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
is they're very very nice very ethical

your computer's bios and you have to

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.060 
your computer's bios and you have to
manually<00:03:40.540> adjust<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:42.310> timings<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.690> al<00:03:44.070> 1856

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
megahertz in order for this to work the

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.960 
megahertz in order for this to work the
way<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.680> should<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.190> I<00:03:48.840> still<00:03:49.840> think<00:03:50.110> that<00:03:50.200> the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
way it should I I still think that the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.970 
way it should I I still think that the
patriot<00:03:51.970> memory<00:03:52.090> should<00:03:52.450> have<00:03:52.860> maybe<00:03:53.860> made

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
patriot memory should have maybe made

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.449 
patriot memory should have maybe made
this<00:03:54.370> more<00:03:54.640> of<00:03:54.670> a<00:03:54.790> note<00:03:55.000> in<00:03:55.239> them<00:03:55.570> in<00:03:55.780> the

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
this more of a note in them in the

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.920 
this more of a note in them in the
instruction<00:03:57.459> guide<00:03:57.610> because<00:03:58.180> it<00:03:58.600> was<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.720> very

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
instruction guide because it was a very

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.130 
instruction guide because it was a very
small<00:03:59.350> print<00:03:59.680> and<00:03:59.920> it's<00:04:00.010> very<00:04:00.190> hard<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.519> see

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
small print and it's very hard to see

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.960 
small print and it's very hard to see
but<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.200> think<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:02.739> added<00:04:02.950> a<00:04:03.130> box<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:03.549> product

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
but I think you added a box this product

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.759 
but I think you added a box this product
should<00:04:04.120> have<00:04:04.239> no<00:04:04.690> ray<00:04:05.140> Knight<00:04:05.350> at<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.590> speed

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
should have no ray Knight at the speed

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.670 
should have no ray Knight at the speed

manually<00:04:09.430> adjust<00:04:09.549> it<00:04:09.970> ok<00:04:10.870> so<00:04:10.930> that's<00:04:11.170> that's

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
manually adjust it ok so that's that's

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.949 
manually adjust it ok so that's that's
the<00:04:11.650> major<00:04:11.799> Khan<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.489> is<00:04:13.239> the<00:04:13.390> older<00:04:13.660> really
