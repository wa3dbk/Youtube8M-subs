00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.300
 so friends so happened that the second 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.020
 Part of this video shoot later 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.880
 several days 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.039
 time is sorely lacking 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.990
 so briefly tell about the second 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.480
 the way is with the droid application 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.999
 little server and attaching a reference description 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.369
 To video on branch flop dejan on forum where 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.390
 signs what system files do you need 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.520
 need to change 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.620
 I'll tell you what you need at first 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.900
 droid maxx nr Further 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.700
 any conductor with the ability to 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.950
 code file system that is exactly in 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.000
 the system of the device itself for this 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.900
 of course rights are required 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.820
 superuser 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.530
 I recommend there is a guide because 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.000
 here is a very convenient text editor and 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.820
 you will need to change literally everything 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.080
 four lines of code and also need 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.870
 wizebox application 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.310
 That is why on the very page of this 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.350
 no play market apps 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.690
 there was no information but when i went to 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.040
 developer's site and the forum went then yes he 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.500
 argued that to complete the work 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.270
 need wizebox 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.650
 so we got a message that of the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.630
 baseballs she carries no 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.380
 responsible for your actions in 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.180
 principle too 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.250
 we wait while the program collects 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.700
 information to our device after which 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.710
 we press 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.720
 install and we are offered a choice of two 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.430
 smart install options and standards it became 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.320
 but smart install it for more 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.880
 advanced users you can 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.400
 something to change something to correct 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.710
 I basically set the standard 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.540
 method using norm and i have no 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.260
 There were no problems, that is, I was tired with 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.880
 using the second item 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.130
 proposed for some reason to stop it 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.510
 All the second time, you can also delete and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.330
 restore system files 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.820
 but this is how it did everything and here 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.350
 my droid app price after 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.630
 you all make it possible to run 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.190
 but just to save time I'm in 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.090
 seen in the upper right corner of the night 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.280
 gameplay 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.710
 let's look at the client itself on 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.050
 smartphone, that is, he was talking about something 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.250
 what kind of things you can just manage 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.990
 With your own, how to say a tablet with 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.110
 using this 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.590
 the remote and that is, the enter button key 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.539
 home 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.069
 turn off the tap let's search by 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.440
 switching device between all 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.750
 applications that is exactly the same 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.069
 Essentially south as in the fourth android on 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.170
 tablet or honeycomb 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.269
 there is the ability to control media 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.040
 the player named this same gamepad 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.090
 eat eat by here really looks like 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.250
 more cooler 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.380
 Although I like how I would play 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.390
 in the emulator it is better to use 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.430
 bluetooth controller here and also here 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.319
 there is such a function is especially convenient 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.049
 on this console when you drive 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.680
 finger and you like but also 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:42.900
 hover over the work surface 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.239
 You can call the keyboard, that is, here 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.160
 there is scrolling very very comfortable and 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.209
 let's see the settings 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.940
 yes here you must specify the port and 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.860
 password here if we pass the password 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.310
 I will not just show if we are with you 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.340
 let's go through the settings of our server 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.630
 here itâ€™s just as well yes yes yes 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.099
 product do not forget anything after 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.819
 changes to the construction include it for well 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.549
 here we also set your password 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.950
 and specify the port but as for the board 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.159
 then it is in principle the default 23 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.709
 I think now I will say for sure 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:22.400
 2302 and it when installing the application in 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.650
 principle in the client and in and in the server 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.900
 same here you can choose 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.079
 the following parameters run when 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.689
 turn on the system i.e. turn on and 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.489
 roll it up into a foundation so as not to 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.260
 the interface loaded but you 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.389
 had access then there is say it again 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.299
 It will also be convenient for consoles, that is 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:43.280
 In principle, this console too cool here 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.200
 but here everything is very simple settings then 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.930
 There are gamepad settings displayed in 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.150
 separate configuration section 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.949
 same touchpad i.e. if 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.889
 smartphone will be that touchpad 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:58.069
 also in a separate section and, in principle, well 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:00.469
 there is nothing so complicated here so I 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.599
 I hope you liked these both methods with 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.939
 you were Vladimir subscribe to 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.409
 channel comment now video will 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.169
 spreading is not so often easy for me 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:11.150
 exams and so thumb up so I 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.689
 I passed them well to everyone until the next day 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.680
 meeting 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.680
 success
