00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.050 

yeah<00:02:31.320> definitely<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.100> know<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.280> mean<00:02:32.700> college

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
yeah definitely you know I mean college

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.060 
yeah definitely you know I mean college
you<00:02:33.180> saw<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.420> lot<00:02:33.570> of<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:34.260> highlights<00:02:34.710> people

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
you saw a lot of the highlights people

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.530 
you saw a lot of the highlights people
around<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.370> country<00:02:35.520> saw<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.150> can<00:02:36.360> shoot

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
around the country saw that I can shoot

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.930 
around the country saw that I can shoot
from<00:02:36.690> deep<00:02:36.930> ranges<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:38.430> know<00:02:38.550> it's<00:02:38.760> not

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
from deep ranges and you know it's not

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.210 
from deep ranges and you know it's not
too<00:02:39.720> big<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:39.990> an<00:02:40.200> adjustment<00:02:40.320> for<00:02:40.800> me<00:02:41.040> I've

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
too big of an adjustment for me I've

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.890 
too big of an adjustment for me I've
been<00:02:41.370> shooting<00:02:41.550> from<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.330> know<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.630> type<00:02:42.870> of

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
been shooting from you know that type of

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.380 
been shooting from you know that type of
range<00:02:43.290> for<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:44.160> know<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> long<00:02:44.520> time<00:02:44.820> now<00:02:45.060> so

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
range for you know a long time now so

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.410 
range for you know a long time now so
it's<00:02:45.600> it's<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.960> little<00:02:46.230> bit<00:02:46.350> different<00:02:46.800> because

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
it's it's a little bit different because

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.940 
it's it's a little bit different because
you<00:02:48.420> just<00:02:48.600> have<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.990> step<00:02:49.230> behind<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.800> line

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
you just have to step behind that line

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.590 
you just have to step behind that line
to<00:02:50.130> shoot<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:50.580> it's<00:02:50.730> almost<00:02:50.880> like<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.150> mindset

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
to shoot so it's almost like a mindset

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.780 
to shoot so it's almost like a mindset
you<00:02:51.750> have<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:51.990> be<00:02:52.080> ready<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:53.340> know<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.550> be

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
you have to be ready to you know to be

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.520 
you have to be ready to you know to be
ready<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.390> prepared<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.930> shoot<00:02:55.170> from<00:02:55.350> that

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
ready and prepared to shoot from that

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.650 
ready and prepared to shoot from that
distances<00:02:56.100> but<00:02:56.310> i<00:02:56.370> know<00:02:56.700> i<00:02:56.820> think<00:02:56.940> i<00:02:57.240> can<00:02:57.300> do<00:02:57.510> it

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
distances but i know i think i can do it

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.320 
distances but i know i think i can do it
pretty<00:02:57.900> well<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.470> obviously<00:02:59.130> continue<00:02:59.760> to<00:03:00.150> work

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
pretty well I obviously continue to work

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.900 
pretty well I obviously continue to work
on<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.870> continue<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.530> get<00:03:01.620> better<00:03:01.850> but<00:03:02.850> I

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
on it to continue to get better but I

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.370 
on it to continue to get better but I
think<00:03:03.240> I've<00:03:03.330> shown<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.570> I<00:03:03.720> can<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:04.230> can

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
think I've shown that I can I can

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.770 
think I've shown that I can I can
stretch<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.800> floor<00:03:04.980> at<00:03:05.550> an<00:03:05.700> MBA<00:03:05.970> level<00:03:06.060> and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
stretch the floor at an MBA level and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.440 
stretch the floor at an MBA level and
you<00:03:07.350> know
