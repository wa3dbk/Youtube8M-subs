00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
booting down I'm just gonna wait a few

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.170 
booting down I'm just gonna wait a few
extra<00:01:48.600> seconds<00:01:48.990> here<00:01:49.229> because<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:50.310> don't<00:01:51.060> want

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
extra seconds here because I don't want

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.590 
extra seconds here because I don't want
to<00:01:51.329> take<00:01:51.540> any<00:01:51.840> risks<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.909> not<00:01:54.210> powered

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
to take any risks that it's not powered

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.209 
to take any risks that it's not powered
off<00:01:54.750> because<00:01:55.049> sometimes<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.799> pretty<00:01:55.950> hard

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
off because sometimes it's pretty hard

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.770 
off because sometimes it's pretty hard
to<00:01:56.399> see<00:01:57.110> when<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.140> being<00:01:58.469> powered<00:01:58.710> down

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
to see when it's being powered down

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.100 
to see when it's being powered down
especially<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.799> iOS<00:02:02.219> 7<00:02:02.520> beta<00:02:03.180> version
