four whatever and then put your iron
doors<00:00:40.020> inside<00:00:41.149> now<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.210> reason<00:00:42.629> why<00:00:43.050> they

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
doors inside now the reason why they

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.840 
doors inside now the reason why they
can't<00:00:43.590> open<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.070> their<00:00:44.219> own<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.579> because

can't open on their own is because

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.130 
can't open on their own is because
they're<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.750> their<00:00:45.870> mothers

they're up and their mothers
didn't<00:00:46.440> love<00:00:46.590> them<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.219> want<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.730> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
didn't love them so if you want to you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.500 
didn't love them so if you want to you
can<00:00:51.059> do<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> same<00:00:51.480> thing<00:00:51.840> three<00:00:52.260> blocks<00:00:53.510> back

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
can do the same thing three blocks back

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.990 
can do the same thing three blocks back
and<00:00:54.840> three<00:00:54.989> blocks<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.469> right<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.640> make<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and three blocks to the right to make a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.299 
and three blocks to the right to make a
back<00:00:57.360> switch<00:00:57.840> from<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.230> inside<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.190> have

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
back switch from the inside so you have

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.680 
back switch from the inside so you have
to<00:00:59.430> open<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.699> from<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> outside<00:00:59.969> all<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.570> time

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.330 

so<00:01:03.690> put<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.710> there<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.650> go<00:01:07.650> through<00:01:07.920> here

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
so put one on there and go through here

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.950 
so put one on there and go through here
these<00:01:08.610> switches<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.330> not<00:01:09.540> work<00:01:09.720> because

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
these switches do not work because

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.910 
these switches do not work because
there's<00:01:10.350> nothing<00:01:10.680> there<00:01:11.150> so<00:01:12.150> dig<00:01:12.540> down<00:01:12.930> three

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
there's nothing there so dig down three

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.440 
there's nothing there so dig down three
and<00:01:14.220> make<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> staircase<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:16.610> then<00:01:17.610> dig<00:01:18.150> down

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
and make a staircase and then dig down

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.480 
and make a staircase and then dig down
one<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.229> make<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.100> 12<00:01:20.759> x<00:01:21.119> 15<00:01:21.750> room<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.290> 12<00:01:22.590> long<00:01:22.890> 15

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
one and make a 12 x 15 room a 12 long 15

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.530 
one and make a 12 x 15 room a 12 long 15
wide<00:01:23.790> room<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.540> then<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.470> want<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:26.299> make<00:01:27.299> a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
wide room and then you want to make a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.260 
wide room and then you want to make a
few<00:01:27.810> red<00:01:28.770> stone<00:01:29.100> trail<00:01:29.369> view<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:29.970> then<00:01:30.060> make<00:01:30.240> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
few red stone trail view and then make a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.469 
few red stone trail view and then make a
repeater<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.770> actually<00:01:32.210> craft<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
repeater you can actually craft a

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.090 
repeater you can actually craft a
repeater<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:34.229> three<00:01:35.100> stone<00:01:35.700> blocks<00:01:36.890> on<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
repeater with three stone blocks on the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.880 
repeater with three stone blocks on the
bottom<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:39.479> redstone<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> very<00:01:40.590> middle

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
bottom one redstone in the very middle

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.069 
bottom one redstone in the very middle
and<00:01:41.280> two<00:01:41.820> redstone<00:01:42.720> torches<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:45.180> left<00:01:45.930> and

right<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.560> redstone<00:01:47.009> dust<00:01:47.869> that<00:01:48.869> will

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
right of the redstone dust that will

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.450 
right of the redstone dust that will
craft<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.350> repeater<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.070> doing<00:01:50.189> this

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
craft a repeater I just like doing this

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.719 
craft a repeater I just like doing this
I'm<00:01:51.299> more<00:01:51.509> used<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.070> so<00:01:53.070> make<00:01:53.250> your<00:01:53.430> trail

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
I'm more used to it so make your trail

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.030 
I'm more used to it so make your trail
about<00:01:54.000> five<00:01:54.420> things<00:01:54.869> back<00:01:55.170> right<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.860> wall

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
about five things back right on the wall

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.539 
about five things back right on the wall
and<00:01:56.340> then<00:01:57.060> make<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.420> forward<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.460> do

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
and then make it forward one you can do

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.249 
and then make it forward one you can do
the<00:01:59.670> same<00:01:59.700> couple<00:02:00.299> squares<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.840> there<00:02:01.049> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
the same couple squares in there and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.490 
the same couple squares in there and
then<00:02:01.829> you're<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.159> make<00:02:02.310> an<00:02:02.490> arc<00:02:02.820> shape

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
then you're going to make an arc shape

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.700 
then you're going to make an arc shape
right<00:02:04.500> here

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
right here

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.050 
right here
it'll<00:02:06.010> be<00:02:07.289> 253<00:02:08.289> long<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.950> then<00:02:09.490> you<00:02:09.580> make<00:02:09.729> to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
it'll be 253 long and then you make to

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.270 
it'll be 253 long and then you make to
there<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.660> then<00:02:10.720> destroy<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.709> bottom<00:02:12.010> blocks

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
there and then destroy the bottom blocks

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.010 
there and then destroy the bottom blocks
under<00:02:12.520> those<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.000> redstone<00:02:13.330> torches<00:02:13.810> are

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
under those and redstone torches are

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.930 
under those and redstone torches are
going<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.230> go<00:02:14.319> under<00:02:14.560> those<00:02:14.709> so<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.700> place

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
going to go under those so you place

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.000 
going to go under those so you place
your<00:02:16.090> redstone<00:02:16.360> torches<00:02:16.780> under<00:02:17.140> there<00:02:17.319> you're

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
your redstone torches under there you're

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.210 
your redstone torches under there you're
going<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.220> need<00:02:18.250> roughly<00:02:18.580> fifty<00:02:19.120> three

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
going to need roughly fifty three

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.530 
going to need roughly fifty three
redstone<00:02:21.220> dust<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.700> do<00:02:21.850> this<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.500> 10<00:02:23.819> ish<00:02:24.819> nine

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540

using for this and then the red storm
taupe<00:03:50.370> redstone<00:03:51.370> torch<00:03:51.700> there<00:03:52.049> this<00:03:53.049> kind<00:03:53.290> of

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
taupe redstone torch there this kind of

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.150 
taupe redstone torch there this kind of
neutralizes<00:03:54.579> it<00:03:54.609> and<00:03:55.590> inverts<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.590> flow<00:03:57.100> so

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
neutralizes it and inverts the flow so

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.030 
neutralizes it and inverts the flow so
ones<00:03:57.519> on<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:57.970> ones<00:03:58.150> off<00:03:58.359> so<00:03:58.660> that<00:03:58.690> they<00:03:59.049> both

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
ones on and ones off so that they both

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.060 
ones on and ones off so that they both
function<00:04:00.850> at<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.540> same<00:04:01.780> way<00:04:01.989> and<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.859> see

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
function at the same way and you see

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.390 
function at the same way and you see
when<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.370> flip<00:04:03.609> that<00:04:03.790> they<00:04:04.180> go<00:04:04.420> on<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:04.989> off<00:04:05.400> it

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
when you flip that they go on and off it

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.349 
when you flip that they go on and off it
open<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.060> close<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:08.650> don't<00:04:09.579> know<00:04:09.700> why<00:04:09.880> mine<00:04:10.209> is

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
open and close I don't know why mine is

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.630 
open and close I don't know why mine is
doing<00:04:10.540> that<00:04:10.630> I<00:04:10.660> think<00:04:10.959> it<00:04:11.230> depends<00:04:12.130> on<00:04:12.400> what

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
doing that I think it depends on what

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.199 
doing that I think it depends on what
direction<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.299> door<00:04:13.570> is<00:04:13.870> in<00:04:14.669> if<00:04:15.669> you<00:04:15.820> have<00:04:16.030> it

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
direction the door is in if you have it

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.020 
direction the door is in if you have it
facing

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
facing

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.830 
facing
that<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.329> west<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:18.109> east<00:04:18.350> I<00:04:18.709> think<00:04:19.810> it'll<00:04:20.810> be

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
that the west the east I think it'll be

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.610 
that the west the east I think it'll be
different<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:23.660> you've<00:04:23.810> got<00:04:23.840> that<00:04:24.170> and<00:04:24.380> if<00:04:24.500> you

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
different so you've got that and if you

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.600 
different so you've got that and if you
want<00:04:24.860> a<00:04:25.040> back<00:04:25.370> door<00:04:25.730> thing<00:04:26.240> you<00:04:26.710> go<00:04:27.710> back<00:04:28.250> from

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
want a back door thing you go back from

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.210 
want a back door thing you go back from
here<00:04:29.000> go<00:04:29.450> back<00:04:29.600> three<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.200> up<00:04:30.410> around<00:04:30.860> five

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
here go back three and up around five
