wait a minute you broke this yeah it's
semi-autobiographical<00:02:13.880> well<00:02:14.880> then<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.120> think

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
semi-autobiographical well then I think

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.930 
semi-autobiographical well then I think
it<00:02:15.600> would<00:02:15.690> be<00:02:15.720> especially<00:02:16.320> easy<00:02:16.950> for<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.730> to
