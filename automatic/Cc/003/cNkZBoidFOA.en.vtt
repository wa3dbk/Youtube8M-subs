00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.779 
but it's not that bad and just remember
that<00:05:08.669> I<00:05:09.000> have<00:05:09.210> a<00:05:09.240> 14<00:05:09.750> gauge<00:05:10.020> and<00:05:10.470> a<00:05:11.009> lot<00:05:11.699> of

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
that I have a 14 gauge and a lot of

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.909 
that I have a 14 gauge and a lot of
people<00:05:12.030> have<00:05:12.180> 16<00:05:12.690> gauge<00:05:12.960> and<00:05:13.289> that's<00:05:13.500> smaller

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
people have 16 gauge and that's smaller

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.520 
people have 16 gauge and that's smaller
and<00:05:14.340> it's<00:05:14.690> never<00:05:15.690> experienced<00:05:16.259> might<00:05:16.440> be

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
and it's never experienced might be

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.080 
and it's never experienced might be
different<00:05:16.889> than<00:05:16.949> mine<00:05:17.219> might<00:05:17.550> might<00:05:18.060> be

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
different than mine might might be

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.969 
different than mine might might be
different<00:05:18.539> than<00:05:18.569> yours<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.169> you<00:05:19.680> probably

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
different than yours and you probably

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.200 
different than yours and you probably
actually<00:05:20.099> want<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:20.400> go<00:05:20.550> that<00:05:20.699> route<00:05:20.909> with<00:05:21.180> the

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
actually want to go that route with the

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.029 
actually want to go that route with the
16<00:05:21.810> gauge<00:05:22.020> because<00:05:22.349> it'll<00:05:22.650> probably<00:05:22.830> be<00:05:23.009> a

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
16 gauge because it'll probably be a

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.680 
16 gauge because it'll probably be a
little<00:05:23.099> bit<00:05:23.370> easier<00:05:23.699> on<00:05:23.789> you<00:05:24.060> it's<00:05:24.240> just<00:05:24.449> I

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
little bit easier on you it's just I

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.709 
little bit easier on you it's just I
