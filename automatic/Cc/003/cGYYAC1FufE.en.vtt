split into 15-minute parts are you okay
with<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.340> was<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.760> right<00:01:11.880> sure<00:01:12.210> so

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
with this I was like all right sure so

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.929 
with this I was like all right sure so
then<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.470> was<00:01:13.530> already<00:01:13.799> split<00:01:14.130> into<00:01:14.340> 11<00:01:14.640> parts

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
then it was already split into 11 parts

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.999 
then it was already split into 11 parts
and<00:01:15.299> then<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.689> each<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.350> those<00:01:16.470> 11<00:01:16.710> parts

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and then it's and each of those 11 parts

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.649 
and then it's and each of those 11 parts
for<00:01:17.130> two<00:01:17.250> hours<00:01:17.369> each<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.060> then<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.240> took<00:01:18.360> all

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
for two hours each and then I took all

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.420 
for two hours each and then I took all
those<00:01:18.810> two<00:01:18.990> hour<00:01:19.140> each<00:01:19.380> clips<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.920> then<00:01:20.310> they

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
those two hour each clips and then they

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.390 
those two hour each clips and then they
cut<00:01:20.700> them<00:01:21.030> into<00:01:21.330> eight<00:01:22.049> parts<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.860> their<00:01:23.250> own

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
cut them into eight parts of their own

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.190 
cut them into eight parts of their own
so<00:01:23.850> that's<00:01:24.000> why<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.600> ocarina<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.140> time

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
so that's why you see ocarina of time

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.109 
so that's why you see ocarina of time
Japan<00:01:25.680> thing<00:01:26.930> part<00:01:27.930> batch<00:01:28.229> 1<00:01:28.619> part<00:01:29.040> 1<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.340> 9<00:01:29.490> and

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
Japan thing part batch 1 part 1 of 9 and

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.080 
Japan thing part batch 1 part 1 of 9 and
then<00:01:30.240> batch<00:01:30.479> 2<00:01:30.780> part<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:32.040> part<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.880> part

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
then batch 2 part so it's part of a part

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.149 
then batch 2 part so it's part of a part
it's<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.299> fraction<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.780> fraction<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.320> very

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it's a fraction of a fraction it's very

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.480 
it's a fraction of a fraction it's very
odd<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:37.229> went<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.130> audio

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
odd and as it went on and on the audio

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.800 
odd and as it went on and on the audio
went<00:01:38.700> further<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.000> further<00:01:39.210> time<00:01:39.420> sink<00:01:39.659> so

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
went further and further time sink so

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.690 
went further and further time sink so
I'm<00:01:39.900> really<00:01:40.079> really<00:01:40.350> sorry<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.950> but
