difficulty<00:00:06.390> with<00:00:06.569> that<00:00:10.070> are<00:00:11.070> there<00:00:11.280> other

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
difficulty with that are there other

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.760 
difficulty with that are there other
ideas<00:00:12.980> there<00:00:13.980> are<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.490> few<00:00:14.880> one<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.379> being

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
ideas there are a few one is that being

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.820 
ideas there are a few one is that being
bipedal<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.670> tropical<00:00:18.390> Sun<00:00:18.690> gives<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.619> some

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
bipedal in tropical Sun gives you some

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.040 
bipedal in tropical Sun gives you some
advantage<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.490> thermal<00:00:20.820> regulation<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.869> is

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
advantage in thermal regulation that is

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.890 
advantage in thermal regulation that is
it's<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.320> smaller<00:00:22.650> target<00:00:23.300> for<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.480> Sun<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
it's a smaller target for the Sun and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.019 
it's a smaller target for the Sun and
therefore<00:00:25.590> there's<00:00:25.769> less<00:00:25.980> body<00:00:26.310> heating<00:00:26.699> and

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
therefore there's less body heating and

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.179 
therefore there's less body heating and
this<00:00:27.660> would<00:00:27.869> allow<00:00:28.109> activity<00:00:28.740> during

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
this would allow activity during

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.490 
this would allow activity during
daylight<00:00:29.640> hours<00:00:29.699> which<00:00:30.510> would<00:00:30.720> provide<00:00:31.289> an

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
daylight hours which would provide an

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.410 
daylight hours which would provide an
advantage<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.399> think<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:32.820> still<00:00:33.090> don't

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
advantage but I think we still don't

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.900 
advantage but I think we still don't
understand<00:00:33.960> all<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:35.070> advantages<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.670> by

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
modality why then do we walk upright why

modality why then do we walk upright why
do<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.350> well<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
do we do it well this is one of the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.470 
do we do it well this is one of the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.350 
great questions remaining in human
evolution<00:00:46.520> everybody<00:00:47.520> wants<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.910> know<00:00:48.059> that

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360

stood<00:00:51.719> upright<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.469> first<00:00:53.280> place<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:54.239> of

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
stood upright in the first place and of

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.650 
stood upright in the first place and of
course<00:00:55.280> this<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.180> very<00:00:57.390> legitimate

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
course this is it's a very legitimate

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.430 
course this is it's a very legitimate
question<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.530> ask<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.850> other<00:00:59.969> hand<00:01:00.440> what

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
question to ask on the other hand what

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.340 
question to ask on the other hand what
is<00:01:01.590> important<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.420> standing<00:01:04.019> upright

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
is important is the standing upright

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.580 
is important is the standing upright
itself<00:01:04.949> once<00:01:05.580> you've<00:01:05.790> stood<00:01:06.180> upright<00:01:06.590> you

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
itself once you've stood upright you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.609 
itself once you've stood upright you
have<00:01:07.860> all<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.760> advantages<00:01:09.390> and

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
have all of the advantages and

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.859 
have all of the advantages and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
crawling and this may come about because

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.240 
crawling and this may come about because
of<00:02:12.760> our<00:02:12.880> leg<00:02:13.090> length<00:02:13.390> as<00:02:14.260> babies<00:02:14.890> we<00:02:15.100> have

of our leg length as babies we have

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.040 
of our leg length as babies we have
short<00:02:15.580> stubby<00:02:15.880> little<00:02:16.120> legs<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.720> this<00:02:16.780> makes

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
fidelity may have to do with the length

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.730 
fidelity may have to do with the length
of<00:02:30.490> our<00:02:30.880> legs<00:02:31.150> why<00:02:31.600> our<00:02:31.630> legs<00:02:32.020> are<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:32.350> long<00:02:32.380> of

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740

we see some features in here that are

we see some features in here that are
very<00:04:16.000> very<00:04:16.269> interesting<00:04:16.870> for<00:04:17.709> example<00:04:18.419> these

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
very very interesting for example these

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.560 
very very interesting for example these
would<00:04:19.780> be<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.829> visual<00:04:21.700> areas<00:04:22.150> of<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.419> brain

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
would be the visual areas of the brain

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.770 
would be the visual areas of the brain
and<00:04:22.960> we<00:04:23.740> believe<00:04:24.130> that<00:04:24.430> there<00:04:25.210> has<00:04:25.450> been<00:04:25.480> a

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
and we believe that there has been a

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.680 
and we believe that there has been a
reduction<00:04:26.050> in<00:04:26.620> size<00:04:26.890> of<00:04:27.250> this<00:04:27.370> visual<00:04:27.820> cortex

reduction in size of this visual cortex

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.200 
reduction in size of this visual cortex
when<00:04:29.410> we<00:04:29.620> compare<00:04:30.070> it<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.460> size<00:04:30.700> of<00:04:31.060> the

when we compare it to the size of the
chimpanzee<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:33.669> brain<00:04:33.910> size<00:04:34.210> on<00:04:34.630> this<00:04:34.870> is

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
chimpanzee and the brain size on this is

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.170 
chimpanzee and the brain size on this is
roughly<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.560> same<00:04:35.860> size<00:04:35.919> as<00:04:36.550> this<00:04:36.790> chimpanzee

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
roughly the same size as this chimpanzee

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.680 
roughly the same size as this chimpanzee
brain<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:37.930> yet<00:04:38.650> there's<00:04:39.640> clear<00:04:39.940> evidence<00:04:39.970> for

brain and yet there's clear evidence for
what<00:04:41.140> we<00:04:41.290> would<00:04:41.470> call<00:04:41.790> reorganization<00:04:42.790> of<00:04:42.940> the

00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:53.119 
the organization of the brain gives us

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:55.719 
the organization of the brain gives us
reasoning<00:04:53.809> ability<00:04:54.289> and<00:04:54.729> problem-solving
