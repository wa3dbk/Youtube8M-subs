 he proposes to the materials 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.220
 in rugby charentais 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:09.459

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:10.859

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.589
 soro guillaume 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:22.479
 Explain to me gtlds this year's npc has led to lagos 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.159
 the pass of three 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.159
 presented as temporary 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:30.939
 present members 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.760
 present in the body 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.890
 problem like his father 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.960
 then what exactly did he estimate 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.960
 gold making video documents or his offer 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.860
 the application of water bodies with young people 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.010
 they are responsible for everything 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.010
 young Czechs 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.220
 side of pablo rojas while she can 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.270
 very possessive 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.850
 tax these documents 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.500
 we suffer 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 visitors were getting 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.810
 he dissents over ten years in the service of the team 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.830
 about her and citizen participation and that's because we're going 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.700
 self 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.150
 why me I think it's 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.270
 fouad bearers of raisinio 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.940
 beijing 6 8% 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.750
 everyone will end up in a 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.480
 a single race citizens 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.170
 there are things that change 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.360
 because young and old 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.140
 if you are sport 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.380
 the victims change things move too much for this product 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.280
 I think average growth 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.280
 not stupid the pique head of the community can not change 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.360
 it's mine I think 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.870
 it would be necessary to sensitize young people to acquire hours 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.050
 at soft growth 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.550
 respect other members 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.270
 today obsolete 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.450
 of this kind for the club 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.160
 then how many years did he like 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
 for some servers 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.079
 the wealthiest m 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.560
 for 56% each day she will continue to hunt but it's not a thing 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.019
 only with the work that I do 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.439
 as a horizon to make use of the info that needs 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.439
 from 15 minutes earlier to vote 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:36.969
 so this is a science 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.969
 this measurement to wear them 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.989
 and god knows that we came to play 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.989
 for vincent angban crew second only on the bottom 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.139
 I think not 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.509
 to change things 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:01.379
 suspension 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.539
 are pushed by different 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.539
 his wife left on the fact that people do not hide it 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:08.559
 young people today 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:11.559
 no technical stop this 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:16.369
 one with the problem of suicide 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.809
 as serious as tunis station 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.889
 I think that if young people 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.059
 surprising 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:24.709
 see budget bachand pittsburgh 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.759
 gdf suez no longer want me to feel good 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:29.419
 they become heroes 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.659
 or how 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.489
 opel 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.170
 then 7th place to bleed about eutelsat in France if it is this 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.709
 that she is well interested is undeniable that the protocols that is 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.709
 simply testifies his head 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:46.509
 the one where the beats of the press afp 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:53.559
 mazen has hurt
