00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.330
 the emotion is at the height of the performance 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.350
 skating world 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.480
 so it had not happened 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.779
 it is certainly the most important day of his career 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:11.949
 four laps in the air 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.169
 however as experts say 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:15.759
 point of passage obliged 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.669
 on the road to world title 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.609
 tigana jeans performed 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.079
 brian joubert decided then to ensure 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.079
 the second month in a row 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.429
 the French program becomes more compute 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.939
 but still pretty 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.650
 in his program joubert is executed 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.560
 at the end of his performance 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.710
 it reveals a measured satisfaction more difficult 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.130
 it is the main opponent the canadian of montreal 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.130
 he is not entitled to the error 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.830
 the school system 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.830
 plus the first under the theme and fly away the gold medal 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.460
 after a small facelift 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.470
 960 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.830
 karakama in 1965 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.040
 brian joubert 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.720
 and the third French 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.900
 to win the title 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.900
 figure skating 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.860
 and recommend average tokyo actors about their parents why this 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.800
 Marseille 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.040
 why then at the mercy of being with us 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.299
 that's why m animating what the huge success 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.000
 an expectation of two long years and the culmination of long years of 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.260
 job 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.520
 he and his daughter now 18 years old I skate 10% 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.300
 if i have always worked to be the european champion and champion of 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.920
 world and now it's happened 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.480
 so it's fabulous 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.480
 and paid work and that makes me very happy 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.570
 when you heard precisely will sound to this this brand ctso 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.570
 on the podium you will perform 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.649
 but I still have a lot of emotion 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:20.099
 certainly this season was extraordinary I won everything I have 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.109
 resumed my title of european champion 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.109
 but the fight for the title and world champion is different a year ago 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.689
 bombay it was fabulous and 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.239
 while I am happy 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.520
 you were hurt 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.229
 but it's a personal performance is too good 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.229
 in such a short time to murder worth 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.969
 it was very very hard after the European champions so after the 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.579
 injury 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.269
 that's it 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.089
 it kept me from working in good conditions 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:51.639
 remains that this cycle the days that preceded the departure and here they are for 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.329
 me now where we won is the main 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.420
 and also where she was favorite and we know it's always difficult 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.420
 we pass for a little pressure like that on the shoulders 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.739
 I'm at home I do not like that night 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.849
 this favorite position 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.779
 but now with the experience and the season that I've done but I'm learning to 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:11.669
 manage 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.379
 it will learn to manage again for next season 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.829
 then a new appointment now to make you 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:17.639
 this fund 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.639
 and to recall that before concerning three years 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.999
 yes every season is important for next season it's a season too 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:26.859
 to prepare for the 2010 games 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.859
 but it's true that the number one goal is the Olympics 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.819
 I was not at the rendezvous in 2006 it will be in 2010 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:35.699
