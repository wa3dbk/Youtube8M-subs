00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello to all good day to all that nice 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.779
 and I'm glad to meet you for 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.069
 this time a new dofus video 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.870
 I know you're waiting for it 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.660
 I know you want it but 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.740
 today we will mostly discuss yes 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.809
 I was supposed to be in stream there all of 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.369
 following but I decided to leave the tv 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.710
 and whoever is holding minecraft I am going all you 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.090
 explain why I will not trash 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.670
 nobody if that's what you 're looking for 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.230
 it will not actually happen for you 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.510
 and more or less summarizes the situation of the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.580
 why I left the cnd kraft in 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.619
 either I think it does not tell me how 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.910
 say do not fit me I'm 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.660
 someone who likes to be free to do 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.550
 what he wants 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.510
 if I want to sing during my stream if 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.100
 I want to show my head for a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.719
 time if I just want to discuss 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.460
 just with you but do not play 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.020
 you know I do it because I 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.329
 am free of stream and it's for me 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.950
 the one and only goal of the stream 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.870
 I was not ready yet for this kind 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.910
 rather square thing has enough pro was 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.469
 row where we unfortunately need 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.239
 play because that's the goal 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.820
 me no I'm a guy who likes 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.590
 to be alone and in my delirium she 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.120
 share with you - a live I know for 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.100
 discuss with those who follow me but 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.140
 live and not through your videos 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.610
 interposed and I think it does not 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.159
 not fit so I go back on 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.960
