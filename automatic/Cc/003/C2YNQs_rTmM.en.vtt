okay<00:00:10.850> we<00:00:11.030> see<00:00:11.240> several<00:00:12.020> braces<00:00:12.650> in<00:00:12.830> here<00:00:13.070> I

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
okay we see several braces in here I

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.820 
okay we see several braces in here I
mentioned<00:00:13.640> the<00:00:13.760> X<00:00:14.330> that's<00:00:14.810> the<00:00:15.110> center<00:00:15.470> of<00:00:15.650> it

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
mentioned the X that's the center of it

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.870 
mentioned the X that's the center of it
and<00:00:16.010> we<00:00:16.790> have<00:00:16.970> auxilary<00:00:17.450> bracing<00:00:18.080> around<00:00:18.380> that

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
and we have auxilary bracing around that

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.660 
and we have auxilary bracing around that
we<00:00:19.880> have<00:00:20.029> two<00:00:20.240> two<00:00:20.900> braces<00:00:21.200> here<00:00:21.650> and<00:00:21.980> these

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
we have two two braces here and these

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.640 
we have two two braces here and these
are<00:00:22.730> called<00:00:23.060> finger<00:00:23.570> braces<00:00:24.020> over<00:00:24.350> here

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
are called finger braces over here

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.589 
are called finger braces over here
they're<00:00:25.400> small<00:00:25.669> about<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:26.090> size<00:00:26.330> of<00:00:26.480> the

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
they're small about the size of the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.249 
they're small about the size of the
finger<00:00:26.990> and<00:00:27.259> these<00:00:28.220> braces<00:00:28.759> around<00:00:29.720> the

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
finger and these braces around the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.089 
finger and these braces around the
soundhole

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
soundhole

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.730 
soundhole
this<00:00:31.880> is<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.150> salmon<00:00:32.419> hole<00:00:32.720> these<00:00:33.560> are

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
this is the salmon hole these are

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.700 
this is the salmon hole these are
actually<00:00:34.040> called<00:00:34.250> flutter<00:00:34.610> bars<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:35.710> their

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
actually called flutter bars and their

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.580 
actually called flutter bars and their
function<00:00:37.250> is<00:00:38.090> to<00:00:38.540> reduce<00:00:38.900> the<00:00:39.230> amount<00:00:39.470> of

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
function is to reduce the amount of

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.490 
function is to reduce the amount of
flutter<00:00:40.300> when<00:00:41.300> air<00:00:41.510> passes<00:00:41.840> through<00:00:42.140> this

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
flutter when air passes through this

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.470 
flutter when air passes through this
sound<00:00:43.070> hole<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.820> guitar<00:00:44.150> is<00:00:44.240> being

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
sound hole and the guitar is being

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.830 
sound hole and the guitar is being
played<00:00:44.810> the<00:00:45.800> area<00:00:46.190> around<00:00:46.580> it<00:00:46.850> has<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:47.720> be

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
played the area around it has to be

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.510 
played the area around it has to be
reinforced<00:00:48.470> so<00:00:48.560> it<00:00:48.650> doesn't<00:00:49.010> flutter<00:00:49.310> and

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
reinforced so it doesn't flutter and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.180 
reinforced so it doesn't flutter and
actually<00:00:49.880> move<00:00:50.150> and<00:00:50.540> create<00:00:50.690> a<00:00:51.070> saddle<00:00:52.070> that

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
actually move and create a saddle that

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.420 
actually move and create a saddle that
takes<00:00:52.400> away<00:00:52.640> from<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.940> sound<00:00:53.120> of<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.360> guitar

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
takes away from the sound of the guitar

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.200 
takes away from the sound of the guitar
we're<00:00:55.430> going<00:00:55.550> to<00:00:55.610> talk<00:00:55.760> a<00:00:55.790> little<00:00:55.970> bit<00:00:56.120> about

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.080 
we're going to talk a little bit about
action<00:00:57.080> of<00:00:57.620> your<00:00:57.830> guitar<00:00:58.130> you<00:00:58.370> hear<00:00:58.550> that<00:00:58.670> term

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
action of your guitar you hear that term

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.090 
action of your guitar you hear that term
used<00:00:59.390> a<00:00:59.570> lot<00:01:00.100> high<00:01:01.100> action<00:01:01.670> low<00:01:01.940> action<00:01:02.480> and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
used a lot high action low action and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.390 
used a lot high action low action and
what<00:01:04.100> it<00:01:04.220> refers<00:01:04.549> to<00:01:04.580> is<00:01:05.380> the<00:01:06.380> height<00:01:06.979> of<00:01:07.280> the

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
what it refers to is the height of the

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.039 
what it refers to is the height of the
string<00:01:08.350> off<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.280> fingerboard<00:01:11.090> how<00:01:11.750> high<00:01:11.990> it

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
string off the fingerboard how high it

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.870 
string off the fingerboard how high it
is<00:01:12.350> or<00:01:12.619> how<00:01:12.740> how<00:01:13.070> close<00:01:13.369> it<00:01:13.579> is<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.850> the

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
is or how how close it is to the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.239 
is or how how close it is to the
fingerboard<00:01:14.329> we<00:01:15.200> can<00:01:15.409> push<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:15.799> strings<00:01:16.070> down

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:16.249 
fingerboard we can push the strings down

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:18.700 
fingerboard we can push the strings down
like<00:01:16.490> this<00:01:16.670> down<00:01:16.939> to<00:01:17.090> where<00:01:17.240> they<00:01:17.359> just<00:01:17.710> kind

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
like this down to where they just kind

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.370 
like this down to where they just kind
of<00:01:18.829> touch<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.280> fingerboard<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:20.380> this

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
of touch the fingerboard and this

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.399 
of touch the fingerboard and this
distance<00:01:21.920> between<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.939> bottom<00:01:23.810> side<00:01:24.200> of<00:01:24.350> the

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
distance between the bottom side of the

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.719 
distance between the bottom side of the
string<00:01:24.679> and<00:01:24.829> the<00:01:24.920> fingerboard<00:01:25.249> is<00:01:25.579> your

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
string and the fingerboard is your

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.959 
string and the fingerboard is your
action<00:01:26.119> height<00:01:26.950> I'll<00:01:27.950> exaggerate<00:01:28.340> here<00:01:28.789> if<00:01:28.880> I

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
action height I'll exaggerate here if I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:30.550 
action height I'll exaggerate here if I
lift<00:01:29.179> the<00:01:29.329> string<00:01:29.600> up<00:01:29.749> if<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.079> string<00:01:30.380> gets

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
lift the string up if the string gets

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.109 
lift the string up if the string gets
too<00:01:30.859> high<00:01:31.159> off<00:01:31.999> the<00:01:32.719> neck<00:01:33.700> it's<00:01:34.700> gonna<00:01:34.819> make<00:01:34.999> it

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
too high off the neck it's gonna make it

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.459 
too high off the neck it's gonna make it
hard<00:01:35.359> to<00:01:35.479> press<00:01:35.719> down<00:01:35.960> you're<00:01:36.170> gonna<00:01:36.289> have

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
hard to press down you're gonna have

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.219 
hard to press down you're gonna have
trouble<00:01:36.679> playing<00:01:37.130> your<00:01:37.340> guitar<00:01:37.990> you'll<00:01:38.990> feel

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
trouble playing your guitar you'll feel

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.809 
trouble playing your guitar you'll feel
like<00:01:39.409> you're<00:01:39.560> having<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.859> work<00:01:39.889> too<00:01:40.249> hard

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
like you're having to work too hard

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.789 
like you're having to work too hard
so<00:01:41.420> that<00:01:41.630> would<00:01:41.780> be<00:01:41.810> what<00:01:42.109> we<00:01:42.229> call<00:01:42.259> high

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
so that would be what we call high

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.559 
so that would be what we call high
action<00:01:43.569> the<00:01:44.569> other<00:01:44.780> end<00:01:45.049> of<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.979> range

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
action the other end of the of the range

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:49.359 
action the other end of the of the range
would<00:01:47.569> be<00:01:47.719> low<00:01:47.960> where<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.439> strings<00:01:48.770> are<00:01:48.979> very

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
would be low where the strings are very

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.840 
would be low where the strings are very
close<00:01:49.759> down<00:01:50.329> to<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.659> neck<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.670> problems<00:01:52.670> in

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
close down to the neck and problems in

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.050 
close down to the neck and problems in
that<00:01:52.909> area<00:01:53.359> might<00:01:53.840> include<00:01:54.139> buzzing<00:01:54.799> or

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
that area might include buzzing or

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.270 
that area might include buzzing or
rattling<00:01:56.060> or<00:01:56.359> if<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:57.289> fret<00:01:57.590> at<00:01:57.709> this<00:01:57.920> friend

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
rattling or if you fret at this friend

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.099 
rattling or if you fret at this friend
and<00:01:58.520> you're<00:01:58.850> really<00:01:59.149> hearing<00:01:59.389> the<00:01:59.509> note<00:01:59.780> above

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
and you're really hearing the note above

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:03.010 
and you're really hearing the note above
it<00:02:00.789> it<00:02:01.789> may<00:02:01.999> be<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:02.270> your<00:02:02.420> strings<00:02:02.719> are<00:02:02.810> too

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
it it may be that your strings are too

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.059 
it it may be that your strings are too
low<00:02:03.229> or<00:02:03.259> too<00:02:03.439> close<00:02:03.799> to<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.069> neck<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:05.889> this<00:02:06.889> is

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
low or too close to the neck and this is

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.880 
low or too close to the neck and this is
a<00:02:07.509> fairly<00:02:08.509> complex<00:02:09.350> dimension<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:11.090> has<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.510> do

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
a fairly complex dimension it has to do

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.199 
a fairly complex dimension it has to do
action<00:02:12.890> height<00:02:13.040> also<00:02:13.280> has<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.760> do<00:02:13.910> with<00:02:14.090> the

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
action height also has to do with the

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.820 
action height also has to do with the
contour<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.870> your<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:15.230> your<00:02:15.500> neck

contour of your of your neck

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.940 
contour of your of your neck
whether<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.370> neck<00:02:17.550> itself<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.120> straight<00:02:18.480> or

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
whether the neck itself is straight or

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.700 
whether the neck itself is straight or
whether<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.100> may<00:02:20.280> have<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.550> back<00:02:21.210> bow<00:02:21.570> or<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.560> may

so<00:02:26.640> these<00:02:27.600> factors<00:02:28.050> all<00:02:28.200> come<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.590> when<00:02:28.740> you're

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
so these factors all come in when you're

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.460 
so these factors all come in when you're
talking<00:02:29.280> about<00:02:29.340> action<00:02:29.940> height<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.450> one<00:02:31.230> way

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
talking about action height and one way

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.150 
talking about action height and one way
that<00:02:32.540> repairmen<00:02:33.540> use<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.440> anyone<00:02:34.950> can

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
that repairmen use and and anyone can

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.960 
that repairmen use and and anyone can
use<00:02:35.390> use<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.600> method<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:38.340> gauge<00:02:38.610> and

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
use use this method to to gauge and

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.640 
use use this method to to gauge and
measure<00:02:39.030> your<00:02:39.510> action<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.080> kind<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:40.410> get<00:02:40.560> an

have this little gauge here and what we

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.860 
have this little gauge here and what we
want<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.370> do<00:02:47.460> is<00:02:47.610> set<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:47.850> here<00:02:48.150> here's<00:02:48.690> our

12th fret you count out 12 from the nut

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.100 
12th fret you count out 12 from the nut
and<00:02:52.530> that's<00:02:53.040> our<00:02:53.250> halfway<00:02:53.460> point<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.510> at<00:02:54.840> that

bridge and the top if I can get it in

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.070 
bridge and the top if I can get it in
there<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:54.990> quarter<00:03:55.470> inch<00:03:55.680> or<00:03:56.010> more<00:03:56.840> that<00:03:57.840> means

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
there a quarter inch or more that means

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.370 
there a quarter inch or more that means
if<00:03:58.200> there's<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:59.160> much<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.580> an<00:03:59.700> opening

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
if there's a that much of an opening

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.230 
if there's a that much of an opening
then<00:04:01.380> I'm<00:04:01.740> probably<00:04:02.010> better<00:04:02.490> off<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.910> go<00:04:03.030> ahead

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
then I'm probably better off to go ahead

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.320 
then I'm probably better off to go ahead
and<00:04:03.360> remove<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.959> bridge<00:04:04.170> completely<00:04:05.330> clean
