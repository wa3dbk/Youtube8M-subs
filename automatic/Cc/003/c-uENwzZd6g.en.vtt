00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:05.689
 was 5 business days and apply the full dose of 5 milliliters of 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.030
 solve 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.689
 but possibilitum presumption of 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.689
 for every liter of water that is used 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:16.849
 after 15 to 20 days 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.180
 the seedlings will present at least these share ruts and one size 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.989
 Approximately five centimeters 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:25.320
 this tells us 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.580
 that we should review the first transplant 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.420
 the transplant 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.780
 To carry out the first transplant it is necessary to have the following 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.440
 materials 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.380
 a wooden container of 50 centimeters of the arch for 50 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.560
 centimeters wide and a height of 15 centimeters 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.660
 these indoor soy measures 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.090
 the container should be lined with black plastic and clubs 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.410
 a disposable syringe a whole measuring cup 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.380
 a technopor plate 48 centimeters wide by 48 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.810
 centimeters long and one half to one inch thick 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.480
 with perforations of the same point 5 centimeters in diameter and one 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.509
 distance of 3 5 centimeters between the holes 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.590
 sponge cubes 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.590
 of 1 points 5 centimeters per side 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.740
 a manual beater 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.740
 and some scissors 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.950
 The procedure 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.939
 to make the holes it is necessary to mark first on the iron 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.939
 tecnopor 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.430
 with a 1-point metal tube 5 centimeters in diameter previously 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.430
 heated perforations are made 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.910
 to the container previously formed 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.040
 in its previous edition and a liter of water 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.790
 lone &amp; co is added to 355 milliliters of submission and removed 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.149
 then 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.569
 62 militia of solution are added 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.359
 and if it comes back when removing 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.359
 a report 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.979
 the water level I do not agree is not new to all together five 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.400
 centimeters below the height of the container 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.229
 now 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.439
 then we see when placing the fire turn plant 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.499
 in the container 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:40.409
 then we made a busy half of the kun or cleared 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.929
 this will allow 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.929
 that the seedling that is caught in the middle of it 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.059
 to extract the seedlings your duty to water them
