okay<00:00:03.269> as<00:00:03.419> you<00:00:03.569> can<00:00:03.600> see<00:00:03.749> here<00:00:04.169> on<00:00:04.290> my<00:00:04.470> laptop<00:00:05.009> I

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
okay as you can see here on my laptop I

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.280 
okay as you can see here on my laptop I
have<00:00:05.850> mach3<00:00:06.390> running<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.470> have<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.670> XYZ<00:00:09.290> axis

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
have mach3 running I have the XYZ axis

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.350 
have mach3 running I have the XYZ axis
set<00:00:11.570> zero<00:00:12.570> doubt<00:00:13.219> its<00:00:14.219> current<00:00:14.580> position<00:00:14.730> and

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
set zero doubt its current position and

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.920 
set zero doubt its current position and
I'm<00:00:15.419> in<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.629> mode<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.260> just<00:00:16.710> be<00:00:16.890> able<00:00:17.010> to

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
I'm in a mode to just be able to

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.520 
I'm in a mode to just be able to
manually<00:00:18.930> enter<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.940> G<00:00:20.940> code<00:00:21.260> so<00:00:22.260> I'm<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.380> to

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 
manually enter in G code so I'm going to

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:31.940 
manually enter in G code so I'm going to
go<00:00:22.770> here<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:27.650> select<00:00:28.650> my<00:00:28.920> last<00:00:29.310> command<00:00:30.950> and

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
go here and select my last command and

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.910 
go here and select my last command and
whenever<00:00:32.699> I<00:00:32.940> do<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.620> send

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
whenever I do this it's going to send

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.829 
whenever I do this it's going to send
the<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.550> commands<00:00:35.910> out<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.359> the<00:00:36.480> smooth

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:36.839 
the the commands out to the smooth

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:41.090 
the the commands out to the smooth
supper<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.850> then<00:00:39.260> convert<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.710> parallel

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
supper and then convert that to parallel

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:54.520 
supper and then convert that to parallel
and<00:00:41.429> drive<00:00:41.789> my<00:00:42.059> stepper<00:00:42.839> motors

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.299 

so<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:55.769> you<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:55.980> see<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:57.079> USB<00:00:58.079> cable<00:00:58.309> coming

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
so here you can see the USB cable coming

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.100 
so here you can see the USB cable coming
into<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.170> jetta<00:01:01.170> smooth<00:01:01.469> pepper<00:01:02.930> this<00:01:03.930> is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
into the jetta smooth pepper this is

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.899 
into the jetta smooth pepper this is
where<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> signal<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.860> coming<00:01:05.040> from<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.729> gets

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
where the signal is coming from it gets

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.420 
where the signal is coming from it gets
converted<00:01:06.619> and<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:07.890> ran<00:01:08.700> off<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:09.119> port<00:01:09.720> one

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
converted and then ran off to port one

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.120 
converted and then ran off to port one
into<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.610> breakout<00:01:12.420> board<00:01:12.860> which<00:01:13.860> then

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
into this breakout board which then

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.080 
into this breakout board which then
basically<00:01:14.430> takes<00:01:14.880> each<00:01:15.149> pin<00:01:15.479> as<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:16.110> pulse<00:01:17.090> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
basically takes each pin as a pulse and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.570 
basically takes each pin as a pulse and
use<00:01:18.539> that<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.899> drive<00:01:19.350> my<00:01:19.649> stepper<00:01:20.280> motor

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
use that to drive my stepper motor

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.499 
use that to drive my stepper motor
drivers<00:01:21.180> got<00:01:22.050> a<00:01:22.110> fan<00:01:22.590> back<00:01:23.369> here<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.940> keep<00:01:24.360> it

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
drivers got a fan back here to keep it

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.669 
drivers got a fan back here to keep it
all<00:01:24.630> cool<00:01:24.929> got<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> power<00:01:26.250> supply<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.409> to<00:01:28.409> drive

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
all cool got a power supply to to drive

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.580 
all cool got a power supply to to drive
the<00:01:29.179> actual<00:01:30.179> steppers<00:01:30.679> got<00:01:31.679> a<00:01:31.710> 5<00:01:32.610> volt<00:01:32.640> supply

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
the actual steppers got a 5 volt supply

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.669 
the actual steppers got a 5 volt supply
that's<00:01:34.590> running<00:01:34.890> my<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:36.090> boards<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.810> also

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
that's running my my boards and also

00:01:37.679 --> 00:02:28.370 
that's running my my boards and also
running<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.220> logic<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.390> drivers

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.440
