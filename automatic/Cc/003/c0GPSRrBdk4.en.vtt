00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.610 
benefit from it first off I want to go
over<00:00:56.640> quick<00:00:57.030> scoping<00:00:57.420> now<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.379> everybody

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
over quick scoping now just so everybody

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.770 
over quick scoping now just so everybody
is<00:00:58.770> aware<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.579> sniper<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:00.449> every

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
is aware the sniper is just like every

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.740 
is aware the sniper is just like every
other<00:01:00.809> gun<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.530> fact<00:01:01.800> vet<00:01:02.160> when<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.000> ABS

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
other gun in the fact vet when you ABS

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.450 
other gun in the fact vet when you ABS
when<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.110> aim<00:01:04.260> down<00:01:04.290> sight<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.920> goes<00:01:05.070> directly

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
when you aim down sight it goes directly

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.429 
when you aim down sight it goes directly
to<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.790> center<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.090> your<00:01:06.210> hipfire<00:01:06.510> crosshairs

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
to the center of your hipfire crosshairs

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.800 
to the center of your hipfire crosshairs
so<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.729> only<00:01:08.850> difference<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.420> there's<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
so the only difference is that there's a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.940 
so the only difference is that there's a
scope<00:01:10.049> there<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.439> looks<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.680> little<00:01:10.799> bit

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
scope there so it looks a little bit

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.500 
scope there so it looks a little bit
different<00:01:11.280> once<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.580> understand<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.150> fact

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
different once you understand that fact

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.750 
different once you understand that fact
however<00:01:12.979> quickscoping<00:01:13.979> becomes<00:01:14.340> incredibly

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
however quickscoping becomes incredibly

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.870 
however quickscoping becomes incredibly
easy<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.630> my<00:01:15.990> opinion<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.470> course<00:01:16.580> now<00:01:17.580> what

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
easy in my opinion of course now what

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.609 
easy in my opinion of course now what
you<00:01:17.909> want<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.960> want<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.229> put<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
you want to do is you want to put the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.260 
you want to do is you want to put the
enemy<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.549> middle<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.909> your<00:01:21.060> hipfire

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
enemy in the middle of your hipfire

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.320 
enemy in the middle of your hipfire
crosshairs<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.259> once<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.979> do<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.159> aim<00:01:23.759> down

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
crosshairs and once you do that aim down

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.899 
crosshairs and once you do that aim down
sight<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.140> will<00:01:25.400> notice<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:26.759> your

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
sight and you will notice then your

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.090 
sight and you will notice then your

sniper crosshairs we'll be right on the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.950 
sniper crosshairs we'll be right on the
guy<00:01:29.189> because<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.729> match<00:01:29.909> them<00:01:30.119> up<00:01:30.270> first<00:01:30.630> with

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
guy because you match them up first with

your hipfire crossers my personal tip

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.560 
your hipfire crossers my personal tip
trick<00:01:33.900> for<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.560> actually<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:36.150> not<00:01:36.360> use

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
trick for that is actually to not use

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
trick for that is actually to not use
all<00:01:36.780> four<00:01:37.110> hipfire<00:01:37.500> crosshairs<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.040> use<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
all four hipfire crosshairs but use the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.760 
all four hipfire crosshairs but use the
top<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> bottom<00:01:38.939> one<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.470> enemy

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
top and the bottom one and if the enemy

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.069 
top and the bottom one and if the enemy
is<00:01:40.799> right<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.250> middle<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.670> basically

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
is right in the middle you can basically

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.510 
is right in the middle you can basically
imagine<00:01:43.079> imagine<00:01:43.770> drawing<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.100> line<00:01:44.189> from<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
imagine imagine drawing a line from the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940 
imagine imagine drawing a line from the
top<00:01:44.549> crosshair<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> bottom<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> if

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
top crosshair to the bottom one and if

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.560 
top crosshair to the bottom one and if
you<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.430> kind<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.850> draw<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> line<00:01:48.360> right

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you can kind of like draw a line right

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.280 
you can kind of like draw a line right
right<00:01:49.530> um<00:01:50.060> down<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.210> center<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.990> enemy

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
right um down the center of the enemy

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.679 
right um down the center of the enemy
then<00:01:53.009> when<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.880> scope<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.360> should<00:01:54.450> have<00:01:54.659> a

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
then when you scope in you should have a

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.139 
then when you scope in you should have a
perfect<00:01:55.079> shot<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.380> him<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:56.460> that's<00:01:56.700> my<00:01:56.909> tips

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
perfect shot on him so that's my tips

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.429 
perfect shot on him so that's my tips
for<00:01:57.329> kind<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.540> quick<00:01:57.659> scoping<00:01:57.899> stuff<00:01:58.229> now

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
for kind of quick scoping stuff now

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.780 
for kind of quick scoping stuff now
we're<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.740> get<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> most<00:01:59.310> effective

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
we're going to get to the most effective

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.550 
we're going to get to the most effective
form<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.119> quick<00:02:00.390> scoping<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.810> my<00:02:00.930> opinion<00:02:01.290> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
form of quick scoping in my opinion and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.310 
form of quick scoping in my opinion and
that<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> drag<00:02:02.549> scope<00:02:02.960> basically<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.079> drag

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
that is the drag scope basically to drag

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.510 
that is the drag scope basically to drag
scope<00:02:04.500> you're<00:02:04.710> going<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.890> take<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.280> cross

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
scope you're going to take you cross

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.760 
scope you're going to take you cross
hairs<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.000> you're<00:02:06.719> kind<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.049> going<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.350> slice

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
hairs and you're kind of going to slice

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.229 
hairs and you're kind of going to slice
the<00:02:08.009> enemy<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.340> half<00:02:08.489> with<00:02:08.700> your<00:02:08.819> crosshairs

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
the enemy in half with your crosshairs

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.570 
the enemy in half with your crosshairs
and<00:02:09.390> once<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.110> see<00:02:10.319> him<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:11.129> your<00:02:11.340> scope

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
and once you see him on in your scope

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.400 
and once you see him on in your scope
you're<00:02:11.790> gonna<00:02:11.879> just

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
you're gonna just

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.980 
you're gonna just
fire<00:02:12.560> shot<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:14.240> kind<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.600> takes<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.840> little

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
fire shot and it kind of takes a little

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.470 
fire shot and it kind of takes a little
bit<00:02:15.110> more<00:02:15.290> timing<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.070> you<00:02:16.970> get<00:02:17.150> used<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.420> it

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
bit more timing and you get used to it

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.150 
bit more timing and you get used to it
over<00:02:17.630> time<00:02:17.780> but<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.230> me<00:02:18.350> once<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.710> get<00:02:18.920> used<00:02:19.100> to

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
over time but to me once you get used to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.880 
over time but to me once you get used to
it<00:02:19.250> it's<00:02:19.430> by<00:02:19.670> far<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.360> most<00:02:21.050> effective<00:02:21.740> way<00:02:21.860> to

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
it it's by far the most effective way to

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.770 
it it's by far the most effective way to
quickscope<00:02:22.490> because<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.240> don't<00:02:23.390> have<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.630> be

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
quickscope because you don't have to be

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.360 
quickscope because you don't have to be
you<00:02:24.050> don't<00:02:24.200> have<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.410> have<00:02:24.470> dead<00:02:24.800> on<00:02:24.920> accuracy

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
you don't have to have dead on accuracy

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.250 
you don't have to have dead on accuracy
every<00:02:25.760> time<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.390> can<00:02:26.540> be<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.690> little<00:02:26.930> bit<00:02:27.050> off

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
every time you can be a little bit off

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.810 
every time you can be a little bit off
and<00:02:27.530> just<00:02:27.890> kind<00:02:28.100> of<00:02:28.160> adjust<00:02:28.490> your<00:02:28.610> sháá<00:02:28.790> a

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
and just kind of adjust your sháá a

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.060 
and just kind of adjust your sháá a
little<00:02:29.120> bit<00:02:29.240> with<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.510> drag<00:02:29.750> scope<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.230> bam

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
little bit with the drag scope and bam

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.790 
little bit with the drag scope and bam
you<00:02:31.310> got<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.640> enemy<00:02:32.170> it's<00:02:33.170> my<00:02:33.380> personal

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
you got the enemy it's my personal

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.080 
you got the enemy it's my personal
favorite<00:02:34.100> way<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.220> do<00:02:34.460> it<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:34.700> once<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:34.940> learn

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
favorite way to do it and once you learn

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.610 
favorite way to do it and once you learn
how<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.210> do<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.540> it's<00:02:36.050> definitely<00:02:36.500> very

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
how to do it it's definitely very

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.470 
how to do it it's definitely very
effective<00:02:37.160> as<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.730> can<00:02:37.850> see<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.030> picked<00:02:38.300> up<00:02:38.360> a

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
effective as you can see I picked up a

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.990 
effective as you can see I picked up a
predator<00:02:38.840> missile<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.560> MOAB<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.520> Emma<00:02:40.820> way

BMO<00:02:41.210> I'm<00:02:41.720> still<00:02:42.260> not<00:02:42.380> entirely<00:02:42.680> sure<00:02:42.890> how<00:02:43.520> you

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
BMO I'm still not entirely sure how you

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.220 
BMO I'm still not entirely sure how you
guys<00:02:43.880> want<00:02:44.150> me<00:02:44.240> to<00:02:44.270> pronounce<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.900> but

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
guys want me to pronounce that but

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.830 
guys want me to pronounce that but
either<00:02:45.740> way<00:02:46.010> drag<00:02:46.340> scopes<00:02:46.670> are<00:02:46.910> by<00:02:47.120> far<00:02:47.390> the

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
either way drag scopes are by far the

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.230 
either way drag scopes are by far the
most<00:02:47.990> effective<00:02:48.440> way<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.860> quickscope<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:50.030> once

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
most effective way to quickscope so once

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.580 
most effective way to quickscope so once
again<00:02:50.330> you<00:02:50.570> just<00:02:50.600> take<00:02:50.900> your<00:02:51.020> crosshairs<00:02:51.500> and

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
again you just take your crosshairs and

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.530 
again you just take your crosshairs and
kind<00:02:52.160> of<00:02:52.310> slice<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.730> guy<00:02:52.880> in<00:02:53.000> half<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.300> used<00:02:53.480> to

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
kind of slice the guy in half I used to

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.750 
kind of slice the guy in half I used to
call<00:02:53.690> him<00:02:53.840> mom<00:02:54.100> what<00:02:55.100> I<00:02:55.130> used<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.400> call<00:02:55.490> them

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
call him mom what I used to call them

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.720 
call him mom what I used to call them
its<00:02:56.510> sword<00:02:57.380> scopes<00:02:57.800> is<00:02:58.070> what<00:02:58.250> i<00:02:58.280> call<00:02:58.580> it

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
its sword scopes is what i call it

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.920 
its sword scopes is what i call it
because<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:58.970> didn't<00:02:59.180> know<00:02:59.270> what<00:02:59.390> Jags<00:02:59.660> grip<00:02:59.810> was

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
because I didn't know what Jags grip was

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.840 
because I didn't know what Jags grip was
I<00:03:00.080> was<00:03:00.170> like<00:03:00.260> it's<00:03:00.410> like<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.560> samurai<00:03:00.830> sword<00:03:01.040> so

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
I was like it's like a samurai sword so

get regular recoil so you recoil
actually<00:03:26.540> it<00:03:26.750> really<00:03:27.170> depends<00:03:27.680> on<00:03:27.770> your

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
actually it really depends on your

this clip when I'm laying down there's

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.510 
this clip when I'm laying down there's
hardly<00:03:40.790> no<00:03:41.030> recoil<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.750> i'm<00:03:42.260> using<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.220> Baron

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520

hardly no recoil and i'm using the Baron
which<00:03:43.730> has<00:03:43.910> a<00:03:44.120> massive<00:03:44.600> amount<00:03:44.840> of<00:03:44.900> recoil<00:03:45.050> so

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
which has a massive amount of recoil so

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.560 
which has a massive amount of recoil so
you<00:03:45.440> know<00:03:45.620> that<00:03:45.800> laying<00:03:46.010> prone<00:03:46.400> helps<00:03:47.270> a<00:03:47.390> lot

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570
