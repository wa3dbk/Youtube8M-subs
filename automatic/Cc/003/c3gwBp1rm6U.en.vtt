00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.540
 hello today I'm going to talk about frankenstein's 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.070
 Mary Shelley is from my parents I suppose 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.470
 because he has been in my house for 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.420
 a lot of time and finally I read it and I liked it 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.730
 this cover because if they are fixed I do not know if 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.710
 you get to see someone ran him over with 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.019
 pen and opens reminded me a little 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.900
 due to wii I laugh a lot and finally 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.489
 I read it in this vacation the idea that 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.159
 I had frankenstein is very 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:27.589
 different to the original material in mind 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:29.390
 something created by the 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.789
 pop culture and the references that had 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.730
 seen on television or in books 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.910
 for example the monster the creature that 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.940
 does vÃ­ctor frankenstein in my mind was 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.640
 like a zombie armed in pieces with 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.829
 corpses of people who did not speak 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.559
 and nothing else was like 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.539
 but it does not turn out that he talks and talks very 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.699
 well speaks in fact with a Spanish 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:56.120
 because I read in translation with a 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.390
 Spanish very own formal and correct 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.159
 the author wrote book in 1818 she is 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.780
 English also that's why I had many 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.000
 eager to read this book because there 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.039
 few scriptures within the canon and it 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.170
 Lee is one of them last semester 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:12.259
 that I had the literature class of 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.210
 19th century was not on the book list 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.070
 to read and I was eager to read it 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.039
 this book is published within the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.470
 romantic and gothic current indeed 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.659
 has many elements that he saw and said 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.899
 um this was good in class and I felt so 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.690
 I already the book begins to be narrated by 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.459
 a character named Robert Walton in 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.789
 some letters that he writes to his sister 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:37.039
 he is on an expedition on a ship in 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.679
 Northern Europe writes to certain 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.030
 things of his exploration as the 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.369
 setbacks that is having 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.080
 and things like that the case is that this man 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.600
 while it is in the pole collects 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.190
 to a person who is lying on 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.950
 an ice floe that turns out to be 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.840
 Viktor Frankenstein spend a few days 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.900
 we now instead of reading the letters 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.870
 from walton we read his diary and discovered 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.400
 that frankenstein tells him his story 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.740
 and the story is now narrated by 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.080
 literal frankenstein is your life from 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.590
 Chiquito is the largest of his family 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.600
 he lived in switzerland he has a sister 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.340
 adopted her with him from 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.010
 little boy then he has one more brother 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.290
 boy his mom dies he's going to 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.540
 study at the university and you are interested 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.180
 a lot of medicine and chemistry is in the 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.010
 university that starts doing 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.440
 investigations to be able to bring to the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.440
 life inanimate objects become obsessed with 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.740
 this idea stops writing to his family 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.440
 stop coming out stop sleeping and finally 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:43.000
 he creates his monster and he gets scared because 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.080
 end he falls 20 of his work 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.130
 of the unnatural that you just created 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.740
 apart from the fact that the monster is frightening 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.050
 then he flees and repents 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.430
 very much from that moment on he has 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.930
 to live with the consequences of having 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.670
 created the monster and that the monster 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.860
 it escapes him because that night he does not sleep 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.780
 him in his room and when the 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.940
 monster is no longer there later 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.610
 you start to get news of their 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.950
 family bad news realizes 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.990
 that the monster is in some way 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.900
 revenging himself on him later he finds himself 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.080
 with the monster in some mountains and now 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.330
 the narration passes to the version of the 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.459
 monster of what has happened since the 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.080
 moment when he escaped from the room 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.790
 when they created it and it made me super 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.880
 interesting because the real monster 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.860
 he is very aware of everything that happens 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.780
 learn to speak learn to read and that 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.480
 part of the story I really liked everything 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.770
 the book is a story that is going 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.930
 doing deeper and deeper and 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.459
 deeper and at the end of that you 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.050
 tell the story of the monster returns 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.910
 to go out to frankenstein and again and 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.160
 ends with the explorer prover walton 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.430
 how it started when the monster was 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.340
 find with franks 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.260
 asks him to make her a partner because 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.269
 this is one thing that I did not know I thought 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.400
 that the monster really was like a 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.469
 zombie malilla that killed people but not 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.920
 is what you want is the company of the 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:03.319
 human beings and that they include it and have a 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.239
 relationship with someone else but as the 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.950
 humans are very ignorant not even 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.689
 they stop to talk to him and 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.150
 they just get really scared by 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.219
 just see it metaphors metaphors metaphors 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.000
 then he asks frankenstein to believe 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:19.280
 another being like the woman so that they 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.419
 two can get away from civilization and 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.270
 be happy 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.560
 frank that are in the beginning accept 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.599
 believing that this is going to get rid of him 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.599
 and he will be able to live happily and get married 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:32.330
 with his adoptive sister but then he 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:34.070
 He pulled back and does not finish his project 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.110
 then more loved ones of 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.300
 frankenstein die swearing to rest 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.889
 until you have killed the monster but something 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.550
 happens in the expedition that leads 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.470
 walton and they have to come back it's the book 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.630
 has gothic and romantic elements 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.139
 like for example the ideal of the woman 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.460
 pure frankenstein's girlfriend also the 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.490
 scenario matches 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.430
 in the mental state of the protagonist is 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.050
 Very recurring night as a stage 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.810
 the storms 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.449
 the character is almost always depressed 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.370
 and melancholic in this tendency to 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.380
 abyss that is common among the characters 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.229
 of romanticism some scenarios 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.110
 where the actions of the book happen are 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:18.770
 cemeteries or mountains crags huts 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.500
 remote islands and something very important is 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.560
 that although it was written in 1818 action 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.300
 is set in the past and good that 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.580
 It is for items in which I noticed 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.990
 in the book I really liked this month not 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.699
 have read any book written by a 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.139
 woman I think this is a good 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.139
 recommendation bye
