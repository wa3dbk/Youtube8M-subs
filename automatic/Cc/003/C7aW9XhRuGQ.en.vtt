00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
definitely works for me I don't think I

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.860

mentioned<00:03:06.489> down<00:03:06.790> here<00:03:07.000> actually<00:03:07.120> but<00:03:07.570> I

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
mentioned down here actually but I

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.229 
mentioned down here actually but I
actually<00:03:08.260> have<00:03:08.560> um<00:03:08.890> just<00:03:09.220> skirts<00:03:09.610> hanging<00:03:10.090> up

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
actually have um just skirts hanging up

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.350 
actually have um just skirts hanging up
and<00:03:10.480> then<00:03:10.720> jeans<00:03:11.110> but<00:03:12.100> with<00:03:12.220> my<00:03:12.400> jeans<00:03:12.760> I<00:03:13.120> like

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
and then jeans but with my jeans I like

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.229 
and then jeans but with my jeans I like
to<00:03:13.800> double<00:03:14.800> hang<00:03:15.250> them<00:03:15.459> just<00:03:15.790> because<00:03:15.940> it

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
to double hang them just because it

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.500 
to double hang them just because it
saves<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.720> lot<00:03:16.750> of<00:03:16.959> space<00:03:17.730> which<00:03:18.730> I'm<00:03:18.940> into

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
saves a lot of space which I'm into

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.380 
saves a lot of space which I'm into
because<00:03:19.989> I<00:03:20.370> mean<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.400> already<00:03:21.730> had<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:22.000> add<00:03:22.150> this

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
because I mean I already had to add this

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.600 
because I mean I already had to add this
bar<00:03:22.690> down<00:03:22.930> here<00:03:22.959> so<00:03:23.440> I<00:03:23.470> can't<00:03:23.799> imagine<00:03:23.890> life

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
bar down here so I can't imagine life

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.970 
bar down here so I can't imagine life
without<00:03:24.820> that<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:27.010> again<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.250> hope<00:03:27.459> y'all<00:03:27.730> enjoy
