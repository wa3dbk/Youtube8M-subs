00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.190
 good to all welcome to a new 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.540
 video and this time we come with the second 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.760
 episode already of players to try 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.840
 those players because I think these 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.400
 are pure predictions the truth that the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.410
 game is true did not leave the web not 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.109
 it came out of the game but by my sheer 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.970
 experience is pure prediction always 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.070
 had to calculate or see from those 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.000
 players who are quite arrived or 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.769
 It looks like they're going to be pretty 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.060
 sitting or those silvers that also 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.060
 There are enough silvers to make 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.470
 Well, to tell you that if they are going to rise 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.410
 price when I go I am the game after 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.570
 of the after the web and well then 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.880
 here we are with them I have some 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.740
 how many about 80 2 this time I'm going to talk 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.750
 of the barclays and well we go there with 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.540
 some of us have good midfield 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.120
 I always had a pretty picture 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.310
 quite complete very little used yes 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.020
 that a height 81 of 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.820
 physical this year will be 5 rhythm and the 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.790
 jester pretty pretty good years for 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.530
 use it other players that I have not put 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.260
 have because they are pretty similar they are 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.650
 uncle, it's also pretty cold 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.400
 but it 's okay 91 and we also have to 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.320
 leroy fer I think I've already been and uncle 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.970
 that only the three magistrates are going to be 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 in the issa brand at the beginning but now 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.630
 that was when I saw because it's my 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.280
 favorite in this position because it's very 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.080
 very complete others because they have more 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.390
 defense or have more attacks but already 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.000
 wine comes all in addition 80 of Dublin and 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.640
 very very high 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.530
 then we have matt jarvis 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.660
 whenever I've tried it on all 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.150
 days I loved it pretty fast 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.070
 quite agile if you do not have much physical 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.810
 not much happened either but it is 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.780
 quite pretty fast and for those 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.160
 first matches for those first 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.350
 equipment gives because tenders will go 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.580
 pretty good to me I always say good 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.710
 and I think that to be the most used 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.200
 when we start making our teams 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.990
 We are already with the silvers that today I am going to 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.870
 bring is pretty silver we also have 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.670
 to the first jeffery montero another of the 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.470
 that interests in four of regata and 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.820
 four bad leg last year was 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.160
 gold and we're right this year is 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.540
 left end and silver plus in 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.709
 the barclays another of which I believe that 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.380
 they're going to do quite everything here in the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.290
 78 silver team of Dublin 88 rhythm 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.850
 very very very good looking this one leads are 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.209
 monteros players that must be scored 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.100
 yes or yes then we have here the surprise 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.720
 the surprise this is going to be quite 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.030
 quite expensive I calculate that it will be 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.340
 very expensive this player 5 difficult to more 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.010
 Barclays silver is half left 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.230
 oussama assaidi 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.190
 Ecuador 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.750
 very much quality has always been 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.299
 I've loved gold and this year it's going to be 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.799
 pirate or is going to be very very very coveted 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.560
 by all besides look at what you're up to 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.319
 make shot rhythm 8370 plates 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.450
 brutal is very good looking to another player 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.660
 to take into account very very much in mind this 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.900
 oil then we have close friends gave 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.790
 forward as always 88 of pace 81 of 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.890
 physical and 70 shooting grass is silver is 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.510
 brutal brutal for a silver or all the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.239
 players very much to keep in mind this 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.760
 full then we have scott sinclair other 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.280
 that changes from being silver gold and very 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.280
 good statistics 80 of 10,000 88 of 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.140
 very very good rhythm paints this one 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.609
 sinclair also without many means 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.099
 interesting good left this year 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.690
 the barclays that you have to sign up and 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.980
 then left side we change from 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.340
 half and who goes left side 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.340
 banana 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:38.099
 in the comments if I'm wrong you know 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.780
 if it is signed or ordered here in the 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.129
 sunderland but a player too 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.420
 pretty smart I think it's going to 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.209
 be the most expensive left side of the 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.650
 silver barclays and other player 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.480
 quite good enough to sign up this 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.709
 patrick van aanholt then we have another 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.510
 the other of which will be also 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.500
 quite quite used at the beginning 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.870
 of the game nasa the mythical right lateral 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.000
 with good rhythm good dribling good pass 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.700
 good defense and good physical all 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.620
 pretty pretty even and I think that 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.989
 It will also be made very cheap and 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.380
 first think arnautovic if a player 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.459
 wants to change the band so it's going to 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.590
 like it much more than last year and 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.299
 which is right leg and they're going 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.680
 left also you do not know yet if 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.739
 will keep those four stars from 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.430
 watermarks and can be quite pretty 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:27.350
 powerful this framework arnautovic very good 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.350
 pint 82 of rhythm 80 dribbling 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.760
 and physical 574 also measures 199 which is a 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.320
 burrada in 92 so painted this frame 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.720
 Arnautovic does not tip me 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.490
 toys and I can buy it but 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.140
 only at the beginning the game since this 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.700
 has been my favorite player this 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.610
 team 13 that was a beast in front of the 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.740
 center then we have glen johnson other 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.020
 that I think will be cheap 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.630
 77 average that is pretty little or a rhythm 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.540
 acceptable 79 is us from pass 75 of 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.060
 defense 74 the fairly regular physicist and 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.800
 an 82 that is nothing wrong 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.960
 I think it's going to be the bright 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.060
 who can we deal with good and I 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.950
 I think it's going to be among the first of the 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.380
 most used of which are to begin 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.840
 and we finish with nacho monreal lateral 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.460
 left of the arsenal what else also 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.680
 which is pretty good enough for 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.980
 start 71 of passes where those of physicists 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.140
 64 of defense 38 of rhythm then also 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.910
 this is quite balanced this has 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.080
 been the barclays the players that I 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.430
 I think that they will be more than all the 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.870
 barclays can also put me the 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.100
 comments more players the base is that 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.350
 you think they're going to be sitting 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.880
 can be expensive more brands of the brand 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.500
 and also say in the 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.080
 comments of who links who 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.760
 I do the next episode and also 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.380
 If you want me to bring you those equipment 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.570
 to start before the game comes out 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.160
 and so on so that you have a 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.920
 idea 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.210
 Something you get an idea of ​​what I 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.850
 I think they will be the best in each 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.170
 put to start the teams 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.670
 totally cheap are equipment for 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.090
 start and nothing I hope you have 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.040
 liked 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.040
 and here I say goodbye bye
