then no I'm a big callus myth that's

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.270 
then no I'm a big callus myth that's
a--that's<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.860> myth

a--that's a myth

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.140 
a--that's a myth
okay<00:01:02.619> we're<00:01:03.619> trying<00:01:03.739> to<00:01:03.920> dispel<00:01:04.369> okay<00:01:04.790> and

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
okay we're trying to dispel okay and

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.120 
okay we're trying to dispel okay and
this<00:01:05.299> is<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.510> reason<00:01:05.780> why<00:01:06.110> you<00:01:06.740> notice<00:01:06.950> how<00:01:07.070> we

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
this is the reason why you notice how we

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.800 
this is the reason why you notice how we
grow<00:01:07.430> here<00:01:07.460> we<00:01:07.760> have<00:01:07.970> these<00:01:08.119> trays<00:01:08.479> here

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
grow here we have these trays here

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.530 
grow here we have these trays here
they're<00:01:09.020> 10<00:01:09.200> 20<00:01:09.500> no<00:01:09.590> whole<00:01:09.770> trays<00:01:10.070> are<00:01:10.280> called

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
they're 10 20 no whole trays are called

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.410 
they're 10 20 no whole trays are called
mystery<00:01:11.540> it's<00:01:12.320> 10<00:01:12.560> inches<00:01:12.799> by<00:01:13.610> 20<00:01:14.000> inches<00:01:14.920> and

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
mystery it's 10 inches by 20 inches and

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.780 
mystery it's 10 inches by 20 inches and
we<00:01:17.420> do<00:01:17.570> is<00:01:17.720> we<00:01:17.840> have<00:01:18.020> our<00:01:18.049> possible<00:01:18.740> perlite<00:01:19.220> in

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
we do is we have our possible perlite in

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.810 
we do is we have our possible perlite in
it<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:21.320> they're<00:01:21.530> just<00:01:21.680> sitting<00:01:22.009> in<00:01:22.220> this

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
it and they're just sitting in this

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
it and they're just sitting in this
nutrient<00:01:23.299> solution<00:01:26.049> the<00:01:28.780> plant<00:01:29.780> when<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.470> is

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
nutrient solution the plant when it is

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.250 
nutrient solution the plant when it is
is<00:01:32.840> growing<00:01:33.140> here<00:01:33.500> will<00:01:34.190> as<00:01:34.640> a<00:01:34.670> part<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.260> the

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
is growing here will as a part of the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.120 
is growing here will as a part of the
krebs<00:01:36.530> cycle<00:01:36.590> or<00:01:37.180> photosynthesis<00:01:38.980> one<00:01:39.980> of<00:01:40.070> the

krebs cycle or photosynthesis one of the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.160 
krebs cycle or photosynthesis one of the
byproducts<00:01:40.580> is<00:01:40.700> citric<00:01:41.270> acid<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:41.960> will

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
byproducts is citric acid and will

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.070 
byproducts is citric acid and will
produce<00:01:42.409> citric<00:01:42.860> acid<00:01:43.300> extrude<00:01:44.300> extrude<00:01:44.690> it

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
produce citric acid extrude extrude it

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.020 
produce citric acid extrude extrude it
and<00:01:45.200> store<00:01:45.470> it<00:01:45.530> at<00:01:45.680> its<00:01:45.830> roots<00:01:46.070> now<00:01:46.580> we<00:01:46.640> have

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
and store it at its roots now we have

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.460 
and store it at its roots now we have
this<00:01:47.150> but<00:01:47.330> they<00:01:47.390> call<00:01:47.510> static<00:01:47.930> system<00:01:48.229> here

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
this but they call static system here

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.670 
this but they call static system here
that<00:01:49.210> citric<00:01:50.210> acid<00:01:50.510> will<00:01:50.659> stay<00:01:50.870> there<00:01:51.110> okay

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
that citric acid will stay there okay

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.290 
that citric acid will stay there okay
and<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:52.190> lot<00:01:52.370> of<00:01:52.400> other<00:01:52.580> systems<00:01:52.820> hydronic

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
and a lot of other systems hydronic

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.969 
and a lot of other systems hydronic
systems<00:01:53.420> they<00:01:53.930> have<00:01:53.960> flow-through<00:01:54.590> systems

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
systems they have flow-through systems

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.740 
systems they have flow-through systems
that<00:01:55.340> citric<00:01:55.729> acid<00:01:56.000> gets<00:01:56.210> washed<00:01:56.479> away

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
that citric acid gets washed away

getting ready to spread its seed you'll
start<00:02:23.120> drawing<00:02:23.840> up<00:02:23.959> that<00:02:24.140> citric<00:02:24.470> acid<00:02:24.920> from

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
start drawing up that citric acid from

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.640 
start drawing up that citric acid from
the<00:02:25.489> root<00:02:26.030> area<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.569> it'll<00:02:26.959> start<00:02:27.290> extracting

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
the root area and it'll start extracting

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.009 
the root area and it'll start extracting
the<00:02:28.069> sugar<00:02:28.549> from<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:28.879> leaves<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.540> injected

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
the sugar from the leaves and injected

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.619 
the sugar from the leaves and injected
into<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.319> tomato<00:02:30.560> okay

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
into the tomato okay

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.970 
into the tomato okay
15<00:02:32.629> keep<00:02:32.840> in<00:02:32.930> mind<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.200> 50<00:02:33.530> percent<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.890> your

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
15 keep in mind that 50 percent of your

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.760 
15 keep in mind that 50 percent of your
tomato<00:02:34.160> flavor<00:02:34.459> comes<00:02:34.700> in<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:34.910> very<00:02:34.990> last<00:02:35.990> day

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
tomato flavor comes in the very last day

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.730 
tomato flavor comes in the very last day
of<00:02:37.099> ripen<00:02:37.670> okay

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
of ripen okay

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.070 
of ripen okay
when<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.040> flush<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:39.700> through<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:42.900> right<00:02:43.930> it

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
when you flush it through the right it

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.170 
when you flush it through the right it
doesn't<00:02:44.380> yeah<00:02:44.590> when<00:02:45.490> we<00:02:45.610> have<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.850> static

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
doesn't yeah when we have the static

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.780 
doesn't yeah when we have the static
system<00:02:46.480> that's<00:02:47.080> mimics<00:02:47.770> more<00:02:48.070> of<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.370> natural

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
system that's mimics more of the natural

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.650 
system that's mimics more of the natural
process<00:02:49.330> okay<00:02:49.750> okay<00:02:50.500> so<00:02:51.420> tomatoes<00:02:52.420> are<00:02:52.540> like

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
process okay okay so tomatoes are like

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.030 
process okay okay so tomatoes are like
that<00:02:52.870> oranges<00:02:54.210> strawberries<00:02:55.860> pineapples

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
that oranges strawberries pineapples

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.100 
that oranges strawberries pineapples
pineapple<00:02:58.150> yeah<00:02:58.240> pineapple<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.780> same<00:02:58.960> way

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
pineapple yeah pineapple is the same way

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.380 
pineapple yeah pineapple is the same way
if<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.770> take<00:03:00.190> them<00:03:00.340> off<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.700> plant<00:03:00.940> separate

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
if you take them off the plant separate

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.320 
if you take them off the plant separate
over<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.630> plant<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.590> can't<00:03:03.070> draw<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:03.970> flavor

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
over the plant it can't draw that flavor

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.580 
over the plant it can't draw that flavor
from<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.750> rest<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:04.960> the<00:03:05.050> planet

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
from the rest of the planet

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.560 
from the rest of the planet
what's<00:03:06.130> it<00:03:06.220> separated<00:03:06.610> you're<00:03:06.760> done<00:03:12.570> you

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
what's it separated you're done you

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.560 
what's it separated you're done you
won't<00:03:13.690> get<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:13.990> you<00:03:14.260> won't<00:03:14.440> get<00:03:14.530> that

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.120 

they're<00:03:19.570> a<00:03:19.600> green<00:03:20.170> tomato<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.740> just<00:03:20.920> turned

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
they're a green tomato that just turned

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.030 
they're a green tomato that just turned
red<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.610> that's<00:03:21.760> two<00:03:21.940> different<00:03:22.270> things

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
red and that's two different things

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.520 
red and that's two different things
plants<00:03:24.040> naturally<00:03:24.460> emit<00:03:24.670> ethylene<00:03:25.060> ethylene

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
plants naturally emit ethylene ethylene

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.840 
plants naturally emit ethylene ethylene
will<00:03:26.530> turn<00:03:26.860> this<00:03:27.100> tomato<00:03:27.280> red<00:03:27.580> and<00:03:27.730> that's

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
will turn this tomato red and that's

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.670 
will turn this tomato red and that's
what<00:03:27.970> they<00:03:28.060> usually<00:03:28.180> do<00:03:28.480> with<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:28.750> they'll<00:03:29.290> fill

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
what they usually do with a they'll fill

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.600 
what they usually do with a they'll fill
up<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:30.390> trailer<00:03:31.470> semi-trailer<00:03:32.470> with<00:03:33.160> tomatoes

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
up a trailer semi-trailer with tomatoes

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.630 
up a trailer semi-trailer with tomatoes
and<00:03:33.850> then<00:03:34.260> gas<00:03:35.260> them<00:03:35.590> they<00:03:36.250> can<00:03:36.370> do<00:03:36.460> it<00:03:36.520> that

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
and then gas them they can do it that

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.080 
and then gas them they can do it that
way<00:03:36.820> or<00:03:36.970> in<00:03:37.090> another<00:03:37.330> room<00:03:37.570> but<00:03:38.080> definitely<00:03:39.090> it

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
way or in another room but definitely it

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.510 
way or in another room but definitely it
turns<00:03:40.300> red<00:03:40.510> it's<00:03:40.810> got<00:03:40.930> nothing<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.230> do<00:03:41.320> with

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
turns red it's got nothing to do with

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.470 
turns red it's got nothing to do with
well<00:03:42.520> the<00:03:42.580> trike<00:03:42.790> Rinna<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.750> when<00:03:44.380> we<00:03:44.530> first

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
well the trike Rinna and I when we first

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.690 
well the trike Rinna and I when we first
started<00:03:46.800> selling<00:03:47.800> this<00:03:47.950> stuff<00:03:48.010> we<00:03:48.370> did<00:03:48.550> a<00:03:48.580> lot

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
started selling this stuff we did a lot

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.670 
started selling this stuff we did a lot
of<00:03:48.730> marketing<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.240> I<00:03:50.110> came<00:03:50.320> up<00:03:50.470> with<00:03:50.500> the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
of marketing and I came up with the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.010 
of marketing and I came up with the
analogy<00:03:51.070> that<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.670> know<00:03:52.240> everyone<00:03:52.750> seems<00:03:52.960> to

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
analogy that you know everyone seems to

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.420 
analogy that you know everyone seems to
understand<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:53.980> think<00:03:54.130> a<00:03:54.190> real<00:03:54.310> good

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
understand and I think a real good

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.070 
understand and I think a real good
example<00:03:54.520> we<00:03:55.060> have<00:03:55.210> we<00:03:55.300> do<00:03:55.420> have<00:03:55.570> some<00:03:55.750> tourists

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
example we have we do have some tourists

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.680 
example we have we do have some tourists
through<00:03:56.200> here<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:57.180> people<00:03:58.180> from<00:03:58.510> all

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
through here and people from all

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.410 
through here and people from all
international<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:00.790> I<00:04:00.880> kind<00:04:01.060> of<00:04:01.090> joke<00:04:01.270> that's

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
international and I kind of joke that's

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.870 
international and I kind of joke that's
intergalactic<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:03.100> they<00:04:03.220> understand<00:04:03.730> this

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
intergalactic that they understand this

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.720 
intergalactic that they understand this
concept<00:04:04.180> we<00:04:04.990> almost<00:04:05.170> and<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.620> concept<00:04:06.100> just

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
concept we almost and the concept just

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.070 
concept we almost and the concept just
because<00:04:06.940> he's<00:04:07.120> good-looking<00:04:07.360> doesn't<00:04:07.810> mean

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
because he's good-looking doesn't mean

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.760 
because he's good-looking doesn't mean
he's<00:04:08.260> good<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:09.900> when<00:04:10.900> you<00:04:10.960> say<00:04:11.170> that<00:04:11.410> you<00:04:11.650> know

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
he's good and when you say that you know

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.130 
he's good and when you say that you know
the<00:04:12.190> translator<00:04:12.700> says<00:04:12.970> it<00:04:13.120> you<00:04:13.570> know<00:04:13.690> the

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
the translator says it you know the

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.870 
the translator says it you know the
finger<00:04:14.320> starts<00:04:14.710> wagging<00:04:14.860> immediately<00:04:15.610> and

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
finger starts wagging immediately and

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.430 
finger starts wagging immediately and
then<00:04:16.299> of<00:04:16.420> course<00:04:16.600> you<00:04:16.720> have<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:16.960> reverse<00:04:17.200> and

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
then of course you have to reverse and

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.750 
then of course you have to reverse and
just<00:04:17.710> cuz<00:04:17.859> she's<00:04:18.040> good-looking<00:04:18.250> doesn't<00:04:18.580> mean

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
just cuz she's good-looking doesn't mean

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.979 
just cuz she's good-looking doesn't mean
she's<00:04:18.940> good<00:04:19.120> of<00:04:19.239> course<00:04:19.420> he's<00:04:19.570> now<00:04:19.750> I've<00:04:19.870> got

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
she's good of course he's now I've got

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.590 
she's good of course he's now I've got
something<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.320> fight<00:04:20.590> back<00:04:20.799> with<00:04:21.540> it's<00:04:22.540> the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
something to fight back with it's the

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.600 
something to fight back with it's the
same<00:04:22.780> thing<00:04:22.990> with<00:04:23.110> vegetables<00:04:23.620> we<00:04:24.070> in<00:04:24.190> America

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
same thing with vegetables we in America

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.940 
same thing with vegetables we in America
are<00:04:24.640> so<00:04:25.390> jaded<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:26.230> think<00:04:26.440> that<00:04:26.590> just<00:04:26.800> because

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
are so jaded to think that just because
