00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
and small fish eggs so it could be

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.810 
and small fish eggs so it could be
having<00:01:33.409> a<00:01:33.590> really<00:01:33.829> devastating<00:01:34.009> impact<00:01:34.670> on

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
want to emphasize to the public that

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.650 
want to emphasize to the public that
they<00:02:10.429> should<00:02:10.580> not<00:02:10.670> be<00:02:10.850> releasing<00:02:11.480> any

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
at home into the wild you may think that

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.199 
at home into the wild you may think that
you're<00:02:15.920> doing<00:02:16.250> them<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.459> favor<00:02:16.670> by<00:02:16.879> releasing

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
you're doing them a favor by releasing

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.030 
you're doing them a favor by releasing
them<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.659> that's<00:02:17.780> too

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
them and that's too

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.830 
them and that's too
main<00:02:18.159> treatment<00:02:18.459> but<00:02:19.360> it's<00:02:19.510> really<00:02:19.719> not

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
main treatment but it's really not

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.550 
main treatment but it's really not
because<00:02:20.140> they're<00:02:20.230> going<00:02:20.349> to<00:02:20.409> have

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
because they're going to have

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.899 
because they're going to have
devastating<00:02:21.069> impacts<00:02:21.549> to<00:02:21.579> our<00:02:21.700> native
