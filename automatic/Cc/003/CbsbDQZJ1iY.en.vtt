00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.200
 today we are going to see an effect is done with 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.850
 eight letters 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.430
 which we are going to give to the spectator 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.450
 to choose one that touches only 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.450
 suppose it touches this one 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.060
 We will show it to you and we will tell you 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.119
 that the one you chose is a very letter 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.820
 special since between the eight letters is 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.570
 The only one 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.570
 red 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.290
 but what would have happened 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.960
 If I had chosen a black letter 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.600
 suppose that this would also be very 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.890
 special because it would be the only black 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.890
 between all the reds 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.300
 it's the quick effect 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.750
 simple and quite visual we go to the 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.750
 revelation 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.590
 well like that trick knees with another 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.590
 letters but interspersed red and black 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.990
 let's open a fan 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.640
 so that the viewer chooses one of 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.960
 them anyone who touches a carpet 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.960
 all this part above 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.750
 and we are going to demonstrate the letter you chose 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.650
 in this case a red letter and the secret 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.659
 of this trick is how we are going to show it 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.999
 with the thumb of the left hand 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.270
 we turn to the right hand to the letter of 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:48.310
 up and we show the two 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.820
 the one that we pass to the right hand and the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.030
 letter below 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.510
 but when we leave we leave and the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.220
 Whats Next 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.410
 from the left hand we always show 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.410
 the letter below and we leave the next 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.310
 What do we do then once you 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.459
 we show all the black letters 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.580
 we are going to place the red letter below 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.580
 all 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.470
 and let's say what happens if there 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.180
 chosen a black letter and exactly the 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.599
 same procedure 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.319
 we always show the one below and 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.319
 we drop the two 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.500
 that's all 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.500
 a quick and simple effect
