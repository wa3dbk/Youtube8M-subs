00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.690
 It continues on at point 2 and as in the first part we have to 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.320
 here too Camino 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.340
 Change of guard the decor of the fireplace or must be accepted 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.259
 they use our own brothers against us 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.179
 Change of power Carmina Burana have opposed the Empire and 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.179
 our brothers oppose us 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.339
 Baader has a rare moment to help us with this difficult fight 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.339
 becomes 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.610
 where was already forgotten fireplaces 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.190
 on the target 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.210
 has never given the flower Billion of Camino 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.890
 unofficially became around 20 years after our purchases 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.690
 after a special pot of imperial 500-lists lithium after 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.710
 they had in Munich 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.730
 create one kilogram of August in Munich in Bonn 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.560
 Customers need to train 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.820
 our community 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.940
 an expert 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.660
 Aachen 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.400
 called 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.230
 observe 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.230
 yes very nice in this and in this mission we also have Boba Fett and the 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.230
 Protesters not immediately 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.770
 and thus to the main entrance there was a category Pulmonary function 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.020
 wears and a top Trudpert 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.360
 The Boberg's destructive talents set one to destroy the consoles 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.630
 clearly the word no problem 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.110
 They are all the samples of the last thing to make sure the customers 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.110
 at the enormous never more unique can be worthwhile 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.530
 real quick 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.060
 because here it is surprising to see it live from Rome 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.060
 we just see main part 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
 Hauschild 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.530
 without scolding the ECJ he has hit us still full pot 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.479
 Bekir very fast 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.019
 believe is true already 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.019
 we will bring the samples 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.429
 word 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:31.419
 he speaks 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.610
 I just hope that's dead too 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.780
 central platform implemented Robert Herzl 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.729
 also has the same scheme as the Jedis 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.379
 he falls after a certain doubt that hard to do 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.869
 has expired 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:49.869
 and if he kills people so by the opponents 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:53.949
 he invites himself partially again 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:57.179
 Well, we have to wait and see what happened again 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:59.019
 lost all my energy 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.159
 but did not attack and hit this shit protected 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.229
 that is very annoying now 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.349
 now by and large of these enemies Rome 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.739
 coha pull that off easily which only guessed his guns Colt 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:33.819
 Unfortunately, I can not get up, but he does not seem to hit me either 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:44.229
 they show no reaction 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.689
 Concrete focus 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.489
 and we can repeat ourselves to Boba Fett today will not destroy her 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.369
 the 5 2 way of life and the topics the clones of the communal place also drive 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:04.369
 We make good 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.869
 was not easy for the city when smoker 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.009
 Robert also has a jetpack you can see 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.059
 and I think you can not go sideways into this facility 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.309
 That's exactly what it means 

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:22.490
 the side doors are me 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.919
 White smoke no longer 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.919
 I did not take any risks and started immediately through the middle 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.830
 what will be lost for us now 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:36.719
 I am in a hurry 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:38.969
 that was wrong 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:41.969
 that's what I wanted 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.689
 direct 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:54.520
 you should definitely use this grenades parts 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.520
 the Bobo represented 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:00.499
 as with those just a lot easier 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:03.779
 if you use the practices shoot a full three times a cook 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.330
 the good thing is we are not prevented at all 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.990
 Fri. 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.620
 destroy two ships 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.749
 Run for children for years 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:18.989
 Bremen the case 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:21.870
 an official free 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.189
 and that was a joke 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:28.569
 the former landed already 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.569
 and I could buy up to the CIO 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.719
 Let's go! There is not much time left for a week either 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.789
 we can do it 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.349
 we can go back to the break 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.339
 also see costs 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:50.740
 he was cool 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.629
 with a rocket moves around with what is that thing for a thing and Munich 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:58.249
 a detonation Stracke shock 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:00.610
 a very nice wafer 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.189
 especially with a lot of punch 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:06.089
 and now I have to look at it as well 

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:09.089
 and well 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.439
 from here I meet the above case 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.009
 Bravo was not deserved too long 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:26.119
 after switch on 

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:29.830
 I think I take all the heavy propos therefore, the shop pressure 

00:06:29.829 --> 00:06:32.419
 in front 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.419
 and then the stranger brings 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:40.699
 Yes, very nice 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.360
 There's something for that 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:54.050
 yes with this mission would be DAX 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.050
 sometimes 

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:04.439
 Bounty hunters 

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:08.899
 has something about that as well and jewelry chains 

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:14.110
 after the call minute, the repair decided 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.189
 that is a concern Lichtenhagen soldiers to come to 1 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.730
 In the future, Northrend should be two of them 

00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:28.330
 Also on the internet is a pleasure 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.619
 or is the AMI in different 

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:34.889
 we have never been right 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:37.150
 very beautiful and present than usual 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.919
 and I'll give you a tip for this mission 

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.089
 I say 

00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:43.809
 Leutz please quite fast 

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:47.159
 You must not be La Marche me in this mission 

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:51.169
 otherwise this will feel like this in this steaming base 

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:53.719
 and then it will not work out anymore 

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:56.319
 this mission can be cruel 

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:59.529
 I had it now I moved very fast I have it all very much 

00:07:59.529 --> 00:08:00.960
 quickly got there 

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.710
 People listen to this tip 

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.710
 if you can do it here, that's average 

00:08:06.249 --> 00:08:07.330
 otherwise it will be tight
