00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
I'm surprised and just go for a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.100 
I'm surprised and just go for a
waterfall<00:01:23.400> considering<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.270> i'm<00:01:24.780> pretty

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
waterfall considering that i'm pretty

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.460 
waterfall considering that i'm pretty
sure<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.380> they<00:01:25.710> know<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:27.960> take<00:01:28.320> at

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
sure that they know that it can take at

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.190 
sure that they know that it can take at
least<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:28.890> thunderbolt<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:31.049> don't

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
least one thunderbolt so I really don't

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.380 
least one thunderbolt so I really don't
know<00:01:31.290> why<00:01:31.530> they<00:01:31.710> did<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.920> but<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.970> know<00:01:33.119> it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
know why they did that but you know it

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.300 
know why they did that but you know it
doesn't<00:01:33.570> really<00:01:33.840> matter<00:01:34.049> because<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:35.220> know

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
doesn't really matter because you know

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.160 
doesn't really matter because you know
it's<00:01:35.430> their<00:01:35.549> decision<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.180> as<00:01:36.600> soon<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.990> saw

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
it's their decision but as soon as I saw

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.630 
it's their decision but as soon as I saw

and I keep using Thunderbolt because I'm

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.929 
and I keep using Thunderbolt because I'm
spect<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:56.250> team<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.640> pretty

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
spect to it it's a this team is pretty

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.569 
spect to it it's a this team is pretty
offensive<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:58.020> far<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.710> last<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.159> guys<00:01:59.340> might

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
offensive so far the last you guys might

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.810 
offensive so far the last you guys might
be<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> little<00:01:59.850> more<00:02:00.000> defensive<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.899> Lapras<00:02:01.649> is

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
be a little more defensive but Lapras is

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.219 
be a little more defensive but Lapras is
definitely<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> little<00:02:03.000> more<00:02:03.270> defensive<00:02:03.840> than

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
definitely a little more defensive than

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.010 
definitely a little more defensive than
the<00:02:05.040> other<00:02:05.250> guys<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.390> didn't<00:02:06.719> use<00:02:06.810> them<00:02:06.930> in

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020

speed<00:02:56.300> because<00:02:57.300> I<00:02:57.750> want<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.020> make<00:02:58.170> sure<00:02:58.200> that

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
speed because I want to make sure that

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.530

his<00:02:58.560> explosion<00:02:59.280> if<00:02:59.430> needed<00:02:59.880> could<00:03:00.300> be<00:03:00.390> pretty

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
his explosion if needed could be pretty

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.140 
his explosion if needed could be pretty
powerful<00:03:00.900> but<00:03:01.170> he<00:03:01.230> has<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> rock<00:03:02.340> polish<00:03:02.820> so<00:03:03.030> he

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
powerful but he has a rock polish so he

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.100 
powerful but he has a rock polish so he
can<00:03:03.330> speed<00:03:03.720> up<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:06.510> they<00:03:06.720> switch<00:03:06.930> out

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
can speed up and so they switch out

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.620 
can speed up and so they switch out
there<00:03:07.260> venusaur<00:03:07.770> I<00:03:07.800> have<00:03:07.950> no<00:03:08.070> idea<00:03:08.220> why<00:03:08.430> I

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
there venusaur I have no idea why I

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.030 
there venusaur I have no idea why I
don't<00:03:09.630> know<00:03:09.810> why<00:03:09.990> they<00:03:10.110> didn't<00:03:10.350> use<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:10.740> just

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.190 
anyways well I wasn't exactly sure but I
just<00:04:07.890> wanted<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.250> make<00:04:08.370> sure<00:04:08.430> that<00:04:08.700> if<00:04:09.270> he

just wanted to make sure that if he
didn't<00:04:10.560> survive<00:04:10.890> what<00:04:11.730> if<00:04:11.850> he<00:04:11.880> did<00:04:12.150> survive<00:04:12.650> ok

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
didn't survive what if he did survive ok

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.130 
didn't survive what if he did survive ok

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.240 
wanted to make sure that is that absol
and<00:04:18.000> froslass<00:04:18.600> had<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.810> chance<00:04:19.109> with<00:04:19.950> full<00:04:20.220> HP

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
and froslass had a chance with full HP

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.250 
and froslass had a chance with full HP
to<00:04:20.700> go<00:04:20.850> into<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.299> battle<00:04:21.720> not<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.020> have<00:04:22.140> to

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
to go into that battle not to have to

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.780 
to go into that battle not to have to
take<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.620> aqua<00:04:23.010> Jets<00:04:23.220> they<00:04:23.490> knew<00:04:23.640> they

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
take to aqua Jets they knew they

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.100 
take to aqua Jets they knew they
couldn't<00:04:24.000> survive<00:04:24.330> them

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
couldn't survive them

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.320 
couldn't survive them
and<00:04:25.250> maybe<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.550> slightest<00:04:26.849> chance<00:04:26.969> camera

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
and maybe the slightest chance camera

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.170 
and maybe the slightest chance camera
might<00:04:27.569> win<00:04:27.780> but<00:04:27.990> he<00:04:28.500> didn't<00:04:28.800> so<00:04:29.039> it<00:04:29.460> worked<00:04:30.000> out

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
might win but he didn't so it worked out

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.659 
might win but he didn't so it worked out
anyway<00:04:30.509> so<00:04:30.629> I<00:04:30.870> go<00:04:31.080> for<00:04:31.319> a<00:04:31.349> psycho<00:04:31.620> cut<00:04:31.979> I<00:04:32.219> think

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
anyway so I go for a psycho cut I think

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.070 
anyway so I go for a psycho cut I think
I<00:04:32.729> should<00:04:32.879> replace<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:33.270> with<00:04:33.360> night<00:04:33.539> /<00:04:33.780> because

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
I should replace it with night / because

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.860 
I should replace it with night / because
you<00:04:34.919> know<00:04:35.069> to<00:04:35.129> get<00:04:35.280> some<00:04:35.460> stabbed<00:04:35.699> in<00:04:35.909> there<00:04:36.090> so
