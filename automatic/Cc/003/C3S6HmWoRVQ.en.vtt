00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.890
 physically but that is also very 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.780
 attentively and technically what is that

 We will work all this with the 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.160
 group I think it's because of the 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.740

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.780

 September 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.080
 here at carole against the premise is that 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.570
 you will be ready to make your 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.810

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.900
 now I feel good because 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.720
 physically I'm fine but the 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.640
 evidence that I miss a bit of rhythm 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.650
 matches it's for this good now 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.540
 I will work during 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.390
 the training I spoke with the coach 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.280
 I'm good now it's the coach 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.209
 who will decide how I will react 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.209
