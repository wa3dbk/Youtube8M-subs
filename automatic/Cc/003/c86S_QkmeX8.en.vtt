00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:07.890
 Welcome to the helmet is a jury 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.590
 live 7 or we have here 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.559
 a brand means we have here all 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.509
 you have the p7 in your hand we have 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.010
 one of the runway camera for example above 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.960
 that we can just turn around that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.449
 We have for example on although sometimes even 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.699
 seen and we have a 7 inch 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.160
 Display with HD resolution for a price 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.050
 from only about 250 euro here in hungary 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.400
 At least and again, that's also noticeable 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.480
 already a nice stall speed 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.130
 although we back no longer the newest 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.590
 android have installed because we have 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.170
 only android 4.2 on it, however 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:42.620
 very cool animations we see here 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.760
 422 so no kitkat per se but 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.960
 still fun on ice cream 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.500
 sandwich a bit too 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.780
 roar 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.520
 because in itself it is not at all 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.649
 Slow is also a place 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.090
 accor in there by mediatek in here 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.770
 and once I get the camera here 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.430
 turn, for example, is also here 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.770
 the app 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.480
 and here I could immediately photos 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.070
 make the camera like sau but done 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.960
 with 10 megapixels can really the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.159
 Best service especially if we are 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.450
 Look that there really is still a flash 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.590
 is inside and I can do that one can 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.540
 Of course, just turn around 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.390
 or lie down as I wish 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.610
 and really a really cool one 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.140
 solutions makes the device as well as a 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.580
 bit thicker is not the thinnest 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.470
 you have seen smartphone so far 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.810
 but even has dual sim in here 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.090
 with his little pin we can down 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.619
 still a micro usb per microsd to completely 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.960
 have a microphone and charge 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.549
 headphone jack in there and of course 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 on and off switch and volume control 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.880
 or above bayer the camera 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.409
 That's why it really is allowed 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.829
 find nothing 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.180
 on the back also son mathis 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.490
 of course there is plastic in white as well 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.689
 in other colors though 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.670
 really not at all gouted here 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.490
 and it's fun to use is one 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.619
 a bit nicer, such as at gt3 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.110
 r gt2 what i have now this example 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.960
 slippery white but you can do the game 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.820
 see that the 4.7 inches versus 52 inches 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.229
 here also in the size does not arrive 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.090
 hang again with the camera together 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.790
 just need a lot of space above without the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.979
 the smartphone would be much smaller or smaller 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.380
 one perhaps for iphone 5, we 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.489
 Here also a relatively large largest 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.390
 difference but here we have too 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.970
 much stuff against 4.7 inches and in the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.660
 thick can 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.850
 Actually, this is not what you see here 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.120
 so fat I've already verdikt course 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.440
 times the smartphones had in hand 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.900
 so , of course, you can of course exist 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.310
 many other software features or 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.990
 I also like, for example, in general 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.850
 that for the android buttons outside 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.040
 do not have directly on the picture itself 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.640
 because 4.72 are not necessarily that 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.110
 greatest 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.700
 Here we have the possibility , for example 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.020
 to many functions immediately to it 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.150
 come in or down here between 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.220
 notifications and settings here 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.990
 to switch immediately or even here 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.880
 a bit which can be seen here even 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.740
 did not find above place and 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.970
 accordingly , we can do the order 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.990
 Also, change wants a lot more 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.700
 I'll get you in the device right now 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.980
 no longer show benchmarks and 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.600
 reviews and so i may my colleagues 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.410
 for graveling that was just one 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.970
 hands on with the review extreme p7 up 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.300
 next time and seem forgotten 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.300
 bring to
