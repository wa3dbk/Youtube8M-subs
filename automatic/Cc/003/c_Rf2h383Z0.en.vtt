well and I actually think we've done
that<00:00:23.080> this<00:00:23.260> year<00:00:23.529> but<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.250> team<00:00:24.430> knew<00:00:24.670> the

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
that this year but the team knew the

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.730 
that this year but the team knew the
stakes<00:00:25.060> were<00:00:25.270> very<00:00:25.450> very<00:00:25.660> high<00:00:25.840> this<00:00:25.900> year<00:00:26.080> for

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
stakes were very very high this year for

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.779 
stakes were very very high this year for
us<00:00:26.830> to<00:00:26.920> deliver<00:00:27.100> we<00:00:27.279> kind<00:00:27.460> of<00:00:27.490> need<00:00:27.610> to<00:00:27.640> go

outside<00:00:27.940> of<00:00:28.270> the<00:00:28.330> box<00:00:28.480> so<00:00:28.990> we<00:00:29.020> focused<00:00:29.170> on

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
outside of the box so we focused on

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.710 
outside of the box so we focused on
three<00:00:29.740> pillars<00:00:29.949> compete<00:00:30.850> customize<00:00:31.510> and

combat training was actually something

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.740 
combat training was actually something
as<00:03:00.100> they<00:03:00.220> mentioned<00:03:00.580> was<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.970> development<00:03:01.630> tool

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
as they mentioned was a development tool

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.480 
as they mentioned was a development tool
that<00:03:02.320> actually<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.740> see<00:03:02.890> how<00:03:03.040> multiplayer

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
that actually to see how multiplayer

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.160 
that actually to see how multiplayer
works<00:03:03.640> on<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:03.910> enemies<00:03:04.150> thanks<00:03:04.810> for<00:03:04.930> behaving

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
works on the enemies thanks for behaving

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.870 
works on the enemies thanks for behaving
with<00:03:05.320> in<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.500> world<00:03:05.740> now<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.460> way<00:03:06.610> that<00:03:06.790> it

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
with in the world now the way that it

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.100 
with in the world now the way that it
works<00:03:06.970> is<00:03:07.150> if<00:03:07.300> there's<00:03:07.420> different<00:03:07.780> levels<00:03:07.810> of

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
works is if there's different levels of

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.140 
works is if there's different levels of
the<00:03:08.230> combat<00:03:08.620> range<00:03:08.830> so<00:03:09.070> a<00:03:09.130> beginner<00:03:09.460> level<00:03:09.730> the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
the combat range so a beginner level the

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.520 
the combat range so a beginner level the
AI<00:03:10.330> is<00:03:10.540> going<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.810> move<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.990> little<00:03:11.110> bit<00:03:11.200> slower

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
AI is going to move a little bit slower

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.500 
AI is going to move a little bit slower
give<00:03:12.130> you<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.340> basic<00:03:12.550> idea<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.970> like<00:03:13.120> okay<00:03:13.210> this

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
give you a basic idea of like okay this

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.940 
give you a basic idea of like okay this
is<00:03:13.630> how<00:03:13.720> my<00:03:13.840> guns<00:03:14.050> work<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:14.590> want<00:03:14.830> to<00:03:14.890> get

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
is how my guns work I want to get

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.070 
is how my guns work I want to get
familiarity<00:03:15.400> with<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.640> map<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:16.240> wanna<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.600> don't

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
familiarity with the map I wanna I don't

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.960 
familiarity with the map I wanna I don't
know<00:03:17.260> what<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.830> Willy<00:03:18.130> Pete<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:18.580> or<00:03:18.850> what<00:03:18.940> a

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
know what it Willy Pete is or what a

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.850 
know what it Willy Pete is or what a
flashbang<00:03:19.510> is<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:20.080> can<00:03:20.200> just<00:03:20.350> try<00:03:20.530> those<00:03:20.710> out

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
flashbang is you can just try those out

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.400 
flashbang is you can just try those out
so<00:03:21.160> it's<00:03:21.610> really<00:03:21.790> this<00:03:21.970> idea<00:03:22.150> of<00:03:22.600> creating

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
so it's really this idea of creating

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.720 
so it's really this idea of creating
this<00:03:23.530> environment<00:03:23.680> where<00:03:24.160> it's<00:03:24.280> safe<00:03:24.520> for<00:03:24.640> you

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
this environment where it's safe for you

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.800 
this environment where it's safe for you
to<00:03:24.790> play<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.150> get<00:03:25.240> your<00:03:25.390> bearings<00:03:27.540> now<00:03:28.540> as<00:03:28.750> you

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
to play and get your bearings now as you

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.290 
to play and get your bearings now as you
actually<00:03:29.470> level<00:03:29.740> up<00:03:29.980> or<00:03:30.280> actually<00:03:30.910> change<00:03:31.180> the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
actually level up or actually change the

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.810 
actually level up or actually change the
difficulty<00:03:32.080> level<00:03:32.350> in<00:03:32.740> combat<00:03:33.310> training<00:03:33.490> it's

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
difficulty level in combat training it's

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.580 
difficulty level in combat training it's
actually<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.240> great<00:03:34.540> warm-up<00:03:35.050> at<00:03:35.170> least<00:03:35.320> for<00:03:35.470> me

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
actually a great warm-up at least for me

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.140 
actually a great warm-up at least for me
before<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.190> go<00:03:36.310> online<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.700> always<00:03:36.910> think<00:03:37.030> about

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
before I go online I always think about

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.910 
before I go online I always think about
one<00:03:37.450> or<00:03:37.570> two<00:03:37.600> matches<00:03:38.020> to<00:03:38.080> kind<00:03:38.260> of<00:03:38.290> get<00:03:38.410> my

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
one or two matches to kind of get my

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.010 
one or two matches to kind of get my
bearings<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.520> everything<00:03:39.820> ready<00:03:40.240> and<00:03:40.750> that's

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
bearings and everything ready and that's

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.060 
bearings and everything ready and that's
one<00:03:41.140> of<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.260> things<00:03:41.320> that<00:03:41.530> combat<00:03:41.890> training

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
one of the things that combat training

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.320 
one of the things that combat training
can<00:03:42.250> do<00:03:42.370> now<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.730> other<00:03:42.850> cool<00:03:43.090> thing<00:03:43.120> about

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
you give me a few and two other BOTS

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.790 
you give me a few and two other BOTS
like<00:03:55.810> me<00:03:55.900> with<00:03:56.020> my<00:03:56.140> buddy<00:03:56.350> and<00:03:56.500> three<00:03:56.680> other

like me with my buddy and three other

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.890 
like me with my buddy and three other
BOTS<00:03:57.040> you<00:03:57.460> basically<00:03:57.700> create<00:03:58.000> matches<00:03:58.690> and

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
BOTS you basically create matches and

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.780 
BOTS you basically create matches and
try<00:03:59.260> them<00:03:59.410> out<00:03:59.500> with<00:03:59.680> you<00:04:00.100> know<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.220> lot<00:04:00.490> of<00:04:00.520> bots

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
try them out with you know a lot of bots

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.400 
try them out with you know a lot of bots
against<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.150> very<00:04:01.240> small<00:04:01.570> team<00:04:01.780> so<00:04:02.110> there's<00:04:02.380> a

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
against the very small team so there's a

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.720 
against the very small team so there's a
lot<00:04:02.560> of<00:04:02.620> variability<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.370> can<00:04:03.520> do<00:04:03.610> and

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
lot of variability that you can do and

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.400 
lot of variability that you can do and
actually<00:04:03.880> think<00:04:04.150> that<00:04:04.180> this<00:04:04.360> mode<00:04:04.660> will<00:04:05.050> be<00:04:05.380> a

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
actually think that this mode will be a

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.410 
actually think that this mode will be a
great<00:04:05.800> sort<00:04:06.070> of<00:04:06.160> taster<00:04:06.910> for<00:04:06.940> people<00:04:07.300> there

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
great sort of taster for people there

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.000 
great sort of taster for people there
