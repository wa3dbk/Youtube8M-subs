00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
selection and I broke out the electric

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.900 
selection and I broke out the electric
guitar<00:00:06.509> for<00:00:07.109> this<00:00:07.379> this<00:00:07.710> lesson<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.400> probably

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910

played this thing in probably two or

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.190 
played this thing in probably two or
three<00:00:10.590> years<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.160> kind<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.429> just<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.820> up

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
three years it kind of just is up

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.780 
three years it kind of just is up
showpiece<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.349> my<00:00:13.440> wall<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.040> speak<00:00:14.400> because

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
showpiece in my wall so to speak because

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.730 
showpiece in my wall so to speak because
because<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:16.199> know<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> lot<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.500> times

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
because of you know a lot of times

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.109 
because of you know a lot of times
electrics<00:00:17.220> use<00:00:17.400> for<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.640> different<00:00:17.910> kind<00:00:18.090> of

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
electrics use for a different kind of

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.320 
electrics use for a different kind of
music<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:19.279> it's<00:00:20.279> not<00:00:20.460> really<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> economy's

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
music so it's not really the economy's

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.390 
music so it's not really the economy's

got play a lot but I can show you a few
things<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.240> electric<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.840> great<00:00:25.199> for

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
things that the electric is great for

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.140 
things that the electric is great for
and<00:00:25.859> some<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.580> might<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.910> fan<00:00:27.119> of

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and some of you might be a fan of

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.089 
and some of you might be a fan of
electric<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.840> said<00:00:28.080> electric<00:00:28.949> has<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
electric like I said electric has a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.160 
electric like I said electric has a
really<00:00:29.340> cool<00:00:29.580> sound<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.480> great<00:00:30.720> ad<00:00:30.960> and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
really cool sound it's a great ad and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.590 
really cool sound it's a great ad and
different<00:00:31.410> parts<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.830> kind<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.070> thing<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.940> lot

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
different parts that kind of thing a lot

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.060 
different parts that kind of thing a lot
of<00:00:33.660> times<00:00:33.780> even<00:00:34.170> people<00:00:34.380> are<00:00:34.469> first<00:00:34.770> learning

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
of times even people are first learning

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.920 
of times even people are first learning
I<00:00:35.489> know<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.059> couple<00:00:36.180> guys<00:00:36.360> I've<00:00:36.660> taught<00:00:36.809> in

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
I know a couple guys I've taught in

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.330 
I know a couple guys I've taught in
college<00:00:37.320> they<00:00:37.500> love<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.920> learn<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
college they love to learn on the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.160 
college they love to learn on the
electric<00:00:38.700> because<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.390> strings<00:00:39.750> are<00:00:39.960> really

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
electric because the strings are really

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:54.220 
electric because the strings are really
light

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.229 

so<00:00:54.769> it<00:00:55.039> could<00:00:55.219> be<00:00:55.339> great<00:00:55.579> if<00:00:55.699> you're<00:00:55.820> beginning

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
so it could be great if you're beginning

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.910 
so it could be great if you're beginning
to<00:00:56.359> learn<00:00:56.480> on<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:56.719> electric<00:00:57.050> because<00:00:57.199> you<00:00:57.800> get

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
to learn on the electric because you get

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.229 
to learn on the electric because you get
lighter<00:00:58.190> strings<00:00:58.550> not<00:00:58.850> gonna<00:00:59.000> hurt<00:00:59.089> your

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
lighter strings not gonna hurt your

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.939 
lighter strings not gonna hurt your
fingers<00:00:59.570> as<00:00:59.690> much<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:00.140> until<00:01:00.379> I<00:01:00.409> get<00:01:00.589> callus

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
fingers as much so until I get callus

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.560 
fingers as much so until I get callus
can<00:01:01.159> be<00:01:01.219> something<00:01:01.550> to<00:01:01.609> do<00:01:01.730> but<00:01:02.359> with<00:01:02.449> this

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
can be something to do but with this

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.299 
can be something to do but with this
lesson<00:01:02.930> I<00:01:02.989> want<00:01:03.050> to<00:01:03.170> go<00:01:03.260> over<00:01:03.379> power<00:01:03.680> chords

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
lesson I want to go over power chords

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.539 
lesson I want to go over power chords
now<00:01:04.549> power<00:01:05.330> chords<00:01:06.040> that<00:01:07.040> they're<00:01:07.280> called

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
now power chords that they're called

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.810 
now power chords that they're called
power<00:01:08.330> chords<00:01:08.780> or<00:01:08.930> v<00:01:09.320> chords<00:01:09.890> because<00:01:10.700> you

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
power chords or v chords because you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.420 
power chords or v chords because you
take<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.210> root<00:01:11.479> note<00:01:11.840> of<00:01:12.259> whatever<00:01:13.130> you're

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
take the root note of whatever you're

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.609 
take the root note of whatever you're
playing<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.270> let's<00:01:14.420> say<00:01:14.600> this<00:01:14.810> top<00:01:15.049> string<00:01:15.409> is

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
playing so let's say this top string is

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.219 
playing so let's say this top string is
an<00:01:15.740> E<00:01:15.979> string<00:01:16.369> for<00:01:16.670> example<00:01:17.090> this<00:01:17.780> is<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.020> top

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
an E string for example this is the top

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.219 
an E string for example this is the top
string<00:01:18.530> is<00:01:18.649> called<00:01:18.830> a<00:01:19.100> string<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:19.850> know<00:01:20.000> that

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
string is called a string you know that

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.109 
string is called a string you know that
if<00:01:21.229> you<00:01:21.380> press<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.920> first<00:01:22.580> fret<00:01:22.880> of<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:23.000> E

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
if you press the first fret of the E

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.649 
if you press the first fret of the E
string<00:01:23.420> comes<00:01:23.780> F<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:25.039> F<00:01:25.159> sharp<00:01:25.189> G<00:01:26.050> g-sharp<00:01:27.050> a

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
string comes F and F sharp G g-sharp a

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.450 
string comes F and F sharp G g-sharp a
and<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:29.869> forth<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:30.740> that's<00:01:30.920> how<00:01:31.069> you<00:01:31.130> know<00:01:31.340> the

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
and so forth so that's how you know the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.100 
and so forth so that's how you know the
root<00:01:31.670> note<00:01:31.940> whatever<00:01:32.240> you're<00:01:32.479> compressing

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
root note whatever you're compressing

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.889 
root note whatever you're compressing
and<00:01:33.530> for<00:01:34.069> a<00:01:34.100> power<00:01:34.340> chord<00:01:34.789> what<00:01:35.330> you<00:01:35.479> do<00:01:35.630> is<00:01:35.780> you

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
and for a power chord what you do is you

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.359 
and for a power chord what you do is you
play<00:01:36.080> it<00:01:36.140> looks<00:01:36.380> like<00:01:36.590> for<00:01:36.920> example<00:01:37.250> let's

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
play it looks like for example let's

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.669 
play it looks like for example let's
play<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.549> G<00:01:37.940> 5<00:01:38.179> so<00:01:38.720> we'll<00:01:38.869> call<00:01:39.049> it<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.170> fifth<00:01:39.440> but

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
play a G 5 so we'll call it a fifth but

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.969 
play a G 5 so we'll call it a fifth but
a<00:01:39.709> g5<00:01:40.340> power<00:01:40.729> chord<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:41.869> play<00:01:41.899> so<00:01:42.500> this<00:01:42.709> is<00:01:42.890> an

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
a g5 power chord you play so this is an

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:43.480 
a g5 power chord you play so this is an
E

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
E

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.899 
E
that's<00:01:44.119> AF<00:01:44.509> F<00:01:44.840> sharp<00:01:45.170> G<00:01:45.500> so<00:01:46.190> your<00:01:46.310> first<00:01:46.490> finger

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
that's AF F sharp G so your first finger

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.719 
that's AF F sharp G so your first finger
is<00:01:46.970> on<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.390> top<00:01:47.630> string<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:49.039> the<00:01:49.159> third<00:01:49.369> fret

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
is on the top string and the third fret

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.199 
is on the top string and the third fret
then<00:01:50.600> you'll<00:01:50.750> take<00:01:50.959> your<00:01:51.200> ring<00:01:51.530> finger<00:01:51.560> and

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
then you'll take your ring finger and
