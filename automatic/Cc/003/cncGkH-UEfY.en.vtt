00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.970
 today we realize that smoothing 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.220
 is increasingly in demand in the east 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.710
 in salons it's a technique that 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.170
 is really the area of expertise of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.740
 hairdressers and we wanted to propose a 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.640
 alternative with two smoothing quines 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.809
 at home a kit that fits more to 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.780
 a curly tab hair and a 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.390
 second six week kit that's called 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.160
 the Japanese kit for hair more 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.160
 soft curling very thick that will come in 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:56.579
 done brought this smoothing one can have 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.170
 also in the living rooms you see your posed 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.629
 in the palm of your hand and you'll come 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.489
 apply some of the content 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.430
 the third a fourth then you 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.950
 combed as flat as possible and we 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.950
 will leave it between 20 and 30 minutes 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.360
 now we have two possibilities and 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.250
 we apply live fixation on 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.670
 your hair wet well wrung when 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.370
 same and we put the hair in position 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.880
 agree or a little more pro of fairs 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.970

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.850
 we go first high school your hair see 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.550
 pass the plate for really set a 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.950
 shape and apply the fixer from above 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.690
 step 2 of agreement will fall if the cream 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.330
 smoothing fixer you'll be able 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.640

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.890
 a combative starting from top to bottom 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.740
 keeping the flattened hair well 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.780
