now in a stand lift stri drive throw

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.080 
now in a stand lift stri drive throw
that's<00:00:31.380> basically<00:00:31.769> all<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.250> now<00:00:32.850> some

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that's basically all it is now some

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.790 
that's basically all it is now some
other<00:00:33.239> some<00:00:33.809> pitches<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.290> are<00:00:34.410> used<00:00:34.620> in

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
other some pitches that are used in

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.549 
other some pitches that are used in
baseball<00:00:35.250> or<00:00:35.719> for<00:00:36.719> example<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> four<00:00:37.290> seamer

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
baseball or for example a four seamer

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.889 
baseball or for example a four seamer
four<00:00:38.190> seam<00:00:38.430> fastball<00:00:38.910> what<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.540> allows<00:00:39.750> to

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
four seam fastball what this allows to

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.630 
four seam fastball what this allows to
do<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> ball<00:00:40.500> comes<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.920> little<00:00:41.219> bit<00:00:41.309> harder

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
do is the ball comes a little bit harder

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.160 
do is the ball comes a little bit harder
than<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.850> two<00:00:42.000> seam<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.809> comes<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
than a two seam and it comes at a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.770 
than a two seam and it comes at a
straight<00:00:43.469> angle<00:00:43.640> now<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.390> two

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
straight angle now you have a to a two

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.900 
straight angle now you have a to a two
seam<00:00:46.170> which<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.190> does<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.579> has<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
seam which what it does is it has a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.880 
seam which what it does is it has a
little<00:00:48.329> bit<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.660> movement<00:00:48.899> it'll<00:00:49.440> cut<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
little bit of movement it'll cut to the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.069 
little bit of movement it'll cut to the
left<00:00:50.039> it'll<00:00:50.399> cut<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> right<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.270> it's<00:00:51.989> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
left it'll cut to the right and it's a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.299 
left it'll cut to the right and it's a
little<00:00:52.379> bit<00:00:52.500> slower<00:00:52.680> than<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.860> four<00:00:53.100> seam

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
little bit slower than a four seam

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.029 
little bit slower than a four seam
fastball<00:00:53.789> another<00:00:54.360> basic<00:00:55.079> pitch<00:00:55.289> would<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
fastball another basic pitch would be a

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.700 
fastball another basic pitch would be a
changeup<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.699> lot<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.270> people<00:00:57.449> choose<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.109> and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
changeup a lot of people choose this and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.040 
changeup a lot of people choose this and
a<00:00:58.770> lot<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.949> people<00:00:59.160> choose<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.789> 80<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.870> all

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
a lot of people choose this 80 it all

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.439 
a lot of people choose this 80 it all
has<00:01:01.230> its<00:01:01.440> own<00:01:01.590> sequel<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.190> same<00:01:02.760> equal<00:01:03.120> effect

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
has its own sequel a same equal effect

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.109 
has its own sequel a same equal effect
but<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.500> purpose<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.010> changeup<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
but it's the purpose of a changeup is to

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.450 
but it's the purpose of a changeup is to
change<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.170> speed<00:01:07.470> up<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.770> little<00:01:07.799> bit<00:01:08.100> slow<00:01:08.340> it

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
change the speed up a little bit slow it

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.420 
change the speed up a little bit slow it
down<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.909> cause<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.720> batter<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.799> ruin<00:01:11.310> his

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
down and cause the batter to ruin his

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.800 
down and cause the batter to ruin his
