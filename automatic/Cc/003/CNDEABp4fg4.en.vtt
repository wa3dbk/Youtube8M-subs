the airport then checking in early the
possibility<00:04:08.890> of<00:04:08.920> delays<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.989> real

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
possibility of delays and the real

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.979 
possibility of delays and the real
difference<00:04:11.410> is<00:04:11.530> more<00:04:11.709> like<00:04:11.890> two<00:04:12.160> hours<00:04:12.989> and

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
difference is more like two hours and

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.990 
difference is more like two hours and
just<00:04:14.680> think<00:04:14.890> that<00:04:14.980> each<00:04:15.160> of<00:04:15.220> those<00:04:15.430> hours<00:04:15.730> is

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
just think that each of those hours is

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.219 
just think that each of those hours is
costing<00:04:16.419> you<00:04:16.510> more<00:04:16.690> than<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:16.900> hundred<00:04:17.079> dollars

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
you might be better off putting that

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.950
