technology evolutions

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.130 
technology evolutions
or<00:00:55.629> from<00:00:55.809> the<00:00:55.870> sandbags

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.110 

so<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.530> engineer<00:00:59.920> measured<00:01:00.310> exterior<00:01:00.940> it

so the engineer measured exterior it

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.120 
so the engineer measured exterior it
kind<00:01:01.390> of<00:01:01.420> gives<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.630> little<00:01:01.750> more<00:01:02.230> support

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
kind of gives a little more support

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.850 
kind of gives a little more support
little<00:01:03.280> stronger<00:01:04.199> by<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.230> same<00:01:05.470> sound<00:01:05.770> that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
little stronger by the same sound that
