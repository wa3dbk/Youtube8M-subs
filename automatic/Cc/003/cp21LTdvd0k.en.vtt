00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
guess if you don't really really

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.020 
guess if you don't really really
understand<00:00:58.280> that<00:00:58.370> kind<00:00:58.579> of<00:00:58.699> painting<00:00:58.879> you

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
understand that kind of painting you

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.670 
understand that kind of painting you
could<00:00:59.180> look<00:00:59.329> at<00:00:59.510> it<00:00:59.629> and<00:00:59.780> you<00:00:59.840> could<00:00:59.989> say<00:01:00.199> you

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
could look at it and you could say you

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.220 
could look at it and you could say you
know<00:01:00.770> a<00:01:00.800> child<00:01:01.070> could<00:01:01.370> do<00:01:01.550> that<00:01:02.050> unless<00:01:03.050> you've

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
know a child could do that unless you've

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.719 
know a child could do that unless you've
actually<00:01:03.469> picked<00:01:03.620> up<00:01:03.710> a<00:01:03.800> paintbrush<00:01:04.100> yourself

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
actually picked up a paintbrush yourself

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.550 
actually picked up a paintbrush yourself
and<00:01:04.879> actually<00:01:05.089> tried<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.509> do<00:01:05.720> it<00:01:05.899> it's<00:01:06.470> really

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
and actually tried to do it it's really

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.050 
and actually tried to do it it's really
really<00:01:07.070> hard<00:01:07.940> to<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:09.410> access<00:01:09.619> that<00:01:10.250> freedom<00:01:10.670> to

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
really hard to to access that freedom to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.180 
really hard to to access that freedom to
just<00:01:11.479> step<00:01:11.960> outside<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.530> tradition<00:01:13.009> I<00:01:13.070> mean

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
just step outside the tradition I mean

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.380 
just step outside the tradition I mean
his<00:01:13.280> early<00:01:13.520> paintings<00:01:13.970> were<00:01:14.119> kind<00:01:14.330> of

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
his early paintings were kind of

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.630 
his early paintings were kind of
extremely<00:01:15.050> competent<00:01:15.560> in<00:01:15.979> that<00:01:16.130> art<00:01:16.340> world

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
extremely competent in that art world

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.389 
extremely competent in that art world
sense<00:01:17.170> but<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.259> takes<00:01:18.470> a<00:01:18.590> great<00:01:18.830> deal<00:01:18.860> of<00:01:19.070> skill

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
sense but it takes a great deal of skill

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.340 
sense but it takes a great deal of skill
to<00:01:19.429> put<00:01:19.820> that<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.149> one<00:01:20.270> side<00:01:20.330> to<00:01:20.869> untie

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
to put that to one side to untie

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.560 
to put that to one side to untie
yourself<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.310> learn<00:01:22.700> how<00:01:22.970> to<00:01:23.000> paint<00:01:23.360> like

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
yourself and and learn how to paint like

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.570 
yourself and and learn how to paint like
this<00:01:23.899> which<00:01:24.380> is<00:01:24.410> like<00:01:24.649> a<00:01:24.710> child<00:01:25.070> but<00:01:25.220> not<00:01:25.399> like

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
this which is like a child but not like

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.359 
this which is like a child but not like
a<00:01:25.610> child<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:30.409> second<00:01:30.860> thing<00:01:30.950> I<00:01:31.040> guess<00:01:31.220> you

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
a child the second thing I guess you

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.069 
a child the second thing I guess you
noticed<00:01:31.520> is<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.000> wonderful<00:01:32.270> scruffy<00:01:32.869> toe

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
noticed is the wonderful scruffy toe

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.770 
noticed is the wonderful scruffy toe
technique<00:01:33.770> he<00:01:33.920> uses<00:01:34.159> there's<00:01:34.579> a<00:01:34.780> brilliantly

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
technique he uses there's a brilliantly

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.859 
technique he uses there's a brilliantly
random<00:01:36.770> brightly<00:01:37.640> colored<00:01:37.939> ground<00:01:38.240> with<00:01:38.630> this

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
random brightly colored ground with this

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.230 
random brightly colored ground with this
white<00:01:39.200> paint<00:01:39.530> palette<00:01:40.130> knifed<00:01:40.369> all<00:01:40.909> over<00:01:41.149> the

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
white paint palette knifed all over the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.760 
white paint palette knifed all over the
surface<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.689> then<00:01:41.810> he<00:01:41.899> scratches<00:01:42.380> through<00:01:42.649> it

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
surface and then he scratches through it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.830 
surface and then he scratches through it
the<00:01:42.979> lines<00:01:43.189> are<00:01:43.430> literally<00:01:43.729> dug<00:01:44.360> into<00:01:44.600> the

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
the lines are literally dug into the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.380 
the lines are literally dug into the
surface<00:01:45.259> so<00:01:45.409> this<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:46.460> can<00:01:46.670> tell<00:01:46.970> what's<00:01:47.149> nine

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
surface so this you can tell what's nine

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.260 
surface so this you can tell what's nine
and<00:01:47.600> what's<00:01:47.750> color<00:01:48.909> certainly<00:01:49.909> this<00:01:50.060> the

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
and what's color certainly this the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.300 
and what's color certainly this the
under<00:01:50.869> painting<00:01:51.110> that<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.530> colored<00:01:52.070> under

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
under painting that the colored under

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.999 
under painting that the colored under
painting<00:01:52.549> was<00:01:52.939> I<00:01:52.970> think<00:01:53.299> left<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:54.020> dry<00:01:54.259> and

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
painting was I think left to dry and

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.069 
painting was I think left to dry and
then<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.790> white<00:01:55.969> pace<00:01:56.270> is<00:01:56.450> spread<00:01:56.689> over<00:01:56.719> it

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
then the white pace is spread over it

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.389 
then the white pace is spread over it
but<00:01:57.259> I<00:01:57.320> think<00:01:57.380> in<00:01:57.619> places<00:01:57.950> he's<00:01:58.040> taken<00:01:58.340> the

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
but I think in places he's taken the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.459 
but I think in places he's taken the
paint<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:59.030> paste<00:01:59.240> off<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.630> done<00:01:59.750> it<00:01:59.840> again<00:02:02.469> one

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
paint to paste off and done it again one

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:04.690 
paint to paste off and done it again one
of<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.649> interesting<00:02:03.890> things<00:02:04.100> about<00:02:04.219> this<00:02:04.520> is

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
of the interesting things about this is

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.330 
of the interesting things about this is
this<00:02:04.820> is<00:02:04.969> purely<00:02:05.329> done<00:02:05.689> in<00:02:05.869> oils<00:02:06.290> and<00:02:06.920> one<00:02:07.219> of

children<00:03:23.870> reacting<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.739> painting<00:03:25.159> and

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
children reacting to this painting and

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.190 
children reacting to this painting and
they<00:03:25.340> do<00:03:25.609> think<00:03:26.030> it's<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.209> kind<00:03:26.359> of<00:03:26.480> playground

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
they do think it's a kind of playground

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.679 
they do think it's a kind of playground
of<00:03:27.349> then<00:03:27.500> some<00:03:27.799> kind<00:03:28.040> of<00:03:28.099> carnival<00:03:28.760> or<00:03:28.909> jumping

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:29.689 
of then some kind of carnival or jumping

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.670 
of then some kind of carnival or jumping
tumbling<00:03:30.290> game<00:03:31.750> but<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.780> think<00:03:32.930> it's<00:03:33.469> the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
tumbling game but I think it's the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.039 
tumbling game but I think it's the
painting<00:03:34.099> of<00:03:34.189> a<00:03:34.280> man<00:03:34.519> who's<00:03:34.909> watched<00:03:35.599> street
