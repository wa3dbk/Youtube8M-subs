00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.710
 chevrolet cobalt no doubt divide 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.539
 the title of the worst car on 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.160
 Russian market with nissan almera 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.199
 but in spite of this machine well 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.779
 sold and do here is that in 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.779
 in this segment until design nobody looks 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.510
 workhorse is just about him she 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.340
 unlikely the owner will turn around 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.140
 when he puts his car in parks 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.120
 although if you close your eyes on huge 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.020
 homely cobalt lights a lot 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.239
 interesting detail 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.890
 brand radiator grille massive 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.710
 stamping on the sides or quite 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.270
 representative pocket 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.770
 and this with the main task to do 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.770
 car is very affordable 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.510
 I'm you here for a few 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.410
 complete sets and the cheapest begins 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.820
 from 444 thousand rubles 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.330
 true in this version you get quite 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.370
 a little bit 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.080
 engine and a half liters with a mechanical 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.690
 box with airbag for 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.800
 driver heated front seats 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.110
 windows and little things more 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.440
 for a second pillow air conditioner or even 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.640
 abs should be paid separately 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.190
 no tape recorder to the mother too 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.440
 audio path is provided though 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.540
 if you continue to equip the car 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.670
 then the limit of 500 thousand can be obtained 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:46.070
 car already with multimedia 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.860
 already with a gun here is 5 real paradise 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.990
 for installers how much nothing 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.750
 you can install any 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.350
 third party devices for 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.509
 any money 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.040
 daytime running lights camera navigators 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.750
 rearview parking sensors 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.780
 the whole world of non-original options for 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.460
 cobalt owner open for example 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.009
 parking sensors which is installed on our 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.780
 car is clearly non-standard but 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.000
 speaks Russian speaks 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.110
 how many meters left 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.510
 Of course it doesnâ€™t look the best 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.540
 way but their tasks and does it 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.940
 the main thing and the radio tape recorder despite its 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.180
 quite modest view supports 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.760
 any flash drive mp3 players 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.620
 You keep quiet about the iPhone, although without a hill 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.780
 the tar did not go on the front bumps 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.250
 the panels now and then snap off after which 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.230
 backlit all the buttons stopped 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.230
 work well though the music played like 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.000
 nothing happened under the hood here 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.350
 one and a half liter petrol aspirated 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.940
 engine delivering 105 horsepower and 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.650
 134 newton meters of torque 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.660
 numbers by modern standards scary 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.850
 small but surprisingly overclocking 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.010
 cobalt does not even lead us 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.730
 with 5-speed mechanics it accelerates 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.319
 and initially enough water though 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.110
 the printer of course he did not put the first 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.660
 hundred experience gains up to 11.7 seconds 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.930
 to drive outside she is clumsy back 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.730
 It turned out much more interesting and more 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.070
 so oddly enough on the roads 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.109
 Cobalt respect I thought that you 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.329
 will constantly shoot something like a robot 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:18.410
 nowhere miss but in fact we 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:23.210
 We shoot as I show thanks 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.580
 and yet the trump card of this car 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.400
 this space where you do not look everywhere 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.530
 plenty of space behind the trunk on 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.710
 driver's seat everywhere 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.450
 This is a big plus though claims by 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.790
 the economy here is enough for plating 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.410
 door neut comfortable armrest buttons 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.660
 window lifter to use too 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.860
 uncomfortable 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.930
 rear passengers despite the abundance 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.960
 place interferes with the step on the front 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.180
 seats but what I really do not understand is 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.960
 the fact that all budget sedans are alone and 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.540
 same problems 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.470
 seemingly make make the car where 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.930
 this is not and 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.640
 they will pull you the trunk lid 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.560
 only opens from the outside with a key fob or 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.020
 she has no shoulder inside 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.910
 or the handles of the night really lack light and 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.830
 separate sections for the near and far 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.690
 but they don't have an uneven profile without 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.390
 lumbar support and so on so 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.830
 Further 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.660
 instead of us once again 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.640
 offer a unique car for 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.480
 the whole family and after all cable really 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.950
 good car 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.350
 especially if you abstract from his 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.200
 but looks good here 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.910
 insulation energy-intensive suspension 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.680
 speed bumps Russian 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.140
 manholes which are located 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.100
 as usual the roads are practically 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.530
 does not notice 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.650
 so that there is comfort and no extra 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.160
 Classic sound scheme in front 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.600
 simple mcpherson behind then all the sky 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.910
 but surprisingly there are claims to 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.790
 quality of quality like for example 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.530
 assembled interior or painted car 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.110
 our car is already in large quantities 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.790
 chipped which is clearly not there 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.610
 where does it go in stone that is it 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.400
 says that in a year maybe 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.030
 two operating machines for sure 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.830
 will have to tint some gaps in 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.330
 the cabin is more like a village so 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.099
 they are uneven 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.720
 and the outer handle touches the case 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.730
 doors and beating themselves paint 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.830
 the overall impression of the cabin is pleasant 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.180
 despite these drawbacks design 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.860
 center console looks modern 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.690
 and a dashboard like the others 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.200
 chevrolet models are reminiscent of those from 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.210
 scooter 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.009
 which adds freshness to usually super 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.020
 press on interiors budget sedan 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.659
 rally ears have a good sales experience 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.809
 Sherali budget car 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:33.629
 cobalt obviously also waiting for success not 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:35.729
 you will become a big and simple car without 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:38.399
 claims for imputed money what else 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.939
 need can be just a little more 

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:40.939
 quality 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.530
 90 percent cobalt buyers 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.020
 there will be men of the head of families with a little 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.400
 income and various companies we read 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.200
 how much will the first year of ownership cost 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.510
 chevrolet cobalt and that's what happened 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.640
 all mandatory expenses of the comprehensive insurance policy and 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.270
 CTP transport tax and technical 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.890
 service 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.720
 we have developed a loss of car value for 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:06.040
 year and fuel consumption for this before and 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.650
 addition 234 1944 rubles so one 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.240
 kilometer costs 9 rubles 39 kopecks and 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.190
 that means going to work 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.230
 will cost the owner two hundred thirty 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.830
 four rubles as 15 kilograms 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.830
 potato
