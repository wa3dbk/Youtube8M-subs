00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
top away from the sway bar there so I'm

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.570

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.040 
out with an impact and in this case it
just<00:00:25.289> broke<00:00:25.710> which<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.160> good<00:00:26.630> because<00:00:27.630> all<00:00:27.930> we

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
just broke which is good because all we

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.940 
just broke which is good because all we
wanted<00:00:28.260> was<00:00:28.439> out<00:00:29.480> here's<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.660> new<00:00:30.810> kit<00:00:31.140> I

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.340 

don't<00:00:34.950> know<00:00:35.010> where<00:00:35.130> he<00:00:35.219> bought<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:36.140> but<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
don't know where he bought it but it's a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.920 
don't know where he bought it but it's a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
side we're working on this will separate

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.150 
side we're working on this will separate
the<00:00:58.510> control<00:00:58.930> arm<00:00:59.170> from<00:00:59.290> the<00:00:59.590> sway<00:00:59.890> bar<00:01:00.129> a

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.310 
the control arm from the sway bar a
little<00:01:00.309> bit<00:01:00.660> give<00:01:01.660> us<00:01:01.780> some<00:01:01.899> more<00:01:02.050> room<00:01:02.290> to

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
little bit give us some more room to

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.170 
little bit give us some more room to
work

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.820 

you<00:01:08.630> can<00:01:08.810> see<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.020> sway<00:01:09.200> bar<00:01:09.380> kind<00:01:09.560> of<00:01:09.590> moving

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
you can see the sway bar kind of moving

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.470 
you can see the sway bar kind of moving
up<00:01:09.950> or<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.190> control<00:01:10.550> arm<00:01:10.700> moving<00:01:10.850> down<00:01:13.480> got

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
up or the control arm moving down got

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.690 
up or the control arm moving down got
the<00:01:14.600> bolt<00:01:14.780> with<00:01:15.020> one<00:01:15.320> washer<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.100> rubber<00:01:16.490> on

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
the bolt with one washer and rubber on

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.000 
the bolt with one washer and rubber on
it<00:01:16.730> slide<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:17.570> up<00:01:17.660> through<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.960> control<00:01:18.260> arm

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010

put<00:01:22.010> on<00:01:22.100> another<00:01:22.310> rubber

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.450 

then<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.480> metal<00:01:36.720> washer<00:01:37.520> sleeve<00:01:38.520> tube

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:02:00.840 

I'll<00:01:53.619> stick<00:01:53.829> it<00:01:53.859> through<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.100> sway<00:01:54.340> arm

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.950 

laughs<00:02:01.450> rubber<00:02:01.750> bushing

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
laughs rubber bushing

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.290 
laughs rubber bushing
and<00:02:04.530> now<00:02:04.620> we<00:02:04.680> we<00:02:05.280> run<00:02:05.460> into<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.700> problem<00:02:06.090> there's

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
and now we we run into a problem there's

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.180 
and now we we run into a problem there's
there's<00:02:06.810> not<00:02:07.020> enough<00:02:07.200> threads<00:02:07.590> out<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.070> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
there's not enough threads out of the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.210 
there's not enough threads out of the
top<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:09.000> put<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.300> washer<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:10.979> let<00:02:11.130> the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
top to put the washer on so we let the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.580 
top to put the washer on so we let the
jack<00:02:11.460> down<00:02:11.780> still<00:02:12.780> not<00:02:12.930> enough<00:02:13.110> threads<00:02:13.440> to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
jack down still not enough threads to

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.080 
jack down still not enough threads to
get<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.800> washer<00:02:14.190> on<00:02:14.340> there<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.760> nut<00:02:14.940> on

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
get the washer on there and the nut on

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.940 
get the washer on there and the nut on
there<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:16.230> now<00:02:16.320> we're<00:02:16.410> going<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.590> jack<00:02:16.770> up<00:02:16.800> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
there so now we're going to jack up the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:24.230 
there so now we're going to jack up the
other<00:02:17.220> side<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.820> truck<00:02:21.500> should<00:02:23.209> push<00:02:24.209> the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
other side of the truck should push the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.740 
other side of the truck should push the
control<00:02:24.780> arm<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.140> sway<00:02:25.350> bar<00:02:25.590> together<00:02:26.750> it's

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
control arm and sway bar together it's

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.870 
control arm and sway bar together it's
still<00:02:28.020> not<00:02:28.230> enough<00:02:28.530> thread<00:02:29.310> sticking<00:02:29.550> out<00:02:29.790> of

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
still not enough thread sticking out of

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.380 
still not enough thread sticking out of
the<00:02:29.940> top<00:02:31.490> so<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.730> course<00:02:32.940> we're<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.150> going<00:02:33.360> to

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
the top so of course we're just going to

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:44.960 
the top so of course we're just going to
hit<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.540> with<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.690> hammer

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.020 

make<00:02:45.570> sure<00:02:45.720> we<00:02:45.840> got<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:45.990> bolt<00:02:46.380> all<00:02:47.340> up<00:02:47.820> in

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
make sure we got that bolt all up in

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.640 
make sure we got that bolt all up in
there<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:51.570> magically<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.050> appears<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.620> can

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
there and magically it appears you can

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.960 
there and magically it appears you can
see<00:02:52.800> those<00:02:52.980> shiny<00:02:53.160> bolts<00:02:53.550> sticking<00:02:53.700> out<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
see those shiny bolts sticking out the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.060
