00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.880
 on everyone I come back today 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.740
 introduce you to a palette that I received 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.230
 well just so yesterday so it's a 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.199
 palette that I ordered on ebay and 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.289
 this palette game takes through pau 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.330
 pinette let's say since I had seen 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.070
 had seen her on her channel and I have everything 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.630
 immediately cracked which I wanted 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.490
 absolutely you presence in more 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.830
 delay I present you the little 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.590
 palette of the oracle mark so that's 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.540
 a not to be pro I'm showing you 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.790
 quickly as issue receipts 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.530
 so I'll forgive you anyway 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.690
 put the seller's link in the bar 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.920
 info I paid them I think a 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.920
 fifty euros postage 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.230
 understood and I have the receipts under 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.290
 eight 8 days forgiveness super well packaged 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.630
 so I did receive first of all of course 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.740
 envelope like his bubble and to 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.230
 inside there was a small carton 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:03.010
 like that and still inside there 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.600
 had the paper like that so very very 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.690
 very well packaged so she presents herself 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.240
 like these and it's a palette 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.260
 propal is so that is composed of sixteen 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.990
 lighthouse 8 flagship maths and 8 iridescent and 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.110
 inside of those of this little 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.510
 box if we can call it like that 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.120
 so there is the palette so that I you 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.150
 show right away and like this so 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.460
 who is super super fine super light 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.890
 so when you go on holiday in 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.630
 weekend I think she will replace 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.390
 maneikis so that besides I'm going 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.530
 you compare it 6 compared to the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.460
 naked so 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.260
 so see exactly 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.990
 laura yeah that is a little 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.490
 smaller level length at the level of 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.280
 the height she is a little bit 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.120
 later on saying higher but by 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.710
 against if you look 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.810
 there is no picture she is much more 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.490
 fine is much lighter so 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.170
 much more convenient to carry 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.940
 even if you want to take it 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.600
 in your purse s is widely 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.130
 manageable 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.290
 that's it if you know you 're going a 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.000
 evening that you have here you do not have 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.520
 no opportunity to return home 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.340
 this little palette there is very 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.000
 convenient to carry and therefore to 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.060
 interior 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.750
 apparently so I do not have them yet 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.250
 tested there is hope 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.820
 there is a small eye shadow that 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.390
 is like these and that makes the 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.190
 all that is 5.5 g 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.960
 so what is more than enough 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.980
 as you know the basins your stones 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.050
 it lasts an eternity 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.880
 so we'll go straight to the 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.830
 pallet so she is like this canton 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.010
 louvre inside there is a small 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.100
 mirror so to mark when akpro ago 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.750
 a little plastic that protect it and 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.030
 so it's a palette that you can 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.010
 fold so super practical frankly 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.780
 me it's true that I have a lot of 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.890
 pallets and that's why 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.750
 I would not crack for the weiss 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.820
 Palace cherub indicated because I 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.360
 find that she has already gone really 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.920
 imposing 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.290
 I already have that of the fifteenth 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.870
 birthday and I do not go out because 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.000
 here are the imposing hypers and it's true 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.340
 that most of the time we are great 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.680
 placed and put his voice on what the 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.950
 let us bend her 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.470
 hand 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.780
 she is really super practical so 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.390
 she's like this and we're going 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.239
 pass right away to the farc on the 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:30.739
 part of the top so we have headlights 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:33.680
 maths and on the bottom part we have everything 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.000
 what is taken and satin so these are 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.070
 lighthouses that are a little bit 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.810
 powdery but good a bit like all 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.570
 lighthouses anyway you pat well 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.459
 your brush and there is no problem 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.130
 these are headlights that are ultra ultra 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.209
 ultra pigmented and that hold well I 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.650
 you will admit I have not done any 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.040
 make up with cons I have them 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.660
 switch on my hand and when I wanted 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.060
 remove the swatch and well I had 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.200
 still the footsteps of women and this without 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.550
 eyelid so as much to tell you 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.690
 only with a base in my opinion 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.480
 to have to stand in do first here we have 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.760
 the lighthouse white so off as its name 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.290
 the indicated a dull white I find it 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.870
 but not like the vanilla 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.310
 schema that a kind of beige maths that 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.400
 looks pretty good too I 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.430
 compare to the burn at home so 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.970
 who is the crime 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.440
 we have the top so extinct to the loaf 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.600
 very very good to fade for 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.150
 could very well to fade the 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.780
 girlfriends that makes me think of a yogurt 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.070
 from mac so also emit and 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.550
 which is not bad when we do 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.230
 make-up how to say enough in shades 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.130
 purple in the vise pose for story 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.990
 but it's not bad too 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.680
 here we went purple hues which is a 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.020
 pink means here is mater gas and we have the 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.050
 sand color so there is a marc or 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.790
 means here we have the espresso hue so 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.710
 there is a brown a little darker 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.140
 so matt that makes you think 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.580
 offered espresso from mac but that I 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.050
 finds a lot more spicy is 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.440
 much easier to work finally 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.260
 Here is the color black which for me 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:10.340
 is rather a very dark brown gray 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:14.720
 rather than a black match on a new day that 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.880
 is a how to say a clear iridescent nude 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.250
 and this one is enough powder Nazi camps 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.820
 we have champagne so that looks 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.070
 a lot to urban decay sin so is 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.470
 a pretty 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.470
 yes a pretty rose and with a little bit of 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.080
 pretty irritating gold glitter that is 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.750
 a pretty golden I thought he 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.880
 looked like the half-baked color of 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.130
 at how to say cherves indicated 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.760
 but I find it a little bit 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:46.770
 more orange than alps is so free 11 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:50.629
 it's a lighthouse 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:53.460
 kepa bronze at all I find rather 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:56.400
 what about a cream dark enough finally 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.550
 orange is pretty clear enough I could 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.650
 tell you I see it's a how to say 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.220
 it's a pretty new satin color 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.539
 after 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:09.120
 here we pay him you pay him land and 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:12.720
 this one looks a lot like saintes 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.000
 Mole home mac much it 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.360
 is slightly darker and more 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.139
 intense but here we have the var garnett which 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.729
 is the perfect Duke of the ancient lighthouse of 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:25.650
 at mac and that is absolutely 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:28.349
 beautiful when we make smoky 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.539
 to really be there he is beautiful 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:33.870
 beautiful we have the deep purple that is 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:35.819
 a very dark plum that is absolutely 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.919
 divine for the care required also 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:40.620
 I love this type of colors really 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:43.380
 it shows off any type 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:48.330
 iris I love I love this and then 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:50.479
 here we have the slate shade which is a sandstone 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.590
 who pulls to the beautiful blue 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.719
 really his two aunts there for the 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.180
 who they are they are really 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:59.009
 sublime it's really this one 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.440
 is sumptuous so I'm absolutely 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:03.960
 delighted with this palette there I do not regret 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.870
 absolutely no thanks poppy net of 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.279

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.080
 a palette that is super convenient to 

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:13.380
 carry the headlights are ultra 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.960
 pigmented her and the textures have 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.479
 the air will say that the creamy air have 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.639
 the air is especially for maths 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:23.370
 they look super easy to work 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:25.680
 of course I will tutor you 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.990
 make up to present this palette there 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.909

 little like the nars packaging is
