amazing new applications for the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.570 
amazing new applications for the
technology<00:02:17.810> I've<00:02:18.810> been<00:02:19.050> believing<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.430> this

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
technology I've been believing in this

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.660 
technology I've been believing in this
for<00:02:21.300> almost<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.990> last<00:02:22.140> decade<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.520> we've

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
for almost the last decade and we've

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.280 
for almost the last decade and we've
learned<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.120> much<00:02:24.270> from<00:02:24.330> our<00:02:24.600> community<00:02:25.080> I

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
learned so much from our community I

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.440 
learned so much from our community I
mean<00:02:25.530> they're<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> very<00:02:26.340> vocal<00:02:26.520> community<00:02:27.240> they

mean they're a very vocal community they

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.930 
mean they're a very vocal community they
care<00:02:27.750> passionately<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.740> deeply<00:02:28.830> about<00:02:29.760> what

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
care passionately and deeply about what

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.620 
care passionately and deeply about what
we've<00:02:30.090> created

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
we've created

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.480 
we've created
they've<00:02:30.900> given<00:02:31.050> us<00:02:31.320> so<00:02:31.560> much<00:02:31.920> valuable

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
they've given us so much valuable

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.060 
they've given us so much valuable
impacts<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.590> feedback<00:02:34.590> around<00:02:34.860> what

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
impacts and and feedback around what

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.040 
impacts and and feedback around what
works<00:02:35.280> what<00:02:35.580> doesn't<00:02:35.760> work<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.420> we've<00:02:36.840> taken

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
works what doesn't work and we've taken

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.570 
works what doesn't work and we've taken
all<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.620> into<00:02:37.860> account<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.430> we've

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
all of that into account and we've

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.510 
all of that into account and we've
really<00:02:39.239> tried<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.110> reassess<00:02:40.890> our<00:02:41.070> assumptions

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
really tried to reassess our assumptions

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.150 
really tried to reassess our assumptions
and<00:02:41.790> push<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.840> much<00:02:43.050> harder<00:02:43.110> push<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:44.010> at

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
and push that much harder push it at

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160 
and push that much harder push it at
that<00:02:44.310> much<00:02:44.520> further<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.570> try<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:45.989> create

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
that much further to try and create

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.190 
that much further to try and create
something<00:02:46.500> that's<00:02:46.920> completely

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
something that's completely

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.160 
something that's completely
revolutionary<00:02:49.200> yet<00:02:49.830> again
