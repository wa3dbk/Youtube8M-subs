00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
colorway it is a pretty bright color way

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.980 
colorway it is a pretty bright color way
to<00:00:10.800> begin<00:00:11.070> with<00:00:14.299> so<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.480> see<00:00:15.630> there<00:00:15.809> two

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
to begin with so you see there two

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.269 
to begin with so you see there two
strips<00:00:17.539> and<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.600> stud<00:00:19.080> configuration<00:00:19.320> which

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
strips and you stud configuration which

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.920 
strips and you stud configuration which
basically<00:00:20.609> supposed<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.390> give<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.689> better

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
basically supposed to give you better

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.890 
basically supposed to give you better
grip<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.920> guess<00:00:26.269> that's<00:00:27.269> why<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.510> don't<00:00:27.779> like

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
grip I guess that's why you don't like

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.640 
grip I guess that's why you don't like
you<00:00:28.050> change<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.470> shape<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> studs<00:00:29.189> and

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
you change the shape of the studs and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.840 
you change the shape of the studs and
they<00:00:31.650> are<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> bit<00:00:32.070> clearer<00:00:32.340> as<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.640> can<00:00:32.759> see

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
they are a bit clearer as you can see

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:43.220 
they are a bit clearer as you can see
there<00:00:39.200> there's<00:00:40.200> another<00:00:40.469> one<00:00:41.960> should<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.050> see

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
there there's another one should you see

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.260 
there there's another one should you see
the<00:00:43.680> dimples<00:00:44.129> which<00:00:44.370> basically<00:00:44.820> serve<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the dimples which basically serve the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.380 
the dimples which basically serve the
purpose<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:46.590> know<00:00:46.800> pods<00:00:47.250> had<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.740 

ctr360<00:00:51.390> maestri<00:00:51.660> -<00:00:52.430> there's<00:00:53.430> an<00:00:53.670> instep<00:00:54.449> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
know Mikey change them to just strips

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.520 
know Mikey change them to just strips

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
but basically they share the same

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.380 
but basically they share the same
purpose<00:00:59.160> and<00:01:01.460> those<00:01:02.460> contain<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.059> know<00:01:03.180> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
soft lining here instead of just on the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.280 
soft lining here instead of just on the
tab<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.659> did<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.140> Maestri<00:01:07.650> twos<00:01:07.890> and

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
of control that's symmetrical lacing

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.429 
of control that's symmetrical lacing
overall<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.509> does<00:01:33.659> seem<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.020> pretty<00:01:34.259> good

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
overall it does seem like a pretty good

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.890 
overall it does seem like a pretty good
relation<00:01:35.040> like<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.400> didn't<00:01:35.610> change<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.210> lot<00:01:36.840> of

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
relation like you didn't change a lot of
