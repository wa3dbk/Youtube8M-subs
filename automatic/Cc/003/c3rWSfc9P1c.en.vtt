that you need in this case I'm gonna
control<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:33.920> robot<00:02:34.330> with<00:02:35.330> these<00:02:36.520> with<00:02:37.520> these

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
control the robot with these with these

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.710 
control the robot with these with these
controls<00:02:38.470> with<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:39.650> fader<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.720> this

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
controls with this fader and this

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.570 
controls with this fader and this
fluttery<00:02:42.260> control<00:02:44.830> I'm<00:02:45.830> going<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.220> run<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
fluttery control I'm going to run the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:55.810 
fluttery control I'm going to run the
program

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.320 

so<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.970> demonstration<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:59.430> can<00:02:59.700> go<00:03:00.590> forward

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
so the demonstration you can go forward

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.790 
so the demonstration you can go forward
you<00:03:03.330> can<00:03:03.570> go<00:03:03.750> backward<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:06.320> you<00:03:07.320> can<00:03:07.560> move

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
you can go backward and you can move

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.030 
you can go backward and you can move
there<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:09.060> rubble<00:03:09.380> to<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.500> right<00:03:11.990> and<00:03:12.990> to<00:03:13.040> the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
there the rubble to the right and to the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:29.920 
there the rubble to the right and to the
left

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.800 

and<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.790> now<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.079> right<00:03:34.499> now<00:03:34.530> i<00:03:35.629> am<00:03:36.629> working

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
and and now and right now i am working

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.649 
and and now and right now i am working
with<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:38.450> with<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.480> gravity<00:03:39.810> sensor<00:03:41.239> but<00:03:42.239> i

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
with the with the gravity sensor but i

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.869 
with the with the gravity sensor but i
can<00:03:43.260> i<00:03:43.969> can<00:03:44.969> use<00:03:45.450> both<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:46.079> them<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:47.489> gravity

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
can i can use both of them the gravity

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.520 
can i can use both of them the gravity
sensor<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.680> controls<00:03:50.540> then<00:03:51.540> I've

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
sensor and and the controls then I've

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:03.110 
sensor and and the controls then I've
made<00:03:53.180> in<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.540> Tojo<00:03:54.780> see<00:03:59.299> in<00:04:00.299> this<00:04:01.230> case<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:02.120> need

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
made in the Tojo see in this case I need

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.860 
made in the Tojo see in this case I need
to<00:04:03.239> change<00:04:03.540> their<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:04.769> layout<00:04:07.609> and<00:04:08.609> I<00:04:09.120> need<00:04:09.689> to

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
to change their the layout and I need to

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:19.400 
to change their the layout and I need to
actively<00:04:10.849> rapidly<00:04:11.849> sensor<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:18.509> gonna<00:04:19.049> run

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
actively rapidly sensor and I gonna run

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.990 
actively rapidly sensor and I gonna run
the<00:04:20.479> this<00:04:21.479> program

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000
