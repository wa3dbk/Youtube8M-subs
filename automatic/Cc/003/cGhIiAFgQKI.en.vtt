00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:03.680

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.770
 Now I want to show you my 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.770
 collection and this box 360 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.409
 the world is very very small only three 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.969
 Minpros recently that boxing 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.689
 Well, I wanted no criticism begin 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.419
 my first two games tahrir increased 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.949
 was a coach him have no end of summer 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.419
 speak 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.689
 At first, I wanted to in Kiev 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.689
 we think it is 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.440
 when lost it is not birds singing 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.790
 but to his 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.230
 he is very colorful very big 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.680
 but it came out 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.700
 only tass 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.190
 good what uah 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.600
 I really liked the son of Mikhail Panov 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.280
 sportswoman 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.019
 gray hair giving game 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.400
 on board cup 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.490
 2011 individuals did not boast helped 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.650
 wholesalers are immortal top rated 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.040
 we are lagging behind 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.040
 so here is the disc rubbish 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.490
 a lot of all two pages is very 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.490
 flew a little smaller 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.640
 but have a good playing with other games month 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.870
 In general, they could not open it all 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.900
 there is almost no achievement 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.070
 in the Czech Republic 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.340
 well, the last game I bought the day before yesterday dataart 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.910
 here of course regretted that the supercomputer 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.240
 because computers are russian version 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.890
 and here in this field is passed on 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.500
 English but still essentially it is not 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.110
 changes because it's very interesting there 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.250
 watched weapons do meetings not 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.369
 passed caps on reaching outside of them 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.150
 not enough 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.650
 but the game is good 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.910
 but how is all accent bye speed 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.810
 A new video can do something 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.000
 There review the COP to treat such 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.790
 but all bye
