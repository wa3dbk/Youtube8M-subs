00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.250
 so now that we read the name in 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.449
 the public be the name of font bertrand 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.189
 and that we have it here in the studio the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.849
 coincidence is that while the

 will convert as you are alumni of the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.980

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.320
 here that there is a very important breakfast 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.870
 in German school and then he told me 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.870
 my assistant because question asks 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.010
 If the event is very interesting, 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.510
 oriented so that we all meet 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.990
 the generations of the school's alumni 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:04.480

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:06.550
 no longer exhale one but can go I do not 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.060
 I'm faculty 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.689

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.759

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.009

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.259
