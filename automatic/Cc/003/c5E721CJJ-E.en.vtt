limitation<00:00:41.829> which<00:00:42.250> I<00:00:42.430> find<00:00:42.730> about<00:00:42.910> this<00:00:43.210> phone

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
limitation which I find about this phone

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.360 
limitation which I find about this phone
is<00:00:43.660> that<00:00:43.899> it<00:00:44.590> does<00:00:44.770> not<00:00:44.890> have<00:00:45.130> a<00:00:45.160> memory

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
is that it does not have a memory

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.119 
is that it does not have a memory
expansion<00:00:46.180> slot<00:00:46.420> it<00:00:46.899> has<00:00:47.140> internal<00:00:47.649> 4gb

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
expansion slot it has internal 4gb

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.850 
expansion slot it has internal 4gb
memory<00:00:48.340> out<00:00:48.670> of<00:00:48.850> which<00:00:49.000> 2.8<00:00:49.540> 8gb<00:00:49.870> is<00:00:50.200> available

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860

to the user

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.299 
to the user
so<00:00:51.910> this<00:00:52.059> is<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:52.989> memory<00:00:53.860> which<00:00:54.039> is<00:00:54.129> available

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309
