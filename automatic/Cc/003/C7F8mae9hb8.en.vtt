00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.859
 reports issued by television

 information from Syria has rejected the 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.580
 accusations of opposition warning 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.970
 that 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.630
 jr attack from the us ignite everything 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.610
 middle east despite the evidence 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.310
 some western countries continue 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.400
 accusing the Syrian government of having 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.550
 the Washington attack has already 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.830
 started to consider the military option 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.950
 against syria france has also called 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.650
 to a strong reaction if it is confirmed 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.960
 that bashar al-asad is behind what 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.390
 I call the chemical massacre 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.030
 On the other hand, the United Kingdom accuses 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.120
 Syrian government to carry out the attack 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.180
 but some regional powers think 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.040
 otherwise they will be warned against 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.000
 any military option in Syria 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.010
 saying that there are no regulations 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.440
 international for this act russia 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.900
 also rejects that the Syrian government 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.780
 be behind the chemical attack 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.060
 Moscow described the allegation as a 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.240
 provocation that is against peace 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.100
 in Syria the clearest evidence is the 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.350
 presence of the inspectors of the 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.530
 united nations that are in 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.690
 Damascus 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.750
 invitation of the Syrian government the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.819
 Syrian Chancellor Walid Al Moalem has said 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.520
 that your country cooperates with the mission of 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.560
 inspect the sites affected by 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.920
 the chemical attacks of groups 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.860
 terrorist threats from the us and their 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.650
 allies are not something new for Syria the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.000
 last month of March the president 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.280
 American threatened Syria with the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.069
 military intervention after a 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.680
 gas attack kill 30 people in the 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.989
 city of jan al asad this happened 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.750
 after the Russian mission of 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.570
 inspectors announced that the militants 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.620
 supported by the west they were behind 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.989
 of the attack the recent progress of the 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.269
 Syrian army could be the reason 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.340
 principal that the opposition has 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.340
 asked for foreign intervention
