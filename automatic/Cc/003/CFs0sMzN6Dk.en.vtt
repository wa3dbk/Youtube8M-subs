 in the year 2003 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.200

 the machine went into mint 2005 year 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.150
 tim burton the series of tests and initial validations my breasts 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.560
 our civil engineer corroborated this 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.909
 through my master we who have them get a product to

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.210
 what after what the bars quality safety for the product 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.240
 final and figure of circulation throughout the process of elaboration of the 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.470
 the advantages that existed at home and their white cured grapes

 agents of the cia the last rooms 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.729
 has the same jazz composition 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.899
 this is manifested in having a more stable product and that the drying process 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.009
 of hands we have a regularity 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:17.789
 that otherwise it would be impossible 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:21.119
 the fruits that have unicaja and Santander until they go is a 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:22.139
 water loss 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.930

 drying these products
