tricks<00:00:04.799> that<00:00:05.730> I've<00:00:05.819> recently<00:00:06.029> figured<00:00:06.660> out

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:07.099 
tricks that I've recently figured out

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.009 
tricks that I've recently figured out
well<00:00:08.099> I<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.550> don't<00:00:09.450> know<00:00:09.510> if<00:00:09.599> this<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.750> exactly

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019

how<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.290> tricks<00:00:10.590> are<00:00:10.710> done<00:00:10.740> but<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.160> figured

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
how the tricks are done but I figured

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.160 
how the tricks are done but I figured
out<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.880> way<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.120> doing<00:00:12.360> their<00:00:12.599> tricks<00:00:12.809> anyways

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
out a way of doing their tricks anyways

although common beanie and again I've
incorporated<00:00:21.270> these<00:00:21.750> tricks<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.320> come<00:00:22.710> up

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
incorporated these tricks to come up

deck there's no possible setup involved

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.920 
deck there's no possible setup involved
here<00:00:42.050> we'll<00:00:43.050> mix<00:00:43.320> them<00:00:43.500> up<00:00:43.559> really<00:00:43.800> well<00:00:44.930> give

a couple cuts one more cut ok so then

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.810 
a couple cuts one more cut ok so then
what<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.129> explained<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820

spectator that i'm going to ask them for
questions<00:00:59.460> to<00:01:00.289> arrive<00:01:01.289> at<00:01:01.500> four<00:01:02.329> key<00:01:03.329> words

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
questions to arrive at four key words

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.050 
questions to arrive at four key words
needed<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.860> find<00:01:05.129> their<00:01:05.339> card<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.700> let's<00:01:05.880> say

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
needed to find their card so let's say

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.770 
needed to find their card so let's say
the<00:01:06.350> selected<00:01:07.350> card<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.479> king<00:01:09.689> of

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the selected card is the the king of

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.780 
the selected card is the the king of
clubs<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.770> first<00:01:10.979> question<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.670> there

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
clubs so the first question is is there

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.490 
clubs so the first question is is there
card<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.060> black<00:01:12.270> or<00:01:12.420> red<00:01:12.570> card<00:01:12.840> obviously<00:01:13.260> black

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
card a black or red card obviously black

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.820 
card a black or red card obviously black
so<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.799> spelled<00:01:14.040> black<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.520> l.a<00:01:15.330> see<00:01:15.990> k<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
so we spelled black be l.a see k the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.830 
so we spelled black be l.a see k the
second<00:01:17.640> question<00:01:17.790> would<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.479> their<00:01:18.600> card<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
second question would be is their card a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.679 
second question would be is their card a
figure<00:01:19.170> card<00:01:19.439> court<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:19.920> Court<00:01:19.950> card<00:01:20.400> or<00:01:20.580> a

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
figure card court or Court card or a

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.740 
figure card court or Court card or a
number<00:01:21.689> card<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.640> in<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.759> case<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.509> of

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
number card and in this case that of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.060 
number card and in this case that of
course<00:01:24.869> would<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.380> figure<00:01:25.680> card<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.040> we

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
course would be a figure card so we

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.890 
course would be a figure card so we
spelled<00:01:26.400> f<00:01:26.580> i<00:01:27.229> gu<00:01:28.229> r<00:01:28.650> e<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.430> then<00:01:30.240> i<00:01:30.270> asked<00:01:30.659> them

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
spelled f i gu r e and then i asked them

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.410 
spelled f i gu r e and then i asked them
if<00:01:31.110> their<00:01:31.829> card<00:01:32.159> or<00:01:32.490> what's<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.030> value<00:01:33.180> of

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
if their card or what's the value of

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.399 
if their card or what's the value of
their<00:01:33.570> card<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.799> king<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.310> spell

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
their card it's a king so we spell

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.890 
their card it's a king so we spell
k.i.n.g<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:39.299> suit<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.840> card

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
k.i.n.g and then the suit of the card

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.590 
k.i.n.g and then the suit of the card
would<00:01:40.799> be<00:01:40.829> clubs<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:41.939> case<00:01:42.150> always<00:01:42.420> bail

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
would be clubs in this case always bail

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.100 
would be clubs in this case always bail
see<00:01:42.960> how<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.950> be<00:01:44.460> s<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.149> then<00:01:45.659> believe<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.020> or

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
see how you be s and then believe it or

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.080 
see how you be s and then believe it or
not<00:01:46.200> there<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:47.070> should<00:01:47.280> arrive<00:01:47.579> at<00:01:47.850> their

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
not there we should arrive at their

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.280 
not there we should arrive at their
selected<00:01:48.509> card<00:01:48.720> at<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.079> point<00:01:49.579> so<00:01:50.960> now<00:01:51.960> let's

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
selected card at this point so now let's

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.429 
selected card at this point so now let's
just<00:01:52.470> go<00:01:52.619> ahead<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:54.140> actually<00:01:55.140> do<00:01:55.259> this

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
just go ahead and and actually do this

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.010 
just go ahead and and actually do this
trick<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.979> what<00:01:56.880> happens<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.420> get<00:01:57.479> spectator

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
trick so what happens is I get spectator

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.450 
trick so what happens is I get spectator
to<00:01:58.320> cut<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> cards<00:01:59.159> anywhere<00:01:59.549> just<00:02:00.240> before<00:02:00.750> it

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
to cut the cards anywhere just before it

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.219 
to cut the cards anywhere just before it
half<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.490> deck<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.090> knows<00:02:03.299> not<00:02:03.750> over<00:02:04.079> half

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
half the deck like knows not over half

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.590 
half the deck like knows not over half
the<00:02:04.380> deck<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.250> small<00:02:05.520> packet<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.479> they

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the deck but just a small packet so they

cards they've arrived at a random card

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.449 
cards they've arrived at a random card
and<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.780> magician<00:02:55.140> doesn't<00:02:55.440> see<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.070> card<00:02:56.310> it

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459

also the card is definitely hidden and

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.490

cards as many times as they like and it

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.300 
cards as many times as they like and it
would<00:03:06.030> seem<00:03:06.240> pretty<00:03:06.420> impossible<00:03:06.660> now<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.920> find

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.130 
their card so now what happens is we
take<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.430> rest<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.940> cards<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.750> we<00:03:12.900> set
