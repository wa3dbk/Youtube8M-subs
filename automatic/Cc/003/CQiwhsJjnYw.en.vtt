00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
alright guys so here you have it we're

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.400 
alright guys so here you have it we're
right<00:02:15.150> here<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.940> basic<00:02:17.940> one<00:02:18.209> when<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.260> do

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
right here and the basic one when you do

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.500 
right here and the basic one when you do
this<00:02:19.730> your<00:02:20.730> background

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
this your background

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.770 
this your background
I<00:02:21.690> guess<00:02:21.989> should<00:02:22.380> get<00:02:22.980> removed<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.780> your

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
I guess should get removed and your

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.890 
I guess should get removed and your
taskbar<00:02:25.410> should<00:02:25.800> also<00:02:26.040> lose<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:27.150> little<00:02:27.599> bit<00:02:27.720> of

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
taskbar should also lose a little bit of

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.160 
taskbar should also lose a little bit of
its<00:02:28.050> arrow<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:29.209> if<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.420> didn't<00:02:30.600> like<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.930> of

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
its arrow and if you didn't like that of

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
its arrow and if you didn't like that of
course<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.530> could<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:31.680> always<00:02:32.040> just

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
course you could just always just

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.520 
course you could just always just
rightly<00:02:32.730> go<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:32.970> personalize<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:33.930> do

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530
