00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.460
 and you carcassonne a good come us 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.090
 see if you're a man comes on our 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.090
 chambley track 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:22.250
 like a palette as to you cognacq 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:22.250
 jay 550 days 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.490
 like every two months here we are 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:35.220
 back to chambley for the top 6 numbers 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:35.220
 of 208 nissan gt-r 2014 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.200
 10 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.200
 biturbo 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.240
 for this autopsy after coming 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.760
 try the caterham we use to 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.480
 academy this year big caliber 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.790
 nissan gt-r vintage 2014 550 horses 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.650
 power equivalent to that of the year 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.180
 past but some new things 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.440
 just like we reserve 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.440
 nissan every year 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.560
 11 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.860
 is 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.450
 among the novelties then there's the 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.789
 cosmetic 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.100
 it's rather new arrival of fire 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.520
 full led in the front with a system is 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.780
 does this allowing the directional 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.810
 signature led at the back retaining 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.070
 the circular globes there are some 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.759
 small details of bodywork in particular 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.750
 the chrome arches on the front fenders 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.009
 after for the rest aesthetically he 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.659
 is hard to differentiate them even if a 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.569
 other version is equipped with rims 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.280
 lightened spec v after it's mostly the 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:50.329
 chassis that is reworked one could 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.619
 suppose it has been reworked 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.390
 precisely for more efficiency but this 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.799
 is not the case she feels good neighbor 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.179
 can she have a little better finished and 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.179
 especially she is more comfortable 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.640
 there is not bad 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.230
 but it's really hard passage of the grip 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.490
 back before when so six years ago 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.490
 you do not know how 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.209
 it is 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.660
 then the chassis keeps its system 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.860
 bilstein tronic lady with three modes including 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.160
 you still have the mode is required and 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.930
 fashion 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.849
 obviously the most practical on this 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.489
 circuit against the comfort mode him 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.629
 enjoys among others the usaj of us 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.510
 silent blocks and systems 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.920
 antivibration is actually in 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.349
 veiling with a direction that in addition has 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.299
 been slightly relaxed at low speed 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.010
 the car is much more livable on 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.170
 highway is much more pleasant 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.830
 than in the past and in addition the self has been 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.830
 a sound system 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.510
 if we want to find three positive points 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.860
 on this car I think we can 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.050
 difficult to ignore his 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.190
 rate at this power level level of 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.830
 performance and efficiency 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.850
 a car that off option is displayed 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.730
 less than one hundred thousand euros 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.500
 still quite rare so that's 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.840
 really important 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.030
 know that our model with the spec 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.550
 v so the wheels and the rear wing in 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.140
 carbon matte varnish or from 7500 euros to 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.390
 apart from painting it is the only option 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.580
 which are available a second point 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.660
 is obviously the efficiency that we 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.770
 could bring the facility of 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.130
 driving since one can with this 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.390
 car 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.730
 that's what makes his biggest 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.710
 defect is particularly 8 is 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.350
 particularly effective without 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.790
 to have a truly if not 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.280
 concentrate it's obvious but in all 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.500
 case get excited behind the wheel 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.030
 third quality 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.950
 we could say the grip 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.870
 that's the motricity and the flu is 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.150
 true that my dunlop that are him 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.650
 specific are pretty bluffing they are 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.420
 cupping and in any case on dry ground 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.030
 like today and you have some 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.050
 passing speeds that are staggering 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.100
 we have to go back to 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.870
 several times to keep the tachometer 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.760
 where the registration system of 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.240
 measures to certify that we went to 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.240
 this speed 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.050
 2 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.260
 three negative points that are not 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.300
 Specific to achieve it in 2014 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.220
 could obviously still be talked about 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.720
 of the image deficit of this car by 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.310
 compared to that many get along 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.800
 to define as its competitors 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.530
 whether it's the porsche or vehicles 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.840
 of German origin for the most part 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.740
 that could be the first point 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.140
 me what seems to me more important 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.420
 it is to say that the car I you 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.030
 the saying is stingy in pure sensations 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.350
 in any case it is not very rewarding 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.540
 for the driver who feels 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.760
 finally a little isolated since his role 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.070
 is a little limited the car already going 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.480
 especially fast without having a 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.400
 major application 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.200
 the last point the engine is no longer 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.270
 young he is devilishly effective 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.230
 the rounds he is very torquey on a 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.950
 fairly wide rpm range 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.900
 however it is surprisingly greedy on 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.910
 is far from the console that is announced 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.280
 we are closer actually in 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.810
 particularly mild use of the 15 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.150
 liters at the very least 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.190
 as for the circuit you have 74th 'in the 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.310
 tank do not expect to do more than 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.860
 170 km at a good speed since we exceed 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.570
 briskly the 45 liters and no 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.520
 smoke without fire with its 550 horses the 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.260
 car weighs so after not checking 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.830
 far from a ton 8 it's finally 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.830
 pretty normal 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.050
 t 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.139
 if I were to conclude that at the tac 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.940
 I will try once again persistent 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.880
 and signing tell you he's totally 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.010
 illusory for internet users often 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.810
 which also have only rarely 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.790
 their behind in trying to 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.210
 compare this gt-r coming down from a 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:11.090
 true worthy line of Japanese sportswoman 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:14.000
 I remember very good moments in 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.350
 glass 34 with typically 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.020
 German competitors and in particular the 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.000
 911 who she is 50 years old this year 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.320
 why because anyway the 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.789
 customers do not ask the question on 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.110
 do not hesitate with a 911 we do not hesitate 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:26.120
 not why not with a bmw 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.310
 m6 who also four places that 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.330
 is also a great gt a gt-r se 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.979
 deserves for what she is with a 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.460
 car engineers provided by 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.190
 Japanese 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.720
 passionate we must limit ourselves to that if we 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.250
 just try to compare it 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.229
 to others we can only be disappointed 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.760
 since the car has defects that the 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:41.810
 others do not, however, have there of 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.120
 qualities that are major and that are 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:47.449
 unique ease of driving and great 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.430
 efficiency let's limit it rsa and I hope 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.990
 that everyone will do the same 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.350
 otherwise everyone will be disappointed trying the 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.350
 comparison
