look<00:02:31.140> for<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.410> smaller<00:02:31.770> centuries<00:02:32.370> there's

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
look for the smaller centuries there's

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.510 
look for the smaller centuries there's
two<00:02:33.480> types<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.840> centuries<00:02:34.200> one<00:02:34.530> taller<00:02:35.130> dude

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
two types of centuries one taller dude

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.420 
two types of centuries one taller dude
and<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.850> other<00:02:35.970> one<00:02:36.180> konica<00:02:36.720> imp<00:02:37.050> dude<00:02:37.430> is

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
and the other one konica imp dude is

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.370 
and the other one konica imp dude is
that<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.700> haiti<00:02:38.940> century<00:02:39.480> or<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:39.660> no<00:02:39.990> i<00:02:40.020> can't

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
that the haiti century or so no i can't

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.050 
that the haiti century or so no i can't
i<00:02:40.530> can't<00:02:40.560> remember<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.220> name<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.640> yeah<00:02:41.940> it

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
i can't remember the name of it yeah it

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.640 
i can't remember the name of it yeah it
is<00:02:42.180> whatever<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.750> one<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:42.990> those<00:02:43.140> centuries

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
is whatever is one of those centuries

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.150 
is whatever is one of those centuries
all<00:02:44.250> right<00:02:44.400> but<00:02:45.360> if<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:46.110> launch<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.770> smaller

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
all right but if you launch the smaller

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.100 
all right but if you launch the smaller
stench<00:02:47.490> in<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.730> air<00:02:47.970> like<00:02:48.630> what<00:02:48.840> I'm<00:02:48.900> doing

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
stench in the air like what I'm doing

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.110 
stench in the air like what I'm doing
right<00:02:49.260> now<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:50.370> can<00:02:50.490> actually<00:02:50.580> kill<00:02:50.880> them<00:02:51.030> in

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
right now you can actually kill them in

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.050 
right now you can actually kill them in
one<00:02:51.360> air<00:02:51.660> combo<00:02:52.170> rather<00:02:52.830> than<00:02:53.070> two<00:02:53.400> or<00:02:53.730> three

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
one air combo rather than two or three

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.630 
one air combo rather than two or three
air<00:02:54.660> combos<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.470> took<00:02:56.040> me<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.190> while<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.400> figure

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
air combos and took me a while to figure

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.080 
air combos and took me a while to figure
that<00:02:56.820> out<00:02:57.560> but<00:02:58.560> once<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:58.890> start<00:02:59.090> start

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
that out but once you start start

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.900 
that out but once you start start
looking<00:03:00.330> for<00:03:00.480> them<00:03:00.600> hounding<00:03:01.470> them<00:03:01.590> down

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
looking for them hounding them down

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.850 
looking for them hounding them down
you'll<00:03:02.910> pass<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.540> mission<00:03:03.870> but<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.470> helps<00:03:04.740> to

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
you'll pass the mission but it helps to

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.530 
you'll pass the mission but it helps to
have<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.010> controller<00:03:05.430> with<00:03:05.610> rapid<00:03:06.000> fire<00:03:06.210> yeah

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
have a controller with rapid fire yeah

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.760 
have a controller with rapid fire yeah
whatever<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:09.720> yeah<00:03:09.870> if<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.380> got<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> couple
