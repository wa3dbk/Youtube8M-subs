idea<00:02:20.870> why<00:02:21.700> they<00:02:22.700> finally<00:02:22.970> figured<00:02:23.239> out<00:02:23.300> that

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
idea why they finally figured out that

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.940 
idea why they finally figured out that
were<00:02:23.750> in<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.900> middle<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.290> apocalypse<00:02:24.830> and

therefore chewy is of the essence
chewing<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:28.790> of<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.000> essence<00:02:29.330> that's<00:02:29.569> the

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
chewing is of the essence that's the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.390 
chewing is of the essence that's the
