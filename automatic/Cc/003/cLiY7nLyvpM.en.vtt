HD<00:01:07.660> ratio<00:01:08.660> on<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.500> TV<00:01:09.890> monitor<00:01:10.130> if<00:01:10.910> you<00:01:11.240> have

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
HD ratio on the TV monitor if you have

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
HD ratio on the TV monitor if you have
your<00:01:11.720> info<00:01:12.230> on<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:13.130> monitor<00:01:13.730> like<00:01:13.970> that

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
your info on the monitor like that

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.100 
your info on the monitor like that
you'll<00:01:15.530> actually<00:01:15.800> crop<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.760> side<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.480> the

you'll actually crop the side and the

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.430 
you'll actually crop the side and the
top<00:01:18.380> as<00:01:18.620> well<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.220> what<00:01:19.370> you<00:01:19.400> have<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.670> do<00:01:19.970> is

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
top as well so what you have to do is

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.650 
top as well so what you have to do is
push<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.590> info<00:01:21.920> button<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:22.490> get<00:01:23.120> rid<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:23.360> all

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
push the info button and get rid of all

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.170 
push the info button and get rid of all
the<00:01:23.750> info<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:24.710> it's<00:01:24.860> kind<00:01:25.100> of<00:01:25.190> not<00:01:26.000> too

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
the info so it's kind of not too

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.090 
the info so it's kind of not too
convenient<00:01:26.540> not<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.960> able<00:01:27.080> to<00:01:27.230> see<00:01:27.530> anything

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
convenient not to able to see anything

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.540 
convenient not to able to see anything
you<00:01:28.880> can<00:01:29.060> still<00:01:29.330> see<00:01:29.600> on<00:01:29.810> 70<00:01:30.290> on<00:01:30.410> top<00:01:30.680> LCD<00:01:31.340> you

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
you can still see on 70 on top LCD you

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.270 
you can still see on 70 on top LCD you
can<00:01:31.850> still<00:01:32.120> see<00:01:32.330> your<00:01:33.010> aperture<00:01:34.010> shutter

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
can still see your aperture shutter

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.720 
can still see your aperture shutter
speed<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:35.270> ISO<00:01:35.510> but<00:01:36.410> you<00:01:37.130> can't<00:01:37.430> under

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
speed and ISO but you can't under

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.040 
speed and ISO but you can't under
monitor<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:38.300> that's<00:01:38.510> one<00:01:38.750> bad<00:01:38.990> thing<00:01:39.020> about<00:01:39.290> it

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
monitor so that's one bad thing about it

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.300 
monitor so that's one bad thing about it
so<00:01:42.220> when<00:01:43.220> I<00:01:43.250> start<00:01:43.670> recording<00:01:44.500> its<00:01:45.500> records

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
so when I start recording its records

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.980 
so when I start recording its records
right<00:01:46.520> away<00:01:46.790> as<00:01:47.480> you<00:01:48.140> can<00:01:48.350> see<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.810> it<00:01:50.810> gets

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
right away as you can see and it gets

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.250 
right away as you can see and it gets
you<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.230> red<00:01:51.409> dot<00:01:51.620> on<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:51.920> TV<00:01:52.750> that's<00:01:53.750> showing

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.880 
you the red dot on the TV that's showing
that<00:01:54.380> I'm<00:01:54.590> recording<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.960> I'm<00:01:57.409> gonna<00:01:57.560> do<00:01:57.770> the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
that I'm recording and I'm gonna do the

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.890 
that I'm recording and I'm gonna do the
same<00:01:58.100> test<00:01:58.400> so<00:01:58.760> even<00:01:59.150> if<00:01:59.240> I<00:01:59.360> start<00:01:59.750> recording

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
same test so even if I start recording

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.770 
same test so even if I start recording
on<00:02:00.470> 70<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.100> doesn't<00:02:01.460> really<00:02:01.670> change<00:02:01.970> anything

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
on 70 it doesn't really change anything

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.770 
on 70 it doesn't really change anything
and<00:02:03.229> there's<00:02:03.560> no<00:02:03.880> nothing<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:05.030> just<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.659> know

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
and there's no nothing you just you know

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.930 
and there's no nothing you just you know
start<00:02:06.110> recording<00:02:06.500> it<00:02:06.590> right<00:02:06.710> away<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.130> I<00:02:07.550> did

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940

so<00:02:20.220> now<00:02:20.430> I'm<00:02:20.640> shooting<00:02:20.819> with<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.150> t2i<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:22.200> is

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
so now I'm shooting with the t2i this is

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.839 
so now I'm shooting with the t2i this is
a<00:02:22.380> standby<00:02:22.830> mode<00:02:22.920> right<00:02:23.370> now

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
a standby mode right now

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.059 
a standby mode right now
so<00:02:24.180> as<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.989> can<00:02:25.140> see<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.440> same<00:02:25.620> thing<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
so as you can see the same thing the

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.940 
so as you can see the same thing the
info<00:02:26.520> on<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.940> bottom<00:02:27.330> when<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.349> info<00:02:28.709> shows

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
info on the bottom when the info shows

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.520 
info on the bottom when the info shows
up<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.550> crops<00:02:30.300> on<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.780> side<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:31.290> I'm<00:02:31.380> gonna

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
up it crops on the side so I'm gonna

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.350 
up it crops on the side so I'm gonna
turn<00:02:31.739> off<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.190> info<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:35.550> fills<00:02:35.819> out<00:02:36.060> the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
turn off the info and it fills out the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.559 
turn off the info and it fills out the
it<00:02:36.959> feels<00:02:37.230> out<00:02:37.380> nicely<00:02:37.920> throughout<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.060> HT

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
it feels out nicely throughout the HT

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.500 
it feels out nicely throughout the HT
minor<00:02:39.750> just<00:02:40.110> like<00:02:40.290> what<00:02:40.800> 7d<00:02:41.580> was<00:02:41.760> doing<00:02:42.150> and

even top as well so that's the screen
that<00:03:31.470> we<00:03:31.620> you'll<00:03:31.799> see<00:03:32.070> when<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:32.820> actually<00:03:33.180> put

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
that we you'll see when you actually put

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.650 
that we you'll see when you actually put
this<00:03:33.750> info<00:03:34.560> button<00:03:34.980> on<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.150> can<00:03:36.329> actually

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
this info button on and I can actually

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.599 
this info button on and I can actually
turn<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.049> on<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.380> off<00:03:37.500> while<00:03:38.130> I'm<00:03:38.310> recording

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
turn it on and off while I'm recording

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.630 
turn it on and off while I'm recording
and<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.000> can<00:03:39.180> see<00:03:39.510> what's<00:03:40.290> going<00:03:40.380> on<00:03:40.769> and<00:03:41.430> I'm

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
and you can see what's going on and I'm

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.550 
and you can see what's going on and I'm
shooting<00:03:41.820> exactly<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.450> same<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:42.930> guess<00:03:43.410> so

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
shooting exactly the same I guess so

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.380 
shooting exactly the same I guess so
it's<00:03:43.680> 200<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:46.470> aperture<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.489> 2.8<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.150> the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
it's 200 and the aperture is 2.8 and the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.210 
it's 200 and the aperture is 2.8 and the
shutter<00:03:48.630> speed<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.109> 150th<00:03:49.650> of<00:03:49.799> a<00:03:49.829> second

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
shutter speed is the 150th of a second

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.920 
shutter speed is the 150th of a second
I'm<00:03:50.340> shooting<00:03:50.670> in<00:03:50.790> Full<00:03:51.359> HD<00:03:51.480> 24<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.570> should

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
I'm shooting in Full HD 24 so I should

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.319 
I'm shooting in Full HD 24 so I should
really<00:03:55.200> try<00:03:55.609> let<00:03:56.609> me<00:03:56.640> try<00:03:56.910> one<00:03:56.940> more<00:03:57.120> time

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
really try let me try one more time

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.509 
really try let me try one more time
because<00:03:57.510> I<00:03:57.660> didn't<00:03:58.079> do<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.739> info<00:03:59.190> button

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
because I didn't do the info button

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.710 
because I didn't do the info button
while<00:03:59.819> I'm<00:03:59.970> recording<00:04:00.299> if<00:04:00.600> that<00:04:00.870> affects<00:04:01.230> the

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
through the info see if it changes

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.800 
through the info see if it changes
everything<00:04:33.620> so<00:04:33.980> right<00:04:34.220> now<00:04:34.450> we<00:04:35.450> don't<00:04:35.600> have

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
everything so right now we don't have

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.500 
everything so right now we don't have
any<00:04:36.050> info<00:04:36.440> once<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.980> info<00:04:37.280> comes<00:04:37.520> up<00:04:37.760> it<00:04:38.210> crops

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
any info once the info comes up it crops

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.720 
any info once the info comes up it crops
down<00:04:38.750> on<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:38.990> side<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:40.280> bottom<00:04:40.430> and<00:04:40.670> the

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
down on the side and the bottom and the

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.330 
down on the side and the bottom and the
top<00:04:40.760> but<00:04:41.120> it<00:04:41.240> shows<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:42.650> info<00:04:43.070> on<00:04:43.220> the

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
top but it shows the the info on the

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.720 
top but it shows the the info on the
side<00:04:43.580> where<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.850> black<00:04:44.300> area<00:04:45.200> is<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:46.490> I<00:04:46.520> guess

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
side where the black area is so I guess

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.600 
side where the black area is so I guess
it's<00:04:46.940> being<00:04:47.180> used<00:04:47.540> but<00:04:47.960> not<00:04:47.990> as<00:04:48.410> just<00:04:48.710> you<00:04:49.520> know

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
it's being used but not as just you know

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.220 
it's being used but not as just you know
full<00:04:50.290> resolutions<00:04:51.400> so<00:04:52.400> right<00:04:52.730> now<00:04:52.990> I'm<00:04:53.990> gonna
