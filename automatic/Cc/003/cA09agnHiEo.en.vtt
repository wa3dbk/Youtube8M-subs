00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.289
 it's a really new experience 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.910
 fascinating because image you are a 48 year old professional doing 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.900
 improvisation 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.900
 and suddenly loki right in the words puts it in the mouth of the character 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.360
 it's really learning I think that's why I say in life we ​​have 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.570
 what to learn hundred 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.570
 I'm learning here 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.410
 I think it turned out to be an honor. 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.750
 and you feel it for the seriousness that it is a product 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.260
 that worked well in the first one will work out in the second one has no doubt 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.430
 and by club repercussion 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.430
 I had it inside my own home, right? 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.810
 I'm putting a lot of shit in our traditions. 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.050
 and why is she better position right? 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.050
 have a bit of a motel a bit of 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.950
 but if I have no doubt that the post what I know how to do 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.250
 I can only thank God and thank the disney studios who 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.800
 gave this opportunity 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.380
 but it's one thing I never imagined doing in life cicerone only in pmdb 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.070
 just say soccer club started at copa d'or where I think fantastic 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.910
 I think the incredible Latin family 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.200
 I love pluto 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.200
 at the opportunity he got dumped 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.370
 Southern Africa, I do not think I would be able to double the role of 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.830
 preposterous 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.560
 but I would start what I like would be an option 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.390
 I really would 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.700
 but I think it would not have capacity for the advertiser would like double 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.019
 It will also be kind of difficult, right? 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.019
 I confess that it is difficult 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:20.289

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:21.039
