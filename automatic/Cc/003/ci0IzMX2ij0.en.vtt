area today we worry about this being the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.900 
area today we worry about this being the
third<00:00:48.890> heatwave<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> summer<00:00:50.460> season<00:00:50.670> this

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
third heatwave of the summer season this

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.819 
third heatwave of the summer season this
will<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> third<00:00:51.449> day<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.780> row<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:52.500> 90

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
will be the third day in a row with 90

will be the third day in a row with 90
plus<00:00:53.039> temperatures<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.789> yes<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.270> will

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
plus temperatures so yes this will

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.810 
plus temperatures so yes this will
likely<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.260> heatwave<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.190> could<00:00:56.370> continue

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
likely be a heatwave and could continue

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.939 
likely be a heatwave and could continue
into<00:00:56.969> your<00:00:57.180> workweek<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.840> well<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:58.710> all

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
into your workweek as well but then all

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.130 
into your workweek as well but then all
