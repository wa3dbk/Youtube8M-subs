common mistake I always see is people

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.720 
common mistake I always see is people
focusing<00:00:07.259> on<00:00:07.410> picking<00:00:07.680> counters<00:00:08.099> or<00:00:08.340> blindly

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
focusing on picking counters or blindly

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.490 
focusing on picking counters or blindly
copying<00:00:09.150> what<00:00:09.269> they<00:00:09.389> see<00:00:09.540> pros<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.110> streamers

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
copying what they see pros and streamers

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.499 
copying what they see pros and streamers
do<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.280> obviously<00:00:11.429> can<00:00:11.849> work<00:00:12.000> sometimes

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
do and this obviously can work sometimes

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.999 
do and this obviously can work sometimes
but<00:00:12.780> usually<00:00:13.019> only<00:00:13.230> when<00:00:13.590> you're<00:00:13.679> playing<00:00:13.860> it

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
but usually only when you're playing it

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.680 
but usually only when you're playing it
to<00:00:14.070> neither<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.460> don't<00:00:14.700> belong<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.000> for
