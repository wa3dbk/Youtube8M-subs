would like just be able to use the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.680 
would like just be able to use the
super-strength<00:02:24.950> like<00:02:25.340> quickly<00:02:26.180> go<00:02:26.390> under<00:02:26.570> the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
super-strength like quickly go under the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.270 
super-strength like quickly go under the
plane<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.170> I<00:02:27.230> don't<00:02:27.290> know<00:02:27.470> yank<00:02:27.800> off<00:02:28.010> the

plane and I don't know yank off the
wheels<00:02:28.700> or<00:02:28.970> something<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:34.340> much<00:02:34.489> easier

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
wheels or something and so much easier

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.640 
wheels or something and so much easier
just<00:02:35.090> keep<00:02:35.810> recording<00:02:35.959> or<00:02:36.260> no<00:02:36.380> because<00:02:36.500> I

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
just keep recording or no because I

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.310 
just keep recording or no because I

tracer<00:03:21.440> told<00:03:21.650> us<00:03:21.740> -<00:03:21.920> Oh<00:03:27.610> wonderful<00:03:28.640> oh<00:03:34.030> fuck

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
tracer told us - Oh wonderful oh fuck

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:45.100 
tracer told us - Oh wonderful oh fuck
let's<00:03:35.210> get<00:03:35.360> water<00:03:40.210> let's<00:03:41.210> do<00:03:41.390> this<00:03:43.930> no<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:44.960> don't

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
let's get water let's do this no I don't

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.010 
let's get water let's do this no I don't
think<00:03:45.260> actually<00:03:46.390> you<00:03:47.390> think<00:03:47.420> about<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.930> that

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
think actually you think about it that

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.450 
think actually you think about it that
rocket<00:03:48.380> launchers<00:03:48.650> would<00:03:48.830> actually<00:03:49.130> be<00:03:49.220> kind

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.460 
rocket launchers would actually be kind

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.160 
rocket launchers would actually be kind
of<00:03:49.520> useful<00:03:49.700> just<00:03:50.000> know<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:50.630> one<00:03:50.780> naturally

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
of useful just know that one naturally

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.340 
of useful just know that one naturally
one<00:03:51.410> with<00:03:51.560> talking<00:03:51.710> about<00:03:51.920> too<00:03:52.580> slow

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
one with talking about too slow

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.320 
one with talking about too slow
experiment<00:03:54.350> is<00:03:54.410> too<00:03:54.620> agile<00:03:55.220> um<00:03:55.490> cones<00:03:56.240> would

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
experiment is too agile um cones would

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.570 
experiment is too agile um cones would
be<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:56.480> lot<00:03:56.660> better<00:03:57.130> even<00:03:58.130> though<00:03:58.280> they've

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
be a lot better even though they've

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.830 
be a lot better even though they've
clearly<00:03:58.940> failed<00:03:59.240> before<00:03:59.390> but<00:03:59.950> not<00:04:00.950> as<00:04:01.070> bad<00:04:01.220> as

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
clearly failed before but not as bad as

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.040 
clearly failed before but not as bad as
rocket<00:04:02.840> launchers

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.900 

that<00:04:06.680> was<00:04:06.770> like<00:04:06.890> that<00:04:07.250> was<00:04:07.340> not<00:04:07.460> a<00:04:07.520> rocket

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
that was like that was not a rocket

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.460 
that was like that was not a rocket
launch<00:04:08.060> that's<00:04:08.240> like<00:04:08.390> a<00:04:08.420> grenade<00:04:08.810> launcher<00:04:09.290> Oh

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
launch that's like a grenade launcher Oh

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.940 
launch that's like a grenade launcher Oh
Oh<00:04:11.290> spider-man<00:04:12.290> what<00:04:13.070> if<00:04:13.850> I<00:04:13.940> went<00:04:14.150> up<00:04:14.830> if<00:04:15.830> I

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
Oh spider-man what if I went up if I

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.039 
Oh spider-man what if I went up if I
crashed<00:04:16.190> up<00:04:16.400> on<00:04:16.580> the<00:04:16.700> d-pad<00:04:16.880> it<00:04:17.750> would<00:04:17.930> have

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
crashed up on the d-pad it would have

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.830 
crashed up on the d-pad it would have
gone<00:04:18.170> his<00:04:18.530> version<00:04:18.920> of<00:04:19.190> up<00:04:19.370> which<00:04:20.000> is<00:04:20.180> down<00:04:20.450> and

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
gone his version of up which is down and

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.600 
gone his version of up which is down and
if<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.260> press<00:04:21.500> down<00:04:21.769> on<00:04:21.920> the<00:04:22.010> d-pad<00:04:22.160> it<00:04:22.520> would

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
if I press down on the d-pad it would

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.280 
if I press down on the d-pad it would
have<00:04:22.700> done<00:04:22.820> my<00:04:22.970> version<00:04:23.240> of<00:04:23.420> and<00:04:23.810> would<00:04:24.200> have

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
have done my version of and would have

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:32.170 
have done my version of and would have
gone<00:04:24.410> down<00:04:24.560> at<00:04:24.770> all<00:04:30.040> a<00:04:31.040> little<00:04:31.580> overkill<00:04:32.000> don't

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
gone down at all a little overkill don't

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:44.900 
gone down at all a little overkill don't
you<00:04:32.270> think

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.930 

this<00:04:45.910> is<00:04:46.090> really<00:04:46.270> like<00:04:47.099> the<00:04:48.099> difficulty<00:04:48.819> of

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
this is really like the difficulty of

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.610 
this is really like the difficulty of
the<00:04:49.060> game<00:04:49.090> really<00:04:49.599> pretty<00:04:50.229> much<00:04:50.319> the<00:04:50.500> reason

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
the game really pretty much the reason

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.379 
the game really pretty much the reason
why<00:04:50.949> a<00:04:50.979> my<00:04:51.400> opinion<00:04:51.759> it<00:04:53.789> like<00:04:54.789> the<00:04:54.970> first<00:04:55.120> game

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
why a my opinion it like the first game

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.870 
why a my opinion it like the first game
was<00:04:55.569> slightly<00:04:55.960> difficult<00:04:56.139> in<00:04:56.770> some<00:04:57.250> areas<00:04:57.610> but

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
was slightly difficult in some areas but

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.559 
was slightly difficult in some areas but
never<00:04:58.569> to<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.990> own<00:04:59.490> extent<00:05:00.490> that<00:05:00.759> it<00:05:01.150> made<00:05:01.389> you

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
never to the own extent that it made you

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.890 
never to the own extent that it made you
wanna<00:05:01.780> quit<00:05:01.990> playing<00:05:02.259> and<00:05:03.330> this<00:05:04.330> was<00:05:04.569> really

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
wanna quit playing and this was really

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.879 
wanna quit playing and this was really
just<00:05:06.060> frustration<00:05:07.060> that<00:05:07.440> just<00:05:08.440> makes<00:05:08.710> you

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
just frustration that just makes you

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.370 
just frustration that just makes you
really<00:05:09.340> just<00:05:09.870> want<00:05:10.870> to<00:05:10.960> put<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:11.199> game<00:05:11.319> down

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
really just want to put the game down

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.170 
really just want to put the game down
for<00:05:11.740> a<00:05:11.800> bit<00:05:12.479> and<00:05:13.479> it's<00:05:13.660> not<00:05:13.720> good<00:05:15.150> it's<00:05:16.150> not

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
for a bit and it's not good it's not

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.399 
for a bit and it's not good it's not
really<00:05:16.449> that<00:05:16.630> the<00:05:16.690> game<00:05:16.870> is<00:05:16.990> too<00:05:17.199> difficult

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
really that the game is too difficult

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:23.040 
really that the game is too difficult
but<00:05:17.860> it's<00:05:18.819> it's<00:05:19.210> fairly<00:05:19.750> easy<00:05:19.900> but<00:05:21.690> there's<00:05:22.690> so

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
but it's it's fairly easy but there's so

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.230 
but it's it's fairly easy but there's so
many<00:05:23.229> like<00:05:25.470> cheap<00:05:26.470> of<00:05:27.069> a<00:05:27.460> whittle<00:05:27.759> deaths<00:05:28.000> that

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
many like cheap of a whittle deaths that

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:37.189 
many like cheap of a whittle deaths that
happened<00:05:28.630> and<00:05:28.750> it<00:05:28.840> really<00:05:29.050> pisses<00:05:29.229> you<00:05:29.409> off

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:58.940 

you<00:05:37.860> can't<00:05:38.219> stick<00:05:38.550> to<00:05:38.580> walls<00:05:39.060> nine<00:05:39.960> and<00:05:40.469> an<00:05:40.830> O

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.970 

I<00:06:00.050> think<00:06:01.050> we<00:06:01.110> might<00:06:01.260> have<00:06:01.410> it<00:06:01.620> now

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
I think we might have it now

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.470 
I think we might have it now
I<00:06:02.010> mean<00:06:02.340> Arsenal<00:06:02.790> strength<00:06:03.030> is<00:06:03.180> pretty<00:06:03.390> much

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
I mean Arsenal strength is pretty much

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.510 
I mean Arsenal strength is pretty much
perfect<00:06:03.750> and<00:06:04.140> we're<00:06:04.230> pretty<00:06:04.920> much<00:06:05.100> not<00:06:05.310> gonna

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
perfect and we're pretty much not gonna

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.820 
perfect and we're pretty much not gonna
lose<00:06:05.610> this<00:06:05.820> now<00:06:06.000> yeah<00:06:06.930> basically<00:06:07.170> the<00:06:07.470> similar

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
lose this now yeah basically the similar

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.460 
lose this now yeah basically the similar
strength<00:06:08.010> is<00:06:08.190> basically<00:06:08.580> like<00:06:09.110> if<00:06:10.110> you<00:06:10.260> go<00:06:10.410> too

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
strength is basically like if you go too

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.770 
strength is basically like if you go too
far<00:06:10.740> away<00:06:10.860> from<00:06:10.950> the<00:06:11.220> helicopter<00:06:11.490> you'll<00:06:12.090> lose

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
far away from the helicopter you'll lose

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.260 
far away from the helicopter you'll lose
pretty<00:06:13.080> much<00:06:13.200> and<00:06:13.940> yeah

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
pretty much and yeah

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:26.490 
pretty much and yeah
we're<00:06:15.960> doing<00:06:16.170> really<00:06:16.290> good<00:06:16.740> so<00:06:17.370> oh<00:06:18.920> my<00:06:19.920> god
