00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
you would have one of these things

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.170 
you would have one of these things
instead<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:46.140> traditional<00:00:46.350> PC<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.520> the

reason a lot of companies have moved
toward<00:00:49.890> these<00:00:50.039> devices<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.789> because<00:00:51.480> they

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
toward these devices is because they

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.270 
toward these devices is because they
want<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.930> take<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> hard<00:00:52.500> disk<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.010> get<00:00:53.160> it

want to take the hard disk and get it
off<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.820> desk<00:00:54.030> they<00:00:54.449> want<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.719> move<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> data

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
you'd expect on a PC we've got a couple

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.289 
you'd expect on a PC we've got a couple
of<00:01:06.840> USB<00:01:07.140> ports<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> front<00:01:08.340> we've<00:01:09.090> got<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
of USB ports on the front we've got a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.870

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
couple more USB ports on the back we've

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.179 
couple more USB ports on the back we've
got<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.350> DisplayPort<00:01:13.350> we've<00:01:13.560> got<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> DVI

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
got a DisplayPort we've got a DVI

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.700 
got a DisplayPort we've got a DVI
interface<00:01:14.820> we've<00:01:15.180> got<00:01:15.330> Ethernet<00:01:15.900> there's<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
interface we've got Ethernet there's a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.160 
interface we've got Ethernet there's a
mic<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.729> power<00:01:17.970> buttons<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> front<00:01:18.659> so

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
mic in the power buttons on the front so

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.620 
mic in the power buttons on the front so
the<00:01:19.409> point<00:01:19.979> about<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.479> all

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the point about this is that you get all

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.149 
the point about this is that you get all
the<00:01:21.750> connectivity<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.590> you're<00:01:22.770> used<00:01:23.009> to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the connectivity that you're used to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.700 
the connectivity that you're used to
from<00:01:23.310> using<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:23.820> pc<00:01:24.080> but<00:01:25.080> instead<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.619> have

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
from using your pc but instead you have

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.289 
from using your pc but instead you have
this<00:01:25.830> little<00:01:26.070> device<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.460> has<00:01:26.909> no<00:01:27.119> moving

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
this little device that has no moving

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.050 
this little device that has no moving
parts<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.869> no<00:01:28.020> disk<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.220> advantage<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
parts of no disk so the advantage to the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.149 
parts of no disk so the advantage to the
enterprise<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:31.049> if<00:01:31.650> you've<00:01:31.920> got

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
enterprise is that if you've got

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.980 
enterprise is that if you've got
thousands<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.850> these<00:01:33.000> out<00:01:33.240> there<00:01:33.479> are<00:01:33.600> tens<00:01:33.840> of

thousands of these out there are tens of
thousands<00:01:34.500> you're<00:01:34.650> now<00:01:34.770> managing<00:01:35.250> them<00:01:35.369> all

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520
