00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
flagship isn't it well yeah I guess so

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.339 
flagship isn't it well yeah I guess so
well<00:00:30.519> that<00:00:30.730> proves<00:00:31.000> it<00:00:31.179> Captain<00:00:31.960> Kirk<00:00:32.169> is<00:00:32.290> the

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
well that proves it Captain Kirk is the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
that's why he was assigned command to

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.920 
that's why he was assigned command to
the<00:00:35.769> Federation<00:00:36.160> selection<00:00:36.750> excuse<00:00:37.750> me
