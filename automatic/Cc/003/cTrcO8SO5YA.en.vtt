00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
percent so I think I'm going to use the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.940 
percent so I think I'm going to use the
Valkyries<00:02:40.599> a<00:02:40.629> little<00:02:40.900> bit<00:02:41.019> more<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.799> only

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
Valkyries a little bit more the only

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.729 
Valkyries a little bit more the only
down<00:02:42.400> side<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:43.329> the<00:02:43.750> Valkyries<00:02:44.170> are<00:02:44.319> that<00:02:44.500> they

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
down side of the Valkyries are that they

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.149 
down side of the Valkyries are that they
cost<00:02:45.430> fifteen<00:02:46.299> minutes<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.870> Train<00:02:47.140> so<00:02:47.980> that

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
cost fifteen minutes to Train so that

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.500 
cost fifteen minutes to Train so that
sucks<00:02:49.079> but<00:02:50.099> for<00:02:51.099> just<00:02:51.760> if<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.180> make<00:02:52.389> them

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
sucks but for just if you make them

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.180 
sucks but for just if you make them
overnight<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.379> doesn't<00:02:53.799> matter<00:02:53.950> because

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
overnight that doesn't matter because

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.490 
overnight that doesn't matter because
you<00:02:55.000> know<00:02:55.090> you're<00:02:55.750> sleeping<00:02:55.930> when<00:02:56.319> they're

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
you know you're sleeping when they're

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.699 
you know you're sleeping when they're
training<00:02:57.159> so<00:02:57.730> maybe<00:02:58.599> I<00:02:58.720> shouldn't<00:02:59.200> even<00:02:59.319> use

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
training so maybe I shouldn't even use

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.819 
training so maybe I shouldn't even use
