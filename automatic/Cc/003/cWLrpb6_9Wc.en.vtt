00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:20.430 
other and then at the front of the bed
I've<00:05:13.780> planted<00:05:14.229> kale<00:05:16.020> now<00:05:17.070> I've<00:05:18.070> used<00:05:19.440> all

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
I've planted kale now I've used all

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.520 
I've planted kale now I've used all
kinds<00:05:21.130> of<00:05:21.190> stuff<00:05:21.460> that<00:05:21.669> I've<00:05:21.760> shredded<00:05:22.150> as<00:05:23.080> a

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
kinds of stuff that I've shredded as a

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.820 
kinds of stuff that I've shredded as a
mulch<00:05:24.300> and<00:05:25.300> that<00:05:25.539> was<00:05:25.720> a<00:05:25.750> green<00:05:26.050> mulch<00:05:26.380> but<00:05:26.800> I

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
mulch and that was a green mulch but I

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.500 
mulch and that was a green mulch but I
think<00:05:27.130> it's<00:05:27.250> actually<00:05:27.400> starting<00:05:27.820> to<00:05:28.120> feed<00:05:28.330> the

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
think it's actually starting to feed the

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.450 
think it's actually starting to feed the
bed<00:05:28.690> now<00:05:29.020> because<00:05:29.229> it's<00:05:29.560> rotted<00:05:29.889> down<00:05:29.919> I<00:05:32.460> got
