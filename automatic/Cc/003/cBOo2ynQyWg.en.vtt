00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.770
 news and in the United States man was 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.570
 arrested for enjoying photos of ex girlfriend 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.060
 I'll tell you the case. 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.849
 the guy basically chased the girl to 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.720
 got java and even threatened because of 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.059
 In addition, state justice has determined that 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.950
 could not reach so many meters from the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.170
 girl and everything else 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.960
 and this week the guy liked some 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.170
 photos and videos of her facebook and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.840
 cause of this is justice determined the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.870
 his prison then it seems that there the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.039
 Justice really takes the law seriously 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.340
 recently a brand new 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.219
 smartphones called zouk oz 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.680
 ca announced its first smartphone in the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.530
 What is the lenovo support for the investment project? 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.380
 the money more and now this same brand 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.229
 is revealed a very prototype 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.200
 interesting desmartphones with the body 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.240
 fully transparent on account of not 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.909
 have access to no video or the team 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.040
 showing business in operation but 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.409
 also made some pictures come out of the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.330
 appliance working 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.210
 You can see there's a box underneath. 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.100
 which is probably where the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.640
 device hardware to screen 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.470
 probably only displays the content is not 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.990
 There's nothing we'll say like that from a 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.439
 invisible transparent hardware or something 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.270
 type but the concept is well 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.420
 cool and hopefully in the future if I can 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.619
