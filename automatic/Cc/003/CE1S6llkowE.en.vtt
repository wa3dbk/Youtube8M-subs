00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.129
 good morning here I was preparing a 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.129
 once we have finished the work 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:23.060
 and I have it there in my house and we have 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.220
 an uncle that helps me make these little things 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.280
 because it's just that mom prevents you 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.620
 do it hot pink wigs william 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.810
 lopez 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.170
 and we are the artists of houses of 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.170
 brain 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:50.520
 formerly typical here too 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.740
 wait to take refuge in the red 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.080
 by some storm in the days of the 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.850
 life this was a challenge I had to do 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.520
 a cuckoo made bake out there and 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.050
 works of these stone classes but a 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.960
 cuckoo had never done this is made of 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.090
 stone and mud there is nothing else for 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.670
 inside proposing the pretty faces of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.290
 the stone this is the oriented and the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.240
 right to the other box but 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.420
 he usually gets had to be here 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.119
 at noon because they inherit their car day and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.750
 get more into heat these things where 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.490
 I must work as a painting sculpture 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:32.720
 and that makes me fall in love with this, I think it's going 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:32.720
 to be the most the one who puts on the cake 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.399
 many better the up as it goes 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.399
 closing 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.530
 in the cuckoo is very different from the arches 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.530
 to the stone arches to the arches of 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.780
 half a point in the closed positions and 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.850
 closing as the key closes 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.939
 gathering the stones the constructions 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.890
 is what I have worked but now as I 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.890
 I say more to sculpture 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.130
 give to me 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:17.330
 the rod that is inside and to the left 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:23.840
 made of stone they have a curse 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:26.209
 says of easel mason's pawn 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.420
 this work is fine because it 's a good 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.550
 Exercise and apart is alone 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.300
 This is noble art I love 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:40.060
 see this and I participate in this as if 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.060
 outside a work of art is a monument 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.490
 Of course it has to be like that 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.830
 do not 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.690
 because this other other things of my 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.820
 work of what I do then I am now 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.300
 doing a quixote I already have it more or 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.480
 less organized let's see there is a 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.890
 thing that I like very much is 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.110
 the animals then also some 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.200
 scenes even this one that is catching 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.660
 mushrooms a shepherd can be perfectly 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:39.140
 dare 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:41.300
 the shepherd and his sheep Don Quixote 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.880
 crystals in the wide life came out the 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.300
 mills that look at the giants that 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.240
 the models are left then it came out 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.370
 like that and be with the meats on the head 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.060
 saying good we'll see how to 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.060
 is then 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.290
 do not 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.290
 once
