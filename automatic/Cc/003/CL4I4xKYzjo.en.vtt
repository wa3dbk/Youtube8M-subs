ever<00:04:26.440> seen<00:04:26.740> or<00:04:27.580> configured<00:04:28.090> with<00:04:28.270> that<00:04:28.449> much

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
ever seen or configured with that much

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.400 
ever seen or configured with that much
memory<00:04:29.699> and<00:04:30.699> so<00:04:30.910> what<00:04:31.120> it<00:04:31.210> asked<00:04:31.599> me<00:04:31.720> the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
memory and so what it asked me the

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.100 
memory and so what it asked me the
initial<00:04:32.620> setup<00:04:33.599> what<00:04:34.599> you're<00:04:34.750> setting<00:04:35.050> this

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
initial setup what you're setting this

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.999 
initial setup what you're setting this
up<00:04:35.320> is<00:04:35.500> just<00:04:36.780> username<00:04:37.780> password<00:04:38.380> etc<00:04:38.500> so

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
up is just username password etc so

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:40.230 
up is just username password etc so
we'll<00:04:39.160> go<00:04:39.280> ahead<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.490> set<00:04:39.759> that<00:04:39.789> up<00:04:39.940> and<00:04:40.120> then

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
we'll go ahead and set that up and then

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.189 
we'll go ahead and set that up and then
come<00:04:40.419> back<00:04:40.449> later<00:04:40.900> okay<00:04:41.500> okay<00:04:41.680> as<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:42.460> can<00:04:42.610> see

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
come back later okay okay as you can see

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:50.909 
come back later okay okay as you can see
this<00:04:44.199> laptop<00:04:44.500> ranks<00:04:45.280> in<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.460> top<00:04:45.580> 2%<00:04:47.610> CPUs<00:04:49.919> top

internet here at home you can see how
fast<00:05:06.280> it<00:05:06.460> is<00:05:09.240> but<00:05:10.240> to<00:05:11.110> do<00:05:11.260> that

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.260
