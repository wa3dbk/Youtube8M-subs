00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.050 
past I cannot stand in app purchases but
it<00:05:05.830> looks<00:05:05.980> like<00:05:06.130> that's<00:05:06.340> where<00:05:06.520> the<00:05:06.610> industry

the<00:05:22.900> same<00:05:23.050> for<00:05:23.500> Nova<00:05:23.800> 3<00:05:24.070> there<00:05:24.820> are<00:05:24.850> two

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
the same for Nova 3 there are two

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.390 
the same for Nova 3 there are two
options<00:05:25.600> a<00:05:25.780> gyroscope<00:05:26.410> which<00:05:26.650> is<00:05:26.800> motion<00:05:27.220> base

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
options a gyroscope which is motion base

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.700 
options a gyroscope which is motion base
and<00:05:27.730> touch<00:05:28.090> which<00:05:28.450> virtual<00:05:28.930> sticks<00:05:29.260> which<00:05:29.560> is

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
and touch which virtual sticks which is

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.340 
and touch which virtual sticks which is
virtual<00:05:30.130> sticks<00:05:30.400> with<00:05:30.580> buttons<00:05:31.000> so<00:05:31.600> those<00:05:32.200> are

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
virtual sticks with buttons so those are

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.110 
virtual sticks with buttons so those are
the<00:05:32.470> same<00:05:32.650> types<00:05:32.920> we<00:05:33.100> had<00:05:33.280> in<00:05:33.430> modern<00:05:33.730> combat<00:05:33.940> 3

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
the same types we had in modern combat 3

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.870 
the same types we had in modern combat 3
now<00:05:35.050> I<00:05:35.080> will<00:05:35.290> say<00:05:35.470> the<00:05:35.590> gyroscope<00:05:36.250> is<00:05:36.460> sharper

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
now I will say the gyroscope is sharper

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.550 
now I will say the gyroscope is sharper
and<00:05:37.000> more<00:05:37.030> responsive<00:05:37.750> than<00:05:37.780> it's<00:05:38.110> ever<00:05:38.320> been

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
and more responsive than it's ever been

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.410 
and more responsive than it's ever been
which<00:05:39.130> is<00:05:39.160> really<00:05:39.550> really<00:05:39.700> cool<00:05:40.030> if<00:05:40.270> you<00:05:40.390> like

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
which is really really cool if you like

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.840 
which is really really cool if you like
that<00:05:40.840> style<00:05:41.200> I<00:05:41.530> personally<00:05:42.430> prefer<00:05:42.730> the

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
that style I personally prefer the

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.330 
that style I personally prefer the
virtual<00:05:43.240> sticks<00:05:43.510> and<00:05:43.720> buttons<00:05:44.050> so<00:05:45.040> I<00:05:45.070> would

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
virtual sticks and buttons so I would

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.800 
virtual sticks and buttons so I would
say<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.640> controls<00:05:46.030> are<00:05:46.180> slightly<00:05:46.480> better

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
say the controls are slightly better

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.600 
say the controls are slightly better
than<00:05:47.050> modern<00:05:47.170> combat<00:05:47.530> 3<00:05:47.680> but<00:05:48.070> definitely

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
than modern combat 3 but definitely

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.610 
than modern combat 3 but definitely
still<00:05:48.910> not<00:05:49.090> perfect<00:05:49.450> and<00:05:49.930> that<00:05:50.110> just<00:05:50.380> kind<00:05:50.590> of

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
still not perfect and that just kind of

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.380 
still not perfect and that just kind of
comes<00:05:50.890> with<00:05:50.980> the<00:05:51.100> territory<00:05:51.370> and<00:05:52.000> the<00:05:52.090> iOS

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
comes with the territory and the iOS

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
have to maneuver quickly and I would

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.870 
have to maneuver quickly and I would
mess<00:05:58.540> up<00:05:58.780> and<00:05:58.930> it<00:05:58.990> would<00:05:59.080> be<00:05:59.200> frustrating<00:05:59.890> now

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880
