now<00:00:03.179> we're<00:00:03.330> going<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.510> go<00:00:03.659> into<00:00:03.689> sliding

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
now we're going to go into sliding

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.340 
now we're going to go into sliding
standard<00:00:04.950> tuning<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.930> there's<00:00:06.930> some<00:00:07.080> scales

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
standard tuning and there's some scales

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.560 
standard tuning and there's some scales
that<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:07.710> have<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.130> know<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.700> be<00:00:09.120> able<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.420> do

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
that you have to know to be able to do

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.509 
that you have to know to be able to do
this<00:00:09.780> I'm<00:00:10.230> going<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.590> use<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:11.099> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
this I'm going to use this the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.870 
this I'm going to use this the
pentatonic<00:00:11.940> blue<00:00:12.360> scale<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:13.049> e<00:00:13.880> to

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
pentatonic blue scale in e to

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.460 
pentatonic blue scale in e to
demonstrate<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.020> there's<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.289> couple

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
demonstrate this and there's a couple

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.220 
demonstrate this and there's a couple
different<00:00:16.710> places<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.400> play<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.869> first<00:00:19.080> one

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
different places I play it the first one

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:28.810 
different places I play it the first one
is<00:00:19.260> normal<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.949> 12th<00:00:20.279> fret<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.760> looks<00:00:21.000> like

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.359 

and<00:00:28.910> then<00:00:29.750> I<00:00:29.869> also<00:00:29.900> play<00:00:30.410> an<00:00:30.529> extension<00:00:31.100> off<00:00:31.220> of

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
and then I also play an extension off of

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:43.390 
and then I also play an extension off of
that<00:00:35.650> right<00:00:36.650> so<00:00:37.010> typical<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:42.860> second<00:00:43.280> one

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
that right so typical the second one

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:57.350 
that right so typical the second one
that<00:00:43.520> I<00:00:43.579> use<00:00:43.670> is<00:00:44.420> this<00:00:48.670> so<00:00:49.670> that<00:00:50.210> scales<00:00:50.629> here

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.660 

food<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.080> we<00:00:58.590> use<00:00:58.740> those<00:00:58.950> together<00:00:59.220> to<00:00:59.580> be

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
food and we use those together to be

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.130 
food and we use those together to be
able<00:00:59.700> to<00:00:59.910> play<00:00:59.970> slide<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.480> you're<00:01:00.660> talking<00:01:00.990> all

but Greg I think is really tasty at it
and<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.140> how<00:01:31.259> they<00:01:31.470> do<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:43.820> she<00:01:44.820> catch

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and this is how they do it she catch

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.450 
and this is how they do it she catch
that<00:01:45.300> all's<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.320> did<00:01:46.350> was<00:01:46.500> play<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> two<00:01:47.130> scales

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
that all's I did was play the two scales

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.999 
that all's I did was play the two scales
together<00:01:47.970> now<00:01:48.750> i'm<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.440> to<00:01:49.500> start<00:01:49.770> down

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
together now i'm going to start down

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.710 
together now i'm going to start down
here<00:01:50.040> at<00:01:50.550> this<00:01:50.759> scale<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.270> I'm<00:01:51.330> gonna<00:01:51.479> work<00:01:51.660> my

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
here at this scale and I'm gonna work my

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:21.910 
here at this scale and I'm gonna work my
way<00:01:52.200> up<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.410> the<00:01:52.530> next

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.100 

now<00:02:22.920> as<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.130> can<00:02:23.250> tell<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.960> damping<00:02:24.960> is

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
now as you can tell to damping is

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.200 
now as you can tell to damping is
everything<00:02:25.620> on<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:26.010> because<00:02:26.310> we're<00:02:26.610> not<00:02:26.850> in

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
everything on this because we're not in

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.710 
everything on this because we're not in
an<00:02:27.570> open<00:02:27.900> tuning<00:02:28.400> damping<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.520> everything<00:02:30.210> I

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
an open tuning damping is everything I

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.440 
an open tuning damping is everything I
have<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.680> stop<00:02:31.980> notes<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.880> don't<00:02:33.150> line<00:02:33.420> up

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
have to stop notes that don't line up

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.570 
have to stop notes that don't line up
with<00:02:33.630> each<00:02:33.780> other<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.290> do<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.500> lot<00:02:34.800> of<00:02:35.130> single

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
with each other so I do a lot of single

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.180 
with each other so I do a lot of single
note<00:02:35.850> work<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.990> one<00:02:37.230> cool<00:02:37.500> thing<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.800> you

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
note work the one cool thing is you

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.450 
note work the one cool thing is you
still<00:02:38.610> have<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.880> partial<00:02:39.210> open<00:02:39.840> G<00:02:40.230> tuning<00:02:40.460> these

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
still have a partial open G tuning these

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.150 
still have a partial open G tuning these
three<00:02:41.730> strings<00:02:43.850> still<00:02:44.850> in<00:02:45.180> open<00:02:45.660> G<00:02:45.870> tuning<00:02:46.160> so

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
three strings still in open G tuning so

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.830 
three strings still in open G tuning so
you<00:02:47.250> can<00:02:47.490> slide<00:02:47.820> all<00:02:48.150> day<00:02:48.300> long<00:02:48.510> in<00:02:48.720> those

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
you can slide all day long in those

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:59.380 
you can slide all day long in those
three<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.170> make<00:02:49.350> chords

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.550 

so<00:03:00.769> that's<00:03:01.769> standard<00:03:02.280> tuning<00:03:02.489> slide<00:03:02.939> and

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
so that's standard tuning slide and

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.140 
so that's standard tuning slide and
learn<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.590> few<00:03:04.829> more<00:03:04.980> scales<00:03:05.370> learn<00:03:05.939> where

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
learn a few more scales learn where

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.420 
learn a few more scales learn where
everything<00:03:06.180> goes<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.170> you're<00:03:08.129> going<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.340> be

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
everything goes and you're going to be

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.879 
everything goes and you're going to be
rocking
