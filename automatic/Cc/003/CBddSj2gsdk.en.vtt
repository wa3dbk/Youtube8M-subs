00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.489
 the first one is free, certain it's free 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.790
 there's no excuse anymore 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.670
 anime and has no money in the club because 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.739
 It's free, you pay a cent there. 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.559
 dadaian bridge of the fort point com 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:51.530
 Low game, it will take around 17:00. 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.100
 gigabytes nowadays I recommend you 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.339
 leaves the night falling asleep in channels 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.899
 school, and work there the other day 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:06.020
 when they arrive curious in your house you 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.539
 will be able to experience this jewel of 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.880
 modern world that is what matters the 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:13.960
 two how this game 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.030
 basically it's two chips the blue hill is 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.100
 who face each other and kill each other 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.940
 mercenaries hired by an old woman 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.950
 and basically they win to kill some 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.350
 to others in every story story in 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.409
 blah blah comics but in my case 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.110
 insurance agent is a schutter right in the 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.539
 country strike style 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.149
 although it is very different because 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.340
 first and has nine classes 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.130
 so it's that nasty thing about 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.110
 everybody is taking away the most annoying 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.550
 Of the three car everybody gets stripped 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.910
 Straight snipper dominates goes a boring there stays 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.340
 in the bitch that the champion born in the sitting 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.860
 in the door waiting for a kaka trot 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.810
 there's always a bundle that does not have 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.879
 patience of waiting 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:07.459
 I want to see your face again. 

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:10.340
 and takes a test-mission key she sent 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:13.400
 So, how's it going to look ? 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.489
 disarm that annoying shopping mall 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.209
 the two is not much gameplay theme 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.209
 many different 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.880
 what is the meaning of the medical doctor is 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.860
 very important because it always has 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.230
 someone who does not have the patience to stay 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.540
 turning and without the perfectionist and 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.750
 hitting all the plays soon 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.570
 abandoned such a wide person am 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.950
 partly because it is not as efficient as 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.430
 the others 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.490
 however he may choose to play a 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.800
 specific class that is the doctor who is the 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.750
 mean he has a gun 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:08.060
 that cure 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:10.850
 basically then in a finally a cure 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.700
 So what happens to your staff? 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.000
 Time starts to take all the bomb strip 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.830
 Tokyo starts to die, you go there and 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.100
 start looking for them not only stay 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.840
 wondering why when it comes close 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.060
 automatically it already starts to it 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.610
 it looks like a little ray like you two are 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:36.140
 seeing there and then you can heal your 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.790
 Friends, anyway, what's cool is 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.350
 What are you going to teach? 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.230
 the little belly that is there in the 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.050
 I sing and when I've filled you up 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.830
 press the right button and automatically 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.860
 You and the guy you 're healing me will 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.400
 stay right with invincible that can 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.790
 to see the two win there shining and 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.520
 killing everyone has some ways 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.700
 to neutralize and is called uber chardy 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.420
 which is a mixture of German an English 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:13.010
 would be super load of gains 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:17.190
 and then you go in to destroy where you 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:21.630
 to arrive normally the profile works 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.570
 When you get fat when forced 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.870
 small or not at the moment when it was a 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.500
 very large place with the divine and 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.550
 you have to have one I always stay 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.550
 a little more because so 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.490
 wilder
