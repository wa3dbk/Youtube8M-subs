beets they're pretty easy to handle and

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.839 
beets they're pretty easy to handle and
they<00:00:07.350> do<00:00:07.410> well<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:07.799> their<00:00:08.099> high<00:00:08.250> elevation

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
they do well in their high elevation

you<00:00:11.550> can<00:00:11.700> usually<00:00:11.849> plant<00:00:12.269> beets<00:00:12.540> early<00:00:13.639> May

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
you can usually plant beets early May

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.760 
you can usually plant beets early May
maybe<00:00:15.000> late<00:00:15.299> April<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.020> they'll<00:00:16.320> do<00:00:16.470> fairly

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
maybe late April and they'll do fairly

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.070 
maybe late April and they'll do fairly
well<00:00:16.890> in<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.730> higher<00:00:18.090> elevations<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.930> get

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
well in the higher elevations you get

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.140 
well in the higher elevations you get
down<00:00:19.230> around<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.650> Wasatch<00:00:20.070> Front<00:00:20.250> front<00:00:20.910> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
down around the Wasatch Front front and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.509 
down around the Wasatch Front front and
you'll<00:00:21.270> probably<00:00:21.420> want<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.020> maybe<00:00:22.949> plant<00:00:23.310> them

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
you'll probably want to maybe plant them

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.509 
you'll probably want to maybe plant them
middle<00:00:23.760> April<00:00:24.449> or<00:00:25.230> maybe<00:00:25.590> even<00:00:25.680> early<00:00:26.160> April

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
middle April or maybe even early April

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.890 
middle April or maybe even early April
but<00:00:26.789> they<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.000> quite<00:00:27.330> well<00:00:27.359> they're<00:00:27.689> fairly

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
but they do quite well they're fairly

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.540 
but they do quite well they're fairly
Hardy<00:00:28.260> plants<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.800> they'll<00:00:28.920> pop<00:00:29.070> up<00:00:29.310> pretty

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
Hardy plants and they'll pop up pretty

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.429 
Hardy plants and they'll pop up pretty
good<00:00:29.640> they're<00:00:30.300> not<00:00:30.449> nearly<00:00:30.689> as<00:00:30.840> tender<00:00:31.230> as<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
good they're not nearly as tender as the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.830 
good they're not nearly as tender as the
carrots<00:00:31.800> are<00:00:31.980> but<00:00:32.700> they<00:00:32.880> do<00:00:32.940> well<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.690> can

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
carrots are but they do well and you can

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.840 
carrots are but they do well and you can
plant<00:00:34.110> beets<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.590> wide<00:00:34.800> row<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.640> can

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
plant beets in a wide row or you can

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.250 
plant beets in a wide row or you can
plant<00:00:36.090> them<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.450> single<00:00:36.840> roll<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.170> I'll

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
plant them in a single roll and I'll

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.660 
plant them in a single roll and I'll
show<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.649> couple<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.010> ways<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.309> doing<00:00:38.460> each

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
show you a couple of ways to doing each

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.760 
show you a couple of ways to doing each
one<00:00:38.879> when<00:00:39.629> you're<00:00:39.750> doing<00:00:40.020> beets<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.559> row

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
one when you're doing beets in a row

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.040 
one when you're doing beets in a row
it's<00:00:41.550> really<00:00:41.879> simple<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.420> take<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> hole

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
it's really simple you just take a hole

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.830 
it's really simple you just take a hole
and<00:00:43.860> make<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> furrow

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.880 

now<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.050> wanted<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.590> could<00:00:49.710> plant<00:00:50.010> beets

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
now if you wanted you could plant beets

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.189 
now if you wanted you could plant beets
several<00:00:52.890> rolls<00:00:53.100> very<00:00:53.399> close<00:00:53.670> together<00:00:54.199> making

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
several rolls very close together making

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.299 
several rolls very close together making
a<00:00:55.320> wide<00:00:55.559> row<00:00:55.739> system<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.370> rows<00:00:57.289> and<00:00:58.289> that's<00:00:59.010> one

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
a wide row system in rows and that's one

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.360 
a wide row system in rows and that's one
way<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.730> do<00:00:59.910> beets<00:01:00.980> this<00:01:01.980> year<00:01:02.219> has<00:01:02.340> been

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
way you can do beets this year has been

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.340 
way you can do beets this year has been
a<00:01:02.489> very<00:01:02.760> dry<00:01:03.090> year<00:01:03.120> throughout<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.049> winter

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
a very dry year throughout the winter

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.530 
a very dry year throughout the winter
and<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.680> spring<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:06.060> important<00:01:06.510> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and the spring and it's important to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.240 
and the spring and it's important to
have<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.780> moisture<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.560> your<00:01:07.590> furrow<00:01:07.950> so

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
have that moisture in your furrow so

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.250 
have that moisture in your furrow so
that<00:01:08.400> your<00:01:08.549> seeds<00:01:08.850> will<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.330> that

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
that your seeds will have that

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.010 
that your seeds will have that
activation<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.280> them<00:01:11.430> germinating<00:01:12.150> you

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
activation and get them germinating you

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.969 
activation and get them germinating you
can<00:01:13.170> see<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.530> my<00:01:14.010> files<00:01:14.310> are<00:01:14.490> very<00:01:15.680> very<00:01:16.680> dry

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
can see that my files are very very dry

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.440 
can see that my files are very very dry
here<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.430> I'm<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.759> trickle<00:01:17.970> some<00:01:18.210> water

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
here so I'm going to trickle some water

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.810 
here so I'm going to trickle some water
in<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.810> give<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.229> good<00:01:20.220> wetting<00:01:20.520> down

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
in there and give the good wetting down

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.780 
in there and give the good wetting down
in<00:01:21.030> my<00:01:21.150> furrows<00:01:21.890> if<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.040> have<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> really<00:01:23.610> wet

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
in my furrows if you have a really wet

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.640 
in my furrows if you have a really wet
spring<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.299> may<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.630> need<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.350> but

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
spring you may not need to do this but

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.560 
spring you may not need to do this but
in<00:01:26.159> our<00:01:26.310> country<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:26.939> never<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.360> what's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
in our country we never have what's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.080 
in our country we never have what's
called<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.869> wet<00:01:28.020> spring<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.950> always<00:01:29.909> make

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
called a wet spring so I always make

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.899 
called a wet spring so I always make
sure<00:01:30.650> I've<00:01:31.650> got<00:01:31.710> plenty<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.250> moisture<00:01:32.520> to

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
sure I've got plenty of moisture to

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.420 
sure I've got plenty of moisture to
begin<00:01:33.240> with<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.710> don't<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.100> worry

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
begin with and I don't have to worry

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.640 
begin with and I don't have to worry
about<00:01:35.549> watering<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.659> seeds<00:01:36.930> up<00:01:37.170> they<00:01:37.590> should

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
about watering the seeds up they should

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.190 
about watering the seeds up they should
pop<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.070> pretty<00:01:38.460> good<00:01:38.549> with<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.720> having<00:01:40.140> this

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
pop up pretty good with just having this

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.980 
pop up pretty good with just having this
water<00:01:40.470> here<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> furrow<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.990> seeds

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
water here in the furrow the seeds

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.330 
water here in the furrow the seeds
should<00:01:43.439> germinate<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:44.009> your<00:01:44.159> soil

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
should germinate if your soil

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.160 
should germinate if your soil
temperature<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:44.909> up<00:01:45.060> at<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.270> good<00:01:45.479> soil

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
temperature is up at a good soil

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.270

within<00:01:47.970> ten<00:01:48.780> days<00:01:49.049> two<00:01:49.350> weeks<00:01:49.380> at<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> most

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
within ten days two weeks at the most

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.249 
within ten days two weeks at the most
so<00:01:50.759> hopefully<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.540> won't<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.049> water

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
so hopefully you won't have to water

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.649 
so hopefully you won't have to water
them<00:01:52.470> again<00:01:52.799> before<00:01:52.979> they<00:01:53.250> pop<00:01:53.460> up<00:01:53.490> out<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:54.149> you

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
them again before they pop up out if you

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.179 
them again before they pop up out if you
do<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.079> want<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.439> kind<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.740> careful<00:01:55.920> you

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
do you want to be kind of careful you

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.190 
do you want to be kind of careful you
don't<00:01:56.340> wash<00:01:56.520> things<00:01:56.820> away<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.149> beets<00:01:58.049> are

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
don't wash things away but beets are

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.350 
don't wash things away but beets are
pretty<00:01:58.409> tough<00:01:58.619> they<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.520> pop<00:01:59.759> through<00:02:00.119> a

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
pretty tough they can pop through a

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.359 
pretty tough they can pop through a
little<00:02:00.990> bit<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.259> crust<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:01.860> get<00:02:02.009> formed

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
little bit of a crust like we get formed

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.910 
little bit of a crust like we get formed
here<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.700> our<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:03.030> our<00:02:03.149> clay<00:02:03.360> e<00:02:03.390> type<00:02:03.780> soils<00:02:04.259> we

here in our in our clay e type soils we

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.260 
here in our in our clay e type soils we
can<00:02:05.070> still<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.430> those<00:02:05.579> beach<00:02:05.820> pop<00:02:06.090> up

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
can still have those beach pop up

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.359 
can still have those beach pop up
through<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.469> can<00:02:07.619> avoid<00:02:07.740> having<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
through but if you can avoid having the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.400 
through but if you can avoid having the
water<00:02:08.580> after<00:02:08.819> you've<00:02:09.060> planted<00:02:09.599> until<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
water after you've planted until the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.900 
water after you've planted until the
seed<00:02:10.739> things<00:02:10.920> have<00:02:11.039> popped<00:02:11.280> up<00:02:11.489> then<00:02:11.760> you're

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
seed things have popped up then you're

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.120 
seed things have popped up then you're
going<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.060> be<00:02:12.209> better<00:02:12.390> off

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
going to be better off

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.790 
going to be better off
now<00:02:13.460> beets<00:02:13.730> are<00:02:13.910> also<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.510> very<00:02:14.810> good<00:02:15.140> root<00:02:15.560> and

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
now beets are also a very good root and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.480 
now beets are also a very good root and
a<00:02:16.040> leaf<00:02:16.280> crop<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:17.510> leaves<00:02:17.780> are<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:19.100> delicious

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
a leaf crop the leaves are a delicious

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.580 
a leaf crop the leaves are a delicious
treat<00:02:19.910> as<00:02:20.210> well<00:02:20.390> as<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.690> roots<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.200> can

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
treat as well as the roots so you can

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.290 
treat as well as the roots so you can
bottle<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.250> roots<00:02:22.460> you<00:02:22.580> can<00:02:22.640> eat<00:02:22.850> them<00:02:23.030> fresh

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
bottle the roots you can eat them fresh

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.870 
bottle the roots you can eat them fresh
you<00:02:23.630> can<00:02:23.780> eat<00:02:23.870> them<00:02:24.050> pickled<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:24.980> these

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
you can eat them pickled and and these

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.460 
you can eat them pickled and and these
are<00:02:25.940> also<00:02:26.240> very<00:02:26.450> good<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:26.960> very<00:02:27.140> nutritious

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
are also very good and very nutritious

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.290 
are also very good and very nutritious
the<00:02:28.400> seeds<00:02:28.840> are<00:02:29.840> kind<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:31.300> conglomerate

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
the seeds are kind of a a conglomerate

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.730 
the seeds are kind of a a conglomerate
of<00:02:32.450> seeds<00:02:32.720> actually<00:02:33.140> that's<00:02:33.320> more<00:02:33.530> than<00:02:33.620> one

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
of seeds actually that's more than one

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.110 
of seeds actually that's more than one
seed<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:34.220> even<00:02:34.460> though<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:34.610> think<00:02:34.910> you've

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
seed so even though you think you've

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.480 
seed so even though you think you've
spread<00:02:35.450> them<00:02:35.690> out<00:02:35.870> they<00:02:36.830> will<00:02:36.980> kind<00:02:37.220> of<00:02:37.310> come

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
spread them out they will kind of come

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.850 
spread them out they will kind of come
up<00:02:37.520> in<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.880> cluster<00:02:38.300> so<00:02:39.020> we'll<00:02:39.230> kind<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.560> plant

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
up in a cluster so we'll kind of plant

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.730 
up in a cluster so we'll kind of plant
these<00:02:40.040> fairly<00:02:40.750> loose<00:02:42.550> thin<00:02:43.550> across<00:02:43.940> here<00:02:44.740> not

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
these fairly loose thin across here not

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.130 
these fairly loose thin across here not
real<00:02:45.920> heavy<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:46.430> just<00:02:47.240> kind<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.600> plant<00:02:47.960> them

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
real heavy and just kind of plant them

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:58.510 
real heavy and just kind of plant them
in<00:02:48.260> there

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.900 

get<00:02:59.520> them<00:02:59.670> down<00:02:59.880> each<00:03:00.090> row<00:03:01.490> one<00:03:02.490> more<00:03:02.670> row<00:03:02.850> to

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
get them down each row one more row to

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.050 
get them down each row one more row to
do<00:03:05.510> finish<00:03:06.510> off<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:06.960> package<00:03:07.580> all<00:03:08.580> right<00:03:08.820> so

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
do finish off this package all right so

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.290 
do finish off this package all right so
cut<00:03:09.300> our<00:03:09.420> seed<00:03:09.660> in<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.770> furrow<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.340> just

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
cut our seed in the furrow and just

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.180 
cut our seed in the furrow and just
cover<00:03:12.540> them<00:03:12.750> over<00:03:15.560> about<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.590> quarter<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.100> an

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
cover them over about a quarter of an

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.430 
cover them over about a quarter of an
inch<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:17.490> all<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.790> need<00:03:17.970> maybe<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:19.080> little<00:03:19.260> bit

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
inch is all you need maybe a little bit

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.570 
inch is all you need maybe a little bit
more<00:03:19.620> they're<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.860> little<00:03:20.010> bit<00:03:20.190> harder<00:03:20.490> than

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
more they're a little bit harder than

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.390 
more they're a little bit harder than
the<00:03:20.790> carrots<00:03:21.150> are<00:03:21.830> about<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.860> quarter<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.280> an

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
the carrots are about a quarter of an

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.460 
the carrots are about a quarter of an
inch<00:03:24.110> on<00:03:25.110> top<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.530> your<00:03:25.650> seed<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:28.170> then<00:03:28.320> you

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
inch on top of your seed and then you

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.830 
inch on top of your seed and then you
want<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.709> kind<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:29.040> Pat<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.850> ground<00:03:30.330> down<00:03:30.570> get

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
want to kind of Pat the ground down get

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.949 
want to kind of Pat the ground down get
a<00:03:30.870> good<00:03:31.260> contact<00:03:31.530> between<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.310> soil<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.959> the

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
a good contact between the soil and the

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.110 
a good contact between the soil and the
seed<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:37.110> hopefully<00:03:37.590> we<00:03:38.550> won't<00:03:38.700> have<00:03:38.970> to

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
seed and hopefully we won't have to

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.920 
seed and hopefully we won't have to
water<00:03:39.330> this<00:03:41.150> again<00:03:42.150> until<00:03:42.330> we've<00:03:42.570> got<00:03:42.720> some

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
water this again until we've got some

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.530 
water this again until we've got some
seedlings<00:03:43.140> popping<00:03:43.709> up<00:03:44.060> so<00:03:45.060> though<00:03:45.270> I've<00:03:45.360> got

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
seedlings popping up so though I've got

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.960 
seedlings popping up so though I've got
a<00:03:45.570> planning<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.140> enter<00:03:46.640> furrows<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.670> I'll

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
a planning to enter furrows and I'll

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.640 
a planning to enter furrows and I'll
show<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.150> how<00:03:48.300> we<00:03:48.360> can<00:03:48.510> do<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.750> in<00:03:49.020> another<00:03:49.290> in

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
show you how we can do it in another in

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.240 
show you how we can do it in another in
a<00:03:50.340> wider<00:03:50.550> bed<00:03:51.920> now

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
a wider bed now

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.720 
a wider bed now
for<00:03:53.610> making<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.870> wide<00:03:55.110> row<00:03:55.410> we<00:03:56.370> can<00:03:56.580> use

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
for making a just a wide row we can use

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.090 
for making a just a wide row we can use
a<00:03:56.760> rank<00:03:57.060> in<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.480> backside<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:58.140> rake<00:03:58.320> and

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
a rank in the backside of a rake and

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.610 
a rank in the backside of a rake and
rake<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.489> right<00:03:59.700> out<00:03:59.730> and<00:04:00.630> give<00:04:01.140> us<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.380> white

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
rake that right out and give us a white

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.080 
rake that right out and give us a white
bed<00:04:01.890> I'll<00:04:02.310> try<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:02.640> keep<00:04:02.820> mine<00:04:03.060> within<00:04:03.330> about<00:04:03.450> a

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
bed I'll try to keep mine within about a

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.030 
bed I'll try to keep mine within about a
foot<00:04:06.090> wide<00:04:07.040> or<00:04:08.040> so<00:04:09.049> down<00:04:10.049> how<00:04:10.290> long<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.739> want<00:04:10.920> my

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
foot wide or so down how long I want my

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.219 
foot wide or so down how long I want my
bed<00:04:11.780> I'm<00:04:12.780> going<00:04:13.170> to<00:04:13.290> make<00:04:13.470> this<00:04:14.930> try<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:15.959> make<00:04:16.200> a

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
bed I'm going to make this try to make a

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.140 
bed I'm going to make this try to make a
level<00:04:16.650> so<00:04:16.799> my<00:04:16.919> water<00:04:17.160> will<00:04:17.430> pull<00:04:17.700> and<00:04:17.910> soak

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
level so my water will pull and soak

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.080 
level so my water will pull and soak
down<00:04:18.180> into<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.720> soil<00:04:22.610> all<00:04:23.610> right<00:04:23.760> now<00:04:23.910> you'll

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
down into the soil all right now you'll

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.010 
down into the soil all right now you'll
notice<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:25.400> this<00:04:26.400> bed<00:04:26.700> is<00:04:26.940> still<00:04:27.180> pretty<00:04:27.750> dry

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
notice that this bed is still pretty dry

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.440 
notice that this bed is still pretty dry
so<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:28.410> need<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.710> make<00:04:28.860> sure<00:04:28.890> I've<00:04:29.250> got<00:04:29.280> water

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.400 

try<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.080> make<00:04:33.350> it<00:04:33.380> 30<00:04:33.800> level<00:04:35.020> so<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.170> water

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
try to make it 30 level so the water

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.580 
try to make it 30 level so the water
will<00:04:36.680> evenly<00:04:37.160> soak<00:04:37.520> in<00:04:38.350> through<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.440> whole

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
will evenly soak in through the whole

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:49.440 
will evenly soak in through the whole
area

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.360 

because<00:04:50.050> it's<00:04:50.230> so<00:04:50.380> dry<00:04:50.590> if<00:04:50.650> I<00:04:50.830> can<00:04:50.950> get<00:04:51.100> a<00:04:51.130> half

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
because it's so dry if I can get a half

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.980 
because it's so dry if I can get a half
inch<00:04:51.610> of<00:04:51.760> water<00:04:51.970> or<00:04:52.240> so<00:04:52.450> sitting<00:04:52.750> in<00:04:52.810> that

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
inch of water or so sitting in that

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.710 
inch of water or so sitting in that
puddle<00:04:53.340> it'll<00:04:54.340> soak<00:04:54.550> down<00:04:57.210> at<00:04:58.210> least<00:04:58.390> six

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
puddle it'll soak down at least six

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:06.000 
puddle it'll soak down at least six
inches<00:04:59.080> into<00:04:59.350> the<00:04:59.560> soil

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.260 

so<00:05:07.010> now<00:05:07.190> we'll<00:05:07.370> let<00:05:07.490> that<00:05:07.550> water<00:05:07.910> soak<00:05:08.240> down

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
so now we'll let that water soak down

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.950 
so now we'll let that water soak down
and<00:05:08.690> we'll<00:05:08.840> plant<00:05:09.530> some<00:05:09.710> more<00:05:09.830> beet<00:05:10.010> seeds

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
and we'll plant some more beet seeds

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.510 
and we'll plant some more beet seeds
okay<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.350> water<00:05:12.530> soaked<00:05:12.950> down<00:05:13.130> in<00:05:13.340> here

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
okay the water soaked down in here

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.560 
okay the water soaked down in here
pretty<00:05:13.760> good<00:05:14.560> so<00:05:15.560> all<00:05:15.740> we<00:05:15.890> need<00:05:16.010> to<00:05:16.070> do<00:05:16.310> is<00:05:16.570> grab

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
pretty good so all we need to do is grab

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.270 
pretty good so all we need to do is grab
a<00:05:17.600> few<00:05:17.870> beet<00:05:18.110> seeds<00:05:18.440> and<00:05:19.300> scatter<00:05:20.300> them<00:05:20.540> out

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
a few beet seeds and scatter them out

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.640 
a few beet seeds and scatter them out
over<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.370> area<00:05:22.700> doesn't<00:05:22.970> take<00:05:23.270> a<00:05:23.300> lot<00:05:23.650> when

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
over the area doesn't take a lot when

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.860 
over the area doesn't take a lot when
packaged<00:05:25.430> beet<00:05:25.700> seeds<00:05:26.000> will<00:05:26.150> last<00:05:26.360> a<00:05:26.540> normal

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
packaged beet seeds will last a normal

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.020 
packaged beet seeds will last a normal
family<00:05:27.790> several<00:05:28.790> years<00:05:29.410> so<00:05:30.640> kind<00:05:31.640> of<00:05:31.760> scatter

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
family several years so kind of scatter

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.580 
family several years so kind of scatter
those<00:05:32.300> out<00:05:32.510> if<00:05:32.720> you<00:05:32.810> think<00:05:33.050> your<00:05:33.200> seeds<00:05:33.470> a

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
those out if you think your seeds a

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.990 
those out if you think your seeds a
little<00:05:33.620> bit<00:05:33.950> old<00:05:34.160> or<00:05:34.460> something<00:05:34.790> you<00:05:34.880> might

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
little bit old or something you might

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.340 
little bit old or something you might
get<00:05:35.720> a<00:05:35.750> little<00:05:35.840> bit<00:05:36.020> extra<00:05:36.140> in<00:05:36.380> there<00:05:38.260> you<00:05:39.260> can

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
get a little bit extra in there you can

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.660 
get a little bit extra in there you can
always<00:05:39.470> thin<00:05:39.770> them<00:05:39.890> out<00:05:40.010> if<00:05:40.160> you<00:05:40.250> plant<00:05:40.490> too

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
always thin them out if you plant too

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.080 
always thin them out if you plant too
heavy<00:05:40.910> and<00:05:41.660> then<00:05:42.500> we'll<00:05:42.650> cover<00:05:42.860> them<00:05:43.070> up<00:05:43.100> okay

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
heavy and then we'll cover them up okay

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.650 
heavy and then we'll cover them up okay
so<00:05:44.150> now<00:05:44.390> I've<00:05:44.480> got<00:05:44.660> it<00:05:44.810> scattered<00:05:45.230> out<00:05:46.660> cover

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
so now I've got it scattered out cover

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.400 
so now I've got it scattered out cover
it<00:05:47.810> up<00:05:47.900> again<00:05:48.080> about<00:05:48.560> a<00:05:48.590> quarter<00:05:49.010> an<00:05:49.100> inch<00:05:50.410> can

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
it up again about a quarter an inch can

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.020 
it up again about a quarter an inch can
give<00:05:51.560> this<00:05:51.650> seed<00:05:54.190> Pat<00:05:55.190> it<00:05:55.370> down<00:05:55.550> so<00:05:55.790> you<00:05:55.880> got

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
give this seed Pat it down so you got

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.320 
give this seed Pat it down so you got
good<00:05:56.530> seed<00:05:57.530> soil<00:05:57.860> contact<00:05:58.430> that<00:05:58.850> seed<00:05:59.150> in

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
good seed soil contact that seed in

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.510 
good seed soil contact that seed in
contact<00:05:59.840> with<00:05:59.930> that<00:05:59.990> more<00:06:00.350> moist<00:06:00.860> salt<00:06:03.520> that's

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
contact with that more moist salt that's

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.160 
contact with that more moist salt that's
really<00:06:04.880> all<00:06:05.030> it<00:06:05.060> takes<00:06:05.360> so<00:06:05.570> now<00:06:05.750> you're<00:06:05.990> ready
