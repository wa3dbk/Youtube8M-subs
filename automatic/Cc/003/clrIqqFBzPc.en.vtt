00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.840
 how are all new videos of the call 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.670
 of duty coast and well we are in the 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.080
 second episode of creating the best 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.730
 class this time we are going to see her here 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.619
 12 and well it's going to be a little bit different 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.900
 to the first episode and here the benefit 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.789
 it got pretty boring and I did not want 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.950
 do the same with every lazy weapon 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.740
 the truth the truth I believe that you 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.170
 they like to see how they play and they like it 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.730
 see if it really works that class 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.210
 that only sees the putt by hand and 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.910
 tell them why because they deal 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.039
 also this one that in most of 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.749
 rifles occupied the gods persie already 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.539
 I said it is usually change the 

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:46.579
 only order but well then what 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.350
 which is also an image that I took of the 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.870
 class that was nothing to occupy in the 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.469
 next game plate they will see or be at 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.390
 I spend a few minutes more or less 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.519
 is not here 12 is an assault rifle 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.870
 quite pretty good that most 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.079
 busy people the truth I think it's 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.299
 of the best rifles to get out game 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.130
 but not me what normally only 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.690
 they occupied this silencer gun and 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.610
 charge is broad 2 you may want 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.980
 remove chargers amps can you 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.760
 put flu that does not need it the same as 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.190
 the sa 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.120
 you need the truth is that you can 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.770
 buy pretty pretty pretty well 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.590
 and good the projects also in 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.900
 screen the advantages of first bear 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.100
 are the ones he always occupied when starting the 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.290
 true 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.479
 they can remove escabinos what can they put 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.130
 the specialist but not me has 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.170
 worked like this to me has always 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.840
 so operated always carry scavenger 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.490
 from the beginning, so nothing 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.960
 combination of specialists has already 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.290
 said that it changes the order I only think 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.479
 that changed the order from the comparison 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.049
 I think with the sa 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.049
 I wear invisible I wear fast max I wear the 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.789
 you'll see I've been there, I'm fine 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.770
 the silent leads to amplify 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.630
 hartline know a lot but not because 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.039
 will go down to the end did not serve 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.679
 nothing can I elaborate only what I 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.539
 I put in case I get to have a streak 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.330
 quite interesting for which to 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.250
 that is not in 25 be 24 although it is not 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.920
 nothing but yes it is a low that in the end 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.000
 which boat can save so, well, nothing 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.980
 what they will see to condition is a 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.690
 gameplay with here 12 on the map of 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.480
 octane the truth is a pretty level 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.130
 good 43 low I think 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.080
 and we lost 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.240
 not bring the gameplay is more than a 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.310
 trailer the truth I do there are enough 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.160
 low do not always assume everything if not 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.230
 I know if it was too long I'm going to leave you 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.530
 more than anything the pieces more 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.360
 interesting can say a rachita 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.550
 interesting here takes away this bastard 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.960
 because I had a streak of I do not know how many 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.630
 they spent it changing here the truth is 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.310
 that we had to play against a can a clan 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.680
 complete then I think it's 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.470
 pretty good to have been good 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.210
 I do not work alone and with hill that already 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.550
 He returned already according to the taste of bastard 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.020
 so you do not have the diadem of 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.240
 bastard so until you buy from 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.980
 sea ​​we have at least I will do more 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.409
 videos with him 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.640
 so then the laundry nothing because 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.379
 the gameplay is pretty good as they 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.010
 I said, do not miss the champion here in the 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.450
 destroyed building the gun is pretty 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.920
 pretty good what I like about 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.830
 lacados is that it has enough mobility 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.650
 to make a rifle has more mobility 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.500
 that the one with this confusing the 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.549
 first floor that was that of the sc 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:31.230
 I think if it has more mobility than the 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:33.760
 first floor that was the sc and fired 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.819
 good has more lack 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.170
 from close does not have better up close 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.760
 the truth from the hip that goes 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.879
 pretty good but I think he expects a 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.260
 little faster if you can see a 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.040
 little bit faster which works for me 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.400
 pretty pretty good 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.879
 so, nothing like they see is not a 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.090
 rifle for both large maps and 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.740
 estonia come I recommend them better 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.530
 sc 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.890
 which is more accurate than here 12 but 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.000
 it still works pretty well 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.880
 elongated good as you come here to 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.760
 very long distances something moves the 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.620
 weapon but normally the other that's 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.960
 can you check then I think not 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.290
 There is nothing to worry about and as you see 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.550
 I have the Christmas camo that I think is 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.170
 shrugs us that have given us if we 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.200
 realizing 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.150
 go to the color store and like 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.320
 this field to download absolutely 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.320
 free 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.870
 in fact you have the option to download 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.330
 instead of the dog's streak instead 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.160
 that is a dog be a wolf is something 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.980
 Well, yes, it costs a dollar 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.330
 I believe but here the truth is not only 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.520
 a 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.129
 just change the dog to the wolf the 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.289
 I do not really like it, but 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:49.920
 good as I was working enough 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:52.260
 gameplay carries help gusts 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.580
 I will not take your specialist but I carry 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.370
 help nights is practically what 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.790
 same 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.729
 so it's not completely to what they 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.290
 I said of the class but imagine 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.820
 imagine that taking a specialist does not 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.410
 had another example with this weapon with 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.220
 specialist but I believe that this field 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.840
 it's pretty good to prove 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.570
 christer is not pretty good enough 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.290
 for me the most is more important for 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.419
 be more stalker and quick drop are the 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.010
 of the most important ones so if you're 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.770
 work if you like to be in the version 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:26.500
 of the enemy but give him like strong and 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.500
 comment see you the video course goodbye
