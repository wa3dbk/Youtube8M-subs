 Architects should observe and understand progress and participate in shaping it.

 The modern city has so far been marked by the pedestrian development towards the bicycle and the car. 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.250 position:98%
 It is important to find the optimal combination of all forms of urban mobility. 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:50.500 position:98%
 This requires a real balance, which gives us the freedom to choose the fastest and most comfortable way to move. 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:12.000 position:98%
 In our "Eight" project, the street fits with the house. So everyone can walk by foot or bicycle to the roof and lower again. 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.100 position:97%
 We are currently working on a power plant, which produces energy and heat from waste. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:39.100 position:98%
 We also plan an elevator that leads to the gazebo at a height of 100 m, while for a downhill skiing there is a green, blue or black ski trail. 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:47.200 position:98%
 Thus, the power plant directs the resources and the life of the city thanks to the landscapes of the ski slopes created by the man. 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:57.200 position:97%
 Architects should not be just aesthetic designers of beautiful facades or sculptures. They must become ecosystem designers, 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.100 position:58%
 which align economics and ecology. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.100 position:97%
 Instead of wasting more resources or space, we need to optimize what we have. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.100 position:98%
 To make progress, we need to optimize the use of resources.
