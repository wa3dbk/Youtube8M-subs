 realistic stories that address the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.609
 daily life and psychological issues 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.620

 11 of the more than 8,000 works that are 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.020
 on my waiting list for reading 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.939
 damn lack of time is newey solar in 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.580
 came two years before I took on a 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.130
 pum being released and published between 2005 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.470
 and 2006 in the magazine usweekly ans walked the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.540
 shogakukan publisher is focused on the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.689
 not just to deal with the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.299
 theme that consecrated the artist in Brazil to 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.180
 was launched at the end of 2011 by the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.900
 pm pocket with an absurdly high quality 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.030
 fuck 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.619
 I do not know if this is what happened to you. 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.960
 but since the first time I've seen 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.700
 solarin bookstores I was curious to 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.439
 know the meaning of this 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.930
 I thought I could respond to the 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.310
 simply by reading the work in the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.259
 However, it was also necessary to 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.930
 Japanese language 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.659
 understand the title as the Japanese 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.860
 they do not pronounce l talk about ning 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.860
 In this case, it is human henin 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.740
 for love of solani means 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.600
 interesting sky human, right? 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.909
 but for those who have not read it continues 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.489
 That's why I'm going to make a brief 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.679
 summary of the story she tells the story under 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.220
 the point of view of make a girl of 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.350
 24 years in which he graduated two years ago 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.660
 university she lives in a small house 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.270
 with her boyfriend Tony 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.430
 who graduated in the same year that she did 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.200
 goals and aimlessly they follow the 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.430
 life in a way says passionate and 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.080
 monotonous 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.000
 I loved working in the office without 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.260
 not like some of the other environment 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.200
 coworkers 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.940
 she only does it for her to still have the 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.190
 sufficient to continue paying the 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.870
 apartment while he works as 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.660
 illustrator in a company 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.400
 they are both completely bored 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.260
 despite the talent they encounter with their 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.480
 college friends sometimes by 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.500
 month to play music he still feels 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.690
 that something is missing 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.520
 from this context the author can 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.800
 discussing deep psychological issues 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.020
 from the point of view of the protagonist who 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.720
 still feels tired and 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.700
 mainly unhappy but the direction of 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.310
 history begins to change from two 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.250
 decisions one made through another 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.840
 made by tony gives she decides to resign 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.400
 of risky work leading to 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.420
 that the cost of living in 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.490
 high tokyo 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.530
 he decides to invest his time in 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.600
 compose songs for your band of friends 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.150
 trying to follow their dreams of doing 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.160
 success by touching these two choices that 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.019
 were quite a tedious routine to 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.090
 which were both arrested and 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.400
 insecurity now had another role 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.540
 because it was accompanied by the uncertainty of 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.050
 that was to come 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.750
 obviously he does feel a fear however 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.390
 gradually and together they could face 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.000
 this new stage of their lives a step 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.250
 marked by the uncertainty that in the future 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.830
 everything could happen 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.959
 will good things happen? 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.720
 that would be bad what fate 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.410
 reserved these two there is only one way to 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.519
 to know 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.470
 reading your lane beyond the manga is a 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.030
 live action that I have not watched yet 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.030
 leave the recommendation to the curious 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:12.700
 It's getting late military against the ground. 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.700
 but he also knew that I did not sign 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.389
 this song you heard in the trailer 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.090
 was composed of black ta in history and 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.820
 the fuck the author cassiano and newcomm 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.520
 because that 's where the truth is and the band and people 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.880
 confusing regina recorded and it's with 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.380
 translation of what they were this video 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.750
 wrong thinking on the other side of the 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.820
 Heaven, life has come to say goodbye 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.870
 The little piece of the future that I saw was 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.419
 saying goodbye 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.820
 the little room once lives now 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.919
 is occupied by someone else's things 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.090
 horrible that said the days that were 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.860
 wasted 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.229
 maybe if I had the chance I 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.690
 I would go back this day but I will never see 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.400
 this person again even though this 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.520
 fragile happiness in some way 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.590
 remained a bad seed indeed 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.310
 would have germinated then I think this is a 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.200
 goodbye 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.350
 the cans of coffee cold in time 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.979
 freezing colorful rainbow scarf 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.450
 I passed the alley, everything comes back to me. 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.729
 even if this fragile happiness of 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.310
 some way remained a seed 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.690
 bad would have germinated then I 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.020
 I think this is goodbye 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:22.080
 I think it's enough of you 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.930
 Can you face any place with God I? 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.740
 I'll somehow get the 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.669
 God 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.669
 that's what I'm going to do 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.650
 the realism of solari is not only in art 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.450
 but also in essence in the plot the 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.310
 problems in the 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.460
 feelings and thoughts of the 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:57.310
 characters of a solar senile in a work 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.250
 interesting because now a theme that 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.000
 every human being is forced to live the 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.850
 life 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.310
 for what reason we live we are happy 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.380
 Anyway, how can I answer all this? 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.230
 without knowing what these things are 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.480
 read sony you will not have your 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.520
 answers but may see these issues 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.650
 from another point of view 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.030
 and furthermore because home and car 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:26.940
 recommended it went out on the goshawk and moses the doko 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:30.810
 every link of arêgo left in the mouth changed 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.860
 left in the soul came 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.170
