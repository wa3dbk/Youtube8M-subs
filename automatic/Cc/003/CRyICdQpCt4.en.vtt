00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.960
 move on to the most important topics 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.900
 on the application in the local estimate so 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.860
 called inflation indices or 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.430
 conversion rates to current goals these 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.100
 indexes are the main element 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.689
 basic index of new method of obtaining 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.240
 construction costs in current 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.990
 pricing 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.429
 the essence of this method is to first 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.510
 fix the cost of all work and 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.090
 cost estimates in basic prices 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:40.260
 if we work in modern conditions then 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:46.530
 base prices are prices as of 1 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:49.379
 January 2000 and then to get 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.829
 real present value of the work we 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.949
 must multiply the base cost by 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.100
 inflation index 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.710
 thus inflation index are 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.739
 actual cost growth indicator 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.540
 work and costs compared to the base 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.450
 the price level is first of all necessary 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:18.479
 note that inflation indexes can be 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:21.960
 two kinds first you can apply 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.619
 index one number immediately to the total 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.860
 cost of work, including overhead 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:32.720
 expenses and estimated profit such an index 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.509
 Shortly called yandex xml 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.450
 smr is abbreviated building and assembly 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.350
 work 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.420
 possible another option in which 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.090
 cost of work is recalculated in 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.000
 current price level earlier 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.729
 the calculation stage when we deal only 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.610
 direct cost extra charges 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.759
 overhead direct costs 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.680
 made up of famous items here 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.870
 inflation index in this case 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.990
 applied on each or 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.410
 and separately one index 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.890
 on wages another on cost 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.550
 operation of machines 3 index on cost 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.030
 materials such a composite index 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:25.910
 Shortly called Yandex for articles 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:29.070
 costs and so every time 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.820
 starting to use in the estimates of indices 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.810
 inflation 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:37.350
 you need to understand exactly what kind of indexes 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:44.100
 we will use cost items 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:46.370
 or xmr the second question is the answer to which 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.040
 must be clear in advance 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.610
 concerns the use of indexes 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.290
 local budget estimates 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.810
 in the simplest case 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.830
 the whole estimate applies one 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.770
 single inflation index of this 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.430
 enough in a situation where you need 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.180
 get the forecast as fast as possible 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.200
 approximate cost estimate 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:18.140
 of a project for the nomination of an application 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:21.510
 for a contest or for some other purpose 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.970
 but for more accurate costing 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:30.020
 estimates for different types of work in the estimate 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.660
 apply different inflation indices 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.360
 for example in our mix we might 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:41.600
 differently index the cost 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:45.120
 works with foundations windows and floors 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.050
 well, finally the most accurate calculation 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.239
 if you use it 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:56.209
 individual inflation indices for 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.209
 each individual work in the estimate 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.890
 then we will consistently consider all 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.890
 listed case 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.930
 of course 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.460
 specialist who deals 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.920
 budgeting 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.830
 far from always having freedom 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.440
 choice of what method to use it 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.020
 inflation index 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.170
 most likely it has already been agreed 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:26.040
 between customer and contractor 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:29.050
 or generally the method of using indexes 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.320
 established by the local regional center 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.560
 pricing immediately for the whole 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.560
 the region
