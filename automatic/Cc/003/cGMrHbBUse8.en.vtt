feature<00:06:05.229> that<00:06:05.560> you<00:06:05.979> wouldn't<00:06:06.280> normally<00:06:06.370> have

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
feature that you wouldn't normally have

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.400 
feature that you wouldn't normally have
if<00:06:07.000> you<00:06:07.150> just<00:06:07.360> use<00:06:07.539> a<00:06:07.570> standard<00:06:07.870> bag<00:06:08.199> plate

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
if you just use a standard bag plate

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
know the hello replicas that were he'll

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.400 
know the hello replicas that were he'll
is<00:06:13.930> a<00:06:13.960> very<00:06:14.530> well<00:06:15.220> known<00:06:15.250> maker<00:06:16.150> of<00:06:16.449> these<00:06:16.660> turn

is a very well known maker of these turn
signals<00:06:17.800> and<00:06:17.979> they're<00:06:18.520> on<00:06:18.729> a<00:06:18.760> lot<00:06:19.090> of<00:06:19.180> this<00:06:19.300> the

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
signals and they're on a lot of this the

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.810 
signals and they're on a lot of this the
older<00:06:20.050> bikes<00:06:20.229> /<00:06:20.650> to's<00:06:20.919> I<00:06:21.190> know<00:06:21.490> their<00:06:21.669> other

older bikes / to's I know their other
brands<00:06:22.090> even<00:06:22.449> use<00:06:22.570> them<00:06:22.750> but<00:06:22.870> we<00:06:23.770> wanted<00:06:24.039> to

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
brands even use them but we wanted to

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:25.350 
brands even use them but we wanted to
put<00:06:24.220> them<00:06:24.280> on<00:06:24.430> here<00:06:24.639> because<00:06:24.849> it<00:06:24.970> is<00:06:25.090> that

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
put them on here because it is that

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.600 
put them on here because it is that
retro<00:06:25.780> gives<00:06:26.080> it<00:06:26.199> that<00:06:26.229> retro<00:06:26.650> look<00:06:26.740> it's<00:06:27.430> a

the gate 100 RT or the K 1100 LT it's

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.339 
the gate 100 RT or the K 1100 LT it's
basically<00:06:42.070> the<00:06:42.220> same<00:06:42.400> bar<00:06:42.610> so<00:06:43.360> it's<00:06:43.780> bit

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:44.349 
basically the same bar so it's bit

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:45.810 
basically the same bar so it's bit
taller<00:06:44.590> of<00:06:44.800> course<00:06:45.010> but<00:06:45.610> it's<00:06:45.729> very

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
taller of course but it's very

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.310 
taller of course but it's very
comfortable<00:06:46.090> it<00:06:46.389> gives<00:06:46.539> her<00:06:46.690> a<00:06:46.720> good<00:06:46.990> riding

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
comfortable it gives her a good riding

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.409 
comfortable it gives her a good riding
position<00:06:47.650> the<00:06:47.740> ergonomics<00:06:48.250> are<00:06:48.370> great<00:06:48.430> the

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:49.419 
position the ergonomics are great the

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:51.149 
position the ergonomics are great the
pegs<00:06:49.659> are<00:06:49.840> also<00:06:49.990> lowered<00:06:50.530> and<00:06:50.770> they're<00:06:50.979> moved

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:51.159 
pegs are also lowered and they're moved

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:53.460 
pegs are also lowered and they're moved
back<00:06:51.400> and<00:06:51.639> the<00:06:51.729> reason<00:06:52.030> for<00:06:52.120> that<00:06:52.180> is<00:06:52.479> when

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470 
back and the reason for that is when

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.250 
back and the reason for that is when
when<00:06:53.800> she<00:06:54.010> puts<00:06:54.250> her<00:06:54.310> feet<00:06:54.550> down<00:06:55.080> where<00:06:56.080> her

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
when she puts her feet down where her

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.710 
when she puts her feet down where her
where<00:06:56.590> her<00:06:56.770> ankles<00:06:57.310> are<00:06:57.550> and<00:06:57.909> her<00:06:58.120> shins<00:06:58.389> where

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 
where her ankles are and her shins where

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.689 
where her ankles are and her shins where
her<00:06:58.870> shins<00:06:59.110> land<00:06:59.440> can<00:07:00.130> be<00:07:00.250> right<00:07:00.430> in<00:07:00.520> the<00:07:00.610> way

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
her shins land can be right in the way

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:01.920 
her shins land can be right in the way
the<00:07:00.880> middle<00:07:01.060> of<00:07:01.150> peg<00:07:01.270> which<00:07:01.419> he<00:07:01.510> puts<00:07:01.659> her<00:07:01.720> legs

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
the middle of peg which he puts her legs

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.170 
the middle of peg which he puts her legs
down<00:07:02.110> her<00:07:02.560> feet<00:07:02.770> her<00:07:02.860> right<00:07:03.039> here<00:07:03.250> so<00:07:04.000> by

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180 
down her feet her right here so by

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.899 
down her feet her right here so by
moving<00:07:04.659> these<00:07:04.990> back<00:07:05.919> she<00:07:06.370> can<00:07:06.490> get<00:07:06.610> her<00:07:06.699> feet

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:06.909 
moving these back she can get her feet

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:08.189 
moving these back she can get her feet
in<00:07:07.060> front<00:07:07.270> or<00:07:07.449> in<00:07:07.539> back<00:07:07.570> much<00:07:07.990> more

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199 
in front or in back much more

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:11.310 
in front or in back much more
comfortably<00:07:08.909> and<00:07:09.909> it<00:07:10.120> doesn't<00:07:10.449> it<00:07:10.870> does

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
comfortably and it doesn't it does

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.810 
comfortably and it doesn't it does
affect<00:07:11.650> a<00:07:11.740> ground<00:07:11.979> clearance<00:07:12.190> but<00:07:12.490> all<00:07:12.669> it

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
affect a ground clearance but all it

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.670 
affect a ground clearance but all it
does<00:07:12.940> is<00:07:13.120> causes<00:07:13.449> the<00:07:13.539> pegs<00:07:13.750> the<00:07:13.870> fold<00:07:14.110> because

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 
does is causes the pegs the fold because

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.589 
does is causes the pegs the fold because
when<00:07:15.580> you<00:07:15.669> lean<00:07:15.880> this<00:07:16.060> thing<00:07:16.270> over<00:07:16.389> in<00:07:16.510> the
