00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
not really much to say about this one I

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.540 
not really much to say about this one I
I<00:01:00.510> would<00:01:00.840> think<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.289> miz<00:01:01.530> would<00:01:01.829> win<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.250> one

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
I would think the miz would win this one

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.450 
I would think the miz would win this one
just<00:01:03.329> because<00:01:03.690> he's<00:01:04.019> been<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.710> down<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
just because he's been going down and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.899 
just because he's been going down and
down<00:01:05.780> over<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> past<00:01:07.170> year<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.400> kind<00:01:08.850> of

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
down over the past year and it's kind of

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.500 
down over the past year and it's kind of
sad<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.510> I'd<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:10.229> him<00:01:10.320> get<00:01:10.500> back<00:01:10.680> up

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
sad so I'd like to see him get back up

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.210 
sad so I'd like to see him get back up
ideally<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> Miz<00:01:12.840> should<00:01:13.110> win<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.979> know

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
ideally the Miz should win but you know

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.700 
ideally the Miz should win but you know
considering<00:01:14.850> poor<00:01:15.240> writing<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.900> think<00:01:16.140> Santino

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
considering poor writing I think Santino

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.770 
considering poor writing I think Santino
will<00:01:16.920> win<00:01:17.130> oh<00:01:17.369> no<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:18.030> kind<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.330> drawn<00:01:18.570> down

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

Phoenix<00:01:25.860> now<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> think<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.420> match<00:01:27.689> will<00:01:27.869> kind

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
Phoenix now I think this match will kind

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
Phoenix now I think this match will kind
of<00:01:28.259> suck<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:29.369> because<00:01:29.729> Beth<00:01:30.119> will<00:01:30.420> be

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
of suck just because Beth will be

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.620 
of suck just because Beth will be
milking<00:01:31.439> her<00:01:31.680> fake<00:01:32.400> injury<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.210> much<00:01:33.420> as

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
milking her fake injury as much as

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.730 
milking her fake injury as much as
possible<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:36.000> imagine<00:01:36.210> Beth<00:01:36.960> may<00:01:37.320> win

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
possible so you can imagine Beth may win

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.609 
possible so you can imagine Beth may win
it<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.189> an<00:01:38.369> upset<00:01:39.060> well<00:01:39.600> not<00:01:39.900> really<00:01:39.960> an<00:01:40.200> upset

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.650 
summer I think so he could leave now or
you<00:03:59.970> could<00:04:00.209> leave<00:04:00.709> like<00:04:01.709> around<00:04:02.209> no<00:04:03.209> way<00:04:03.389> out

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
you could leave like around no way out

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.069 
you could leave like around no way out
it's<00:04:04.170> kind<00:04:04.769> of<00:04:04.799> hard<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.099> say<00:04:05.459> but<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.900> get

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
it's kind of hard to say but to get

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.809

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
argues against that fact so their promos

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.710 
argues against that fact so their promos
are<00:04:30.590> getting<00:04:30.830> fucking<00:04:31.160> retarded<00:04:31.490> and<00:04:31.970> they

match<00:04:34.760> so<00:04:35.420> I<00:04:35.450> think<00:04:35.600> that<00:04:35.840> Chris<00:04:36.140> Jericho<00:04:36.170> will

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
match so I think that Chris Jericho will

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.800 
match so I think that Chris Jericho will
win<00:04:37.010> because<00:04:37.280> he<00:04:37.910> really<00:04:38.240> needs<00:04:38.420> to<00:04:38.540> get<00:04:38.660> the

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
win because he really needs to get the

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.930 
win because he really needs to get the
heat<00:04:39.020> in<00:04:39.200> this<00:04:39.230> match<00:04:39.560> after<00:04:40.130> that<00:04:40.430> is<00:04:40.760> a<00:04:40.880> two

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940
