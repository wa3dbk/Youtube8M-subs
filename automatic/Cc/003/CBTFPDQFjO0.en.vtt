00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hey people in my video today 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.569
 I want to show you how to do it again 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.550
 windows and os 6 on a hard drive 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.010
 Install them in parallel 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.330
 can use if that then I think 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.309
 some do not quite understand 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.690
 we always ask you year you stood 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.029
 Windows away if I have a hackintosh 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.859
 makes most are determined to 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.689
 we have installed normal system 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.980
 they have a hard drive and either 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.769
 you only have one partition on the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.160
 everything is on it or 2 on 1 to half 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.750
 windows especially the dates and yes when 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.600
 We then install the os we need 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.320
 Format hard disk 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.170
 So that's all the data 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.020
 that's why you should leave yours 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.730
 backup important data and windows new 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.200
 install and I'll show you 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.329
 I do that again today 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.460
 now here only with a virtual 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.800
 machine but that does not change anything 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.570
 but I do not want it 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.879
 my hard drive format that around you 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.699
 to show here installed completely 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.649
 normal your hackintosh and start your 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.070
 installation program that's all 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.070
 default 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.970
 So far, all in all, a star 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.880
 First of all we choose ours as normal 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.689
 language then go on and on 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.840
 then go into the hard drive 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.140
 utility at utilities 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.049
 hard disk utility and see that 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.490
 Now we have our hard drive and it 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.840
 you have to go to position and now 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.479
 do we need two partitions of your child 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.250
 we'll do it soon I'll have 22 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.530
 because ever on one I would like to mean us 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.259
 iks have that you wanted the vsx videos 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.009
 did not need to change anything and the 2d wants 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.799
 from ms the file system assad and 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.460
 here are just windows specified 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.460
 apply on 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.579
 Now we have two hard disks on 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.140
 the one we can our place 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.990
 we will install on the others 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.759
 after our windows install and 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.049
 Now you can be quite normal here 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.210
 click through it depends on which 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.100
 INSTALLATION things I used do 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.439
 it is short with Cosmo oil a particularly 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.689
 more runs or holds virtual box with 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.799
 two hard drives or sticks in windows 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.660
 on sixx we can do it all 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.410
 to install 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.850
 you see, and now runs yet 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.220
 and tell us or when the 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.560
 installation is complete so the 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.110
 installation goes for example 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.440
 completed and then I was in the 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.520
 fall down the virtual machine 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.540
 So you guys thought her father was the one 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:35.660
 calculator briefly down and then changes 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:37.660
 almost two usb stick more out of mine 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.930
 case I have to change now what the cd 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.970
 namely my windows cd and you have to 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.910
 you stop in the boot manager then select 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.560
 is better and where the cdu of the dvd 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.770
 windows on it is i want windows now 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.130
 7 simply it does not matter which windows 7 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:59.210
 is and now i start the windows 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.840
 Installers like you see the city â€‹â€‹completely 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.840
 easy 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.370
 so 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.260
 that would have to be known just like that 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.970
 whole looks like number windows 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.610
 thereby installs time for the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.900
 I think most of the time I do not give any problems 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.140
 Just click on continue now 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.430
 to install 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.860
 you then go on I accept the 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.970
 license votes and then goes up 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.700
 custom extended mercedes 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.410
 whole partition and so on and you 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.900
 do you have windows service extra windows 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.610
 has to be learned and also has to find 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.380
 made very smart so go to the 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.290
 partition or have called from windows 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:43.299
 is also denied here and opens 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.010
 ok format should you see now can 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.760
 you click on continue and windows 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.459
 preinstalled 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.599
 and yes I'll show you the whole time briefly 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.040
 or see you again when the 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.160
 installation is complete 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.900
 the in stara the track had to quasi 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160
 but must start the need now 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.069
 do not do it but I have to do the same 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.500
 You're back to my USB stick, yes 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.680
 we use when in if you are 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.299
 yes, as dvd that means you are now offering 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:20.289
 I saw that again from your stick 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:23.440
 now synonymous capture and in my fold 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:27.039
 I just have to, we dim the 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.340
 bootloader to come and choose what 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.720
 I would like to do so however from the cd and 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.039
 now i can get rid of ticks and 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.820
 windows ntfs and yes that 's it then 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.560
 actually already 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.240
 you can choose between both politicians 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.669
 system you have to choose only if 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.460
 Once you have exported it there 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.620
 install the bootloader so per 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.479
 reinstall multi wiest bootloader 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.270
 because he is gone if we are 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.470
 windows installed on it which is the 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.460
 windows buttlar or installed 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.560
 That's why you should not stop working 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.950
 That's why you need gigs again 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.630
 usb stick camel again and 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.280
 install bootloader and you can 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.610
 between both operating systems completely 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.380
 easy to choose and yes that was it from me 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.729
 for this video I hope you have it 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.190
 helped a little bit further and is 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.599
 Now how to use both operating systems 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.830
 I would be pleased if but 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.950
 next time is back than you 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.950
 then
