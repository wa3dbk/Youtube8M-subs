00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello everyone with you shrimp today we 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.670
 Consider a very cool mod which 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.580
 will allow to arrange the real 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.590
 modern war directly in minecraft 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.269
 This mod can be installed on the server and 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.070
 fight a team on a team for 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.440
 any prize well or just for 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.810
 fun with my friends well, and now 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.070
 let's get down to this mod 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.590
 and we start with these 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.689
 There are only three explosive objects and 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.539
 the very first thing is the most common 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.519
 the bomb which is called bomb 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.320
 it explodes not very much but 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.840
 power enough to 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.940
 destroy some military structure 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.040
 next item is dynamite by 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.200
 power he is a little stronger than a bomb 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.989
 also pretty impressive but 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.520
 the third item is the real one 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.680
 a grenade that explodes much 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.690
 stronger than a bomb dynamite together 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.610
 taken so if you want to arrange 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.070
 too harsh war then these three 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.289
 explosives just for you next 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.629
 the subject is an ordinary leg he is 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.120
 basic equipment of the real soldier 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.949
 really this knife is not as strong as me 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.010
 he thought about two times weaker 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.840
 ordinary stone sword well, perhaps it 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.820
 so conceived the same legs and not 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.159
 any saber next three 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.900
 of the subject is the most important subjects in 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.810
 in this fashion because in one such block 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.090
 there is a whole military building if to be 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.220
 more precisely a bunker and let me show you how 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.650
 activate this block to get 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.390
 military bunker put it on the ground 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.119
 just right click on it 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.490
 mouse as you can see the block disappeared and instead 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.070
 he appeared a real military 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.350
 bunker as you can see in this bunker already 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.990
 tunnel is done so nothing can 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.979
 not breaking quietly get out and that's 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.470
 huge plus 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.750
 the next block is called forest and what 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.030
 translated as forest tent we also 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.399
 install it and activate simple 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.829
 right-click as you see 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.540
 opened a military tent in this 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.450
 the tent has everything you need for 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.640
 survival workbench stove even a chest 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.950
 chests are things that can also 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.110
 you need to survive okay 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.450
 go ahead and then we have a block under 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.850
 name forest big tent from the usual 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.979
 forest in the he is different in quantity 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.080
 players living in it for example in 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.410
 standard forest in te everything is calculated 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.810
 on 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.970
 new man in this tent for two 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.860
 also all these awnings are great 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.720
 camouflage means you see 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.240
 green awning on the grass looks 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.730
 almost unnoticed 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.040
 if there was a forest then it is exact but 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.870
 there is one question what to do if 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.910
 you are in the desert or in 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.860
 any winter biome does not matter 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.440
 developers of this mod about everything 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.510
 taken care of besides forest awnings also 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.090
 There are sand for winter 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.250
 the architecture of the building they are the same 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.810
 Only here different material okay with 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.970
 cents figured let's go to 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.700
 the next subject and the next subject 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.740
 This is such a military box. 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.810
 many items in it can not be put but 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.150
 nevertheless for some weapon 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.250
 it fits perfectly next thing 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.920
 This is such a first-aid kit which 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.020
 restores 3 heart health if 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.150
 you are injured you can always heal 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.310
 itâ€™s enough to take your wounds 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.400
 this first aid kit in hand and click on the right 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.350
 mouse button there is also an analogue of this 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.690
 first aid kit that recovers not 3 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.580
 only 2 health heart 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.800
 well, the last thing I would like to 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.350
 tell you today about camouflage 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.990
 There are three types of camouflage 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.720
 as well as awnings sandy forest and 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.790
 winter i will take a camouflage woodland 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.500
 to show you all the stealth in 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.230
 look at this costume 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.120
 for example against the background of this building I am almost 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.100
 invisible you imagine if you 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.990
 somewhere in the tropical 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.720
 biome I think that this camouflage 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.700
 developers have not added for nothing in general 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.310
 This mod is very useful but it has 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.890
 one minus crafting recipes of all these 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.110
 Blocks weapons items I unfortunately not 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.810
 I found it possible because they simply did not 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.760
 There is well and on this all with you was 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.330
