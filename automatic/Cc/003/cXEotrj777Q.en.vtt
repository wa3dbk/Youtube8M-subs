00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:07.640

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.740
 godfroid of course we always 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.440
 bring such cute things mónica 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.890
 is objective my friend no no 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.070
 today I entered into a different project 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.900
 what is now called mix media that by 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.419
 there we already did with the 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.570
 other names very vision we make note 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:31.180
 with school hours work 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.360
 apart from the collage has views up 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.269
 body and tiny things and we arrived 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.580
 cooking techniques exactly then 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.320
 I worked on a wooden frame and what 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.100
 first I did without sealing the wood 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.500
 without painting without anything is a collage with 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.450
 paper 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.370
 I am working with the products of 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.010
 eternal as you said and in this case 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.250
 I'm using the varnish adhesive and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.320
 decoupage then once it hit 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.870
 all the papers if you see the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.080
 finished there are words or I put 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.300
 different words what at that time 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.170
 for example here river you have to laugh a lot 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.270
 yes sir love that here is not or is the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.250
 you are putting together a monkey because in life 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.960
 you have to have humor to spend 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.610
 some things and everything that you 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.280
 arises at the moment superfluous, yes, I know 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.840
 well we let it dry and then not 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.810
 we know whether or not the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.700
 words are going to come in once I did 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.680
 That's why I forgive a wash with 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.950
 Acrylic land of natural Siena 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.960
 I'm working with acrylics 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.649
 decorative eternal life then what 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.710
 I'm going to do 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.690
 awada from earth of sienna natural to all 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.200
 the project and that gives you the feeling of 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.420
 aged 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.590
 old that I did after I could not miss 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.140
 the transfer then a butterfly 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.390
 she also enjoys that I'm a fan of 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.390
 butterflies then a good photocopy 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.210
 of butterfly two hands of ether molina la 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.420
 third wet and with the third wet 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.569
 supported and paste we already explained it well in the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.519
 another program and then I have this 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.940
 once the image of the 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.970
 I'm going to release it with water better 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.739
 if we let it dry two or three in two or 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.299
 three hours notice that I'm 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.510
 working on paper 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.250
 the paper is sealed with the adhesive 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.299
 to vacate that is not going to 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.860
 spoil when I wet it with the 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.870
 transfer to ask that we do not have 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.360
 no problem for not getting the base 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.569
 exactly sealed is not altered in the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.700
 end you dress him up and this would be another 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.890
 step look here I already took almost everything 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.050
 and I stay the transfer the good thing about 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.629
 the transfer is to look under the 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.180
 journal paper that I stuck in here 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.459
 he wants more dreams he laughs he lives good and everything 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.000
 that at that time came out and now if 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.310
 I start work that I do not know goes 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.130
 arising the work in the moment that 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.090
 is going to work and the first thing I did was 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:16.220
 with plaster and um 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:18.140
 stencil I put a clock if a part of the 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.110
 watch of the dial of a watch and 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.629
 then that I mix it with chalk for 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.610
 give it more texture and this is what you see 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.670
 here if you see I was ahead 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.620
 excel this is already dry then 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.200
 what I did after I put the 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.510
 stencil so as not to mess down and with 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.290
 any brush I will work with 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:43.980
 black acrylic yes with black acrylic I'll 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:47.400
 to paint these numbers that I 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.340
 and with plaster cheese add it as 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.480
 I told them little inflated to do it more 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.400
 hard if I wanted a stone type thing 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.849
 pretty black and then on black 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.200
 I do this so that it does not get stained 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.430
 that I have down 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.370
 the way to work well here is a 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:12.299
 once it dried up let's suppose the black with 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.150
 golden acrylic and it just looked good 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.820
 there we are going to stain with a little 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:22.910
 golden I do not want golden what I want 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.910
 is that an aged person is also 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.220
 in this case you can be the same as 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:34.520
 obviously you can think of it or 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.980
 habiten I said what are you putting together inside 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.050
 of the project there are others 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.150
 there are other extensibles that are made 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.490
 with plaster and there are other extensibles that 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.910
 They are simply made with acrylic 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:50.480
 then what I did was put again 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.000
 If the stencil is going to work now 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:57.040
 see what pin brush esther my brushes 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.040
 they are poor they are sorry 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.410
 Spoken well with two acrylic 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.860
 ground of toasted or natural shade what 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.680
 what I'm going to use is the stencil to make 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.830
 all a float around at minimum light 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.490
 of template exactly and there what 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.610
 I do is mark everything 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.800
 in the east quadrant of the clock look at me 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.009
 that I made a butterfly the finished one has 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.490
 the face of an angel 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.619
 the work can be the the design can 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.550
 to be anybody either is to go working 

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:35.099
 has blondas has a flower of and this 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.249
 fixed you wear these nylon we use 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:39.990
 to get the nerves good for example 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:43.229
 with the brown 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:46.680
 to see with the toasted shadow is painted by a 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:51.649
 You will use it a bit as a seal 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:54.119
 what are they that have out there if 911 

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:57.419
