00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.340 
very hot grill the tuna will cook this
side<00:01:56.680> for<00:01:57.610> about<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.820> minute<00:01:58.120> we<00:01:59.020> want<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.229> make

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
side for about a minute we want to make

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.719 
side for about a minute we want to make
sure<00:01:59.380> we<00:01:59.620> get<00:01:59.710> those<00:01:59.860> lovely<00:02:00.159> crisscross

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
sure we get those lovely crisscross

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.760 
sure we get those lovely crisscross
marks<00:02:00.970> on<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.420> tuna<00:02:01.690> because<00:02:02.440> with<00:02:02.620> this

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
marks on the tuna because with this

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.930 
marks on the tuna because with this
presentation<00:02:03.280> we're<00:02:03.520> going<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.670> keep<00:02:03.790> it

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
presentation we're going to keep it

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.149 
presentation we're going to keep it
quite<00:02:04.120> simple<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:05.229> you<00:02:05.320> can<00:02:05.440> see<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.740> tunas

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
quite simple so you can see the tunas

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.639 
quite simple so you can see the tunas
just<00:02:06.400> taking<00:02:07.060> up<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.299> heat<00:02:07.540> changing<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.619> that

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
just taking up the heat changing to that

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.619 
just taking up the heat changing to that
gray<00:02:09.039> color<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:09.429> I<00:02:09.580> mentioned<00:02:10.060> previously

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
gray color that I mentioned previously

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.110 
gray color that I mentioned previously
so<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.379> tuna<00:02:11.769> will<00:02:11.920> cook<00:02:12.190> right<00:02:12.730> through<00:02:13.030> at

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
so the tuna will cook right through at

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.430 
so the tuna will cook right through at
that<00:02:13.150> color<00:02:13.540> if<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:13.780> let<00:02:14.080> it

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
that color if we let it

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.860 
that color if we let it
but<00:02:14.890> then<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.159> tuna<00:02:15.430> becomes<00:02:15.700> very<00:02:15.909> dry<00:02:16.120> it's

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
but then the tuna becomes very dry it's

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.629 
but then the tuna becomes very dry it's
a<00:02:17.019> fish<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.379> hasn't<00:02:17.650> got<00:02:17.860> much<00:02:18.010> moisture<00:02:18.310> in

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:18.639 
a fish that hasn't got much moisture in

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.979 
a fish that hasn't got much moisture in
it<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.209> needs<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.480> be<00:02:19.569> cooked<00:02:19.659> very<00:02:19.930> quickly

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
it so it needs to be cooked very quickly

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.700 
it so it needs to be cooked very quickly
and<00:02:20.560> just<00:02:21.400> slightly<00:02:21.939> pink<00:02:22.450> in<00:02:22.659> the<00:02:22.749> center

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
and just slightly pink in the center

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.040 
and just slightly pink in the center
now<00:02:24.190> at<00:02:24.310> 40<00:02:24.670> seconds<00:02:25.120> I'm<00:02:25.300> checking<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.870> fish

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
now at 40 seconds I'm checking the fish

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.660 
now at 40 seconds I'm checking the fish
it's<00:02:26.260> lifting<00:02:26.650> beautifully<00:02:27.130> from<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.430> plate

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
it's lifting beautifully from the plate

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.130 
it's lifting beautifully from the plate
you<00:02:28.090> can<00:02:28.210> see<00:02:28.330> we've<00:02:28.450> got<00:02:28.510> those<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:28.960> we

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
you can see we've got those that we

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.920 
you can see we've got those that we
don't<00:02:29.170> want<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.470> burn<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.950> fish<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.780> fish

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
don't want to burn the fish and the fish

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.900 
don't want to burn the fish and the fish

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
feature of a lifestyle barbecue this

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.300 
feature of a lifestyle barbecue this
lovely<00:02:43.630> serving<00:02:44.110> plate<00:02:44.350> on<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.680> side<00:02:44.710> built

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
lovely serving plate on the side built

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.150 
lovely serving plate on the side built
into<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.850> unit<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:47.530> it's<00:02:47.680> about<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.860> minute<00:02:48.070> now

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
into the unit so it's about a minute now

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.650 
into the unit so it's about a minute now
we're<00:02:51.160> going<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.430> use<00:02:51.670> our<00:02:51.850> spatula<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.630> I

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
we're going to use our spatula to I

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.660 
we're going to use our spatula to I
think<00:02:53.080> we<00:02:53.470> might<00:02:53.650> just<00:02:53.830> use<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.160> tongs<00:02:54.430> here

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
think we might just use the tongs here

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.240 
think we might just use the tongs here
we<00:02:54.790> go<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.150> flip<00:02:55.570> now<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.440> tuna<00:02:56.770> is<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.010> very

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
we go and flip now the tuna is a very

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.980 
we go and flip now the tuna is a very
firm<00:02:57.520> fish<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.150> you're<00:02:58.330> going<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.510> find<00:02:58.810> that

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
firm fish so you're going to find that

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.260 
firm fish so you're going to find that
it<00:02:59.110> will<00:02:59.290> lift<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.800> lot<00:02:59.980> easier<00:03:00.460> than<00:03:00.910> say<00:03:01.240> a

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
it will lift a lot easier than say a

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.930 
it will lift a lot easier than say a
salmon<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.620> works<00:03:02.830> beautifully<00:03:03.520> on<00:03:03.670> the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
salmon so it works beautifully on the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.670 
salmon so it works beautifully on the
grill<00:03:04.180> for<00:03:04.390> that<00:03:04.540> reason<00:03:05.020> it's<00:03:05.200> not<00:03:05.290> going<00:03:05.620> to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
grill for that reason it's not going to

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.880 
grill for that reason it's not going to
fall<00:03:05.860> apart<00:03:06.030> its<00:03:07.030> fat<00:03:07.330> content<00:03:07.570> is<00:03:08.020> less<00:03:08.260> so

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
fall apart its fat content is less so

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.570 
fall apart its fat content is less so
therefore<00:03:09.340> it's<00:03:09.520> a<00:03:09.610> firm<00:03:09.880> fish<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:12.280> can<00:03:12.400> see

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
therefore it's a firm fish you can see

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.220 
therefore it's a firm fish you can see
how<00:03:12.700> we've<00:03:12.850> got<00:03:13.030> those<00:03:13.150> lovely<00:03:13.540> grill<00:03:13.900> marks
