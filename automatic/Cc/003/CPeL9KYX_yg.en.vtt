electronic music means to me and the
real<00:02:29.670> fall<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.210> follower<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:31.020> electronic

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
real fall of a follower of electronic

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.800 
real fall of a follower of electronic
music<00:02:31.590> my<00:02:32.550> look<00:02:32.760> at<00:02:32.910> electronic<00:02:33.360> music<00:02:33.630> comes

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
music my look at electronic music comes

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.120 
music my look at electronic music comes
from<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:34.020> different<00:02:34.380> points<00:02:34.710> like<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.040> know

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
from a different points like you know

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.920 
from a different points like you know
when<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.310> started<00:02:35.730> DJing<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.180> DJ<00:02:36.360> was<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.720> freak

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
when I started DJing the DJ was to freak

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.450 
when I started DJing the DJ was to freak
in<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.080> corner<00:02:37.470> while<00:02:37.620> other<00:02:37.800> people<00:02:37.980> had<00:02:38.220> fun

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
in the corner while other people had fun

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.270 
in the corner while other people had fun
it<00:02:38.640> was<00:02:38.820> about<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.780> music<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.800> developed

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
it was about the music and it developed

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.040 
it was about the music and it developed
from<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.610> small<00:02:41.820> subculture<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.750> probably

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
from a small subculture and to probably

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.390 
from a small subculture and to probably
the<00:02:43.140> biggest<00:02:43.380> music<00:02:43.770> culture<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.250> world

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
the biggest music culture in the world

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.120 
the biggest music culture in the world
but<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.270> also<00:02:45.480> about<00:02:45.780> keeping<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.680> where

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
but it is also about keeping it to where

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.820 
but it is also about keeping it to where
the<00:02:47.250> music<00:02:47.610> comes<00:02:48.240> from<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.900> therefore

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
the music comes from and therefore

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.440 
the music comes from and therefore
creating<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.340> perspective<00:02:50.760> for<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.150> music

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
creating a perspective for the music

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.030 
creating a perspective for the music
because<00:02:51.660> what<00:02:51.840> what<00:02:52.110> we<00:02:52.230> see<00:02:52.440> now<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.920> an

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
because what what we see now is an

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.120 
because what what we see now is an
influx<00:02:53.460> in<00:02:53.760> in<00:02:54.270> pop<00:02:55.020> music<00:02:55.050> basically<00:02:55.530> this<00:02:55.980> is

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
influx in in pop music basically this is

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.980 
influx in in pop music basically this is
what<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.520> it's<00:02:56.850> kind<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.210> like<00:02:57.390> dense<00:02:57.660> about

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
what it is it's kind of like dense about

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.260 
what it is it's kind of like dense about
pop<00:02:58.170> music<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:59.520> know<00:02:59.640> we<00:02:59.790> always<00:03:00.060> see

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
pop music and you know we always see

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.120 
pop music and you know we always see
those<00:03:00.510> wave<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.140> right<00:03:01.470> now<00:03:01.680> it's<00:03:01.920> kind<00:03:02.100> of

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
those wave so right now it's kind of

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.620 
those wave so right now it's kind of
like<00:03:02.280> very<00:03:02.520> danceable<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.180> next<00:03:03.420> thing<00:03:03.570> is

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
like very danceable the next thing is

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.060 
like very danceable the next thing is
probably<00:03:03.750> everything's<00:03:04.380> gonna<00:03:04.530> be<00:03:04.710> more<00:03:04.920> I'm

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
probably everything's gonna be more I'm

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.640 
probably everything's gonna be more I'm
being<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.670> maybe<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.150> mean<00:03:06.840> if<00:03:07.020> one<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.500> big

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
being and maybe I mean if one of the big

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.260 
being and maybe I mean if one of the big
rock<00:03:07.860> bands<00:03:08.190> comes<00:03:08.460> up<00:03:08.640> with<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.850> really<00:03:09.240> really
