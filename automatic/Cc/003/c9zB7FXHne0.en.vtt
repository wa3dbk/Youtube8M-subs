00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.640 
actually has a little more power than
enough<00:02:42.910> for<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.210> that<00:02:43.480> would<00:02:43.660> that<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.500> would

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
enough for I that would that you would

00:02:44.650 --> 00:03:14.440 
enough for I that would that you would
normally<00:02:44.770> buy<00:02:45.130> here<00:02:45.520> locally

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.610 

so<00:03:15.080> getting<00:03:15.950> back<00:03:16.010> on<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.550> topic<00:03:16.940> here

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
so getting back on the topic here

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.760 
so getting back on the topic here
making<00:03:19.340> these<00:03:19.459> videos<00:03:19.580> and

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
making these videos and

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.559 
making these videos and
especially<00:03:22.520> kind<00:03:22.730> of

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
especially kind of

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.949 
especially kind of
kind<00:03:25.170> of<00:03:25.200> funny<00:03:25.379> to<00:03:25.530> be<00:03:25.739> prepared<00:03:26.069> to<00:03:26.959> morta

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
kind of funny to be prepared to morta

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:41.130 
kind of funny to be prepared to morta
this<00:03:28.650> is<00:03:28.829> really<00:03:29.159> no<00:03:29.579> comparison

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.930 

so<00:03:41.800> for<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.100> time<00:03:42.130> being<00:03:42.310> I'm<00:03:42.580> going<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.760> keep

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
so for the time being I'm going to keep

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.949 
so for the time being I'm going to keep
sticking<00:03:43.360> mostly<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:43.990> topics<00:03:44.380> about<00:03:44.910> riding

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
sticking mostly to topics about riding

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.760 
sticking mostly to topics about riding
and<00:03:46.959> just<00:03:47.170> finding<00:03:47.860> some<00:03:48.250> roads<00:03:48.490> and<00:03:49.770> well

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
and just finding some roads and well

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.860 
and just finding some roads and well
that's<00:03:51.340> another<00:03:51.580> reason<00:03:51.819> it's<00:03:52.450> just<00:03:52.660> more

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
that's another reason it's just more

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.860 
that's another reason it's just more
like<00:03:53.050> a<00:03:53.080> I<00:03:53.410> guess<00:03:53.860> a<00:03:53.890> travel<00:03:54.310> log<00:03:54.490> or<00:03:54.700> a<00:03:54.870> showing
