00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
frames are like connection to the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.200 
frames are like connection to the
services<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.620> usually<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.219> have

services and so that I usually I have
really<00:01:03.809> bad<00:01:03.840> connection<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.489> is

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
really bad connection on this is

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.010 
really bad connection on this is
probably<00:01:05.790> gonna<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> shortest<00:01:06.630> survival

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
