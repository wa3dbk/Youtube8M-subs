opinion the easiest way to kill Roshan

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.550 
opinion the easiest way to kill Roshan
at<00:01:20.700> level<00:01:20.909> 1<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.720> I'll<00:01:21.810> show<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> basics

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
at level 1 so I'll show you the basics

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.440 
at level 1 so I'll show you the basics
of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> technique<00:01:23.189> 1<00:01:23.549> hero<00:01:23.850> goes<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.299> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
of the technique 1 hero goes in and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.649 
of the technique 1 hero goes in and
tanks<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.200> other<00:01:25.320> one<00:01:25.560> attacks<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:27.299> when

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
tanks the other one attacks then when

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.600 
tanks the other one attacks then when
that<00:01:27.780> hero<00:01:28.080> pulls<00:01:28.320> out<00:01:28.530> they<00:01:28.770> heal<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.250> now<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that hero pulls out they heal up now the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.069 
that hero pulls out they heal up now the
reason<00:01:29.909> why<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.060> one's<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.479> effective<00:01:30.930> is

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
reason why this one's so effective is

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.289 
reason why this one's so effective is
because<00:01:31.110> bio<00:01:31.619> while<00:01:32.310> he's<00:01:32.549> healing<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.030> also

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
because bio while he's healing is also

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.179 
because bio while he's healing is also
healing<00:01:33.540> Ursa<00:01:34.110> which<00:01:34.590> means<00:01:34.799> Earth<00:01:34.979> doesn't

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
healing Ursa which means Earth doesn't

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.580 
healing Ursa which means Earth doesn't
really<00:01:35.520> take<00:01:35.729> any<00:01:36.000> damage<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.390> all<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:37.470> other

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
really take any damage at all the other

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.230 
really take any damage at all the other
thing<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:37.860> well<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.400> tether<00:01:38.700> slows

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
thing as well is that that tether slows

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.719 
thing as well is that that tether slows
rush<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.810> whatever<00:01:40.170> gets<00:01:40.490> caught<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.640> it

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
rush and whatever gets caught in it

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.550 
rush and whatever gets caught in it
which<00:01:42.299> basically<00:01:42.479> means<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.020> attack<00:01:43.259> speeds

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
which basically means is attack speeds

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.560 
which basically means is attack speeds
are<00:01:43.680> also<00:01:43.890> decreased<00:01:44.369> makes<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.880> dangerously

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
are also decreased makes it dangerously

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.690 
are also decreased makes it dangerously
powerful<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.079> effective<00:01:46.280> your<00:01:47.280> R<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.490> mind

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
powerful and effective your R in mind

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.190 
powerful and effective your R in mind
also<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.240> one<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> best<00:01:48.659> healing<00:01:49.079> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
also it's one of the best healing and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200 
also it's one of the best healing and

obviously<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.110> case<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.560> always<00:02:07.680> need<00:02:07.920> to

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
obviously in this case I always need to

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.410 
obviously in this case I always need to
do<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.340> because<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.849> just<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.300> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
do that because you just have this to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.900 
do that because you just have this to
her<00:02:09.539> sir<00:02:09.840> while<00:02:10.259> he's<00:02:10.440> healing<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.849> you

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
her sir while he's healing and so you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.910 
her sir while he's healing and so you
see<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> very<00:02:12.450> fast<00:02:12.750> very<00:02:13.170> easy<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.830> effective

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
combo the next technique you want to use

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.130 
combo the next technique you want to use
is<00:02:20.280> tanking<00:02:20.700> damage<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.629> is<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.930> select

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
is tanking damage so this is you select

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.900 
is tanking damage so this is you select
heroes<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.800> their<00:02:22.890> ability<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.280> resist<00:02:23.760> the

1400 HP you can just tank for ages and

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.839 
1400 HP you can just tank for ages and
so<00:02:37.050> he<00:02:37.170> just<00:02:37.349> sits<00:02:37.560> there<00:02:37.650> put<00:02:38.430> them<00:02:38.519> in<00:02:38.670> and

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
so he just sits there put them in and

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.940 
so he just sits there put them in and
then<00:02:38.940> for<00:02:39.120> ages<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.780> ages<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.140> ages<00:02:40.290> rush<00:02:40.709> and

then for ages and ages and ages rush and

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.770 
then for ages and ages and ages rush and
just<00:02:41.069> hits<00:02:41.220> them<00:02:41.360> eventually<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.480> will<00:02:42.629> need

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
just hits them eventually you will need

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.210 
just hits them eventually you will need
to<00:02:42.840> pull<00:02:43.019> them<00:02:43.080> out<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.410> then<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:43.800> can<00:02:44.010> heal

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
to pull them out and then you can heal

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.790 
to pull them out and then you can heal
them<00:02:44.340> up<00:02:44.459> in<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:45.810> case<00:02:46.050> lone<00:02:46.319> druid<00:02:46.650> will

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
them up in that case lone druid will

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.220 
them up in that case lone druid will
step<00:02:47.069> in<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.489> so<00:02:48.300> theoretically<00:02:48.510> throughout

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
step in and so theoretically throughout

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.869 
step in and so theoretically throughout
this<00:02:49.349> combo<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.099> should<00:02:50.280> never<00:02:50.459> actually<00:02:50.640> be

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
this combo so should never actually be

this combo so should never actually be

level 1 for 3 seconds rush and was

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.920 
level 1 for 3 seconds rush and was
simply<00:03:40.890> not<00:03:41.190> hit<00:03:41.459> her<00:03:41.610> which<00:03:42.330> means<00:03:42.540> she<00:03:42.810> can

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
simply not hit her which means she can

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.180 
simply not hit her which means she can
tank<00:03:43.200> for<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.470> lot<00:03:43.650> lot<00:03:43.830> longer

tank for a lot lot longer

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.630 
tank for a lot lot longer
despite<00:03:44.700> her<00:03:45.209> low<00:03:45.480> armor<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.140> low<00:03:46.349> HP<00:03:46.640> then

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
despite her low armor and low HP then

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.640 
despite her low armor and low HP then
she<00:03:47.790> pulls<00:03:48.030> out<00:03:48.209> heals<00:03:48.569> comebacks<00:03:49.110> comes<00:03:49.440> back

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
she pulls out heals comebacks comes back

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.990 
she pulls out heals comebacks comes back
in<00:03:49.769> again<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:50.159> she<00:03:50.310> can<00:03:50.430> do<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.640> multiple

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
in again and she can do that multiple

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.119 
in again and she can do that multiple
times

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
times

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.229 
times
faceless<00:03:53.129> was<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.340> surprise<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.879> me<00:03:53.970> as<00:03:54.000> well

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
faceless was a surprise to me as well

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.390 
faceless was a surprise to me as well
but<00:03:54.450> backtrack<00:03:54.930> is<00:03:55.140> effective<00:03:55.560> evasion<00:03:55.980> and

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
but backtrack is effective evasion and

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.339 
but backtrack is effective evasion and
so<00:03:56.580> temps<00:03:56.909> at<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.150> time<00:03:57.330> Roshan<00:03:57.870> will<00:03:57.989> not<00:03:58.170> hit

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
so temps at the time Roshan will not hit

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.070 
so temps at the time Roshan will not hit
that<00:03:59.010> is<00:03:59.220> very<00:03:59.519> very<00:03:59.819> effective<00:04:00.090> at<00:04:00.689> resisting

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
that is very very effective at resisting

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.860 
that is very very effective at resisting
damage<00:04:01.700> then<00:04:02.700> we<00:04:02.939> got<00:04:03.090> resisting<00:04:03.540> damage

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
damage then we got resisting damage

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.020 
damage then we got resisting damage
fully<00:04:04.530> now<00:04:04.980> this<00:04:05.099> is<00:04:05.250> where<00:04:05.400> for<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.760> certain

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
fully now this is where for a certain

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.220 
fully now this is where for a certain
period<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.269> time<00:04:06.360> they<00:04:06.720> won't<00:04:06.870> take<00:04:06.989> any

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
period of time they won't take any

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.110 
period of time they won't take any
damage<00:04:07.409> at<00:04:07.769> all<00:04:07.799> instead<00:04:08.670> something<00:04:08.939> else

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
damage at all instead something else

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.330 
damage at all instead something else
well<00:04:09.390> in<00:04:09.689> this<00:04:09.810> case<00:04:10.019> refraction<00:04:10.769> from

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
well in this case refraction from

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.970 
well in this case refraction from
templar<00:04:11.819> assassin<00:04:12.560> got<00:04:13.560> extreme<00:04:13.830> from

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
templar assassin got extreme from

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.770 
templar assassin got extreme from
Abaddon<00:04:14.340> both<00:04:15.000> of<00:04:15.150> these<00:04:15.209> techniques<00:04:15.510> work

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
Abaddon both of these techniques work

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.379 
Abaddon both of these techniques work
and<00:04:16.079> so<00:04:16.709> for<00:04:16.949> three<00:04:17.040> successive<00:04:17.459> hits<00:04:17.669> temple

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
and so for three successive hits temple

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.330 
and so for three successive hits temple
I<00:04:18.449> will<00:04:18.509> not<00:04:18.690> take<00:04:18.810> any<00:04:19.019> damage<00:04:19.290> at<00:04:19.590> all<00:04:19.650> which

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
I will not take any damage at all which

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.890 
I will not take any damage at all which
means<00:04:20.370> you<00:04:20.729> can<00:04:20.850> tank<00:04:21.060> for<00:04:21.209> longer

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
means you can tank for longer

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.840 
means you can tank for longer
and<00:04:21.989> even<00:04:22.590> though<00:04:22.650> she<00:04:22.710> has<00:04:22.860> low<00:04:23.010> HP<00:04:23.040> her<00:04:23.669> high

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
and even though she has low HP her high

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.490 
and even though she has low HP her high
armor<00:04:24.180> means<00:04:24.389> that<00:04:24.540> she<00:04:24.660> can<00:04:24.780> resist<00:04:24.870> a<00:04:25.169> lot<00:04:25.380> of

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
armor means that she can resist a lot of

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.430 
armor means that she can resist a lot of
damage<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:27.060> fastest<00:04:27.600> way<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.720> kill<00:04:27.990> Russian

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
damage the fastest way to kill Russian

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.540 
damage the fastest way to kill Russian
at<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.650> low<00:04:28.770> levels<00:04:29.100> is<00:04:29.250> by<00:04:29.400> increasing

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
at the low levels is by increasing

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.420 
at the low levels is by increasing
attack<00:04:30.090> speed<00:04:30.389> and<00:04:30.630> so<00:04:31.410> bloodless<00:04:31.800> mohkumat<00:04:32.220> I

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430

close as possible to Rush and when you

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.960 
close as possible to Rush and when you

try and tank otherwise he will

now<00:05:36.330> you<00:05:36.389> notice<00:05:36.660> of<00:05:36.810> course<00:05:37.050> here<00:05:37.260> that

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
now you notice of course here that

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.730 
now you notice of course here that
instead<00:05:38.760> of<00:05:39.000> having<00:05:39.270> a<00:05:39.599> snap<00:05:39.960> shield<00:05:40.320> there's

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
instead of having a snap shield there's

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.250 
instead of having a snap shield there's
an<00:05:40.800> Ironwood<00:05:41.160> branch<00:05:41.430> for<00:05:42.060> Earthshaker<00:05:42.660> and

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
an Ironwood branch for Earthshaker and

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.450 
an Ironwood branch for Earthshaker and
there's<00:05:43.410> a<00:05:43.470> good<00:05:43.650> reason<00:05:43.680> for<00:05:44.130> this<00:05:44.220> this<00:05:44.400> is

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
there's a good reason for this this is

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.120 
there's a good reason for this this is
so<00:05:44.700> that<00:05:44.820> his<00:05:44.940> mana<00:05:45.210> regenerates<00:05:45.750> enough<00:05:46.169> that

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
so that his mana regenerates enough that

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.770 
so that his mana regenerates enough that
he<00:05:47.250> can<00:05:47.400> use<00:05:47.580> fissure<00:05:47.820> twice<00:05:48.150> and<00:05:48.479> there<00:05:48.720> you

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
he can use fissure twice and there you

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.469 
he can use fissure twice and there you
go<00:05:48.870> Fisher<00:05:49.200> has<00:05:49.289> come<00:05:49.470> back<00:05:49.620> online<00:05:50.210> and<00:05:51.210> then

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
go Fisher has come back online and then

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.240 
go Fisher has come back online and then
there<00:05:51.720> it<00:05:51.810> is<00:05:51.900> again<00:05:52.050> now<00:05:52.590> remember<00:05:53.010> do<00:05:53.220> not

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
there it is again now remember do not

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.370 
there it is again now remember do not
leave<00:05:53.550> more<00:05:53.729> than<00:05:53.789> 6<00:05:54.210> seconds<00:05:54.720> between<00:05:54.990> each

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
leave more than 6 seconds between each

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.800 
leave more than 6 seconds between each
attack<00:05:56.099> otherwise<00:05:56.820> Roshan<00:05:57.389> will<00:05:57.479> lose<00:05:57.660> his

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
attack otherwise Roshan will lose his

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:58.580 
attack otherwise Roshan will lose his
fury<00:05:58.020> swipes

everything<00:05:59.010> you've<00:05:59.130> done<00:05:59.250> will<00:05:59.430> be<00:05:59.520> a<00:05:59.550> waste

everything you've done will be a waste

everything you've done will be a waste
of<00:05:59.849> time<00:05:59.910> but<00:06:00.900> the<00:06:00.990> second<00:06:01.260> vision<00:06:01.380> goes<00:06:01.590> off

of time but the second vision goes off

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.029 
of time but the second vision goes off
and<00:06:02.070> then<00:06:02.160> rush<00:06:02.340> and<00:06:02.550> goes<00:06:02.699> down<00:06:03.770> now<00:06:04.770> the<00:06:04.830> same

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
and then rush and goes down now the same

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:06.680 
and then rush and goes down now the same
place<00:06:05.250> or<00:06:05.460> Mirana<00:06:06.000> Shin<00:06:06.270> you<00:06:06.360> have<00:06:06.449> five

place or Mirana Shin you have five
seconds<00:06:06.990> stun<00:06:07.260> but<00:06:07.680> you<00:06:07.770> notice<00:06:08.039> that<00:06:08.190> this

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
seconds stun but you notice that this

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.710 
seconds stun but you notice that this
little<00:06:08.669> point<00:06:08.880> here<00:06:08.940> when<00:06:09.210> she<00:06:09.330> throws<00:06:09.539> it

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
little point here when she throws it

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.400 
little point here when she throws it
from<00:06:09.840> the<00:06:10.080> little<00:06:10.199> ledge<00:06:10.440> before<00:06:10.740> the<00:06:10.830> water

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
from the little ledge before the water

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.719 
from the little ledge before the water
gives<00:06:13.410> you<00:06:13.530> enough<00:06:13.889> distance<00:06:14.130> in<00:06:14.490> order<00:06:14.669> to

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
gives you enough distance in order to

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.120 
gives you enough distance in order to
guarantee<00:06:14.970> that<00:06:15.180> five<00:06:15.570> seconds<00:06:16.050> but<00:06:16.800> she's

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
guarantee that five seconds but she's

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.350 
guarantee that five seconds but she's
going<00:06:17.250> to<00:06:17.310> go<00:06:17.430> to<00:06:17.460> there<00:06:17.729> every<00:06:18.060> single<00:06:18.210> time

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
going to go to there every single time

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.719 
going to go to there every single time
so<00:06:18.900> she's<00:06:19.080> the<00:06:19.169> only<00:06:19.229> hero<00:06:19.740> that<00:06:20.039> has<00:06:20.220> to<00:06:20.430> pull

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
so she's the only hero that has to pull

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:22.520 
so she's the only hero that has to pull
out<00:06:20.910> of<00:06:21.240> the<00:06:21.449> rush<00:06:21.630> and<00:06:21.870> pit<00:06:22.110> in<00:06:22.229> order<00:06:22.410> to<00:06:22.470> be

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
out of the rush and pit in order to be

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.659 
out of the rush and pit in order to be
effective<00:06:22.710> which<00:06:23.010> means<00:06:23.220> the<00:06:23.280> enemy<00:06:23.400> team

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
effective which means the enemy team

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:25.580 
effective which means the enemy team
more<00:06:24.300> like<00:06:24.389> to<00:06:24.510> see<00:06:24.660> her<00:06:24.810> and<00:06:25.020> catch<00:06:25.260> her<00:06:25.440> and

more like to see her and catch her and
kill<00:06:25.740> her<00:06:25.830> now<00:06:26.639> after<00:06:26.789> tanking<00:06:27.240> for<00:06:27.360> a<00:06:27.389> little

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 
kill her now after tanking for a little

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:29.930 
kill her now after tanking for a little
bit<00:06:27.720> she<00:06:27.930> comes<00:06:28.169> out<00:06:28.380> she<00:06:28.620> heals<00:06:29.010> up<00:06:29.280> and<00:06:29.550> then

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
bit she comes out she heals up and then

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.310 
bit she comes out she heals up and then
she<00:06:30.060> goes<00:06:30.210> back<00:06:30.240> to<00:06:30.510> the<00:06:30.570> ledge<00:06:30.719> to<00:06:30.900> fire<00:06:31.140> the

she goes back to the ledge to fire the

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.990 
she goes back to the ledge to fire the
arrow<00:06:31.469> again

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
arrow again

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.670 
arrow again
