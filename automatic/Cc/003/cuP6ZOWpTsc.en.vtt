00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.780 

this<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.840> like<00:02:10.019> a<00:02:10.049> PC<00:02:11.480> that'll<00:02:12.480> tell<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.790> basic

this is like a PC that'll tell you basic

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:24.080 
this is like a PC that'll tell you basic
so<00:02:16.069> if<00:02:17.069> you're<00:02:17.519> really<00:02:18.090> new<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.360> laptops<00:02:23.090> but

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
so if you're really new to laptops but

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.780 
so if you're really new to laptops but
if<00:02:24.269> you<00:02:24.480> know<00:02:24.599> what<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:29.280> that's<00:02:29.430> pretty<00:02:29.610> nice

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
if you know what so that's pretty nice

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.400 
if you know what so that's pretty nice
it<00:02:30.030> explains<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.810> touchscreen<00:02:31.230> and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
it explains to the touchscreen and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.670 
it explains to the touchscreen and
everything<00:02:31.920> here<00:02:32.569> but<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:33.599> think<00:02:34.049> I'll<00:02:34.410> know

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
everything here but I think I'll know

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.009 
everything here but I think I'll know
what<00:02:34.799> I'm<00:02:34.920> doing

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
what I'm doing

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.530 
what I'm doing
we<00:02:37.019> have<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.290> course<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.700> charger<00:02:39.239> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
we have of course the charger the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.900 
we have of course the charger the
charger<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:40.319> don't<00:02:41.010> think<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.220> need<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.430> take<00:02:41.760> it

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
charger I don't think I need to take it

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.580 
charger I don't think I need to take it
off<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.269> I<00:02:42.540> think<00:02:43.049> there's<00:02:43.200> something<00:02:43.500> else

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
off but I think there's something else

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.569 
off but I think there's something else
in<00:02:43.829> here<00:02:45.829> it<00:02:46.829> feels<00:02:46.860> like<00:02:47.220> there's<00:02:47.370> something

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
in here it feels like there's something

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.170 
in here it feels like there's something
else

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.789 

what's<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.420> oh<00:02:51.690> it's<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.230> battery<00:02:52.650> of

course<00:02:53.069> court<00:02:53.880> oh<00:02:54.889> it's<00:02:55.889> gonna<00:02:56.069> be<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.220> lot

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
course court oh it's gonna be a lot

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.979

heavier<00:02:56.639> with<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.060> battery<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.750> actually

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
heavier with the battery and it actually

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.390 
heavier with the battery and it actually
looks<00:02:58.500> pretty<00:02:58.620> small<00:02:59.160> for<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.459> battery<00:03:00.170> but

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.190 
looks pretty small for a battery but
then<00:03:02.400> again<00:03:02.519> looks<00:03:02.940> can<00:03:03.239> be<00:03:03.269> deceiving<00:03:03.780> so

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
then again looks can be deceiving so

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.620 
then again looks can be deceiving so
we'll<00:03:04.859> see<00:03:06.590> four<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.709> half<00:03:07.739> hours<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.630> wonder

just<00:03:40.380> Windows<00:03:40.769> 8<00:03:40.950> is<00:03:41.190> pretty<00:03:41.940> complicated<00:03:42.329> for

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
just Windows 8 is pretty complicated for

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.330 
just Windows 8 is pretty complicated for
some<00:03:42.840> people<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:45.260> so<00:03:46.260> yeah<00:03:46.410> let<00:03:46.590> me<00:03:46.620> just<00:03:46.709> turn

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
some people so so yeah let me just turn

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.289 
some people so so yeah let me just turn
this<00:03:47.400> on<00:03:47.730> now<00:03:49.040> all<00:03:50.040> right<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.549> I've<00:03:51.150> opened

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
this on now all right so I've opened

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.750 
this on now all right so I've opened
this<00:03:51.540> up<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:51.959> everything<00:03:52.379> so<00:03:53.219> now<00:03:53.370> let's<00:03:53.549> turn

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
this up and everything so now let's turn

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:02.820 
this up and everything so now let's turn
it<00:03:53.939> on<00:03:54.060> for<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.599> first<00:03:54.689> time

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.380 

so<00:04:03.430> now<00:04:03.550> apparently<00:04:03.940> is<00:04:04.000> this<00:04:04.150> touchscreen

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
so now apparently is this touchscreen

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.880 
so now apparently is this touchscreen
the<00:04:04.990> resolution<00:04:05.620> here<00:04:05.830> is<00:04:06.960> it's<00:04:07.960> a<00:04:08.080> 768

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
the resolution here is it's a 768

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.510 
the resolution here is it's a 768
resolution<00:04:08.920> I<00:04:09.550> think<00:04:09.790> it<00:04:09.880> goes<00:04:10.000> like<00:04:11.460> 1366<00:04:12.460> by

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
resolution I think it goes like 1366 by

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.410 
resolution I think it goes like 1366 by
768<00:04:13.170> I'll<00:04:14.580> double<00:04:15.580> check<00:04:15.610> to<00:04:15.880> make<00:04:16.030> sure<00:04:16.090> on

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
768 I'll double check to make sure on

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.560 
768 I'll double check to make sure on
that<00:04:18.750> feels<00:04:19.750> nice<00:04:20.110> it<00:04:20.620> is<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.970> is<00:04:22.150> pretty<00:04:22.360> heavy

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
that feels nice it is it is pretty heavy

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.730 
that feels nice it is it is pretty heavy
for<00:04:22.840> a<00:04:22.870> laptop<00:04:23.140> like<00:04:24.330> like<00:04:25.330> Ike<00:04:25.540> it's<00:04:26.440> hard<00:04:26.620> for

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
for a laptop like like Ike it's hard for

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.200 
for a laptop like like Ike it's hard for
me<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:26.950> hold<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.250> in<00:04:27.370> one<00:04:27.490> hand<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.960> lift

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.790 

yeah<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.240> guess<00:04:34.600> it<00:04:34.750> takes<00:04:34.900> a<00:04:35.050> little<00:04:35.200> while<00:04:35.410> for

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
yeah I guess it takes a little while for

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.920 
yeah I guess it takes a little while for
the<00:04:35.920> first<00:04:35.950> time<00:04:37.980> if<00:04:38.980> you<00:04:39.130> can<00:04:39.250> look<00:04:39.430> through
