00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
kind of weird at the beginning but it

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.440 
kind of weird at the beginning but it
kind<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.039> gets<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.429> little<00:02:08.759> used<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.330> it's

grappling play this
so<00:02:12.310> grapple<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:12.850> think<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.210> so<00:02:13.360> much<00:02:13.540> fun<00:02:13.750> it

so grapple I think is so much fun it

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.810 
so grapple I think is so much fun it
kind<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.200> really<00:02:14.410> does<00:02:14.650> change<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:15.070> game<00:02:15.340> cuz

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
kind of really does change the game cuz

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.570 
kind of really does change the game cuz
you<00:02:15.940> do<00:02:16.090> end<00:02:16.330> up<00:02:16.420> having<00:02:16.750> your<00:02:17.550> exosuit<00:02:18.550> and

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
you do end up having your exosuit and

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.400 
you do end up having your exosuit and
then<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:18.850> have<00:02:18.970> that<00:02:19.000> XO<00:02:19.480> grapple<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.020> you

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
then you have that XO grapple and you

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.400 
then you have that XO grapple and you
can<00:02:20.590> go<00:02:20.740> like<00:02:21.040> 50-60<00:02:21.940> feet<00:02:22.030> out<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.780> in<00:02:23.170> like

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
can go like 50-60 feet out and in like

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.380 
can go like 50-60 feet out and in like
no<00:02:23.620> time<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.490> makes<00:02:24.700> getting<00:02:24.910> from<00:02:25.210> one

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
no time so it makes getting from one

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.940 
no time so it makes getting from one
side<00:02:25.600> of<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.750> map<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.410> other<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.710> lot

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
side of the map to the other a lot

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.860 
side of the map to the other a lot
faster<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.400> like<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.700> said<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.940> also<00:02:28.270> adds<00:02:28.480> a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
faster and like I said it also adds a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.630 
faster and like I said it also adds a
different<00:02:29.200> type<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:29.530> field<00:02:29.800> at<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.130> top<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.340> I

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
different type of field at the top of I

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.240 
different type of field at the top of I
guess<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.270> strategy<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.590> different<00:02:32.920> type<00:02:33.220> of

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
guess a strategy and a different type of

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.820 
guess a strategy and a different type of
skill<00:02:33.790> set<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.300> be<00:02:34.780> able<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:35.020> do<00:02:35.140> good<00:02:35.380> in<00:02:35.560> the
