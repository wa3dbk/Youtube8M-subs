video<00:00:03.300> I'm<00:00:03.570> going<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:04.049> be<00:00:04.140> reviewing<00:00:04.410> the

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
video I'm going to be reviewing the

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.480 
video I'm going to be reviewing the
district<00:00:06.000> TPU<00:00:06.359> case<00:00:06.569> for<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.049> oneplus<00:00:07.350> one

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
district TPU case for the oneplus one

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.610 
district TPU case for the oneplus one
now<00:00:08.490> this<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.120> matte<00:00:09.630> black<00:00:09.900> flexible

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
now this is the matte black flexible

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.860 
now this is the matte black flexible
version<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.580> costs<00:00:11.820> around<00:00:12.000> ten<00:00:12.570> dollars

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
version and it costs around ten dollars

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.589 
version and it costs around ten dollars
for<00:00:13.049> Americans<00:00:13.469> while<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:14.070> costs<00:00:14.280> about

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
for Americans while it costs about

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.700 
for Americans while it costs about
eighteen<00:00:15.599> dollars<00:00:15.719> for<00:00:16.080> international

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
eighteen dollars for international

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.970 
eighteen dollars for international
buyers<00:00:16.940> so<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.150> worth<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.600> let's<00:00:19.590> find<00:00:19.770> out

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
buyers so is it worth it let's find out

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.689 
buyers so is it worth it let's find out
as<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.880> can<00:00:21.000> see<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:21.539> we<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:23.010> district

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
as you can see here we have the district

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.019 
as you can see here we have the district
TPU<00:00:24.330> case<00:00:24.630> here<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.279> actually

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
TPU case here and this is actually

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.820 
TPU case here and this is actually
pretty<00:00:27.539> nice<00:00:27.930> looking<00:00:28.140> at<00:00:28.470> least<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.710> my

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
pretty nice looking at least in my

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.450 
pretty nice looking at least in my
opinion<00:00:28.939> so<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.449> have<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.810> nice<00:00:31.529> matte<00:00:32.160> black

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
opinion so we have this nice matte black

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.780 
opinion so we have this nice matte black
finish<00:00:32.790> here<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.739> you<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:35.130> like<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.370> soft

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
finish here and you get like a soft

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.420 
finish here and you get like a soft
touch<00:00:36.030> feel<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.320> feels<00:00:37.500> sort<00:00:38.280> of

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
touch feel to it so it feels sort of

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.639 
touch feel to it so it feels sort of
similar<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.149> nexus<00:00:39.390> 5<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.899> case<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.320> also

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
similar to the nexus 5 the case is also

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.250 
similar to the nexus 5 the case is also
pretty<00:00:40.860> flexible<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.670> can<00:00:41.820> see<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
pretty flexible as you can see and

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.750 
pretty flexible as you can see and
that's<00:00:43.260> actually<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.739> lightweight<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.700> you

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
that's actually a lightweight so you

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.569 
that's actually a lightweight so you
pretty<00:00:45.570> much<00:00:45.690> moved<00:00:46.050> feel<00:00:46.350> damage<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
pretty much moved feel damage so the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.010 
pretty much moved feel damage so the
difference<00:00:47.789> when<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.149> apply<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.690> your<00:00:48.719> phone

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
difference when you apply on your phone

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.750 
difference when you apply on your phone
which<00:00:49.620> I'm<00:00:49.829> gonna<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.219> right<00:00:50.250> now<00:00:50.520> actually

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
which I'm gonna do right now actually

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.660 
which I'm gonna do right now actually
I'm<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.480> an<00:00:51.539> apply<00:00:52.039> and<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.430> how<00:00:53.520> it

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
I'm just an apply and this is how it

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.770 
I'm just an apply and this is how it
looks<00:00:54.530> maybe<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.620> should<00:00:55.800> show<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:55.980> some<00:00:56.340> of

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
looks maybe I should show you some of

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.610 
looks maybe I should show you some of
the<00:00:57.780> holes<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.940> buttons<00:01:00.390> yeah<00:01:01.109> this

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the holes here and the buttons yeah this

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.709 
the holes here and the buttons yeah this
is<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> TPU<00:01:02.100> case<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:02.609> do<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.059> some<00:01:03.390> buttons

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
is a TPU case so we do have some buttons

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.660 
is a TPU case so we do have some buttons
here<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.729> all<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.909> holes<00:01:06.119> lined<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:07.670> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
here and all the holes lined up the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.850 
here and all the holes lined up the
buttons<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> volume<00:01:09.390> rocker<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.930> right

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
buttons for the volume rocker and right

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.539 
buttons for the volume rocker and right
over<00:01:10.979> here<00:01:11.250> as<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.400> camera<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:13.189> as<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.369> see

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
over here as a camera so as you can see

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.120 
over here as a camera so as you can see
here<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:15.540> pretty<00:01:15.720> nicely<00:01:15.960> there<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.500> there's

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
here just pretty nicely there so there's

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.060 
here just pretty nicely there so there's
some<00:01:17.280> bump<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> front<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.509> if<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.290> happen

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
some bump on the front so if you happen

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.280 
some bump on the front so if you happen
to<00:01:20.100> drop<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.909> flat<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> ground<00:01:21.900> like

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
to drop it and flat on the ground like

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.399 
to drop it and flat on the ground like
this<00:01:22.820> I'll<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.970> fine<00:01:24.210> because<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> bump<00:01:25.170> on

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
this I'll be fine because of the bump on

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.219 
this I'll be fine because of the bump on
the<00:01:25.950> frontier<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.970> will<00:01:27.570> do<00:01:27.659> some<00:01:27.900> decent

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
the frontier so I will do some decent

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.859 
the frontier so I will do some decent
prediction<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.070> front<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> glass<00:01:30.000> as

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
prediction on the front of the glass as

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
prediction on the front of the glass as
for<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> holes<00:01:31.530> are<00:01:31.799> pretty<00:01:32.189> precise<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
for the holes are pretty precise the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.620 
for the holes are pretty precise the
cuts<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.540> least<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.869> my<00:01:34.049> case<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:35.329> I'm<00:01:36.329> going

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
cuts at least in my case and I'm going

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.260 
cuts at least in my case and I'm going
to<00:01:36.720> show<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.500> for<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.240> for<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
to show you the for the for the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.780 
to show you the for the for the
headphone<00:01:39.750> ports<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.770> put<00:01:41.579> that

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
headphone ports you can put that

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.149 
headphone ports you can put that
headphone<00:01:42.479> jack<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.560> fine<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.979> this

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
headphone jack just just fine and this

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.609 
headphone jack just just fine and this
is<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.549> big<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.960> fits<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.409> fine

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
is like the big one so it fits just fine

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.800 
is like the big one so it fits just fine
i<00:01:46.979> guess<00:01:47.159> i<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.549> hear<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.759> click<00:01:47.970> i'm<00:01:48.450> not

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
i guess i can hear the click i'm not

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.270 
i guess i can hear the click i'm not
sure<00:01:48.930> if<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.110> guys<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:49.740> i<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:50.009> hear<00:01:50.189> it

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
sure if you guys can but i can hear it

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.830 
sure if you guys can but i can hear it
just<00:01:50.369> fine<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:52.280> save<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.549> micro<00:01:54.149> USB<00:01:54.180> ports

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
just fine and save it a micro USB ports

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.090 
just fine and save it a micro USB ports
it<00:01:55.049> let's<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:56.130> find<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.899> holes<00:01:58.140> for<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
it let's just find the holes for the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.609 
it let's just find the holes for the
speaker<00:01:59.640> girls<00:01:59.909> there's<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.329> problem<00:02:00.619> same

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
speaker girls there's a problem same

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.350 
speaker girls there's a problem same
with<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.950> noise<00:02:02.369> cancellation<00:02:03.000> they<00:02:03.180> seem

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
with the noise cancellation they seem

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.359 
with the noise cancellation they seem
pretty<00:02:03.390> precise<00:02:04.049> i<00:02:04.079> saw<00:02:04.409> for<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.770> back<00:02:05.070> here

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
pretty precise i saw for that back here

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.119 
pretty precise i saw for that back here
I<00:02:05.549> don't<00:02:06.149> know<00:02:06.210> if<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.360> can't<00:02:06.570> tell<00:02:06.899> but<00:02:07.259> it's

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
I don't know if you can't tell but it's

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.040 
I don't know if you can't tell but it's
off<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.610> corner<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.179> that's<00:02:09.390> that's<00:02:09.750> for

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
off to the corner but that's that's for

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.030 
off to the corner but that's that's for
every<00:02:10.580> every<00:02:11.750> Distronic<00:02:12.750> TPU<00:02:13.080> case

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
every every Distronic TPU case

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.860 
every every Distronic TPU case
fortunately<00:02:14.459> that's<00:02:14.670> not<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:15.209> precise<00:02:15.629> but

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
fortunately that's not that precise but

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.140 
fortunately that's not that precise but
I<00:02:16.079> don't<00:02:16.739> have<00:02:16.829> a<00:02:16.860> problem<00:02:17.010> with<00:02:17.219> that<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.909> cut

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
I don't have a problem with that the cut

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.849 
I don't have a problem with that the cut
for<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.569> camera<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:18.959> pretty<00:02:19.230> precise<00:02:19.620> oh

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
for the camera is pretty precise oh

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.089 
for the camera is pretty precise oh
that's<00:02:20.609> very<00:02:20.730> nice<00:02:21.079> okay<00:02:22.079> so<00:02:22.140> there's<00:02:22.769> some

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
that's very nice okay so there's some

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.979 
that's very nice okay so there's some
strange<00:02:23.969> hole<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.420> people<00:02:24.780> have<00:02:24.870> been

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
strange hole that people have been

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.140 
strange hole that people have been
commenting<00:02:25.469> right<00:02:25.709> over<00:02:25.890> here<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:27.090> is

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
commenting right over here and this is

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.170 
commenting right over here and this is
an<00:02:27.769> injection<00:02:28.769> molding<00:02:29.159> point<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.969> is

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
an injection molding point so this is

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.589 
an injection molding point so this is
not<00:02:30.359> a<00:02:30.420> defect<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.530> any<00:02:31.980> means<00:02:32.359> so<00:02:33.359> this

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
not a defect and any means so this

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.229 
not a defect and any means so this
appears<00:02:33.959> in<00:02:34.109> any<00:02:34.290> TPU<00:02:34.859> case<00:02:35.099> but<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.120> a

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
appears in any TPU case but it is a

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.390 
appears in any TPU case but it is a
little<00:02:36.450> bit<00:02:36.659> more<00:02:36.840> noticeable<00:02:37.439> in<00:02:37.709> this<00:02:38.159> case

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
little bit more noticeable in this case

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.059 
little bit more noticeable in this case
but<00:02:38.819> it's<00:02:39.450> not<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:39.599> huge<00:02:39.780> deal<00:02:39.920> everything<00:02:40.920> else

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
but it's not a huge deal everything else

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.490 
but it's not a huge deal everything else
seems<00:02:41.129> pretty<00:02:41.849> nice<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.750> normal<00:02:43.019> problem<00:02:43.379> with

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
seems pretty nice so normal problem with

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.009 
seems pretty nice so normal problem with
it<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.769> it's<00:02:44.639> for<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.909> buttons<00:02:45.480> they<00:02:45.780> are

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
it and it's for the buttons they are

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.710 
it and it's for the buttons they are
pretty<00:02:46.260> they're<00:02:47.250> pretty<00:02:47.280> tacky<00:02:47.909> tacky<00:02:48.329> so

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
pretty they're pretty tacky tacky so

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.929 
pretty they're pretty tacky tacky so
they<00:02:48.900> press<00:02:49.109> nicely<00:02:49.560> as<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.040> can<00:02:50.370> see<00:02:50.579> and

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
they press nicely as you can see and

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.960 
they press nicely as you can see and
just<00:02:51.629> pressing<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.049> power<00:02:52.200> button<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.819> it<00:02:53.819> is

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
just pressing the power button and it is

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.849 
just pressing the power button and it is
to<00:02:54.090> try<00:02:54.299> pressing<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.260> volume<00:02:55.290> rocker<00:02:56.030> let's

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
to try pressing the volume rocker let's

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.690 
to try pressing the volume rocker let's
run<00:02:58.859> over<00:02:58.889> here<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.909> we<00:03:00.329> first<00:03:00.840> pretty<00:03:01.049> nicely

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
run over here so we first pretty nicely

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.610 
run over here so we first pretty nicely
and<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.909> don't<00:03:03.030> have<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.180> problem<00:03:03.359> with<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.659> so

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
and I don't have a problem with it so

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.710 
and I don't have a problem with it so
that's<00:03:04.950> in<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.189> video<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.700> think<00:03:06.359> this<00:03:06.450> case<00:03:06.689> is

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
that's in the video I think this case is

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.599 
that's in the video I think this case is
well<00:03:07.079> warfare<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.590> my<00:03:07.680> opinion<00:03:07.919> and<00:03:08.159> i<00:03:08.310> highly
