00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.750
 so, well, it's a curious moment 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.880
 and good the neutral series with body 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.140
 flame can burn itself to the minimum 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.430
 Cons will end up so special that it has 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.710
 the special defense that the 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.540
 speed that has that plus a dance 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.280

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.290
 psuv in special protection carving 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.360
 special at speed with some balls 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.990
 he preached this pokemon may be too 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.670
 brutal 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.890
 the only thing so they have defenses 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.100
 pretty bad they touch the sweep is a 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.000
 physical and falls well I only wanted you 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.890

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.259
