00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
web config file notice that at the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.569 
web config file notice that at the
moment<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.630> are<00:00:33.690> using<00:00:34.079> basic<00:00:34.620> HTTP<00:00:35.370> binding

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
moment we are using basic HTTP binding

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.209 
moment we are using basic HTTP binding
this<00:00:36.390> means<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.230> underlying<00:00:37.530> protocol

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
this means that the underlying protocol

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.780 
this means that the underlying protocol
for<00:00:38.460> communication<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.710> HTTP<00:00:40.710> now<00:00:41.250> let's<00:00:41.489> try

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
for communication is HTTP now let's try

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.560 
for communication is HTTP now let's try
and<00:00:41.940> use<00:00:42.239> net<00:00:43.110> TCP<00:00:43.860> binding<00:00:44.399> instead<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.149> basic

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
and use net TCP binding instead of basic

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.389 
and use net TCP binding instead of basic
HTTP<00:00:46.200> binding<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.770> see<00:00:46.890> what's<00:00:47.100> going<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
HTTP binding and see what's going to

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.299 
HTTP binding and see what's going to
happen<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.899> are<00:00:48.930> using<00:00:49.140> net<00:00:49.590> TCP

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
happen so here we are using net TCP

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.610 
happen so here we are using net TCP
binding<00:00:50.789> meaning<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> underlying<00:00:52.110> protocol

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
binding meaning the underlying protocol

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.340 
binding meaning the underlying protocol
is<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.449> TCP<00:00:54.449> protocol<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.170> let's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
is going to be TCP protocol and let's

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.170 
is going to be TCP protocol and let's
see<00:00:55.440> what's<00:00:55.649> going<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.920> happen<00:00:56.370> since<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.090> have

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
see what's going to happen since we have

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.599 
see what's going to happen since we have
specified<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.629> binding<00:00:58.140> as<00:00:58.320> net<00:00:58.590> TCP<00:00:59.160> binding

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
specified the binding as net TCP binding

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.000 
specified the binding as net TCP binding
we<00:01:00.120> need<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.449> add<00:01:00.629> another<00:01:00.899> base<00:01:01.379> address<00:01:01.859> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
we need to add another base address to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.690 
we need to add another base address to
support<00:01:02.370> TCP<00:01:02.850> protocol<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:04.110> let's<00:01:04.700> change

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
support TCP protocol so let's change

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.609 
support TCP protocol so let's change
this<00:01:06.000> HTTP<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.170> net<00:01:08.030> TCP<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.350> let's<00:01:10.350> change

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
this HTTP to net TCP and let's change

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.899 
this HTTP to net TCP and let's change
the<00:01:10.770> port<00:01:11.100> number<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:12.060> 80<00:01:12.750> 90<00:01:13.470> all<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.340> with

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
the port number to 80 90 all right with

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.770 
the port number to 80 90 all right with
this<00:01:15.090> change<00:01:15.360> let's<00:01:16.140> save<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.890> changes<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
this change let's save the changes and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.509 
alright now to support non HTTP
protocols<00:02:48.870> in<00:02:49.050> is<00:02:49.379> we<00:02:49.620> need<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.890> do<00:02:50.040> two<00:02:50.489> things

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
protocols in is we need to do two things

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.820 
protocols in is we need to do two things
that<00:02:51.330> is<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.510> first<00:02:51.810> one<00:02:52.080> is<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.440> install

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
that is the first one is to install

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.460 
that is the first one is to install
walls<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:54.480> windows<00:02:55.230> communication

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470

foundation on HTTP activation components

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.059 
foundation on HTTP activation components
and<00:02:58.890> then<00:02:59.400> we<00:02:59.519> also<00:02:59.640> need<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.060> enable<00:03:00.420> non<00:03:01.319> HTTP

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
and then we also need to enable non HTTP

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.130 
and then we also need to enable non HTTP
protocol<00:03:02.519> support<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.510> forever

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
protocol support in is forever

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.619 
protocol support in is forever
application<00:03:05.129> ok<00:03:05.760> let's<00:03:06.180> go<00:03:06.330> ahead<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.540> look

application ok let's go ahead and look

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.979 
application ok let's go ahead and look
at<00:03:06.750> these<00:03:06.930> steps<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.470> detail<00:03:07.500> now<00:03:08.330> so<00:03:09.330> step

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
at these steps in detail now so step

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.080 
at these steps in detail now so step
here<00:03:10.349> are<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.590> steps<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.950> install<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.940> know

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
here are the steps to install you know

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.509 
here are the steps to install you know
was<00:03:12.690> component<00:03:13.409> and<00:03:13.650> windows<00:03:14.310> communication

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
was component and windows communication

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.630

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.580 
foundation on HTTP activation component
so<00:03:18.180> basically<00:03:18.569> we<00:03:18.750> need<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.930> go<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.170> control

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
so basically we need to go to control

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.100 
so basically we need to go to control
panel<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.099> to<00:03:20.640> get<00:03:20.819> to<00:03:21.060> control<00:03:21.390> panel<00:03:21.840> within

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
panel and to get to control panel within

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.039 
panel and to get to control panel within
the<00:03:22.319> run<00:03:22.470> window<00:03:22.860> type<00:03:23.550> control<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:24.870> that

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
the run window type control so that

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.509 
the run window type control so that
should<00:03:25.230> open<00:03:25.349> up<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.709> control<00:03:26.069> panel<00:03:26.400> and

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
should open up the control panel and

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.460 
should open up the control panel and
here<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.940> should<00:03:26.970> find<00:03:27.390> programs<00:03:28.019> and

and<00:04:30.390> to<00:04:30.900> do<00:04:31.050> that<00:04:31.290> you<00:04:31.680> know<00:04:31.950> simply<00:04:32.400> go<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.610> IAS

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
and to do that you know simply go to IAS

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.950 
and to do that you know simply go to IAS
and<00:04:33.540> within<00:04:33.930> is<00:04:34.350> this<00:04:34.710> our<00:04:34.920> application

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
and within is this our application

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.510 
and within is this our application
directory<00:04:36.960> so<00:04:37.290> right<00:04:37.440> click<00:04:37.590> on<00:04:37.830> that<00:04:38.040> and

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
directory so right click on that and

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.330 
directory so right click on that and
then<00:04:39.180> select<00:04:39.630> manage<00:04:39.870> application<00:04:40.680> advanced

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
then select manage application advanced

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.720 
then select manage application advanced
settings<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.440> he<00:04:43.440> notice<00:04:43.800> that<00:04:43.980> enable<00:04:44.610> the

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
settings and he notice that enable the

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.880 
settings and he notice that enable the
protocols<00:04:45.240> at<00:04:45.420> the<00:04:45.510> moment<00:04:45.810> it's<00:04:45.930> only<00:04:46.080> HTTP

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
protocols at the moment it's only HTTP

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.360 
protocols at the moment it's only HTTP
so<00:04:47.520> let's<00:04:48.510> also<00:04:48.750> say<00:04:49.050> we<00:04:49.260> want<00:04:49.560> support<00:04:50.160> for

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
so let's also say we want support for

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.330 
so let's also say we want support for
net<00:04:50.690> TCP<00:04:51.690> protocols<00:04:52.290> who<00:04:52.500> put<00:04:52.770> in<00:04:52.890> there

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
net TCP protocols who put in there

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.070 
net TCP protocols who put in there
if<00:04:53.610> you<00:04:53.790> want<00:04:53.970> to<00:04:54.120> have<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.540> support<00:04:54.900> for

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
if you want to have the support for

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.130 
if you want to have the support for
another<00:04:55.380> other<00:04:56.370> protocols<00:04:57.060> just<00:04:57.750> specify

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
another other protocols just specify

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.200 
another other protocols just specify
them<00:04:58.380> with<00:04:58.590> you<00:04:59.250> know<00:04:59.400> a<00:04:59.430> comma<00:04:59.880> separated

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
them with you know a comma separated

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.640 
them with you know a comma separated
list<00:05:00.650> so<00:05:01.650> let's<00:05:02.340> click<00:05:02.580> OK<00:05:02.790> and<00:05:03.240> at<00:05:03.990> this<00:05:04.260> point

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
list so let's click OK and at this point

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.090 
list so let's click OK and at this point
you<00:05:05.400> know<00:05:05.670> we<00:05:05.970> should<00:05:06.210> be<00:05:06.240> able<00:05:06.540> to<00:05:06.780> use<00:05:07.100> TCP

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
you know we should be able to use TCP

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.220 
you know we should be able to use TCP
protocol<00:05:08.640> so<00:05:09.210> let's<00:05:09.600> actually<00:05:09.810> go<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.230> is<00:05:10.950> and

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
protocol so let's actually go to is and

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.630 
protocol so let's actually go to is and
browse<00:05:13.230> this<00:05:13.590> service<00:05:13.950> file<00:05:14.190> and<00:05:14.340> see<00:05:14.460> what's

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
browse this service file and see what's

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.580 
browse this service file and see what's
going<00:05:14.850> to<00:05:14.910> happen<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.450> look<00:05:16.080> at<00:05:16.200> that<00:05:16.350> it

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
going to happen and look at that it

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.050 
going to happen and look at that it
works<00:05:16.920> as<00:05:17.190> expected

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
works as expected

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.210 
works as expected
okay<00:05:18.630> now<00:05:19.140> let's<00:05:19.650> go<00:05:19.800> to<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:19.980> client

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
okay now let's go to the client

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.970 
okay now let's go to the client
application<00:05:20.810> so<00:05:21.810> here<00:05:22.050> we<00:05:22.230> have<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.560> client

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
application so here we have the client

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.220 
application so here we have the client
application<00:05:23.130> and<00:05:23.790> if<00:05:24.240> we<00:05:24.330> look<00:05:24.540> at<00:05:24.780> the

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
application and if we look at the

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.260 
application and if we look at the
configuration<00:05:26.100> file<00:05:26.400> of<00:05:26.730> the<00:05:26.880> client

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
configuration file of the client

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.270 
configuration file of the client
application<00:05:27.620> notice<00:05:28.620> that<00:05:28.740> at<00:05:28.890> the<00:05:28.980> moment

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
application notice that at the moment

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.860 
application notice that at the moment
the<00:05:29.370> client<00:05:29.700> application<00:05:29.820> is<00:05:30.300> still<00:05:30.510> using

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
the client application is still using

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.500 
the client application is still using
basic<00:05:31.230> HTTP<00:05:31.860> binding<00:05:32.040> so<00:05:32.790> we<00:05:32.940> need<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.270> update

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
basic HTTP binding so we need to update

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.680 
basic HTTP binding so we need to update
the<00:05:34.200> service<00:05:34.650> reference<00:05:35.160> ok<00:05:35.760> so<00:05:36.120> let's<00:05:36.300> go<00:05:36.510> and

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
the service reference ok so let's go and

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.890 
the service reference ok so let's go and
do<00:05:36.900> that<00:05:37.080> right<00:05:37.380> now<00:05:37.410> so<00:05:38.510> update<00:05:39.510> service

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
do that right now so update service

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.830 
do that right now so update service
reference<00:05:40.380> so<00:05:41.340> this<00:05:41.670> should<00:05:42.090> change<00:05:42.450> the

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
reference so this should change the

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.810 
reference so this should change the
binding<00:05:43.320> now<00:05:43.560> to<00:05:44.220> net<00:05:44.490> TCP<00:05:45.270> binding<00:05:46.430> ok<00:05:47.430> so

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
binding now to net TCP binding ok so

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.790 
binding now to net TCP binding ok so
notice<00:05:48.060> that<00:05:48.390> at<00:05:48.660> the<00:05:48.810> moment<00:05:49.110> it's<00:05:49.230> using<00:05:49.620> net

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
notice that at the moment it's using net

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
notice that at the moment it's using net
TCP<00:05:50.340> binding<00:05:50.730> so<00:05:51.060> let's<00:05:51.270> go<00:05:51.450> and<00:05:51.600> test<00:05:51.870> our<00:05:52.820> WCF

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
TCP binding so let's go and test our WCF

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.810 
TCP binding so let's go and test our WCF
service<00:05:54.270> and<00:05:54.510> see<00:05:54.990> if<00:05:55.080> it<00:05:55.230> supports<00:05:55.740> non<00:05:56.220> HTTP

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
service and see if it supports non HTTP

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.730 
service and see if it supports non HTTP
protocols<00:05:57.300> that<00:05:57.510> is<00:05:57.660> TCP<00:05:58.110> that's<00:05:58.440> what<00:05:58.590> we

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
protocols that is TCP that's what we

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.120 
protocols that is TCP that's what we
have<00:05:58.860> specified<00:05:59.330> ok<00:06:00.330> so<00:06:00.930> let's<00:06:01.230> say<00:06:01.470> test<00:06:01.890> as

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
have specified ok so let's say test as

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.210 
have specified ok so let's say test as
the<00:06:02.310> name<00:06:02.490> click<00:06:02.910> get<00:06:03.210> message<00:06:03.690> and<00:06:03.990> it<00:06:04.950> should

the name click get message and it should

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.850 
the name click get message and it should
work<00:06:05.250> now<00:06:08.960> now<00:06:09.960> look<00:06:10.200> at<00:06:10.320> this<00:06:10.410> we<00:06:10.590> have<00:06:10.620> an
