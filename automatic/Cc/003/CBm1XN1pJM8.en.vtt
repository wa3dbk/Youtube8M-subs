come with the same screen size as the
galaxy<00:00:29.099> s5<00:00:29.730> which<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.420> 5.1<00:00:30.929> inch<00:00:31.170> which<00:00:31.410> means

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
galaxy s5 which is 5.1 inch which means

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.900 
galaxy s5 which is 5.1 inch which means
that<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:33.530> size<00:00:34.530> will<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:34.800> defiled<00:00:35.219> 5.1<00:00:35.670> into

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
that the size will be defiled 5.1 into

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
that the size will be defiled 5.1 into
the<00:00:35.969> only<00:00:36.270> difference<00:00:36.600> will<00:00:36.750> be<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
the only difference will be the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.990 
the only difference will be the
resolution<00:00:37.500> which<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.860> going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.219> be<00:00:38.280> quad<00:00:38.700> AC

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
resolution which is going to be quad AC

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.840 
resolution which is going to be quad AC
and<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> really<00:00:40.649> great<00:00:41.070> bump<00:00:41.579> from<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
and that is a really great bump from the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.959 
and that is a really great bump from the
1080p<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.870> galaxy<00:00:43.260> s5<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.829> due<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
1080p on the galaxy s5 and due to the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.920 
1080p on the galaxy s5 and due to the
5.1<00:00:45.539> inch<00:00:45.920> screen<00:00:46.920> size<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.090> dimensions<00:00:48.660> will

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
5.1 inch screen size the dimensions will

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.709 
5.1 inch screen size the dimensions will
be<00:00:49.350> same<00:00:50.010> as<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> galaxy<00:00:50.460> s5<00:00:51.149> by<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.420> device

as the iphone 6 which is six point nine
millimeter<00:01:01.070> so<00:01:02.070> definitely<00:01:02.730> if<00:01:03.059> they<00:01:03.270> make

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
millimeter so definitely if they make

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.500 
millimeter so definitely if they make
the<00:01:03.899> galaxy<00:01:04.830> s6<00:01:05.309> thinner<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:06.030> six<00:01:06.299> point

the galaxy s6 thinner like six point
nine<00:01:06.570> millimeter<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.549> then<00:01:08.549> definitely<00:01:09.030> we

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
nine millimeter and then definitely we

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.359 
nine millimeter and then definitely we
are<00:01:09.540> going<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.840> see<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.320> lower<00:01:11.100> capacity

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
are going to see a lower capacity

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.330 
are going to see a lower capacity

now coming with a little bit lower

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.380 
now coming with a little bit lower
milliamp<00:01:39.600> hours<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.850> 2600<00:01:41.850> which<00:01:42.000> is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
milliamp hours with the 2600 which is

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.249 
milliamp hours with the 2600 which is
equal<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.229> galaxy<00:01:43.710> s4<00:01:44.540> battery<00:01:45.540> which<00:01:46.079> was

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
equal to the galaxy s4 battery which was

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.219 
equal to the galaxy s4 battery which was
the<00:01:46.500> samsung's<00:01:46.950> 2013<00:01:47.909> flagship<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:49.079> the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.609 
and this it will be a little bit you
know<00:02:08.069> less<00:02:08.869> there<00:02:09.869> will<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.080> less<00:02:10.229> million

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
know less there will be less million

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.410 
know less there will be less million
parts<00:02:10.920> as<00:02:11.039> compared<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.700> chipset<00:02:12.270> you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
parts as compared to the chipset you

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.720 
parts as compared to the chipset you
know<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.690> power<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.110> will<00:02:13.440> be

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
know the power that will be

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.080 
know the power that will be
consumed<00:02:14.629> by<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.870> device<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:15.760> take<00:02:16.760> this<00:02:16.879> as<00:02:17.060> a

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
consumed by the device so take this as a

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.539 
consumed by the device so take this as a
grain<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.420> salt<00:02:17.659> and<00:02:18.019> maybe<00:02:18.349> they<00:02:18.799> should<00:02:19.040> do

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
grain of salt and maybe they should do

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.839 
grain of salt and maybe they should do
some<00:02:20.090> better<00:02:20.650> optimization<00:02:21.650> maybe<00:02:22.549> but

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
some better optimization maybe but

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.490 
some better optimization maybe but
anyways<00:02:23.450> if<00:02:23.659> they<00:02:23.780> are<00:02:23.840> making<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.290> device

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
anyways if they are making the device

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.380 
anyways if they are making the device
smaller<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.310> battery<00:02:25.640> size<00:02:25.849> will<00:02:26.030> also<00:02:26.239> get

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
smaller the battery size will also get

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.949 
smaller the battery size will also get
smaller<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.920> same<00:02:28.129> time<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:29.480> quality

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
smaller and the same time the quality

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.600 
smaller and the same time the quality
screen<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.440> all<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:30.739> will<00:02:30.920> take<00:02:31.129> more<00:02:31.310> power

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
screen and all that will take more power

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.509 
screen and all that will take more power
so<00:02:31.970> we<00:02:32.000> might<00:02:32.450> have<00:02:32.989> some<00:02:33.530> very<00:02:33.739> problems<00:02:34.340> and

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
so we might have some very problems and

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.180 
so we might have some very problems and
issues<00:02:34.580> but<00:02:35.450> yes<00:02:35.959> Samsung<00:02:36.260> will<00:02:36.590> find<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.980> way

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
issues but yes Samsung will find a way

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.160 
issues but yes Samsung will find a way
to<00:02:37.629> solve<00:02:38.629> this<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.920> know<00:02:40.069> issue<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.750> of

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
to solve this you know issue and of

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.399 
to solve this you know issue and of
course<00:02:42.410> 2600mah<00:02:43.250> battery<00:02:43.599> if<00:02:44.599> it's<00:02:44.900> optimized

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
course 2600mah battery if it's optimized

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.650 
course 2600mah battery if it's optimized
it<00:02:45.680> might<00:02:45.860> be<00:02:46.069> good<00:02:46.250> for<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.910> quality<00:02:47.150> screen

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
it might be good for the quality screen

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.619 
it might be good for the quality screen
but<00:02:48.410> let's<00:02:49.370> see<00:02:49.519> what<00:02:49.549> would<00:02:49.790> happen<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.360> and

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
but let's see what would happen so and

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.270 
but let's see what would happen so and
