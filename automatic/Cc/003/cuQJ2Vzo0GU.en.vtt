time<00:00:30.990> ago<00:00:31.189> by<00:00:32.189> flying<00:00:32.489> toys<00:00:32.730> around<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.719> you

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
time ago by flying toys around and you

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.660 
time ago by flying toys around and you
know<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.170> imagining<00:00:34.920> one<00:00:35.160> day<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.430> I'd<00:00:35.550> be

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
know just imagining one day that I'd be

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.580 
know just imagining one day that I'd be
able<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.910> put<00:00:36.120> something<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> air<00:00:37.260> without

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
able to put something in the air without

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.189 
able to put something in the air without
the<00:00:37.890> investment<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.520> cracking<00:00:39.449> you<00:00:39.749> know<00:00:39.839> open

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
the investment of cracking you know open

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.340 
the investment of cracking you know open
source<00:00:40.550> and<00:00:41.550> open<00:00:41.789> hardware<00:00:42.120> stuff<00:00:42.449> which<00:00:43.140> now

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
source and open hardware stuff which now

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.590 
source and open hardware stuff which now
is<00:00:43.530> has<00:00:43.859> come<00:00:44.039> along<00:00:44.249> but<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.640> think<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:44.909> 2006<00:00:45.449> it

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
is has come along but I think in 2006 it

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.509 
is has come along but I think in 2006 it
was<00:00:45.719> pretty<00:00:45.870> primitive<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.620> all<00:00:47.339> the

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
was pretty primitive and all the

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:48.709 
was pretty primitive and all the
instructions<00:00:47.819> were<00:00:47.999> in<00:00:48.149> German<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.629> know

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
instructions were in German you know

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.509 
instructions were in German you know
that's<00:00:48.899> wiki<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.409> micro<00:00:49.649> copter<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> just

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
that's wiki for micro copter and I just

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:51.950 
that's wiki for micro copter and I just
decided<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.120> know<00:00:51.210> I'm<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.359> to<00:00:51.510> wait<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.659> few

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
decided you know I'm going to wait a few

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.950 
decided you know I'm going to wait a few
years<00:00:52.609> until<00:00:53.609> things<00:00:53.819> mature<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> bit<00:00:54.239> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
years until things mature a bit and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.189 
years until things mature a bit and
things<00:00:55.170> really<00:00:55.319> matured<00:00:55.710> quickly<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.489> so

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
things really matured quickly and so

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.389 
things really matured quickly and so
this<00:00:58.199> year<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.739> know<00:00:58.859> we've<00:00:59.039> gone<00:00:59.190> from

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
this year you know we've gone from

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.219 
this year you know we've gone from
seeing<00:00:59.699> almost<00:01:00.089> none<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.839> these<00:01:00.929> things<00:01:01.139> in

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
seeing almost none of these things in

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.680 
seeing almost none of these things in
the<00:01:01.289> air<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.710> being<00:01:02.699> almost<00:01:02.850> commonplace<00:01:03.269> what

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the air to being almost commonplace what

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.280 
the air to being almost commonplace what
do<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.470> think<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.650> was<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.420> created<00:01:06.420> sort<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
do you think it was it created sort of a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.649 
do you think it was it created sort of a
breakthrough<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.400> why<00:01:08.940> are<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.330> starting

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
breakthrough and and why are we starting

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.030 
breakthrough and and why are we starting
to<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.170> many<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.500> these<00:01:10.590> things<00:01:10.770> flying

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
to see so many of these things flying

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.670 
to see so many of these things flying
around<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:11.370> well<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.390> would<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.260> tend<00:01:13.620> to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
around now well I would get I I tend to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.770 
around now well I would get I I tend to
separate<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.250> maker<00:01:14.520> movement<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.510> sort

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
separate the maker movement and the sort

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.530 
separate the maker movement and the sort
of<00:01:15.870> pushed<00:01:16.290> for<00:01:16.560> mass<00:01:16.880> consumer<00:01:17.880> adoption<00:01:18.060> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
of pushed for mass consumer adoption and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.120 
of pushed for mass consumer adoption and
I<00:01:19.020> think<00:01:19.260> we're<00:01:19.410> seeing<00:01:19.620> both<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.890> those

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
I think we're seeing both of those

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.710 
I think we're seeing both of those
progressing<00:01:20.700> at<00:01:20.790> an<00:01:20.880> incredible<00:01:21.360> rate<00:01:21.420> right

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
progressing at an incredible rate right

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.780 
progressing at an incredible rate right
now<00:01:21.870> and<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:23.010> you<00:01:23.160> know<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.550> such

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
now and here you know we have such

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.220 
now and here you know we have such
diversity<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.570> these<00:01:24.780> things<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.140> are

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
diversity in these things that are

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.750 
diversity in these things that are
flying<00:01:25.380> around<00:01:25.650> one<00:01:26.100> right<00:01:26.340> over<00:01:26.370> a<00:01:26.550> head

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
flying around one right over a head

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.250 
flying around one right over a head
right<00:01:26.910> now<00:01:26.940> you<00:01:27.540> know<00:01:27.600> everything<00:01:27.720> from<00:01:27.930> ready

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
right now you know everything from ready

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.130 
right now you know everything from ready
to<00:01:28.410> made<00:01:28.560> ready<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.340> fly<00:01:29.600> copters<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.050> know

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
to made ready to fly copters to you know

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.410 
to made ready to fly copters to you know
total<00:01:31.470> home<00:01:31.590> made<00:01:31.770> projects<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:34.400> I

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
total home made projects and and so I

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.880 
total home made projects and and so I
don't<00:01:36.420> I'm<00:01:36.750> super<00:01:37.140> exciting<00:01:37.500> they're<00:01:37.680> just

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
don't I'm super exciting they're just

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.420 
don't I'm super exciting they're just
it's<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:39.290> you<00:01:40.290> know<00:01:40.410> the<00:01:40.800> opportunities<00:01:41.400> are

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
it's a you know the opportunities are

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.760 
it's a you know the opportunities are
sort<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.850> endless<00:01:42.060> right<00:01:42.330> now<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.380> you're<00:01:43.560> set

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and if you wanted to do anything it

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.800 
and if you wanted to do anything it
wasn't<00:01:56.340> designed<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:56.970> you<00:01:57.330> had<00:01:57.540> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
wasn't designed to do you had to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.930 
wasn't designed to do you had to
essentially<00:01:58.200> become<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> hobbyist<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.220> so<00:01:59.700> you

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
essentially become a hobbyist and so you

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.220 
essentially become a hobbyist and so you
know<00:02:00.000> within<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.360> couple<00:02:00.510> weeks<00:02:00.660> I<00:02:01.080> was

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
know within a couple weeks I was

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.840 
know within a couple weeks I was
soldering<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.100> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.370> hobby<00:02:02.520> shops

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
soldering and going to hobby shops

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.760 
soldering and going to hobby shops
ordering<00:02:03.300> all<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.540> little<00:02:04.200> parts<00:02:04.320> i<00:02:04.530> needed

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
ordering all the little parts i needed

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.089 
ordering all the little parts i needed
to<00:02:04.890> do<00:02:05.070> fpv<00:02:05.790> flying<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:07.590> know<00:02:07.680> i<00:02:07.710> hacked

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
to do fpv flying and you know i hacked

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.619 
to do fpv flying and you know i hacked
together<00:02:08.220> my<00:02:08.519> own<00:02:08.550> gimbals<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.330> things<00:02:09.479> like

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
together my own gimbals and things like

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.750 
together my own gimbals and things like
that<00:02:09.690> before<00:02:10.200> they<00:02:10.590> were<00:02:10.679> available<00:02:10.920> for<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
that before they were available for the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.660 
that before they were available for the
uniform<00:02:12.239> mass<00:02:12.420> market<00:02:13.040> but<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.340> industry's

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
uniform mass market but the industry's

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.070 
uniform mass market but the industry's
moving<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.060> quickly<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.810> know<00:02:15.900> within

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
moving so quickly that you know within

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.930 
moving so quickly that you know within
six<00:02:16.410> months<00:02:16.560> suddenly<00:02:17.100> there<00:02:17.280> were<00:02:17.400> broad

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
six months suddenly there were broad

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.670 
six months suddenly there were broad
products<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.720> could<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:19.020> buy<00:02:19.319> and

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
products that you could just buy and

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.210 
products that you could just buy and
they<00:02:20.069> were

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
they were

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.500 
they were
a lot<00:02:20.340> more<00:02:20.460> expensive<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.150> think<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.390> will

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
a lot more expensive and I think it will

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.780 
a lot more expensive and I think it will
it<00:02:21.660> will<00:02:21.720> always<00:02:21.990> be<00:02:22.080> like<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.700> but<00:02:23.700> i<00:02:23.730> think

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
it will always be like that but i think

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.910 
it will always be like that but i think
it's<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:24.270> been<00:02:24.510> really<00:02:24.660> important<00:02:25.170> to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
it's it's been really important to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.270 
it's it's been really important to
continue<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.120> build<00:02:27.330> things<00:02:27.600> in<00:02:28.410> my<00:02:28.740> garage<00:02:28.800> on

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
continue to build things in my garage on

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.800 
continue to build things in my garage on
the<00:02:29.370> side<00:02:29.580> because<00:02:29.970> i<00:02:30.150> don't<00:02:30.540> think<00:02:30.570> i<00:02:30.750> would

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
the side because i don't think i would

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.060 
the side because i don't think i would
understand<00:02:31.260> how<00:02:31.440> these<00:02:31.590> things<00:02:31.650> work

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
understand how these things work

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.040 
understand how these things work
certainly<00:02:32.610> not<00:02:32.700> how<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.910> repair<00:02:33.330> them<00:02:33.510> if<00:02:33.870> i

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
certainly not how to repair them if i

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.230 
certainly not how to repair them if i
weren't<00:02:34.230> building<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:35.490> know<00:02:35.580> multicopters

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
weren't building you know multicopters

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.880 
weren't building you know multicopters
on<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.420> side<00:02:36.630> as<00:02:36.840> well<00:02:37.020> yeah<00:02:37.440> it's<00:02:37.590> actually

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
on the side as well yeah it's actually

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.040 
on the side as well yeah it's actually
it's<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.010> really<00:02:38.190> interesting<00:02:38.400> point<00:02:38.760> because

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
it's a really interesting point because

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.600 
it's a really interesting point because
you<00:02:40.050> know<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.290> there's<00:02:40.860> been<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.220> much<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.520> an

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
you know that there's been so much of an

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.010 
you know that there's been so much of an
upbringing<00:02:41.850> in<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.480> say<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.870> the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
upbringing in the say that the

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.920 
upbringing in the say that the
multicopter<00:02:43.560> world<00:02:43.910> from<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.390> DIY

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
multicopter world from that that DIY

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.890 
multicopter world from that that DIY
perspective<00:02:47.090> it's<00:02:48.090> been<00:02:48.270> interesting<00:02:48.540> for<00:02:48.750> me

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
perspective it's been interesting for me

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.750 
perspective it's been interesting for me
to<00:02:48.960> think<00:02:49.140> about<00:02:49.380> what<00:02:49.650> happens<00:02:50.400> when<00:02:50.490> they

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
to think about what happens when they

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.940 
to think about what happens when they
become<00:02:51.090> much<00:02:51.930> more<00:02:52.140> commercially<00:02:52.890> available

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
become much more commercially available

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.920 
become much more commercially available
on<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.340> mass-market<00:02:53.790> scale<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.450> how<00:02:54.540> do<00:02:54.600> people

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
on a mass-market scale and how do people

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.620 
on a mass-market scale and how do people
react<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.100> compared<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.090> people<00:02:57.540> who've

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
react to that compared to people who've

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.940 
react to that compared to people who've
trained<00:02:57.870> themselves<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.350> be<00:02:58.440> pilots<00:02:58.830> and

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
trained themselves to be pilots and

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.150 
trained themselves to be pilots and
flyers<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.730> think<00:02:59.940> about<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.240> much<00:03:01.130> yeah<00:03:02.130> I

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
flyers you think about that much yeah I

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.760 
flyers you think about that much yeah I
do<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:03.110> you<00:03:04.110> know<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.230> don't<00:03:04.410> think<00:03:04.500> there's

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
do and you know I don't think there's

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.190 
do and you know I don't think there's
there's<00:03:05.490> any<00:03:05.610> replacement<00:03:06.209> for<00:03:06.420> for<00:03:06.780> training

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
there's any replacement for for training

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.390 
there's any replacement for for training
and<00:03:07.380> practice<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.990> and<00:03:09.990> in<00:03:10.830> fact<00:03:11.010> many<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.310> my

cases<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:21.240> crashes<00:03:21.600> could<00:03:21.720> have<00:03:21.810> been

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
cases the crashes could have been

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.720 
cases the crashes could have been
prevented<00:03:22.050> but<00:03:22.800> people<00:03:23.040> were<00:03:23.130> too<00:03:23.400> excited

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
prevented but people were too excited

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.370 
prevented but people were too excited
about<00:03:24.030> what<00:03:24.480> they<00:03:24.600> were<00:03:24.660> going<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.080> do<00:03:25.230> you

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
about what they were going to do you

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.960 
about what they were going to do you
know<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.590> first<00:03:25.830> time<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.610> put<00:03:26.790> something

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
know the first time you put something

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.940 
know the first time you put something
loving<00:03:27.300> you<00:03:27.360> see<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.570> new<00:03:27.690> perspective<00:03:28.200> it's

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
loving you see that new perspective it's

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:29.870 
loving you see that new perspective it's
tempting<00:03:29.220> just<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.519> push<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:29.850> little

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
tempting just to push it a little

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.759 
tempting just to push it a little
further<00:03:30.090> but<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:30.989> course<00:03:31.230> if<00:03:31.470> you're<00:03:31.560> over

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
further but of course if you're over

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.910 
further but of course if you're over

of the dive trips that I've been running

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.270 
of the dive trips that I've been running
pretty<00:05:01.870> much<00:05:02.020> every<00:05:02.260> year<00:05:02.530> for<00:05:02.890> a<00:05:02.950> long<00:05:03.070> time

now only this year where we will have

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.640 
now only this year where we will have
quadcopters<00:05:07.150> on<00:05:07.240> board<00:05:07.420> so<00:05:07.750> that<00:05:07.960> will<00:05:08.410> change

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
quadcopters on board so that will change

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.130 
quadcopters on board so that will change
things<00:05:08.920> a<00:05:09.040> lot<00:05:09.190> and<00:05:09.880> so<00:05:10.810> I'm<00:05:10.870> looking<00:05:10.930> forward
