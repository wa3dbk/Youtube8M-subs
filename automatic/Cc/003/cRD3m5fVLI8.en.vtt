00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
before watch my other video then you'd

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.490 
before watch my other video then you'd
realize<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:17.039> kind<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.520> messy<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:19.109> kind<00:00:19.439> of

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
realize it's kind of messy and I kind of

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.990 
realize it's kind of messy and I kind of
want<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.710> take<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.100> mess<00:00:20.310> away<00:00:20.490> from<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.850> one

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
want to take the mess away from this one

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.880 
want to take the mess away from this one
I<00:00:21.029> found<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.539> there<00:00:21.689> was<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> machine<00:00:22.289> that

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
I found that there was a machine that

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.490 
I found that there was a machine that
actually<00:00:23.330> eliminated<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.570> use<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.109> muslin

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
actually eliminated the use of a muslin

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.800 
actually eliminated the use of a muslin
cloth<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.160> things<00:00:26.789> getting<00:00:27.240> like<00:00:27.449> dripping

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
cloth and things getting like dripping

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.099 
cloth and things getting like dripping
and<00:00:28.260> my<00:00:28.740> fridge<00:00:29.039> would<00:00:29.220> get<00:00:29.429> wet<00:00:29.910> from<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> way

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
and my fridge would get wet from the way

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.220 
and my fridge would get wet from the way
that<00:00:31.410> would<00:00:31.529> drip<00:00:31.910> anyways<00:00:32.910> there's<00:00:33.809> lots<00:00:34.079> of

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
that would drip anyways there's lots of

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.770 
that would drip anyways there's lots of
reasons<00:00:34.559> why<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.219> am<00:00:35.610> really<00:00:36.059> excited<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.600> use

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
reasons why I am really excited to use

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.560 
reasons why I am really excited to use
this<00:00:36.989> when<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.320> first<00:00:37.500> wax<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.100> looks<00:00:38.250> like

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
this when I first wax it it looks like

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.360 
this when I first wax it it looks like
there<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> couple<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.500> things<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.010> can<00:00:41.219> do

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
there is a couple of things you can do

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.389 
there is a couple of things you can do
you<00:00:41.969> get<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.210> prep<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.719> mix<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.530> set<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.190> and

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
you get to prep it mix it set it and

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.510 
you get to prep it mix it set it and
then<00:00:44.640> strain<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.870> know<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.590> at<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.219> point

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
then strain it I know that at this point

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.250 
then strain it I know that at this point
it<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:47.730> becomes<00:00:48.149> regular<00:00:48.570> yogurt<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.140> then

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
it just becomes regular yogurt and then

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.020 
it just becomes regular yogurt and then
when<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.530> strain<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.920> that's<00:00:50.730> when<00:00:51.000> it

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
when you strain it that's when it

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.660 
when you strain it that's when it
becomes<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.600> Greek<00:00:51.809> yogurt<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.800> I'm<00:00:53.190> going<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
becomes the Greek yogurt so I'm going to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.930 
becomes the Greek yogurt so I'm going to
this<00:00:54.270> right<00:00:54.719> now<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.430> first<00:00:56.699> thing<00:00:56.910> that

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
this right now so the first thing that

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.110 
this right now so the first thing that
is<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:58.320> my<00:00:58.530> favorite<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.670> do<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> whole

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
is not my favorite is it can do a whole

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.270 
is not my favorite is it can do a whole
gallon<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.690> milk<00:01:00.840> which<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.230> usually<00:01:01.649> do<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.890> can

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
gallon of milk which I usually do I can

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.440 
gallon of milk which I usually do I can
only<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.820> half<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.780> gallon<00:01:04.170> which<00:01:05.150> I'll<00:01:06.150> live

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
only do half a gallon which I'll live

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.990 
only do half a gallon which I'll live
with<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> now<00:01:07.080> I'll<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.070> make<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.520> more

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.789 
with for a now I'll have to make it more
often<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:10.320> all<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.890> did<00:01:11.130> right<00:01:11.729> now<00:01:11.760> what<00:01:12.600> put<00:01:13.470> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
often so all I did right now what put a

often so all I did right now what put a
half<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:15.420> gallon<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.890> pot<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.330> use<00:01:18.780> 2%

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
half of a gallon in a pot that I use 2%

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.280 
half of a gallon in a pot that I use 2%
milk<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.790> I'm<00:01:21.689> gonna<00:01:21.960> let<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.439> milk<00:01:22.830> get<00:01:23.280> to

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
milk and I'm gonna let this milk get to

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.929 
milk and I'm gonna let this milk get to
185<00:01:25.290> degrees<00:01:25.950> Fahrenheit

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
185 degrees Fahrenheit

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.149 
185 degrees Fahrenheit
well<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> milk<00:01:27.900> got<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.200> little<00:01:28.590> bit<00:01:28.710> warmer

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
well the milk got a little bit warmer

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.780 
well the milk got a little bit warmer
than<00:01:29.240> 185<00:01:30.240> which<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.900> totally<00:01:31.409> fine<00:01:31.729> as<00:01:32.729> long

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
than 185 which is totally fine as long

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.670 
than 185 which is totally fine as long
as<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.119> didn't<00:01:33.360> burn<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.020> know<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.229> didn't

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
as I didn't burn it and I know I didn't

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.130 
as I didn't burn it and I know I didn't
because<00:01:34.860> I've<00:01:35.130> made<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:36.180> million<00:01:36.960> times

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
because I've made this a million times

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.749 
because I've made this a million times
before<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.950> said<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.189> make<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.430> every<00:01:38.520> week

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
before like I said I make it every week

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.870 
before like I said I make it every week
so<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:40.009> 196<00:01:41.009> right<00:01:41.250> now<00:01:41.400> which<00:01:41.850> is

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
so it's like 196 right now which is

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.940 
so it's like 196 right now which is
totally<00:01:42.329> fine<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.780> right<00:01:43.320> now<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.799> let

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
totally fine so right now I have to let

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.429 
totally fine so right now I have to let
it<00:01:44.070> drop<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:45.619> 110<00:01:46.619> degrees<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:48.030> add<00:01:48.299> my<00:01:48.780> starter

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
it drop to 110 degrees to add my starter

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.380

draining<00:04:10.760> vessel<00:04:11.150> so<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.930> draining<00:04:12.290> vessel

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
draining vessel so the draining vessel

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:13.090 
draining vessel so the draining vessel
is

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
is

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.010 
is
blue<00:04:13.400> container<00:04:13.790> here<00:04:14.210> and<00:04:14.240> then<00:04:14.660> you<00:04:14.780> put<00:04:14.960> the

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
blue container here and then you put the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.449 
blue container here and then you put the
Greek<00:04:15.230> yogurt<00:04:15.530> in<00:04:15.590> here<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.040> felt<00:04:16.340> that

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
Greek yogurt in here and I felt that

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.120 
Greek yogurt in here and I felt that
this<00:04:16.640> container<00:04:17.150> and<00:04:17.480> this<00:04:17.600> mesh<00:04:18.080> thing<00:04:18.410> were

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
this container and this mesh thing were

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.780 
this container and this mesh thing were
way<00:04:19.730> too<00:04:19.760> small<00:04:20.830> not<00:04:21.830> necessarily<00:04:22.460> this<00:04:22.610> blue

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
way too small not necessarily this blue

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.100 
way too small not necessarily this blue
thing<00:04:22.970> but<00:04:23.180> this<00:04:23.330> thing<00:04:23.510> was<00:04:23.630> way<00:04:23.780> too<00:04:23.840> small

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
thing but this thing was way too small

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.590 
thing but this thing was way too small
because<00:04:24.320> I<00:04:24.470> felt<00:04:24.860> that<00:04:25.130> I<00:04:25.370> had<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.300> fill<00:04:26.480> this

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
because I felt that I had to fill this

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.960 
because I felt that I had to fill this
up<00:04:26.750> twice<00:04:27.170> and<00:04:27.530> dump<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:27.920> way<00:04:28.040> out<00:04:28.250> so<00:04:28.820> that

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
up twice and dump the way out so that

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.540 
up twice and dump the way out so that
was<00:04:29.090> kind<00:04:29.270> of<00:04:29.300> annoying<00:04:29.420> but<00:04:30.380> other<00:04:31.100> than<00:04:31.280> that

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
was kind of annoying but other than that

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.790 
was kind of annoying but other than that
