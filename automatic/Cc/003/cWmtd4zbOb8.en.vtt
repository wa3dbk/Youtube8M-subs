00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
more scrutiny as well this is generally

not required to be labeled so the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.970 
not required to be labeled so the

to do its screening this is just another

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.860 
to do its screening this is just another
example<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.850> FDA<00:02:26.850> having<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.360> react<00:02:27.660> the
