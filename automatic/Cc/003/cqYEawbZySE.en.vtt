00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
video but before we talk about that my

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:53.889 
video but before we talk about that my
first<00:00:52.129> encounter<00:00:52.429> if<00:00:53.149> two<00:00:53.300> are<00:00:53.390> you<00:00:53.480> one<00:00:53.719> with

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
first encounter if two are you one with

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.110 
first encounter if two are you one with
the<00:00:53.989> stock<00:00:54.319> gun<00:00:54.559> he<00:00:54.739> pens<00:00:54.980> one<00:00:55.280> bounces<00:00:55.819> three

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
the stock gun he pens one bounces three

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.869 
the stock gun he pens one bounces three
now<00:00:56.359> and<00:00:56.899> it's<00:00:57.620> not<00:00:57.920> that<00:00:58.219> likely<00:00:58.429> that<00:00:58.729> he's

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
now and it's not that likely that he's

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.000 
now and it's not that likely that he's
gonna<00:00:59.059> pin<00:00:59.300> me<00:00:59.329> by<00:00:59.629> well<00:01:00.019> being<00:01:00.499> on<00:01:00.679> the<00:01:00.800> move

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
gonna pin me by well being on the move

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.340 
gonna pin me by well being on the move
and<00:01:01.280> barely<00:01:01.819> a<00:01:01.850> me<00:01:02.059> he<00:01:02.539> penned<00:01:02.839> one<00:01:03.079> in<00:01:03.260> the

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
and barely a me he penned one in the

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.840 
and barely a me he penned one in the
lower<00:01:03.530> plate<00:01:03.739> because<00:01:04.070> it<00:01:04.190> is<00:01:04.400> made<00:01:04.640> out<00:01:04.699> of

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
lower plate because it is made out of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.270 
lower plate because it is made out of
paper<00:01:05.089> but<00:01:05.420> now<00:01:05.690> I<00:01:05.720> have<00:01:06.050> to<00:01:06.320> cover<00:01:06.860> from<00:01:07.130> a

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
paper but now I have to cover from a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.310 
paper but now I have to cover from a
lower<00:01:07.460> plate<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:07.940> that<00:01:08.150> should<00:01:08.750> not<00:01:08.990> be<00:01:09.200> an

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
lower plate so that should not be an

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.469 
lower plate so that should not be an
issue<00:01:09.409> anymore<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.220> now<00:01:10.520> even<00:01:11.210> though<00:01:11.329> it's

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
issue anymore and now even though it's

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.120 
issue anymore and now even though it's
tempting<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:11.899> go<00:01:12.110> finish<00:01:12.380> him<00:01:12.619> off<00:01:12.710> there

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
tempting to go finish him off there

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.039 
tempting to go finish him off there
might<00:01:13.280> be<00:01:13.310> something<00:01:13.880> really<00:01:14.360> nasty<00:01:14.509> behind

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
might be something really nasty behind

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.359 
might be something really nasty behind
him<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:15.320> I<00:01:15.350> don't<00:01:15.560> want<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:15.799> take<00:01:15.950> those<00:01:16.130> hits

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
him so I don't want to take those hits

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.670 
him so I don't want to take those hits
for<00:01:16.670> no<00:01:17.090> reason<00:01:17.570> besides<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.320> have<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:18.530> name

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
for no reason besides to have the name

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.080 
for no reason besides to have the name
of<00:01:18.829> the<00:01:18.920> three<00:01:19.100> behind<00:01:19.430> me<00:01:19.579> and<00:01:19.700> seems<00:01:19.939> that

around the corner anyways and getting

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.639 
around the corner anyways and getting
one<00:01:29.000> shot<00:01:29.210> in<00:01:29.240> really<00:01:29.689> early<00:01:29.719> before<00:01:30.110> even<00:01:30.409> has

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649

before he tries to unload all these
shells<00:01:42.740> this<00:01:43.310> is<00:01:43.430> not<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.700> greatest<00:01:43.909> angling

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
he beat around the corner when I was

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.680 
he beat around the corner when I was
already<00:03:29.190> covered<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.940> now<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.120> month<00:03:30.390> board

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690

already covered and now the month board
he's<00:03:30.930> gonna<00:03:31.110> take<00:03:31.350> his<00:03:31.590> shot<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.160> I'm<00:03:32.340> gonna

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
he's gonna take his shot and I'm gonna

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.940 
he's gonna take his shot and I'm gonna
be<00:03:32.730> able<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.150> farm<00:03:33.840> him<00:03:34.080> all<00:03:34.350> day<00:03:34.590> pretty<00:03:34.620> much

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
be able to farm him all day pretty much

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.180 
be able to farm him all day pretty much
it<00:03:35.280> was<00:03:35.520> boarding<00:03:36.050> and<00:03:37.050> managed<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.800> track<00:03:38.010> him

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
it was boarding and managed to track him

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.860 
it was boarding and managed to track him
so<00:03:38.430> he<00:03:38.640> can't<00:03:38.880> really<00:03:39.209> turn<00:03:39.360> this<00:03:39.480> through<00:03:39.780> it

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
so he can't really turn this through it

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.080 
so he can't really turn this through it
and<00:03:39.930> even<00:03:40.019> shoot<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.560> 140<00:03:41.070> it<00:03:41.489> doesn't<00:03:41.790> manage

and even shoot the 140 it doesn't manage

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.790 
and even shoot the 140 it doesn't manage
the<00:03:42.209> pool<00:03:42.390> he<00:03:42.900> does<00:03:43.080> manage<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.380> pull<00:03:43.620> off<00:03:43.769> a

stock gun on the UN which isn't really
that<00:04:41.410> surprising<00:04:42.040> but<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.430> did<00:04:42.640> someone<00:04:43.450> or

that surprising but I did someone or

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.070 
that surprising but I did someone or
three<00:04:43.750> shots<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.470> so<00:04:45.430> so<00:04:46.390> the<00:04:46.540> armor<00:04:46.870> even

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
three shots and so so the armor even

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.810 
three shots and so so the armor even
though<00:04:47.590> it<00:04:47.650> wasn't<00:04:47.890> that<00:04:48.100> necessary<00:04:48.640> in<00:04:48.730> this

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820
