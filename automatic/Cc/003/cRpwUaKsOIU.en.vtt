normal way which is to start off with a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.250 
normal way which is to start off with a
feathered<00:01:05.610> mating<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.210> then<00:01:06.869> cut<00:01:07.110> off

feathered mating and then cut off

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.990 
feathered mating and then cut off

off as a quince a root stock to which I

off as a quince a root stock to which I
have<00:01:17.790> simply<00:01:18.180> chipped<00:01:18.420> budded<00:01:18.810> two<00:01:19.439> buds<00:01:19.740> one

example<00:01:23.369> I've<00:01:23.580> used<00:01:23.610> Catholic<00:01:24.240> pear<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:25.110> is

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
example I've used Catholic pear which is

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.440 
example I've used Catholic pear which is
quite<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> vigorous<00:01:25.799> variety<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.640> culinary<00:01:27.030> or

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
cooking pear to get to this stage

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.600 
cooking pear to get to this stage
normally<00:01:30.990> would<00:01:31.380> probably<00:01:31.829> take<00:01:32.040> about<00:01:32.280> four

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
normally would probably take about four

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.490 
normally would probably take about four
years<00:01:32.909> if<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.420> were<00:01:33.509> propagating<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> trees

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
years if you were propagating the trees

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.100 
years if you were propagating the trees
in<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.220> traditional<00:01:35.670> way<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.630> believe<00:01:36.960> you

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
in the traditional way but I believe you

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.840 
in the traditional way but I believe you
can<00:01:37.259> cut<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.560> by<00:01:37.740> at<00:01:37.860> least<00:01:38.009> one<00:01:38.310> year<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
can cut that by at least one year and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.749 
can cut that by at least one year and
probably<00:01:39.630> save<00:01:39.869> even<00:01:40.049> two<00:01:40.409> years<00:01:40.770> by<00:01:41.490> budding

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
probably save even two years by budding

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.120 
probably save even two years by budding
straight<00:01:42.240> onto<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:43.200> or<00:01:43.350> two<00:01:43.560> year<00:01:43.770> old<00:01:43.920> root

straight onto one or two year old root
stock<00:01:44.450> are<00:01:45.450> getting<00:01:45.750> close<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.229> show<00:01:46.380> the
