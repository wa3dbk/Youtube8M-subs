00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello everyone and welcome to my 10 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.979
 white point is today I'm going to 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.860
 teach how to customize a pair of glasses 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:13.770
 Sun and give them a touch of fun color 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.280
 for the summer for this tutorial I have 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:20.760
 used an orange nail polish 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:23.070
 1 color range this increases clear and a 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.170
 turquoise the number of the tones what 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.090
 I will leave indicated in my blog to start 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.539
 we can do two things to take away the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.530
 crystals to the glasses or in my case I 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:39.120
 I'm going to take some duct tape and I'm going to 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.629
 place on the glass like this 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.629
 or 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:56.230
 then with the cutter I'm going to cut what 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.230
 closer to the edge 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.180
 in this way we will avoid staining 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.180
 the crystals 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:22.810
 others we are going to if we press 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.810
 the edges and remove propellers 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.970
 in this way it is completely covered 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.770
 we do so with the rest of the crystal a 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.070
 Once we have covered the crystals 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.030
 with zeal 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:47.690
 I'm going to take this strawberry-colored nail polish 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.560
 and plenty I will start 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.560
 paint the glasses 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.680
 so that it looks good we're going to have to 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.680
 give at least two layers 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.720
 I'm going to paint only the top part 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.330
 lower part color graffiti 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.600
 orange and then I will make a gradient between 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.600
 they 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.610
 Y 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.920
 once we verify that it is 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.120
 completely dry let's give it a 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.120
 second layer of color 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.350
 now with the orange nail polish I'm going 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.350
 do is degraded 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.400
 Y 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.140
 for this we are going to need a sponge 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.740
 of this kind this is a piece of 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.910
 scourer 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:49.160
 and a place to put on nail polishes 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.160
 let's take a couple of drops 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:58.680
 and now with the sponge 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.680
 we bend and soak it 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.629
 to pierce light touches right where 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.629
 the two colors come together 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.630
 I'm going to take a little more 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.630
 I take the sponge 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:22.840
 dad and neither excess and 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.840
 I keep giving light touches 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.050
 to create that gradient 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.120
 this is how our 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.120
 degraded 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.439
 now to make it look more integrated I'm going 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.420
 to catch again the raspberry color and 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:54.650
 I will do the same for the other 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.650
 down direction 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.370
 I take a little sponge we will 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.190
 it takes away the stress and I'm going to do it now 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.930
 degraded to down in this way 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.409
 the two will be better integrated 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.409
 colors 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.570
 now let's paint the sideburns of the 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.050
 glasses I have thought about making hairline 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.050
 colors 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.890
 i 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.750
 I'm going to start with this color and 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.500
 we are simply painting stripes to 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.040
 our finest taste more weights like 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.040
 we prefer 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.010
 Y 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.010
 two 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.340
 that's how our 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.340
 spectacle 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.300
 we could leave it like that but I'm going to 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.880
 add some white stripes between 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.380
 the reality of colors I'm going to do 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.770
 with this white nail polish 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.750
 For this I will use this brush that is more 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.510
 fine that the one who brings own nail polish 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.720
 so we can make a few more lines 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.180
 precise 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.139
 you have to have a little patience but 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.830
 the result is worth it 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:37.280
 we just have to catch and give one last 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.680
 layer with transparent shine 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.379
 in this way we will ensure a little more 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.560
 the color to avoid highlighting and 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:48.509
 we will give a touch of extra brightness and for 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.749
 so we can see how the 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:53.550
 final result of our glasses 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:56.400
 customized we have left the part 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.889
 interior of the unpainted spectacle as it is 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.889
 the part that is in contact with the skin and 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:05.310
 I preferred to leave it like this to avoid 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:07.289
 possible adverse reactions good 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.860
 I hope you liked a kiss and 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.860
 until next time
