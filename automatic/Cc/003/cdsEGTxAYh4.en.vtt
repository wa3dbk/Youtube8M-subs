00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
this with a grain of salt like it's not

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.240 
this with a grain of salt like it's not
gonna<00:01:11.850> look<00:01:12.030> exactly<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.140> guy<00:01:13.320> from<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
gonna look exactly like the guy from the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.060 
gonna look exactly like the guy from the
game<00:01:14.939> because<00:01:15.509> obviously<00:01:15.810> that's<00:01:16.500> medieval

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
game because obviously that's medieval

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.080

times<00:01:17.340> fantasy<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.450> somewhat<00:01:19.350> realistic

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
times fantasy this is somewhat realistic

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.120 
times fantasy this is somewhat realistic
GTA<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.350> just<00:01:22.350> take<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.830> grain<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.009> salt

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
GTA so just take it with a grain of salt

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.200 
GTA so just take it with a grain of salt
but<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.369> think<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.820> actually<00:01:24.030> looks<00:01:24.150> pretty

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
but I think it actually looks pretty

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.270 
but I think it actually looks pretty
cool<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.810> make<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:24.990> put<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.350> charcoal<00:01:26.009> or<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
cool so to make it put a charcoal or a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.330 
cool so to make it put a charcoal or a
gray<00:01:26.729> combat<00:01:27.360> sweater<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.869> with<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.710> standard

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.140 
with scruffy boots and then for the head
obviously<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> most<00:01:35.009> important<00:01:35.400> part<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.790> went

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
obviously the most important part I went

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.789 
obviously the most important part I went
with<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> ponytail<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.200> hair<00:01:37.409> but<00:01:37.650> you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
with the ponytail in the hair but you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.020 
with the ponytail in the hair but you
can<00:01:37.979> go<00:01:38.070> with<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> long<00:01:38.460> hair<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.880> like

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
can go with the long hair if you like

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.490 
can go with the long hair if you like
that<00:01:39.210> better<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.689> then<00:01:39.840> obviously<00:01:40.020> make<00:01:40.409> it

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
that better and then obviously make it

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.310 
that better and then obviously make it
like<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> whitish<00:01:41.100> grey<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.689> put<00:01:43.020> grey

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
like a whitish grey and then I put grey

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.200 
like a whitish grey and then I put grey
stubble<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.950> because<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.820> think<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.119> won't

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
stubble on because I think that won't

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.819 
stubble on because I think that won't
look<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.509> best<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.409> top<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.590> all<00:01:46.799> off

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
look the best and then to top it all off

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.859 
look the best and then to top it all off
put<00:01:47.220> dragon<00:01:47.579> eyes<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.299> because<00:01:48.659> obviously

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
put dragon eyes on because obviously

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.810 
put dragon eyes on because obviously
that's<00:01:49.259> what<00:01:49.350> he<00:01:49.409> has<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> game<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.460> it

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
that's what he has in the game and it

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.789 
that's what he has in the game and it
looks<00:01:50.850> pretty<00:01:51.210> interesting<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.560> like

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
looks pretty interesting I like I like

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.319 
looks pretty interesting I like I like
the<00:01:52.979> head<00:01:53.220> like<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.640> actually<00:01:53.729> kind<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.180> looks

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the head like it actually kind of looks

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.550 
the head like it actually kind of looks
like<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.570> especially<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.140> had<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.439> an

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
like it especially if you had like an

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.380 
like it especially if you had like an
older<00:01:55.920> character<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.610> think<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.210> would<00:01:57.299> look

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
older character I think it would look

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.700 
older character I think it would look
better<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:58.079> might<00:01:58.200> want<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.380> tweak<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
better you might want to tweak the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.289 
better you might want to tweak the
outfit<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.340> don't<00:01:59.579> really<00:01:59.790> like<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.119> that

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
outfit if you don't really like it that

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:00.740 
outfit if you don't really like it that
much

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
much

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.330 
much
but<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.110> think<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:01.530> something<00:02:01.799> again<00:02:02.159> that's

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
but I think it's something again that's

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.580 
but I think it's something again that's
outside<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.909> box<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:04.170> these<00:02:04.320> type<00:02:04.560> of

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
outside the box and I like these type of

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.560 
outside the box and I like these type of
outfits<00:02:04.979> because<00:02:05.130> they<00:02:05.430> are<00:02:05.579> unique<00:02:05.759> moving

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
outfits because they are unique moving

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.089 
outfits because they are unique moving

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
especially like with the hair that we

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.970 
especially like with the hair that we
use<00:02:39.540> for<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.840> other<00:02:40.050> outfit<00:02:40.500> because<00:02:40.680> it's

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
use for the other outfit because it's

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.280 
use for the other outfit because it's
the<00:02:41.130> light<00:02:41.280> hair<00:02:41.550> kind<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.209> matched<00:02:42.480> with<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
the light hair kind of matched with the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.229 
the light hair kind of matched with the
theme<00:02:43.560> but<00:02:44.099> something<00:02:44.550> about<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.940> rebreather

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
theme but something about the rebreather

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.240 
theme but something about the rebreather
just<00:02:45.569> looks<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:45.930> cool<00:02:46.200> on<00:02:46.380> this<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.040> think

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
just looks so cool on this and I think

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.800 
just looks so cool on this and I think
that's<00:02:47.400> kind<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.700> why<00:02:47.819> I<00:02:47.850> like<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.299> lot<00:02:48.420> but

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
that's kind of why I like it a lot but

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.320 
that's kind of why I like it a lot but
if<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.620> wanted<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.920> bad<00:02:50.069> guy<00:02:50.310> sort<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:50.940> outfit

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
if you wanted a bad guy sort of outfit

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.270 
if you wanted a bad guy sort of outfit
you<00:02:51.540> know<00:02:51.569> obviously<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.290> names<00:02:52.470> just<00:02:52.739> Asylum

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
you know obviously the names just Asylum

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.710 
you know obviously the names just Asylum
fugitive<00:02:53.730> then<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.150> think<00:02:54.390> this<00:02:54.510> would<00:02:54.630> be<00:02:54.660> a

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
fugitive then I think this would be a

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:03.200 
fugitive then I think this would be a
really<00:02:54.989> fun<00:02:55.230> one<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.470> use

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210
