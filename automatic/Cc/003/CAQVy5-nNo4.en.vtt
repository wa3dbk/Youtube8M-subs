00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 all are left as they are to buy the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.330
 gym g22 the reason why I buy it is 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.150
 because I s 4 I did not feel slow anymore 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.380
 worked then it is a fame 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.270
 much 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.000
 another reason why our 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:24.090
 energy is the largest screen is of 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.460
 5.2 against the s4 which is 5.0 other 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.560
 part of the four cores that have 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.410
 both are quad-core this is from 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.250
 1.9 against 2.26 that if they make a great 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.140
 difference 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.240
 what are the front cameras and 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.100
 laterals are the same no 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:47.110
 difference and another there has uip - 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.170
 after these notes here in your 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.320
 screen and you can save them 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.970
 when you are very effective for 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.850
 people who work 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:02.110
 s to take notes and that's very good 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.449
 application that does not bring it to that 4 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.990
 another thing about the four that I noticed that the 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.740
 face 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.740
 we have 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.110
 functions but we can not do much 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.880
 best face image 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.440
 but not in favor of software 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.500
 understands 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.350
 panoramic and other options like this 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.090
 to mode 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.520
 and we have all the options we have 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.730
 panorama 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.920
 we have filters we have 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.920
 let's see laugh with the most normal 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.960
 when it is very good 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.609
 do not occupy that it was an application 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.609
 additional to have more functions 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.010
 and how they will realize who they are 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.250
 prices 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.250
 they are exactly almost the same 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:14.280
 in the gym g22 has a price of 399 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:17.459
 dollars against the s 4 388 dollars 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.299
 are the difference dollars between one 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.090
 and another but the quality and speed is 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.489
 much also the quality the quality of 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.510
 determinator is very good and from beijing 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.890
 it's a polycarbonate 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.170
 against a simple plastic 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.750
 another advantage that has 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.020
 in him and against the samsung which is the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.610
 samsung has removable battery 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.610
 it can be changed and put 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.599
 comes 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.620
 you also have memory option and the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.530
 Chinese has 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.560
 another thing about gym g22 is that it does not have 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.760
 buttons aside your buttons are here 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.120
 behind 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.850
 so if you really realize if 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:12.570
 It is as if from the phone below 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.030
 and we are very concerned about another reason that 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.410
 We can turn the phone off and on with 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.890
 just touch it twice very fast 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.170
 as you can see there it went out and if it 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.550
 we get thanks again turn on 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.880
 difference groups you have to give 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.360
 click on the button to turn it off and 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.360
 turn it on 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.860
 then that is all 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.890
 in my opinion in milk that then is 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.770
 much more superior than the ds4 I know 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.960
 I recommend 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.360
 Any questions or comments that have 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:50.730
 let's leave here down there was no giving 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.730
 like and subscribe
