00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.219 
at that long shot i just hit there it
was<00:01:23.369> insane<00:01:23.909> he<00:01:24.299> was<00:01:24.450> almost<00:01:24.659> hit<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.080> every

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
was insane he was almost hit in every

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.899 
was insane he was almost hit in every
single<00:01:25.500> long<00:01:25.770> shot<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.009> he<00:01:26.220> took<00:01:26.430> there<00:01:26.820> were

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
single long shot that he took there were

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.399 
single long shot that he took there were
so<00:01:27.119> many<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.540> he<00:01:27.659> could<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.930> made<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.320> he

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
so many that he could have made and he

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.020 
so many that he could have made and he
just<00:01:28.680> missed<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.130> think<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.520> had<00:01:29.549> come<00:01:29.909> up

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
just missed and I think if I had come up

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.219 
just missed and I think if I had come up
against<00:01:30.299> maybe<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.630> little<00:01:30.810> bit<00:01:30.960> less

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
against maybe a little bit less

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.050 
against maybe a little bit less
goalkeeper<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.400> was<00:01:32.520> coming<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.790> against

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
goalkeeper I was coming up against

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.149 
goalkeeper I was coming up against
manuel<00:01:33.420> neuer<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.930> sometimes<00:01:34.650> could<00:01:34.890> see<00:01:35.040> us

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
manuel neuer and sometimes could see us

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.590 
manuel neuer and sometimes could see us
and<00:01:35.400> if<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.579> didn't<00:01:35.880> come<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.119> against<00:01:36.420> those

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and if I didn't come up against those

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.789 
and if I didn't come up against those
type<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.840> guys<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.170> think<00:01:37.380> he<00:01:37.470> could<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.710> had

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
type of guys I think he could have had

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.499 
type of guys I think he could have had
some<00:01:37.979> more<00:01:38.070> long<00:01:38.280> shots<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
some more long shots this is one of the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.240 
some more long shots this is one of the
free<00:01:39.659> kicks<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.049> he<00:01:40.110> took<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:41.009> was<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
free kicks that he took it was the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.069 
free kicks that he took it was the
closest<00:01:42.000> free-kick<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.479> had<00:01:42.720> he<00:01:42.899> actually

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
closest free-kick that I had he actually

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.380 
closest free-kick that I had he actually
has<00:01:43.320> really<00:01:43.680> good<00:01:43.770> free<00:01:44.040> kicks<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:45.090> really

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
has really good free kicks and I really

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.880 
has really good free kicks and I really
wish<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.659> made<00:01:45.869> some<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.259> him<00:01:46.290> because<00:01:46.500> his

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
wish I made some with him because his

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.340

protection<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.909> insane<00:01:48.479> his<00:01:48.659> stats<00:01:48.899> were<00:01:49.079> so

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
protection just insane his stats were so

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.010

nice 89 power and 99 free kick accuracy

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.300 
nice 89 power and 99 free kick accuracy
I<00:01:52.200> mean<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.470> doesn't<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:52.770> any<00:01:52.829> better<00:01:53.159> than

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
I mean it doesn't get any better than

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.370 
I mean it doesn't get any better than
that<00:01:53.460> guys<00:01:53.820> he<00:01:54.210> has<00:01:54.329> incredible<00:01:54.840> finishing<00:01:55.259> in

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
that guys he has incredible finishing in

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.050 
that guys he has incredible finishing in

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
and around the box and I do suggest that

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.219 
and around the box and I do suggest that
you<00:01:57.149> go<00:01:57.240> out<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.479> buy<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.630> player<00:01:57.930> when<00:01:58.110> his

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
you go out and buy this player when his

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.660 
you go out and buy this player when his
price<00:01:58.439> drops<00:01:58.740> he'll<00:01:59.130> probably<00:01:59.250> drop<00:01:59.490> to

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
price drops he'll probably drop to

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.280 
price drops he'll probably drop to
around<00:01:59.790> 40<00:02:00.240> k<00:02:00.360> later<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.899> week<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.200> think

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290

rating overall is going to be a 7.5 out
of<00:02:24.300> 10<00:02:24.480> for<00:02:24.720> him<00:02:24.900> guys<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.500> only<00:02:25.680> reason<00:02:25.830> I

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
of 10 for him guys the only reason I

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.500 
of 10 for him guys the only reason I
gave<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.490> because<00:02:26.820> he's<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.000> little<00:02:27.300> bit

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
gave that is because he's a little bit

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.360 
gave that is because he's a little bit
on<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.840> slow<00:02:28.080> side<00:02:28.110> otherwise<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:28.950> think<00:02:29.130> he's

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
on the slow side otherwise I think he's

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.950 
on the slow side otherwise I think he's
a<00:02:29.400> very<00:02:29.520> nice<00:02:29.880> player<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.390> when<00:02:30.510> he<00:02:30.600> drops<00:02:30.840> in
