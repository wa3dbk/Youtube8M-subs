arrived is her application to the first
exam<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:33.160> started<00:02:34.090> thinking<00:02:34.420> how<00:02:34.570> would<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:35.320> use

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
exam I started thinking how would I use

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.539 
exam I started thinking how would I use
straight<00:02:36.160> this<00:02:36.579> line<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.299> I<00:02:37.989> just<00:02:38.829> grabbed

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
straight this line and I just grabbed

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.979 
straight this line and I just grabbed
out<00:02:39.820> of<00:02:40.000> thin<00:02:40.209> air<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:41.609> line<00:02:42.609> an<00:02:42.940> idea<00:02:43.359> how<00:02:43.930> to

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
out of thin air a line an idea how to

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.740 
out of thin air a line an idea how to
illustrate<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.640> then<00:02:45.820> I<00:02:45.940> sketch<00:02:46.329> it<00:02:46.510> down

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
illustrate it so then I sketch it down

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.370 
illustrate it so then I sketch it down
and<00:02:47.400> then<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.700> create<00:02:49.329> the<00:02:49.570> little<00:02:49.870> things<00:02:50.109> like

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
and then I create the little things like

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.220 
and then I create the little things like
hat<00:02:50.850> it's<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.150> Hat<00:02:52.390> she<00:02:52.690> wants<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.049> have<00:02:53.200> a

later<00:03:00.459> on<00:03:00.670> how<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.359> works<00:03:01.600> in<00:03:01.840> reality<00:03:02.019> because

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
later on how it works in reality because

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.080 
later on how it works in reality because
we<00:03:03.010> are<00:03:03.160> about<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:04.060> shoot<00:03:04.239> a<00:03:04.540> shot<00:03:05.100> then<00:03:06.100> I<00:03:06.489> also

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
we are about to shoot a shot then I also

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.740 
we are about to shoot a shot then I also
like<00:03:07.569> to<00:03:07.600> see<00:03:08.170> our<00:03:08.530> clothes<00:03:09.130> line<00:03:09.600> because<00:03:10.600> I

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
like to see our clothes line because I

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.020 
like to see our clothes line because I
always<00:03:11.230> think<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:12.100> clothes<00:03:12.430> line<00:03:12.760> is

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
always think that the clothes line is

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.740 
always think that the clothes line is
very<00:03:13.269> cinematic<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:15.220> there

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
very cinematic and there

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.199 
very cinematic and there
very<00:03:17.750> visually<00:03:18.349> engaging<00:03:18.700> in<00:03:19.700> order<00:03:20.030> to

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
very visually engaging in order to

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.270 
very visually engaging in order to
understand<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:22.160> hats<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:22.970> bring<00:03:23.840> them<00:03:23.989> out

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
understand the hats I bring them out

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.729 
understand the hats I bring them out
then<00:03:25.280> there's<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.150> car<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.989> we<00:03:27.140> have<00:03:27.319> to<00:03:27.500> use

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
then there's a car that we have to use

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.750 
then there's a car that we have to use
and<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:28.730> printed<00:03:29.239> out<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.450> car<00:03:30.550> which<00:03:31.550> is

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
and so I printed out the car which is

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.690 
and so I printed out the car which is
all<00:03:32.060> jiggly<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:33.319> Soviet<00:03:33.709> car<00:03:33.980> that<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.340> had<00:03:34.580> to

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
all jiggly the Soviet car that I had to

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.120 
all jiggly the Soviet car that I had to
be<00:03:34.819> very<00:03:35.060> specific<00:03:35.300> car<00:03:35.840> that<00:03:36.830> we're<00:03:36.980> gonna

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
be very specific car that we're gonna

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.750 
be very specific car that we're gonna
make<00:03:37.580> sex<00:03:38.060> on<00:03:38.300> later<00:03:38.750> on<00:03:39.019> and<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:40.370> I<00:03:40.400> made<00:03:40.670> the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
make sex on later on and so I made the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.479 
make sex on later on and so I made the
drawing<00:03:41.030> later<00:03:41.540> on<00:03:41.840> off<00:03:42.019> that<00:03:42.349> car<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:43.160> this<00:03:43.340> is

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
drawing later on off that car so this is

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.130 
drawing later on off that car so this is
my<00:03:43.700> stage<00:03:44.090> of<00:03:44.390> storyboard<00:03:45.110> research<00:03:45.709> idea<00:03:46.459> and

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
my stage of storyboard research idea and

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.430 
my stage of storyboard research idea and
whatnot<00:03:48.140> things<00:03:49.180> as<00:03:50.180> loose<00:03:50.599> as<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:50.959> gonna<00:03:51.230> be

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
whatnot things as loose as it gonna be

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.970 
whatnot things as loose as it gonna be
very<00:03:54.069> how<00:03:55.069> to<00:03:55.130> say<00:03:55.519> not<00:03:56.390> professional<00:03:57.170> okay

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
very how to say not professional okay

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.819 
very how to say not professional okay
but<00:03:58.549> it<00:03:58.819> works<00:03:59.120> at<00:03:59.569> least<00:03:59.750> for<00:03:59.989> me<00:04:00.079> I'm<00:04:00.290> having

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
but it works at least for me I'm having

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.699 
but it works at least for me I'm having
good<00:04:01.099> time<00:04:01.569> signa<00:04:02.599> I<00:04:02.900> have<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.260> question<00:04:03.620> about

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
good time signa I have a question about

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.460 
good time signa I have a question about
the<00:04:03.950> storyboard<00:04:04.660> may<00:04:05.660> I<00:04:05.690> okay<00:04:06.560> okay<00:04:07.489> oh<00:04:07.670> wow

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
the storyboard may I okay okay oh wow

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.030 
the storyboard may I okay okay oh wow
okay<00:04:09.500> here<00:04:09.799> comes<00:04:10.069> my<00:04:10.640> question<00:04:11.000> is<00:04:11.680> since<00:04:12.680> you

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
okay here comes my question is since you

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.850 
okay here comes my question is since you
just<00:04:13.489> think<00:04:14.239> about<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:14.750> line<00:04:14.930> on<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.530> spot

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
just think about the line on the spot

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.530 
just think about the line on the spot
and<00:04:16.130> you<00:04:16.190> start<00:04:17.120> drawing

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
and you start drawing

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.640 
and you start drawing
what<00:04:17.959> if<00:04:18.079> way<00:04:18.650> later<00:04:18.950> you<00:04:19.280> change<00:04:19.609> your<00:04:19.820> mind

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
what if way later you change your mind

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.219 
what if way later you change your mind
or<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:22.729> little<00:04:23.240> bit<00:04:23.360> later<00:04:23.570> you<00:04:23.690> change<00:04:24.050> your

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
or a little bit later you change your

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.230 
or a little bit later you change your
mind<00:04:24.380> but<00:04:24.500> you've<00:04:24.680> already<00:04:24.860> started<00:04:25.280> making

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
mind but you've already started making

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.040 
mind but you've already started making
the<00:04:26.570> drawing<00:04:26.780> I<00:04:27.260> don't<00:04:27.800> change<00:04:28.039> my<00:04:28.160> mind<00:04:29.800> I

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
the drawing I don't change my mind I

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.150 
the drawing I don't change my mind I
cannot<00:04:33.050> change<00:04:33.320> my<00:04:33.590> mind

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
cannot change my mind

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.190 
cannot change my mind
so<00:04:34.550> if<00:04:34.850> I<00:04:35.030> started<00:04:35.510> off<00:04:35.690> in<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.020> wrong

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
so if I started off in the wrong

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.800 
so if I started off in the wrong
direction<00:04:36.410> which<00:04:37.070> happens<00:04:37.639> right<00:04:38.030> mm-hmm<00:04:38.660> I

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
direction which happens right mm-hmm I

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.120 
direction which happens right mm-hmm I
just<00:04:39.200> continue<00:04:39.800> on<00:04:40.990> just<00:04:41.990> let<00:04:42.530> it<00:04:42.680> go

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
just continue on just let it go

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.580 
just continue on just let it go
I<00:04:43.160> just<00:04:43.850> just<00:04:44.300> keep<00:04:44.570> working<00:04:45.050> and<00:04:45.169> make<00:04:45.410> the

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
I just just keep working and make the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.770 
I just just keep working and make the
best<00:04:45.770> of<00:04:45.919> it<00:04:46.039> and<00:04:46.250> you<00:04:46.340> know<00:04:46.660> actually<00:04:47.660> I<00:04:47.690> have

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
best of it and you know actually I have

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.350 
best of it and you know actually I have
to<00:04:48.080> say<00:04:48.289> being<00:04:48.950> nervous<00:04:49.280> about<00:04:49.729> once<00:04:50.120> you

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
to say being nervous about once you

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.969 
to say being nervous about once you
start<00:04:50.630> doing<00:04:50.780> something<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:51.410> you<00:04:51.530> realize

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
start doing something and you realize

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.190 
start doing something and you realize
that<00:04:52.010> you<00:04:52.760> wish<00:04:53.000> you<00:04:53.210> started<00:04:53.630> it<00:04:53.750> differently

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
that you wish you started it differently

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.279 
that you wish you started it differently
but<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:54.860> already<00:04:55.280> invested<00:04:56.060> about<00:04:56.180> like<00:04:56.690> 40

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
but you already invested about like 40

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.460 
but you already invested about like 40
hours<00:04:57.320> of<00:04:57.740> work<00:04:57.919> the<00:04:58.280> whole<00:04:58.490> work<00:04:59.419> so<00:04:59.840> a<00:04:59.870> week

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
hours of work the whole work so a week

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.629 
hours of work the whole work so a week
of<00:05:00.710> work<00:05:00.919> right

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
of work right

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.270 
of work right
there's<00:05:02.120> no<00:05:02.270> way<00:05:02.450> going<00:05:02.840> back<00:05:02.990> so<00:05:03.889> I<00:05:03.919> get

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
there's no way going back so I get

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.980 
there's no way going back so I get
really<00:05:04.430> nervous<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:05.210> freaked<00:05:05.450> out<00:05:05.660> and

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
really nervous and freaked out and

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.970 
really nervous and freaked out and
paranoia

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
paranoia

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.180 
paranoia
then<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:07.940> energy<00:05:08.600> that<00:05:08.840> I<00:05:09.110> create<00:05:09.710> is<00:05:09.950> this

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
then the energy that I create is this

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.850 
then the energy that I create is this
you<00:05:11.090> know<00:05:11.270> horrible<00:05:12.250> energy<00:05:13.250> of<00:05:14.290> fear<00:05:15.290> to<00:05:15.560> fail

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
you know horrible energy of fear to fail

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.890 
you know horrible energy of fear to fail
