enough to where the tip of your first
finger<00:02:06.439> is<00:02:06.649> muting<00:02:07.189> the<00:02:07.459> sixth<00:02:07.789> string<00:02:07.999> and<00:02:08.990> it

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
finger is muting the sixth string and it

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.370 
finger is muting the sixth string and it
sounds<00:02:10.190> like<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.600> on<00:02:11.600> that<00:02:11.780> sixth<00:02:12.140> string

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
sounds like that on that sixth string

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.760 
sounds like that on that sixth string
okay<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.520> then<00:02:14.480> let's<00:02:14.870> place<00:02:15.110> our<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.560> rest

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
okay and then let's place our the rest

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.680 
okay and then let's place our the rest
of<00:02:15.890> our<00:02:15.980> fingers<00:02:16.280> down<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:16.730> this<00:02:17.300> particular

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
of our fingers down this this particular

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.710 
of our fingers down this this particular
chord<00:02:18.260> comes<00:02:19.069> from<00:02:19.340> an<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.610> minor<00:02:20.000> chord<00:02:20.390> so<00:02:20.510> an

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
chord comes from an a minor chord so an

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.660 
chord comes from an a minor chord so an
easy<00:02:20.900> way<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.260> getting<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:21.950> memorizing

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
easy way of getting to it and memorizing

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.149 
easy way of getting to it and memorizing
it<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.569> play<00:02:23.750> an<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:24.019> minor<00:02:24.319> chord<00:02:24.620> one<00:02:25.069> of

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
it is to play an a minor chord one of

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:25.380 
it is to play an a minor chord one of
our

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
our

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.880 
our
basic<00:02:25.630> open<00:02:25.750> position<00:02:26.260> chords<00:02:26.560> we've<00:02:26.740> already

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
basic open position chords we've already

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.830 
basic open position chords we've already
done<00:02:28.740> now<00:02:29.740> just<00:02:30.610> like<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.060> previous<00:02:31.300> chord

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
done now just like the previous chord

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.920 
done now just like the previous chord
the<00:02:32.050> form<00:02:32.290> equal<00:02:32.650> before<00:02:33.330> or<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.510> E<00:02:34.540> major

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
the form equal before or the E major

the form equal before or the E major
chord<00:02:35.080> before<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.760> we're<00:02:36.880> going<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.300> switch

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
chord before and we're going to switch

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.780 
chord before and we're going to switch
the<00:02:38.290> fingers<00:02:38.560> we<00:02:38.680> use<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.069> go<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.220> two<00:02:39.490> three

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
the fingers we use and go to two three

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.720 
the fingers we use and go to two three
and<00:02:40.030> four<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.930> play<00:02:41.140> this<00:02:41.319> one<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:45.430> we<00:02:45.520> get<00:02:45.610> the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
and four to play this one so we get the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.830 
and four to play this one so we get the
same<00:02:45.910> chord<00:02:46.209> now<00:02:46.450> we're<00:02:46.570> going<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.750> move

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
same chord now we're going to move

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.800 
same chord now we're going to move
everything<00:02:47.200> up<00:02:47.440> one<00:02:47.860> fret<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:49.209> we<00:02:49.330> have<00:02:49.510> two

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
everything up one fret so we have two

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.900 
everything up one fret so we have two
zeros<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.500> fifth<00:02:50.740> string<00:02:50.980> zero<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.700> the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
zeros the fifth string zero and the

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.150 
zeros the fifth string zero and the
first<00:02:52.180> string<00:02:52.480> zero<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.590> we're<00:02:53.830> gonna<00:02:53.920> have<00:02:54.070> to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
first string zero so we're gonna have to

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.360 
first string zero so we're gonna have to
do<00:02:54.310> is<00:02:54.489> move<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:54.970> up<00:02:55.239> one<00:02:55.959> fret<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.530> then<00:02:57.310> the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
do is move this up one fret and then the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.880 
do is move this up one fret and then the
zeros<00:02:57.910> do<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.150> become<00:02:58.450> ones<00:02:58.750> by<00:02:59.080> barring<00:02:59.650> from

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
zeros do to become ones by barring from

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.449 
zeros do to become ones by barring from
the<00:02:59.980> fifth<00:03:00.190> string<00:03:00.400> across<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.150> first

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
the fifth string across to the first

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.070 
the fifth string across to the first
alright<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.700> remember<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.600> tip<00:03:04.840> of<00:03:04.989> the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
alright and remember the tip of the

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.930 
alright and remember the tip of the
first<00:03:05.290> finger<00:03:05.650> is<00:03:05.800> going<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.040> come<00:03:06.250> down<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:06.790> it

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
first finger is going to come down so it

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.420 
first finger is going to come down so it
mutes<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.660> sixth<00:03:08.230> string<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.040> we're<00:03:09.340> gonna

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
we're muting that sixth string just in

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.130 
we're muting that sixth string just in
case<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.900> hit<00:03:32.170> that's<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:34.660> sixth<00:03:34.959> string

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
case you hit that's the the sixth string

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.680 
case you hit that's the the sixth string
but<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.860> know<00:03:35.950> in<00:03:36.100> playing<00:03:36.459> situations<00:03:37.390> when

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
but you know in playing situations when

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.970 
but you know in playing situations when
you're<00:03:37.780> doing<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.079> strumming<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.739> stuff<00:03:38.890> like

that
it's<00:03:40.590> kind<00:03:40.800> of<00:03:40.830> sometimes<00:03:41.190> it's<00:03:41.310> kind<00:03:41.460> of<00:03:41.490> hard

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
it's kind of sometimes it's kind of hard

it's kind of sometimes it's kind of hard
to<00:03:41.820> avoid<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.390> so<00:03:42.570> that's<00:03:42.750> why<00:03:42.930> we're<00:03:43.110> muting

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
to avoid that so that's why we're muting

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.900 
to avoid that so that's why we're muting
it<00:03:43.620> but<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:43.890> are<00:03:44.070> aiming<00:03:44.280> for<00:03:44.490> the<00:03:44.730> five

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
version of this bar fist during bar

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.340 
version of this bar fist during bar
chord<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.650> all<00:03:56.580> we<00:03:56.790> do<00:03:57.000> is<00:03:57.270> we're<00:03:58.080> trying<00:03:58.200> to

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
chord and all we do is we're trying to

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.620 
chord and all we do is we're trying to
move<00:03:58.470> this<00:03:58.680> second<00:03:59.250> finger<00:03:59.580> up<00:03:59.760> one<00:04:00.300> fret

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
move this second finger up one fret

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.170 
move this second finger up one fret
obviously<00:04:01.620> we<00:04:01.770> can't<00:04:02.040> do<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.490> so<00:04:02.790> we<00:04:02.910> have<00:04:03.060> to

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
obviously we can't do that so we have to

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.970 
obviously we can't do that so we have to
change<00:04:03.360> positions<00:04:03.930> but<00:04:04.530> we<00:04:04.650> are<00:04:04.770> going<00:04:04.890> to

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
change positions but we are going to

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.890 
change positions but we are going to
make<00:04:05.130> just<00:04:05.160> this<00:04:05.730> four<00:04:06.030> on<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.330> second<00:04:06.690> string

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
make just this four on the second string

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.710 
make just this four on the second string
move<00:04:07.230> up<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.500> five<00:04:07.740> so<00:04:08.700> in<00:04:08.820> order<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.300> do<00:04:09.450> that

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
move up to five so in order to do that

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.650 
move up to five so in order to do that
we<00:04:10.050> have<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.410> move<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:11.490> pinky<00:04:11.940> over<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.540> that

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
we have to move the pinky over to that

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.900 
we have to move the pinky over to that
five<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.350> then<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.040> third<00:04:14.280> finger<00:04:14.550> takes

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
five and then the third finger takes

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.000 
five and then the third finger takes
over<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.810> note<00:04:15.990> that<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.230> pinky<00:04:16.620> was<00:04:16.769> just

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
over the note that the pinky was just

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.430 
over the note that the pinky was just
holding<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.579> then<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.750> second<00:04:19.260> finger

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
holding and then that second finger

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.380 
holding and then that second finger
comes<00:04:20.190> over<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.609> plays<00:04:20.730> the<00:04:21.030> one<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.299> the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
comes over and plays the one to the

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.370 
comes over and plays the one to the
third<00:04:21.600> finger<00:04:21.840> we're<00:04:22.079> just<00:04:22.260> holding

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.100 

so<00:04:26.380> we<00:04:26.470> go<00:04:26.560> from<00:04:26.680> here<00:04:27.660> then<00:04:28.660> just<00:04:28.840> kind<00:04:29.050> of

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
so we go from here then just kind of

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.530 
so we go from here then just kind of
shift<00:04:29.410> everything<00:04:29.860> down<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.820> then<00:04:31.180> this<00:04:31.300> one

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
shift everything down and then this one

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.650 
shift everything down and then this one
over

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.890 

okay<00:04:36.660> so<00:04:37.670> keep<00:04:38.670> practicing<00:04:38.940> these<00:04:39.450> try<00:04:39.840> to

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
okay so keep practicing these try to

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.760 
okay so keep practicing these try to
make<00:04:40.139> him<00:04:40.260> as<00:04:40.410> clean<00:04:40.740> as<00:04:40.950> possible<00:04:42.710> after<00:04:43.710> you

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
make him as clean as possible after you

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.379 
make him as clean as possible after you
get<00:04:43.919> a<00:04:43.950> handle<00:04:44.340> on<00:04:44.490> them<00:04:44.730> it's<00:04:44.850> a<00:04:44.940> good<00:04:45.060> idea

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
get a handle on them it's a good idea

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.030 
get a handle on them it's a good idea
maybe<00:04:45.600> there<00:04:45.930> try<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.169> start<00:04:46.470> playing<00:04:46.680> them<00:04:46.919> in

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
maybe there try to start playing them in

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.820 
maybe there try to start playing them in
different<00:04:47.220> frets<00:04:48.060> so<00:04:48.389> even<00:04:49.230> the<00:04:49.350> majors<00:04:49.800> that

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.110 

if<00:05:19.020> you<00:05:19.140> hear<00:05:19.290> something<00:05:19.590> like<00:05:19.620> this<00:05:23.090> well<00:05:24.090> you

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
pressure in the middle of that finger

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:33.730 
pressure in the middle of that finger
and<00:05:27.080> adjust<00:05:28.080> it<00:05:28.200> just<00:05:28.230> like<00:05:28.470> that

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
the biggest problem with a lot of

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.670 
the biggest problem with a lot of
players<00:05:38.720> is<00:05:39.020> they<00:05:39.110> can<00:05:39.260> just<00:05:39.380> late<00:05:39.530> a<00:05:39.560> little

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
players is they can just late a little

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.200 
players is they can just late a little
bit<00:05:39.800> watch<00:05:39.980> their<00:05:40.130> fingers<00:05:40.400> go<00:05:40.550> but<00:05:41.150> they

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
bit watch their fingers go but they

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.700 
bit watch their fingers go but they
don't<00:05:41.390> actually<00:05:41.540> listen<00:05:41.840> to<00:05:41.990> themselves<00:05:42.410> and

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
don't actually listen to themselves and
