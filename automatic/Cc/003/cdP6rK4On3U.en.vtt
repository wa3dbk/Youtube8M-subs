know something different then like

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.020 
know something different then like
damage<00:00:43.800> because<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.129> has<00:00:44.280> low<00:00:44.520> damage<00:00:44.760> so

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
damage because it has low damage so

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.779 
damage because it has low damage so
enchanting<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.660> with<00:00:45.840> extra<00:00:46.379> damage<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:47.010> not<00:00:47.730> a

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
enchanting it with extra damage is not a

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.799 
enchanting it with extra damage is not a
big<00:00:48.120> increase

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
big increase

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.819

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.280 
with some potions and some items I bet
you<00:02:06.460> could<00:02:06.640> use<00:02:06.880> this<00:02:07.060> constantly<00:02:07.900> without

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
you could use this constantly without

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.630 
you could use this constantly without
without<00:02:09.130> using<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.670> single<00:02:10.030> thing<00:02:10.210> so<00:02:10.570> yeah<00:02:11.640> and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
without using a single thing so yeah and

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.960 
without using a single thing so yeah and
it<00:02:13.510> has<00:02:13.600> like<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.810> weird<00:02:14.140> pattern<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.860> well<00:02:15.820> when

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
it has like a weird pattern to well when

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.610 
it has like a weird pattern to well when
they<00:02:16.060> ricocheted<00:02:16.600> -<00:02:16.810> that's<00:02:17.080> not<00:02:17.290> even<00:02:17.500> it

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
they ricocheted - that's not even it

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.540 
they ricocheted - that's not even it
that's<00:02:17.980> not<00:02:18.160> even<00:02:18.340> all<00:02:18.430> they<00:02:18.610> ricochet<00:02:19.090> oh<00:02:20.550> oh

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
that's not even all they ricochet oh oh

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.880 
that's not even all they ricochet oh oh
that's<00:02:21.790> right<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.330> I'm<00:02:22.780> using<00:02:23.050> nature's<00:02:23.560> gift

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
that's right and I'm using nature's gift

that's right and I'm using nature's gift
right<00:02:24.100> now<00:02:24.160> because<00:02:24.460> I<00:02:24.610> wanted<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:24.940> show<00:02:25.210> you

right now because I wanted to show you

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.600 
right now because I wanted to show you
guys<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:25.750> let<00:02:25.930> me<00:02:25.960> click<00:02:26.200> off<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.470> house<00:02:26.620> I'm

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
guys that let me click off the house I'm

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.890 
guys that let me click off the house I'm
using<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:28.720> plus<00:02:29.080> 20<00:02:29.440> mana<00:02:29.650> plus<00:02:30.750> 8%<00:02:31.750> or

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
using a it's plus 20 mana plus 8% or

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.700 
using a it's plus 20 mana plus 8% or
eight<00:02:32.560> percent<00:02:32.800> reduced<00:02:33.250> mana<00:02:33.580> usage<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:34.710> it

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
eight percent reduced mana usage so it

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.400 
eight percent reduced mana usage so it
automatically<00:02:36.310> uses<00:02:36.790> mana<00:02:37.000> potions<00:02:37.510> as<00:02:37.690> soon

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
automatically uses mana potions as soon

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.460 
automatically uses mana potions as soon
as<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.680> can<00:02:38.740> use<00:02:39.070> them<00:02:39.280> so<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:40.080> guess<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.230> could<00:02:41.290> use

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
as I can use them so I guess I could use

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:50.240 
as I can use them so I guess I could use
this<00:02:41.860> permanently<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.550> really<00:02:45.820> neat<00:02:46.000> I

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.540 

could<00:02:51.250> just<00:02:51.400> imagine<00:02:51.520> this<00:02:52.000> being<00:02:53.280> let<00:02:54.280> me<00:02:54.370> see

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
could just imagine this being let me see

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.770 
could just imagine this being let me see
let<00:02:54.760> me<00:02:54.790> see<00:02:54.880> when<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.150> get<00:02:55.239> all<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.570> way<00:02:55.630> down

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
let me see when I get all the way down

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.500 
let me see when I get all the way down
to<00:02:55.900> zero<00:02:56.110> if<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.410> uses<00:02:56.590> one<00:02:56.890> for<00:02:57.130> me<00:02:57.250> oh<00:02:57.510> look

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
to zero if it uses one for me oh look

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.120 
to zero if it uses one for me oh look
that<00:02:58.540> very<00:02:58.840> chains<00:02:59.170> blue<00:02:59.440> he<00:02:59.620> does<00:02:59.800> change

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
that very chains blue he does change

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.610 
that very chains blue he does change
blue<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:02.380> yeah<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:04.270> will<00:03:04.570> use<00:03:04.780> mana<00:03:05.080> potions

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
blue so yeah it will use mana potions

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.740 
blue so yeah it will use mana potions
over<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.160> over<00:03:06.370> for<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.910> guess<00:03:07.300> I<00:03:07.480> there's

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
over and over for you I guess I there's

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.100 
over and over for you I guess I there's
no<00:03:07.930> mana<00:03:08.200> usage<00:03:08.739> cooldown<00:03:09.190> anymore

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
no mana usage cooldown anymore

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.900 
no mana usage cooldown anymore
yeah<00:03:11.110> so<00:03:11.320> you<00:03:11.380> could<00:03:11.590> literally<00:03:11.890> go<00:03:12.610> into<00:03:12.880> a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
yeah so you could literally go into a

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.330 
yeah so you could literally go into a
fight<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.420> use<00:03:13.690> endless<00:03:14.320> mana<00:03:14.620> usage<00:03:17.340> yeah

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
fight and use endless mana usage yeah

couldn't get in to be blue but yeah I
mean<00:04:16.380> this<00:04:16.530> is<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.739> really<00:04:17.220> awesome<00:04:17.250> weapon<00:04:17.940> and

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
mean this is a really awesome weapon and

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.330 
mean this is a really awesome weapon and
it<00:04:18.150> ricochets<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:19.049> really<00:04:19.590> like<00:04:19.769> this<00:04:19.919> weapon

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
it ricochets I really like this weapon

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.030 
it ricochets I really like this weapon
this<00:04:20.519> is<00:04:20.700> this<00:04:21.600> might<00:04:21.840> be<00:04:21.870> Opie<00:04:22.440> if<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:22.800> can

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
this is this might be Opie if you can

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.330 
this is this might be Opie if you can
get<00:04:23.639> the<00:04:23.760> mana<00:04:23.970> consumption<00:04:24.930> down<00:04:25.139> on<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.530> so<00:04:26.310> I

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
get the mana consumption down on it so I

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.920 
get the mana consumption down on it so I
think<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.910> with<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.180> right<00:04:27.330> setup<00:04:27.660> you

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
think that with the right setup you

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.320 
think that with the right setup you
might<00:04:28.080> be<00:04:28.229> able<00:04:28.410> to<00:04:28.470> endlessly<00:04:29.010> use<00:04:29.430> this

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
might be able to endlessly use this
