00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.180 

okay<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.210> quite<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> mix<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.840> choice<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.800> things

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
okay so quite a mix of choice of things

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.730 
okay so quite a mix of choice of things
here<00:01:35.460> where<00:01:35.640> people<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:36.330> B<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> C<00:01:37.290> which<00:01:37.590> I

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
here where people like B and C which I

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.560 
here where people like B and C which I
think<00:01:37.950> are<00:01:38.070> probably<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.550> best<00:01:38.850> two<00:01:39.150> for<00:01:39.540> a

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
think are probably the best two for a

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.530 
think are probably the best two for a
pulmonary<00:01:39.990> renal<00:01:40.380> syndrome<00:01:41.300> nobody<00:01:42.300> picked

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
pulmonary renal syndrome nobody picked

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.570 
pulmonary renal syndrome nobody picked
lupus<00:01:43.050> which<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.530> another<00:01:43.770> pulmonary<00:01:44.310> renal

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
lupus which is another pulmonary renal

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.670 
lupus which is another pulmonary renal
syndrome<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.090> think<00:01:45.330> appropriately<00:01:45.930> in

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
syndrome but I think appropriately in

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.920 
syndrome but I think appropriately in
the<00:01:46.890> younger<00:01:47.220> man<00:01:47.400> that<00:01:47.910> would<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.180> unlikely

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
the younger man that would be unlikely

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.350 
the younger man that would be unlikely
and<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> right<00:01:49.860> answer<00:01:50.220> here<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.580> C

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and the right answer here is C

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.359 
and the right answer here is C
goodpasture's<00:01:52.260> syndrome<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.040> reason

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
goodpasture's syndrome and the reason

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.639 
goodpasture's syndrome and the reason
for<00:01:53.400> that<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:55.400> few<00:01:56.400> things<00:01:56.670> first<00:01:56.940> of<00:01:57.150> all<00:01:57.649> on

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
for that is few things first of all on

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.710 
for that is few things first of all on
the<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> boards<00:01:59.700> anybody<00:02:00.119> with<00:02:00.270> Wegner's

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
the on the boards anybody with Wegner's

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.350 
the on the boards anybody with Wegner's
is<00:02:00.930> gonna<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.700> sinus<00:02:02.700> stuff<00:02:02.820> they're<00:02:03.270> gonna

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
is gonna have sinus stuff they're gonna

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.940 
is gonna have sinus stuff they're gonna
get<00:02:03.540> put<00:02:03.810> him<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:03.990> he's<00:02:04.140> gonna<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.680> nasal

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
get put him on he's gonna have nasal

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.950 
get put him on he's gonna have nasal
steroids<00:02:05.580> on<00:02:05.759> his<00:02:05.910> med<00:02:06.119> list<00:02:06.390> he's<00:02:06.630> gonna<00:02:06.780> have

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
steroids on his med list he's gonna have

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.990 
steroids on his med list he's gonna have
history<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.410> sinus<00:02:07.830> infections<00:02:08.399> they'll<00:02:08.880> give

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
history of sinus infections they'll give

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.760 
history of sinus infections they'll give
you<00:02:09.090> something<00:02:09.509> like<00:02:09.540> that<00:02:09.720> because<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.229> 95

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
you something like that because it's 95

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.830 
you something like that because it's 95
percent<00:02:11.100> of<00:02:11.160> those<00:02:11.250> patients<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.850> a<00:02:12.090> history

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
percent of those patients have a history

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.140 
percent of those patients have a history
or<00:02:12.870> active<00:02:13.440> sinus<00:02:13.860> disease<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.580> think<00:02:14.850> it'll

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
or active sinus disease so I think it'll

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.300 
or active sinus disease so I think it'll
be<00:02:15.290> unlikely<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.470> they<00:02:16.620> didn't<00:02:16.860> wouldn't

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
be unlikely that they didn't wouldn't

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.370 
be unlikely that they didn't wouldn't
bury<00:02:17.489> that<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:17.880> history<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.780> other<00:02:18.900> thing<00:02:19.200> is

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
bury that in history the other thing is

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.520

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
of a hard question because you have to

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.470 
of a hard question because you have to

read beyond out what they obviously give
you<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.810> see<00:02:34.019> what's<00:02:34.260> absent<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.190> what

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
you and see what's absent and what

up<00:03:44.610> on<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.060> board<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:46.320> is<00:03:46.500> one<00:03:46.710> that's

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
up on the board so this is one that's

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.850 
up on the board so this is one that's
very<00:03:47.160> distinctive<00:03:47.790> it's<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:48.090> linear<00:03:48.860> IgG

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.520 
very distinctive it's a linear IgG
deposition<00:03:50.520> so<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.790> see<00:03:51.000> these<00:03:51.060> nice<00:03:51.530> very

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530

easy<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.430> see<00:03:53.670> lines<00:03:54.240> on<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.990> renal<00:03:55.230> biopsy<00:03:55.860> so

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
easy to see lines on the renal biopsy so

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.920 
easy to see lines on the renal biopsy so
you<00:03:56.220> can<00:03:56.490> actually<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:57.120> is<00:03:57.300> one<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.660> should
