00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.020 
just because um I think I found or I
felt<00:03:09.730> like<00:03:10.270> when<00:03:10.570> I<00:03:10.600> used<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.410> other

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
felt like when I used the other

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.160 
felt like when I used the other
exfoliator<00:03:13.030> like<00:03:13.270> after<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.570> while<00:03:13.630> like<00:03:13.870> I

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
exfoliator like after a while like I

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.140 
exfoliator like after a while like I
have<00:03:14.320> this<00:03:14.440> like<00:03:14.680> type<00:03:14.980> dry<00:03:15.430> feel<00:03:15.700> on<00:03:15.820> my<00:03:15.910> face

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
have this like type dry feel on my face

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.410 
have this like type dry feel on my face
which<00:03:16.510> i<00:03:16.630> think<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:16.959> not<00:03:17.080> very<00:03:17.410> like

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
which i think is not very like

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.610 
which i think is not very like
appropriate<00:03:19.420> for<00:03:19.570> my<00:03:19.690> skin<00:03:19.989> type<00:03:20.140> in<00:03:20.350> that<00:03:20.470> is

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
appropriate for my skin type in that is

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.250 
appropriate for my skin type in that is
dry<00:03:20.980> so<00:03:21.519> I<00:03:21.730> started<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.540> use<00:03:22.720> this<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.110> use

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
dry so I started to use this and I use

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.570 
dry so I started to use this and I use
this<00:03:23.350> probably<00:03:23.680> like<00:03:23.800> twice<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.220> week

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
this probably like twice a week

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.040 
this probably like twice a week
especially<00:03:24.820> because<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:25.600> now<00:03:25.810> use<00:03:25.959> the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
especially because I now use the

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.870 
especially because I now use the
Clarisonic<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:26.800> feel<00:03:27.130> like<00:03:27.280> I<00:03:27.400> don't<00:03:27.459> really

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
Clarisonic I feel like I don't really

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.150 
Clarisonic I feel like I don't really
need<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.930> go<00:03:29.110> back<00:03:29.290> in<00:03:29.500> with<00:03:29.590> an<00:03:29.709> exfoliator

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
need to go back in with an exfoliator

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.470 
need to go back in with an exfoliator
after<00:03:30.519> that<00:03:30.670> and<00:03:30.910> I<00:03:30.940> could<00:03:31.120> be<00:03:31.209> wrong<00:03:31.420> but

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
after that and I could be wrong but

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.060 
after that and I could be wrong but
that's<00:03:31.900> just<00:03:32.050> how<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:32.230> feel<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.530> mean<00:03:32.800> because

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
that's just how I feel I mean because

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.670 
that's just how I feel I mean because
I'm<00:03:33.220> lazy<00:03:33.459> it<00:03:33.760> just<00:03:33.940> makes<00:03:34.330> sense<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.720> me<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:35.170> I

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
I'm lazy it just makes sense to me so I

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.160 
I'm lazy it just makes sense to me so I
go<00:03:36.100> back<00:03:36.280> in<00:03:36.459> with<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:36.670> exfoliator<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:37.330> I<00:03:37.930> do

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
go back in with the exfoliator and I do

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.870 
go back in with the exfoliator and I do
this<00:03:38.380> maybe<00:03:38.530> twice<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:39.040> week<00:03:39.190> or<00:03:39.340> three<00:03:39.370> times<00:03:39.700> a

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
this maybe twice a week or three times a

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.050 
this maybe twice a week or three times a
week

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
week

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.670 
week
actually<00:03:40.420> more<00:03:40.540> like<00:03:40.570> twice<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:40.900> week<00:03:41.170> yeah<00:03:41.440> and

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
actually more like twice a week yeah and

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.949 
actually more like twice a week yeah and
then<00:03:42.250> I<00:03:42.489> mean<00:03:42.670> this<00:03:42.790> nothing<00:03:43.450> extra<00:03:43.810> about

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
then I mean this nothing extra about

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.140 
then I mean this nothing extra about
this<00:03:44.200> just<00:03:44.410> put<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.709> on<00:03:44.800> exfoliate<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.000> then

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
this just put it on exfoliate and then

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.360 
this just put it on exfoliate and then
clean<00:03:46.480> off<00:03:46.660> this<00:03:47.170> also<00:03:47.650> gives<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:48.070> clean

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
clean off this also gives a clean

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.190 
clean off this also gives a clean
feeling<00:03:48.760> but<00:03:48.940> it<00:03:49.030> does<00:03:49.269> not<00:03:49.480> give<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.810> squeaky

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
feeling but it does not give a squeaky

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.600 
feeling but it does not give a squeaky
clean<00:03:50.320> feel<00:03:50.590> which<00:03:50.769> I<00:03:50.920> have<00:03:51.070> no<00:03:51.190> problem<00:03:51.519> with

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
clean feel which I have no problem with

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.160 
clean feel which I have no problem with
because<00:03:51.910> I<00:03:52.000> know<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:52.510> my<00:03:52.600> face<00:03:52.780> is<00:03:52.810> clean

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
because I know that my face is clean

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.050 
because I know that my face is clean
because<00:03:53.320> I<00:03:53.590> already<00:03:53.920> use<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.070> Clarisonic<00:03:54.670> so

because I already use a Clarisonic so

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.610 
because I already use a Clarisonic so
this<00:03:55.239> is<00:03:55.360> just<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.720> exfoliate<00:03:55.959> and<00:03:56.350> take<00:03:56.500> off

I'm a little surprised

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.600 
I'm a little surprised
so<00:04:25.419> I<00:04:25.990> use<00:04:26.590> this<00:04:26.740> after<00:04:26.950> that<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.580> just

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
so I use this after that and it just

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.030 
so I use this after that and it just
kind<00:04:27.760> of<00:04:27.910> like<00:04:28.030> balanced<00:04:28.600> out<00:04:28.750> my<00:04:29.080> moisture

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
kind of like balanced out my moisture

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.650 
kind of like balanced out my moisture
levels<00:04:30.370> in<00:04:30.490> my<00:04:30.580> face<00:04:30.790> and<00:04:30.970> all<00:04:31.060> that<00:04:31.270> so<00:04:31.480> how<00:04:31.630> I

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
levels in my face and all that so how I

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.360 
levels in my face and all that so how I
use<00:04:31.900> this<00:04:32.080> is<00:04:32.290> basically<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:33.040> know<00:04:33.130> it's<00:04:33.280> a

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
use this is basically you know it's a

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.400

gel<00:04:33.580> like<00:04:33.760> consistency<00:04:33.940> and<00:04:34.930> I<00:04:35.050> smooth<00:04:35.320> this

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
gel like consistency and I smooth this

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.379 
gel like consistency and I smooth this
on<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:35.980> I<00:04:36.040> leave<00:04:36.190> it<00:04:36.280> for<00:04:36.340> about<00:04:36.550> five<00:04:36.940> to<00:04:37.180> ten

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389

minutes<00:04:37.690> if<00:04:37.840> I'm<00:04:37.990> not<00:04:38.169> really<00:04:38.350> doing<00:04:38.560> anything

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
minutes if I'm not really doing anything

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.170 
minutes if I'm not really doing anything
much<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.310> think<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:39.550> on<00:04:39.639> for<00:04:39.820> as<00:04:39.910> much<00:04:40.030> as

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
much I think it on for as much as

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.310
