00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.080
 I'm here for you today with a box of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.120
 gigabyte b 75m from 13h 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.000
 Let's get the box started by the box. 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.310
 that in front of her that are paulo 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.859
 and predicted that she has everything right that 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.369
 has time and expected 3.0 relative 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.230
 three times vsb paulo sp 310 sata 3 more 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.050
 I'll comment later on with work, or 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.790
 here in the back of the box and everything 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.250
 that it contains the specifications here 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.989
 underneath those who want a glimpse of it and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.020
 What does it matter, I'm going to open the box that 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.620
 I want to see the little box in a 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:54.530
 packaging does not give no importance to content 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:54.530
 open here transparent 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.020
 the back panel 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.820
 the mirror you want to call the connection 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.350
 of the cabinet band for this motherboard 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.119
 then user manual as well 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.760
 practical way to make the connections 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:18.060
 with the moving hills everything explained 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:22.640
 the cd drivers a bypass of gigabyte and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.640
 here the shoes of the two halters 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.909
 I'm back, guys, you're in the room and already 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.490
 I'm open here, you two are going to start. 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.039
 by their main points here 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.710
 the p4 power connector four tires 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.509
 is the processor socket going to open 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.149
 that decision is the processor that 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.259
 with this zink protection and move the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.520
 button accept the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:54.810
 link processors 1155 and 135 and 7 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.420
 to the 3770 silent supports may be okay 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.119
 quietly without any problems and 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.330
 incompatibilities celebrated in four 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.619
 supports up to 32 gb of memory and 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.170
 four times 8 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.840
 here the connector of 24 power movies 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.299
 of the source she already had that they come with the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.069
 zinc usb 3.0 connector that the 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.980
 cabinets you have in the same cabinet will 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.959
 connect it here so much is already 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.160
 good ones here have many simple motherboards 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.080
 which recently dropped a motherboard 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.840
 let's say input for cost benefit 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.700
 She does not have it, she already has it. 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.470
 here it is very important to connect that are 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.230
 I played sometimes losing two usb 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.680

 the front panel of the cabinet 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.090
 front of the audio here is the fan cpu that the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.889
 daughter of friends who do not have this joke 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:15.600
 vilsack temp the computer was champion in 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:18.299
 a pcs 3.0 cup that already 3.0 having the pc 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.709
 standard and that has another pci 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.959
 tse 2.0 personal 4 x cup here at 3.0 16 x 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.090
 the motherboard accepts cross crashes you want 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.180
 do can make cross alloy two plates 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.319
 of mdf she supports is compatible with 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.510
 this however a 3.0 other 2.0 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.109
 I'll leave it, I think it covered everything. 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.010
 Let's get the back panel here. 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.799
 that one has an entrance 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.930
 ps2 for both keyboard purchase mouse you 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.900
 you can see that she's half purple and green green 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.439
 and keyboard and mouse from the one mouse 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:57.019
 keyboard two usb 2.0 here input from 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:04:01.769
 jean on input must and hdmi two usb 3.0 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:03.959
 plus two usb 2.0 one gigiga network and the 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.090
 audio panel headset microphone such 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.010
 an important thing going person 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.590
 always highlight on the motherboard 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.859
 these connections here the video inputs 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.510
 With board, if you will use our 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.759
 bought computer here an example here 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.549
 in the logical store 4 that bought with plate 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:22.530
 video you forget is continuing to 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.750
 house that does not use this one will not 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.860
 an entry here ok will be back here 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.930
 it was really such an entry 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.610
 probably kept it here is here 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.229
 that will not engage 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.270
 extinguished the quito will not have video 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.169
 never proved in the energy signal in the 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.479
 monitor 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.030
 then it is an important train item that 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.220
 copper plate port a motherboard has 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.680
 a very good cost benefit for the value 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.800
 it has all the possibilities functions 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.050
 32GB possible memory already comes with it 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.490
 all ready for your pc that does not want 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.020
 spend a lot and motherboard that exists more 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.690
 the score had something a plate 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.280
 mother well recommended to you if 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.830

 thing makes the description and we pay up 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.360
 You too that sometimes we go 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.770
 the race for something I ask goes from 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.750

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.070
