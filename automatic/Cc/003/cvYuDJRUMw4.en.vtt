I wanted to show you guys something I

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.010 
I wanted to show you guys something I
thought<00:00:03.060> was<00:00:03.240> neat<00:00:03.859> I<00:00:05.060> drew<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:06.600> normally

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
thought was neat I drew this I normally

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.080 
thought was neat I drew this I normally
date<00:00:07.319> everything<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:08.069> do<00:00:08.130> just<00:00:08.790> for<00:00:08.940> reference

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
date everything I do just for reference

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.999 
date everything I do just for reference
but<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.630> drew<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.490> think<00:00:11.490> early<00:00:11.670> June<00:00:13.009> one

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
but I drew this I think early June one

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.910 
but I drew this I think early June one
of<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.190> first<00:00:14.400> drawings<00:00:14.849> i<00:00:14.969> did<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.890> so<00:00:16.890> I

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
of the first drawings i did and so I

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.689 
of the first drawings i did and so I
drew<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.900> then<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.340> think<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> couple

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
drew this and then I think of a couple

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.490 
drew this and then I think of a couple
weeks<00:00:20.970> later<00:00:21.090> I've<00:00:21.660> downloaded<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.289> CAD

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
weeks later I've downloaded a CAD

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.759 
weeks later I've downloaded a CAD
program<00:00:23.010> taught<00:00:23.340> myself<00:00:23.460> how<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.820> use<00:00:24.090> it

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
program taught myself how to use it

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.620 
program taught myself how to use it
digitize<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:26.699> by<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.849> didn't<00:00:27.510> take

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
digitize this just by I didn't take

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.060 
digitize this just by I didn't take
measurements<00:00:28.199> hernia<00:00:28.470> well<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.680> did<00:00:28.859> measure

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
measurements hernia well I did measure

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.460 
measurements hernia well I did measure
it<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.460> course<00:00:29.670> length<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.359> everything<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:31.380> I

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
it of course length and everything but I

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.160 
it of course length and everything but I
didn't<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.800> really<00:00:32.040> accurate<00:00:32.610> measurements

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
didn't have really accurate measurements

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.959 
didn't have really accurate measurements
anyway<00:00:34.170> drew<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.590> digitized<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.399> got<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.700> cut

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
anyway drew it digitized it got it cut

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.959 
anyway drew it digitized it got it cut
and<00:00:36.239> made<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> knife<00:00:36.719> out<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.610> it<00:00:38.610> is

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
and made a knife out of it and it is

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.729 
and made a knife out of it and it is
almost<00:00:41.570> dead<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:43.309> pretty<00:00:44.309> crazy<00:00:45.350> so<00:00:46.350> from<00:00:46.710> my

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
almost dead on pretty crazy so from my

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.330 
almost dead on pretty crazy so from my
original<00:00:47.100> drawing<00:00:49.129> to<00:00:50.129> finish<00:00:50.910> knife<00:00:52.340> it's

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
original drawing to finish knife it's

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.150 
original drawing to finish knife it's
almost<00:00:53.699> dead<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.930> obviously<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:56.039> some

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
almost dead on so obviously have some

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.119 
almost dead on so obviously have some
kind<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.370> curve<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.239> drawing<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.800> is

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
kind of curve in the drawing and this is

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.360 
kind of curve in the drawing and this is
straight<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.550> since<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.949> done<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> flat

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
straight on since it's done on a flat

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.850 
straight on since it's done on a flat
platen<00:01:02.789> but<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.390> pretty<00:01:03.750> much<00:01:03.989> spot<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.379> I

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
platen but it's pretty much spot on I

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.000 
platen but it's pretty much spot on I
wish<00:01:05.360> I<00:01:06.360> would<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.170> went<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.500> little<00:01:07.680> thicker

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
wish I would have went a little thicker

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.950 
wish I would have went a little thicker
in<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.310> handles<00:01:08.729> some<00:01:09.000> people<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.510> and

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
in the handles some people like and

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.230 
in the handles some people like and
thicker<00:01:10.260> some<00:01:11.010> people<00:01:11.280> don't<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.729> personally

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
thicker some people don't I personally

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.850 
thicker some people don't I personally
don't<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.659> think<00:01:12.869> that's<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.200> perfect<00:01:13.350> handle

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
don't I think that's a perfect handle

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.280 
don't I think that's a perfect handle
for<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> neck<00:01:14.220> knife<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.700> not<00:01:14.850> meant<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.210> be

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
for a neck knife it's not meant to be

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.679 
for a neck knife it's not meant to be
used<00:01:16.460> super<00:01:17.460> heavily<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.880> mean<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.240> an<00:01:18.390> EDC

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
used super heavily I mean it's an EDC

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.520 
used super heavily I mean it's an EDC
tool<00:01:19.080> but<00:01:20.119> pretty<00:01:21.119> crazy<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.170> was<00:01:22.320> so

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
tool but pretty crazy that it was so

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.789 
tool but pretty crazy that it was so
spot-on<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.400> thought<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.030> was<00:01:24.150> neat<00:01:27.650> just<00:01:28.650> a

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
spot-on I thought that was neat just a

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
spot-on I thought that was neat just a
fun<00:01:29.040> reference<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:30.000> look<00:01:30.240> back<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.689> see

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
fun reference to go look back and see

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.580 
fun reference to go look back and see

I've wanted to do for years and years I
mean<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.140> talked<00:02:01.380> about<00:02:01.590> doing<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.950> back<00:02:02.280> in

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
mean I talked about doing this back in

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.749 
mean I talked about doing this back in
2010<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.710> didn't<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.070> facilities

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
2010 I just didn't have the facilities

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.779 
2010 I just didn't have the facilities
to<00:02:05.790> do<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:07.099> it's<00:02:08.099> lonely<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.369> lot<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.670> people

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
to do it and it's lonely a lot of people

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.809 
to do it and it's lonely a lot of people
think<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:10.950> something<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.459> decided

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
think that this is something I decided

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.340 
think that this is something I decided
to<00:02:12.000> do<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> whim

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
to do on a whim

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.820 
to do on a whim
that<00:02:13.920> kind<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.130> happened<00:02:14.550> quickly<00:02:15.080> but<00:02:16.080> as<00:02:16.530> far

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
that kind of happened quickly but as far
