some of you have been trying to look for

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.400 
some of you have been trying to look for
two<00:00:23.880> cards<00:00:24.240> 280<00:00:24.539> air<00:00:24.720> cards<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.289> could

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
two cards 280 air cards that you could

two cards 280 air cards that you could
have<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.680> crossfire<00:00:26.189> connection<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.029> you're

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
have in crossfire connection and you're

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.390 
have in crossfire connection and you're
wondering<00:00:28.199> about<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.800> different<00:00:29.099> types<00:00:29.250> of

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
wondering about the different types of

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.700 
wondering about the different types of
combinations<00:00:30.029> or<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.420> will<00:00:30.570> work<00:00:30.750> well<00:00:31.560> on

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
combinations or what will work well on

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.479 
combinations or what will work well on

possible combinations the red section

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.680 
possible combinations the red section
there<00:00:50.280> shows<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.149> would<00:00:51.329> need<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
there shows you that you would need the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.959 
there shows you that you would need the
connector<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.770> bridge<00:00:52.980> connector<00:00:53.460> for

connector the bridge connector for
crossfire<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.899> dot<00:00:55.199> means<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.129> AMD

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
crossfire the dot means that AMD

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.580 
crossfire the dot means that AMD
recommends<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.510> type<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.750> combination<00:00:58.079> so

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
recommends this type of combination so

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.029 
recommends this type of combination so
for<00:00:58.739> example<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.239> 4870<00:01:00.239> x2<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> 4890<00:01:01.829> will

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
for example a 4870 x2 and a 4890 will

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.840 
for example a 4870 x2 and a 4890 will
work<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.460> they<00:01:02.550> recommend<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:04.850> 4850

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
work and they recommend that but a 4850

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.530 
work and they recommend that but a 4850
and<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:07.310> 4870<00:01:08.310> they<00:01:08.760> don't<00:01:08.970> necessarily

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
and a 4870 they don't necessarily

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.859 
and a 4870 they don't necessarily
recommend<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.320> could<00:01:10.500> work<00:01:10.710> right<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.880> but

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
recommend but it could work right so but

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.600 
recommend but it could work right so but
you<00:01:12.960> might<00:01:13.110> find<00:01:13.530> problems<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> games<00:01:14.400> or

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
you might find problems in the games or

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.310 
you might find problems in the games or
things<00:01:14.790> not<00:01:14.939> being<00:01:15.090> recognized<00:01:15.509> properly<00:01:16.080> and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
things not being recognized properly and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.460 
things not being recognized properly and
does<00:01:16.939> you<00:01:17.939> know<00:01:18.060> things<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.930> keep

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
does you know things like that so keep

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.870 
does you know things like that so keep
that<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.650> mind<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.340> should<00:01:20.520> really<00:01:20.670> be

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that in mind you should really be

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.760 
that in mind you should really be
getting<00:01:21.540> two<00:01:21.840> cards<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.259> are<00:01:22.350> identical

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
getting two cards that are identical

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.859 
getting two cards that are identical
with<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> same<00:01:23.340> GPU<00:01:23.790> now<00:01:24.390> they<00:01:24.540> don't<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
with the same GPU now they don't have to

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.039 
with the same GPU now they don't have to
be<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> same<00:01:25.080> brand<00:01:25.439> name<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:25.950> same<00:01:26.340> GPU

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
be the same brand name but same GPU

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.390 
be the same brand name but same GPU
another<00:01:28.049> question<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.740> what<00:01:29.250> are<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
another question is what are the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.640 
another question is what are the
benefits<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.970> DirectX<00:01:30.509> 11<00:01:30.900> well<00:01:31.049> there's<00:01:31.500> some

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
benefits of DirectX 11 well there's some

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.170 
benefits of DirectX 11 well there's some
obvious<00:01:32.130> benefits<00:01:32.610> I've<00:01:32.700> been<00:01:32.820> playing<00:01:33.030> some

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
obvious benefits I've been playing some

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.359 
obvious benefits I've been playing some
directx<00:01:33.720> 11<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.590> tell<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> there<00:01:35.189> it's

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
directx 11 and I tell you there it's

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.969 
directx 11 and I tell you there it's
much<00:01:35.610> faster<00:01:35.880> right<00:01:36.329> off<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> bat<00:01:36.770> makes<00:01:37.770> use

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
much faster right off the bat makes use

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.060 
much faster right off the bat makes use
of<00:01:38.119> windows<00:01:39.119> seven<00:01:39.439> beautifully<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.650> it's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
of windows seven beautifully and it's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.859 
of windows seven beautifully and it's
more<00:01:41.250> realistic<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:42.030> graphics<00:01:42.299> right<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
more realistic the graphics right the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.719 
more realistic the graphics right the
explosions<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.590> shading<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.549> way<00:01:44.670> things

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
explosions the shading the way things

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.210 
explosions the shading the way things
look<00:01:45.270> here's<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.869> screenshot<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.649> example<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
look here's a screenshot for example of

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.210 
look here's a screenshot for example of
DirectX<00:01:47.790> 10<00:01:48.210> okay<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.930> was<00:01:49.079> doing<00:01:50.040> some

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
DirectX 10 okay so I was doing some

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.060 
DirectX 10 okay so I was doing some
benchmarks<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.060> directx<00:01:52.020> 10<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.380> flat<00:01:52.680> CL

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
realistic pot it pops out at you right

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.620 
realistic pot it pops out at you right
it's<00:01:59.430> more<00:01:59.610> realistic<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.180> shading

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
it's more realistic the shading

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.840 
it's more realistic the shading
everything<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:02.070> that's<00:02:02.369> because<00:02:02.729> of

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
everything there that's because of

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.240 
everything there that's because of
tessellation<00:02:03.299> there's<00:02:04.020> also<00:02:04.350> multithreading

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
tessellation there's also multithreading

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.100 
tessellation there's also multithreading

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
capabilities and direct compute

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.650 
capabilities and direct compute
capabilities<00:02:07.860> all<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.369> now<00:02:08.729> added<00:02:09.300> into

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
capabilities all of this now added into

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.070 
capabilities all of this now added into
directx<00:02:10.170> 11<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.739> these<00:02:11.340> games<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.450> have

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
directx 11 and these games that have

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.430 
directx 11 and these games that have
come

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
come

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.860 
come
and<00:02:13.650> are<00:02:13.860> coming<00:02:14.190> out<00:02:14.310> make<00:02:15.090> use<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.330> all<00:02:15.570> that

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
and are coming out make use of all that

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.300 
and are coming out make use of all that
so<00:02:16.320> when<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.590> play<00:02:16.740> these<00:02:16.890> games<00:02:17.100> you're

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
so when you play these games you're

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.400 
so when you play these games you're
going<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.490> notice<00:02:17.840> how<00:02:18.840> things<00:02:19.110> are<00:02:19.260> not<00:02:19.350> so

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
going to notice how things are not so

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.670 
going to notice how things are not so
flat<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.340> square<00:02:20.640> they're<00:02:21.240> more<00:02:21.510> rounded<00:02:22.470> and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
flat and square they're more rounded and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.770 
flat and square they're more rounded and
they've<00:02:23.610> really<00:02:23.880> done<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.060> big<00:02:24.270> improvement

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
they've really done a big improvement

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.870 
they've really done a big improvement
for<00:02:24.960> sure<00:02:25.140> now<00:02:25.920> another<00:02:26.220> question<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.730> about

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
for sure now another question is about

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.960 
for sure now another question is about
the<00:02:27.180> ATI<00:02:27.630> eyefinity<00:02:28.590> what<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.730> all<00:02:29.940> about

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
the ATI eyefinity what is that all about

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.730 
the ATI eyefinity what is that all about
well<00:02:30.330> it's<00:02:30.510> about<00:02:30.600> connecting<00:02:31.080> really<00:02:31.380> three

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
well it's about connecting really three

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.990 
well it's about connecting really three
monitors<00:02:32.070> that's<00:02:32.370> what<00:02:32.520> people<00:02:32.760> are<00:02:32.880> doing

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
monitors that's what people are doing

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.400 
monitors that's what people are doing
these<00:02:33.180> days<00:02:33.360> are<00:02:33.510> connecting<00:02:33.870> three<00:02:34.080> monitors

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
these days are connecting three monitors

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.610 
these days are connecting three monitors
to<00:02:34.620> get<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.770> surround<00:02:35.370> view<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.630> think<00:02:37.320> about<00:02:37.410> it

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
to get a surround view so think about it

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.970 
to get a surround view so think about it
as<00:02:37.740> almost<00:02:38.040> like<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.930> 360<00:02:39.930> view<00:02:39.960> if<00:02:40.410> you<00:02:40.740> really

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
as almost like a 360 view if you really

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.550 
as almost like a 360 view if you really
wanted<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.370> quickly<00:02:41.960> rotate<00:02:42.960> yourself<00:02:43.380> and

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
wanted to quickly rotate yourself and

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.370 
wanted to quickly rotate yourself and
see<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.100> expand<00:02:44.610> your<00:02:44.910> monitor<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:46.020> that<00:02:46.170> way

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
see and expand your monitor so that way

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.370 
see and expand your monitor so that way
you<00:02:46.800> can<00:02:46.980> have<00:02:47.160> aerial<00:02:47.730> views<00:02:48.090> side<00:02:48.780> views<00:02:49.170> of

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
you can have aerial views side views of

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.810 
you can have aerial views side views of
things<00:02:49.740> while<00:02:49.950> you're<00:02:50.070> playing<00:02:50.220> games<00:02:50.520> and

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
the screen resolutions you can't just

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.030 
the screen resolutions you can't just
expect<00:03:01.290> any<00:03:01.620> card<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:03.750> behave<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.830> give<00:03:04.980> you

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
expect any card to behave and give you

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.620
