 I will leave you in the description of the video 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.320
 only what strain they open the folder and 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.090
 they copy all these files only 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.070
 we need clio 4 for this 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.830
 work well in the video description it 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.380
 I leave everything necessary and I also do not know 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.300
 if you saw that here says my 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.520
 name is all pulse for us to say of 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.740
 a better look for soccer mind 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.970
 that is unique only to change 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.940
 this name where it says here below 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.430
 down in the middle of the screen we go 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.920
 here we open this this file 15 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.050
 editor interface with the role of us 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.450
 as you really want what 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.330
 open we look for the part where it says my 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.460
 name is only given by overwhelming 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.680
 and here where my name says you 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.810
 they can whoever they want I do not know how 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.780
 call where you are put and so 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.870
 you will thus appear on your screen 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.790
 of the game will appear its only one below 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.070
 we only do this we close 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.560
 obviously we keep the changes and I 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.729
 I keep nothing because I do not change anything 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.230
 we only copy all the files 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.360
 right click copy 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.120
 we go to the folder of our 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.660
 game when you have installed in 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.900
 my case here we give right click paste 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.590
 or simply just replace it 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.270
 everything announces everything to replace and ready 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.790
 it would already be let's say run 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.730
 This also gave me a lot to like 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.340
 previously I had say the toy to 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.090
 5 installed only we erase what 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.319
 starts in the file is filed if it 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.060
 Llama I do not remember what it was called well 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.060
 the staff 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.120
 normally when you install in the 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.000
 course of gt5 are obviously going to erase 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.540
 this file called radar and what 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.680
 erase so that we say the radar does not 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.420
 leave square 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.860
 only delete this file and 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.430
 obviously they will also erase these 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.670
 records 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.580
 only the script that says like that 7 to 4 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.350
 gats and only delete that no longer 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.350
 matter if it leaves in the folder too 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.360
 for us to say what about error term 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.730
 the gta point of exc that comes with the 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.810
 putta de gta 5 the 4 that you have 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.820
 they just extract it they do not replace it 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.370
 for the one who has the extra in memphis 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.630
 so that not so that it is not for him 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.840
 do not make them a problem only 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.660
 they replace it with the original of 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.640
 extract memphis so that for not 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.310
 make a problem we're just going to 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.920
 replace simple so that not so that 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.270
 be the same version match that 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.590
 It would be all that is being 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.090
 tutorial obviously was not a tutorial 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.560
