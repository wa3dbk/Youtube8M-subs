00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.740
 johanna bathe friends and gets in per 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.510
 life style live from venice beach with 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.490
 my brother matthew you start 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.180
 I still have an old video here where 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.470
 I document my strength increase 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.169
 and that was before the injury 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.120
 my hand and there I was at 125 kilos 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.650
 are five times with dust with he says 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:41.229
 why are I stopping now? 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.820
 instagram read by many people 

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:45.400
 comments Mr. Patrick how it looks 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.470
 with a place you have a force 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.449
 had lost like that and so on 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.820
 on and on 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.750
 it is as said that 125 were 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.250
 stuck 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.030
 and then I broke my hand 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.799
 and of course I do not have one for a long time 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.850
 Although growth made a week 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.239
 after three weeks 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.310
 but three weeks I did not do any 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.350
 at least and now here in gold that 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.270
 first time try again bank press 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.039
 make and I have 150 kilos 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.619
 they have not quite started yet 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:17.859
 completely cured but it went with 15 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:21.340
 kilo and today I have with 110 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:22.659
 kilo nice clean 55 rausgeholt with 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.789
 nice and clean she stops 10 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.049
 in a flop 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.450
 the first block comes this week 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.969
 then online what's up is that ever comes 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.340
 after pro me first the whole trade 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:34.960
 videos certainly also in the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.469
 switzerland update from many things with 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.079
 patrick deutsch also a few games on 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:43.570
 yes of course sometimes nice to hear and 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.929
 also to see that it will be better soon 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.939
 going 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.200
 I do not always know it's easy 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.630
 for people who might be looking for it 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.249
 with her are not having an injury 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.979
 always easy 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:55.179
 yes, without training there are people who 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.399
 the training is missing and they will 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.920
 almost depressed and at this moment 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.240
 not important for other things 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.799
 really focus and try 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.780
 the injury is almost a bit 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.689
 to forget and just have it with you 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.250
 to accept and just in this time 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.049
 maybe reading a book or something 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.879
 and has a little bit more on others 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.760
 things are about to go 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:18.099
 et cetera and then I think so too 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.390
 three four five weeks also the muscle 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.790
 actually try loss in 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.709
 will hold limits especially in the same 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.510
 Of course, nutrition also remains 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.310
 also a factor important that the 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.349
 driver does not start eating shit 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.060
 tremendous achievement have motivation there 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.739
 it has to be there for you 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.329
 preserved body loose over five 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.920
 Weeks I notice now especially 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.200
 if you practice natural and 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.760
 accordingly long natural 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.769
 trained and the quality first there 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.989
 is so after 56 years 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.099
 that loses so well in a month 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.689
 how not to say i think so 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.829
 there you will lose power 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.920
 that means you will become a few 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.450
 Weeks lose a total of greens to you 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.849
 could make the loses the 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.139
 logically but muscles themselves in 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.030
 a month do not just build 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.620
 directly from the train is not directly 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.750
 and of course what to say 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.750
 the so-called memory effect yes if you 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.450
 train 33 45 years and then do it 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.340
 your break now three months be three 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.709
 months is clear there you need to have 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.959
 if you do not exercise but if you do 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.940
 then gentleman again sets me and me 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.959
 think to train as are the had 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.030
 quickly rebuilt 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.459
 this is what is called the memory effect 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.000
 not what's ever had yet 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.769
 anyone 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.989
 since I started to train 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.569
 Considered a longer break so two 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.919
 three weeks had completely well I 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.720
 that's not why I do not know again 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.910
 works properly but I think 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.129
 already that there is something to it 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.540
 it must be something to it so how 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.609
 said people the power comes slowly 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.250
 back my hand is better i 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:48.220
 think such a week everything is perfect 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.590
 tip-top healed and the most important thing is 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.150
 if you have an injury no matter what 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.980
 she simply tries for one 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.859
 hide it I know it's hard 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.530
 and that's not always easy though 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:02.919
 You have to try as little as possible 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.449
 and to think about this injury and me 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:06.510
 I am firmly convinced that then too 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:08.010
 the healing process knows itself yes 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.870
 faster 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.579
 but well that's just my theory with 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.010
 the energy from the book just with the 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.889
 energy on the ground people concerned exactly 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.150
 This lake has got closer to it 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.840
 I still like the video 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.960
 my power will document you 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.120
 and as I said this week, start with 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.970
 the blog definitely looks that here 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.080
 at instagram at our start up to 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.080
 date that soon
