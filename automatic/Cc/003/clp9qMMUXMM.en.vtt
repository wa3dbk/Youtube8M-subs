things like this and i know that freedom

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.260 
things like this and i know that freedom
of<00:04:24.630> information<00:04:24.990> is<00:04:25.440> great<00:04:26.000> but<00:04:27.000> then<00:04:27.180> they

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
release a lot more information not just

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.360

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
phenomenon that might or might not be

phenomenon that might or might not be
real<00:04:37.710> at<00:04:38.220> least<00:04:38.370> that's<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.670> way<00:04:38.730> I<00:04:38.820> see<00:04:39.180> it
