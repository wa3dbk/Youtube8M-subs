00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.239

 let's start naturally probably fixed here 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.350
 they are the rule so let's start with the rules 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.229
 this rule does not break the blocks do not put 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.110
 if not asking to play peacefully then 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.600

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.310
 Of course I looked for the name card 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.610
 called kill and survive damn just 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.080
 super name is probably very interesting 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.810
 read this second book 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.580
 read you remember you remember how you 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.190
 said the wife that there is nearby 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.200
 some kind of base and said that they spend there 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.910
 some experiences go in base kei 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.550
 ok and 3 little book your name is joe us 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.040
 your wife and her name is Emily without any 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.170
 the difference how damn my whore are you 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.710
 woke up and found that it is not 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.310
 that's the way it is always at home you started looking 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.920
 assassin code 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.619
 go out on the street to be that fucking who 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.540
 assassin go outside okay so let's 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.789
 take the torch and roses I do not know 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.649
 I guess he will give her when she finds 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.370
 pink or something like that so 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.739
 anvil means map made for 1.4 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.650
 you don’t cheat on the road 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.440
 okay I will go down this road 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.330
 Actually the dumbest I want 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.830
 say about the cards at her glad it 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.140
 still card on the nerves I'll them 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.930
 evaluate the wife said that nearby 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.120
 There is a base but even if you go out with 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.400
 this fucking little house can 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.799
 notice that the base really is 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.750
 what the fuck is he like when he boils 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.569
 come out you can not notice this damn 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.760
 base yes like she is like that so hidden that 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.849
 I fuck notice actually base there 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.330
 here it is to me what kind of nonsense is actually in 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:52.180
 and for this minus because it is obvious 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.910
 that the base is like a husband did not guess 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.860
 without your videos from here without your wife 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.380
 that this card is actually this 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.000
 crazy this crazy season 3 will be 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.090
 much more interesting in terms of what i am 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.859
 I will judge the cards much more strictly 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.170
 I find on the Internet yes dog grunt know 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.890
 a sign of consent 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.079
 get out 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.780
 pig rotten so here she is fine here 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:23.140
 she here she is on dick wrapped so you 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:29.549
 hike it's here here on why 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.549
 why why not why here they are here 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.010
 enrages it all so entrance is forbidden stop and 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.920
 what do i do here at least some 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.500
 hints there is so input is forbidden 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.120
 if prohibited naturally i will press the lever 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.000
 and come in here so by logging in you can 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.209
 return you I have nothing to lose them 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.790
 I like a little pellet yonder huge 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.239
 just why you have nothing to lose Th 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.700
 jump down so great jump down 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.410
 some kind of dickhead where my wife and ale 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.780
 what do i call there i shit and 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.350
 In general, the first different feeling is that 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.010
 now everything will collapse here 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:14.430
 tyn melon melon from the bottom 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.830
 with notice bitch i will break this tablet yes 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.500
 I know that you can't break a blocker, but when 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:24.540
 you bitch learn to write without mistakes 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:27.630
 then I will start them not to break things like that 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.370
 we go on the torch I think the author 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.550
 we just like I wouldn’t guess what 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.260
 on the way to go and why I need a torch 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.140
 not at all in the know maybe 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.680
 to light up the terrain yes I am so 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.930
 too picky player but not 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:51.630
 less so will the threads of the experimental subjects 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:53.330
 okay kinda cool zombie and this 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.200

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.530
 there was a woman like that 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.380
 the food was recently taken upstairs go rather 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:11.460

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:14.010

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.040

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.800

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.430

 one thing killed my whole family and then I 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:51.600
 began to revenge all people screaming about 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:54.690
 savior and the author probably looked 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.300
 Recently, the movie is some terrible decided 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.780

 you understand the plot in minecraft as 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.670
 Most of this shit because 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.130

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.050
 can only do americans carter 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.030
 because they really 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.160
 original in this regard but therefore 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.100
