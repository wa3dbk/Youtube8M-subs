right there this little smooth plates so
good<00:03:21.949> I<00:03:22.220> guess<00:03:22.519> if<00:03:22.669> the<00:03:22.790> car<00:03:23.000> leans<00:03:23.180> downwards

good I guess if the car leans downwards

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.360 
good I guess if the car leans downwards
it'll<00:03:23.989> stop<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.440> from<00:03:24.620> scratching<00:03:25.129> the<00:03:25.220> whole

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370
