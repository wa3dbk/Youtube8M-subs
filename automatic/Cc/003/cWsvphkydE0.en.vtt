00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:09.360
 relativity have a genre lesson 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:10.920
 salon dialogue so what is the theory 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.710
 relativity and this is all relative 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.139
 yes it does not mean that something is needed 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.080
 carry and then something can be attributed later 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.080
 this is a complicated thing here let's say i'm sitting and you 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.349
 feel you go and i'm sitting 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.090
 we went about me that you 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.270
 speak for the first time sit and i went you 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.860
 let's go right about you 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.100
 one relative to the other all the time 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.390
 something is doing or we say with 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.480
 you went 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.030
 what we do we drive is equal to carry for 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.610
 well, what about house items 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.610
 trees watered cities subject I 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.649
 I understand this is still a difficult thing, but if 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.649
 we will get used to this thought and we will be with it 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.460
 move you further by the way we move with 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.559
 you cane 3 to do we push 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.680
 came across he fell relate what 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.200
 gave yes we were pushing and regarding houses 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.070
 he fell relative to us not ruler 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.009
 glasses so we pushed it residents glasses we 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:23.850
 stopped mast he relatively 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:29.689
 kept on moving glasses regarding yes 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:33.990
 that's him what you say how interesting 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.820
 let's say we push and vovochki 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.000
 then we rest where the buns 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.180
 what about his house what are you 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.470
 say remains with us but keep 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.570
 move points light exactly yes if 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.380
 It can be pushed far he will return 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.659
 rejuvenated interesting idea 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.229
 rejuvenated exactly as much as 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.060
 my pushed as far as he did not see us 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.670
 let's say we pushed him so that he us 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:11.610
 did not see three days how young he was 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.799
 As for me, let's simplify 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.430
 let's not see him for three days 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.920
 is amazing 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.930
 and that fitna what do you understand the theory 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.680
 assumes in all the principle 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.750
 of relativity 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.970
 let's say at home asking where are you going 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.700
 what about how much do you get 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:33.569
 regarding what from asia to student 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:37.920
 much to interview the director in this direction 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.840
 went up to regarding the minister means we 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.010
 his throat pushed him if he saw three days 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.200
 how much have we seen him 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.109
 maybe so he was pushed that he us 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.010
 didn't see for three days then we couldn't 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.010
 see every day 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.930
 it is relative for relative to him 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.870
 the roof 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.480
 he may not see us at all important 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.180
 so in relation to him we continue 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.950
 exist and push others 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.690
 relatively home of course it is difficult 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.820
 not an easy thing but it's not all that 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.170
 there is still a movement about 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.640
 other one by one and cohesive 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.430
 it was time that several understood 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.270
 people now understand everything about 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.360
 others myself 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.850
 well let's say I invented something discovered or 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.220
 then created others 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.340
 then others will block you push exactly 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.020
 I'll be back aged 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.300
 pushed about of course at home 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.910
 same can not move can move 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.690
 the team pushes the glasses ahead of them 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.830
 put on 1 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.610
 allow but only till night 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.490
 knew how to wear glasses 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.010
 update it we leave the team smart 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:55.730
 relate what in the houses of course thanks 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.730
 for your attention
