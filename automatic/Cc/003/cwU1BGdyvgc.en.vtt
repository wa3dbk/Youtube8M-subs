course<00:00:40.410> now<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.070> know<00:00:41.370> better<00:00:41.579> after<00:00:42.000> like

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
course now we know better after like

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.900 
course now we know better after like
reading<00:00:43.320> some<00:00:43.559> studies<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.160> some<00:00:44.460> research

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
reading some studies and some research

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.619 
reading some studies and some research
and<00:00:45.120> from<00:00:45.239> my<00:00:45.420> experience<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:47.629> amount

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and from my experience that the amount

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.299 
and from my experience that the amount
of<00:00:48.750> meals<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.289> eat<00:00:49.320> per<00:00:49.590> day<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:50.010> natural

want to eat basically you have the same
results<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.690> all<00:01:00.989> comes<00:01:01.230> down<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.410> calorie

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
results it all comes down to calorie

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.210 
results it all comes down to calorie
intake<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.390> key<00:01:03.660> here<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:04.080> what<00:01:04.739> made<00:01:04.979> me

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
intake so the key here is what made me

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.190 
intake so the key here is what made me
what<00:01:05.760> made<00:01:05.909> me<00:01:06.090> stick<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.630> basically<00:01:06.990> where

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
what made me stick is basically where

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.990 
what made me stick is basically where
most<00:01:07.409> people<00:01:07.710> fail<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.220> had<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> lot<00:01:08.880> of

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
most people fail I had a lot of

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.850 
most people fail I had a lot of
motivation<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.780> continue<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.470> my<00:01:10.590> fitness

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
journey so these eight seven to eight

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.830 
journey so these eight seven to eight
meals<00:01:13.500> per<00:01:13.770> day<00:01:13.799> didn't<00:01:14.430> kind<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.060> motivate<00:01:15.600> me

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.170 
foods and five meals at first then I
narrowed<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.200> down<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.920> three<00:02:02.820> meals<00:02:03.000> per

narrowed that down to three meals per

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.600 
narrowed that down to three meals per
day<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.689> 15<00:02:04.290> types<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.710> foods<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.100> get<00:02:05.369> all

my calories my micro and micro elements

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.309 
my calories my micro and micro elements
inside<00:02:11.069> my<00:02:11.280> body<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:12.270> basically<00:02:12.660> it's

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
inside my body so basically it's

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
but that's not sustainable I know it's

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.149 
but that's not sustainable I know it's
perfect<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:13.049> can<00:03:13.230> make<00:03:13.379> your<00:03:13.560> perfect<00:03:14.010> diet

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
like that but I know you won't be able

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.640 
like that but I know you won't be able
to<00:03:16.019> sustain<00:03:16.169> it

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
to sustain it

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.469 
to sustain it
at<00:03:16.859> least<00:03:17.129> not<00:03:17.280> longer<00:03:17.639> for<00:03:17.849> one<00:03:18.000> month<00:03:18.209> which

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:20.189 
basically doesn't make any difference

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:23.300 
basically doesn't make any difference
you<00:03:20.939> want<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.239> do<00:03:21.629> something<00:03:22.139> that<00:03:22.379> you<00:03:22.919> can<00:03:23.129> do

narrowing down exactly what works for

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.300 
narrowing down exactly what works for
you<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.810> don't<00:03:31.199> have<00:03:31.379> to<00:03:31.530> waste<00:03:31.709> time<00:03:31.889> on

you so you don't have to waste time on
something<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:32.639> doesn't<00:03:33.030> work<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.509> you<00:03:33.829> you

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
something that doesn't work and you you

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.619 
something that doesn't work and you you

will go as far as sacrificing a little

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.809 
will go as far as sacrificing a little
