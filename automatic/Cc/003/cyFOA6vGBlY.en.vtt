it's three blocks high it's kind of

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.950 
it's three blocks high it's kind of
pointless<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:33.059> wanted<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.570> see<00:00:33.750> if<00:00:33.780> I

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
pointless I just wanted to see if I

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.930 
pointless I just wanted to see if I
could<00:00:34.020> do<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:35.270> and<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.600> got<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.020> work<00:00:37.170> so

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
could do it and and I got it to work so

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.959 
could do it and and I got it to work so
getting<00:00:38.940> these<00:00:39.379> back<00:00:40.379> walls<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.579> move<00:00:41.790> in

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
getting these back walls to move in

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.930 
getting these back walls to move in
enough<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:43.610> activate<00:00:45.590> every<00:00:46.590> every<00:00:47.489> bookshelf

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
enough to activate every every bookshelf

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.840 
enough to activate every every bookshelf
slot<00:00:48.500> on<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.559> enchanting<00:00:49.829> table<00:00:50.399> was<00:00:50.610> easy

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
slot on the enchanting table was easy

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.080 
slot on the enchanting table was easy
but<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.530> doorway<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.489> gave<00:00:53.879> me<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
but I was the doorway that gave me the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.069 
but I was the doorway that gave me the
most<00:00:54.239> trouble<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:55.489> basically<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.840> walk<00:00:57.840> in

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
most trouble so basically just walk in

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.900 
most trouble so basically just walk in
hit<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> pressure<00:00:58.739> plate<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.430> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.539> see

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
hit the pressure plate and you can see

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.030 
hit the pressure plate and you can see
every<00:01:02.910> slot<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.600> activated<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> corners<00:01:04.799> back

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
every slot is activated the corners back

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.219 
every slot is activated the corners back
there<00:01:05.600> I<00:01:06.619> got<00:01:07.619> all<00:01:07.799> 30<00:01:08.130> bookshelves<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
there I got all 30 bookshelves so and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.469 
there I got all 30 bookshelves so and
then<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.710> walk<00:01:10.950> back<00:01:11.189> out<00:01:12.830> gets<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.330> put<00:01:15.330> back

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
then you walk back out gets a put back

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.539 
then you walk back out gets a put back
to<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> way<00:01:15.840> was<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.890> show<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:17.430> it

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
to the way was so I can show you what it

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.520 
to the way was so I can show you what it
looks<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.880> from<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.299> inside<00:01:18.350> replaced<00:01:19.350> that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
looks like from the inside replaced that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.100 
looks like from the inside replaced that
with<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.740> wooden<00:01:20.040> pressure<00:01:20.430> plate<00:01:20.990> throw<00:01:21.990> an

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
with a wooden pressure plate throw an

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:31.880 
with a wooden pressure plate throw an
item<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:25.369> yeah<00:01:27.350> now<00:01:28.880> back<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:30.890> I

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
item on to it and yeah now back here I

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.210 
item on to it and yeah now back here I
kind<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.970> broke<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.360> down<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.840> show<00:01:34.220> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
kind of broke it down to show the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.069 
kind of broke it down to show the
mechanisms<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> took<00:01:36.150> out<00:01:36.420> all<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> timing

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
mechanisms so I took out all the timing

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.149 
mechanisms so I took out all the timing
mechanisms<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.659> activation<00:01:39.659> mechanisms<00:01:40.320> and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
mechanisms the activation mechanisms and

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.450 
mechanisms the activation mechanisms and
I<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.530> down<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.799> complicated

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
I just have it down to the complicated

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.090 
I just have it down to the complicated
part<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:45.290> basically<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> first<00:01:46.710> thing<00:01:46.950> that

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
part so basically the first thing that

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.899 
part so basically the first thing that
happens<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:48.560> those<00:01:49.560> get<00:01:49.860> activated<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.700> there

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
happens is those get activated so there

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.060 
happens is those get activated so there
are<00:01:51.030> these<00:01:51.149> double<00:01:51.840> piston<00:01:52.020> extenders<00:01:52.799> that

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
are these double piston extenders that

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.480 
are these double piston extenders that
activate<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:54.229> this<00:01:55.229> one<00:01:55.500> tick<00:01:55.770> pulse<00:01:56.070> that's

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
activate on this one tick pulse that's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.520 
activate on this one tick pulse that's
provided<00:01:57.030> by<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:59.270> duel<00:02:00.270> edge<00:02:00.540> detector<00:02:01.170> here

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
provided by this duel edge detector here

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.959 
provided by this duel edge detector here
and<00:02:02.100> they<00:02:02.969> push<00:02:03.240> out<00:02:03.420> two<00:02:03.840> bookcases<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:05.729> form

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
and they push out two bookcases to form

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.199 
and they push out two bookcases to form
that<00:02:06.149> one<00:02:06.390> wide<00:02:06.570> doorway<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
that one wide doorway and then the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.999 
that one wide doorway and then the
important<00:02:09.629> thing<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.050> Pistons<00:02:10.530> retract

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
important thing is the Pistons retract

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.860 
important thing is the Pistons retract
to<00:02:11.250> leave<00:02:11.459> room<00:02:11.730> here<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
to leave room here for the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.990 
to leave room here for the
bookcases<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.980> side<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.610> second

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
bookcases on the side so the second

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.440 
bookcases on the side so the second
thing<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.209> happens<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:16.909> yet<00:02:17.909> double<00:02:18.269> piston

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
thing that happens is yet double piston

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.770 
thing that happens is yet double piston
extender<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:19.200> coming<00:02:19.530> down<00:02:19.709> from<00:02:20.010> above<00:02:20.780> and

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
extender is coming down from above and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.699 
extender is coming down from above and
then<00:02:21.930> two<00:02:22.290> other<00:02:22.319> Pistons<00:02:23.159> to<00:02:23.489> block<00:02:24.709> block

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
then two other Pistons to block block

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.020 
then two other Pistons to block block
the<00:02:25.860> view<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.190> piston<00:02:26.640> head<00:02:26.790> from<00:02:26.940> the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
the view of that piston head from the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.020 
the view of that piston head from the
inside<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.690> then<00:02:28.069> just<00:02:29.069> these<00:02:29.340> Pistons<00:02:29.819> come

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
inside and then just these Pistons come

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.399 
inside and then just these Pistons come
up<00:02:30.150> from<00:02:30.329> the<00:02:30.360> bottom<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:33.409> does

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
up from the bottom and that that does

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.670 
up from the bottom and that that does
the<00:02:34.709> doorway<00:02:35.459> part<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.090> then<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.349> rest

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
the doorway part of it and then the rest

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.979 
the doorway part of it and then the rest
of<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.010> was<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.940> know<00:02:39.000> getting<00:02:39.450> Pistons

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
of it was just you know getting Pistons

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.899 
of it was just you know getting Pistons
to<00:02:40.200> push<00:02:40.409> these<00:02:40.620> side<00:02:40.950> parts<00:02:41.340> into<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.670> middle

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
to push these side parts into the middle

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.309 
to push these side parts into the middle
there<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.900> one<00:02:43.470> strange<00:02:44.370> thing<00:02:44.579> with<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.420> I'm

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
there is one strange thing with this I'm

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.890 
there is one strange thing with this I'm
not<00:02:46.590> quite<00:02:46.980> sure<00:02:47.010> why<00:02:47.549> it's<00:02:47.819> working<00:02:48.299> but<00:02:48.750> it

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
not quite sure why it's working but it

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.319 
not quite sure why it's working but it
is<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:51.150> for<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:52.530> two<00:02:52.709> sides<00:02:53.099> you<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.150> see<00:02:54.299> I

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
is so for the two sides you can see I

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.210 
is so for the two sides you can see I
have<00:02:55.069> four<00:02:56.069> wide<00:02:56.250> by<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.519> high<00:02:56.970> piston<00:02:58.220> array

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
have four wide by to high piston array

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.229 
have four wide by to high piston array
there<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.409> bottom<00:03:02.220> piston<00:03:02.760> here<00:03:03.060> I

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
there so for this bottom piston here I

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.720 
there so for this bottom piston here I
have<00:03:03.540> power<00:03:03.810> going<00:03:04.769> underneath<00:03:05.220> into<00:03:05.640> the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
have power going underneath into the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.690 
have power going underneath into the
block<00:03:05.970> below<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.599> for<00:03:07.440> these<00:03:07.620> for<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.459> three

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
block below it for these for the three

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.220 
block below it for these for the three
beside<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.299> there's<00:03:10.260> just<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.709> wire<00:03:10.950> running

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
beside it there's just a wire running

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.110 
beside it there's just a wire running
behind<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.799> then<00:03:14.250> for<00:03:14.810> these<00:03:15.810> three

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
behind it and then for these three

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.430 
behind it and then for these three
there's<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.209> wire<00:03:18.450> running<00:03:18.690> on<00:03:18.870> top<00:03:19.139> now<00:03:19.410> I

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
there's a wire running on top now I

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.339 
there's a wire running on top now I
didn't<00:03:19.799> extend<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.370> wire<00:03:20.639> to<00:03:20.940> here<00:03:21.359> to<00:03:22.109> void

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
didn't extend that wire to here to void

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.599 
didn't extend that wire to here to void
the<00:03:23.720> diagonal<00:03:24.720> power<00:03:24.959> bug<00:03:25.349> but<00:03:25.950> for<00:03:26.280> some

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
the diagonal power bug but for some

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.210 
the diagonal power bug but for some
reason<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:27.599> piston<00:03:28.200> actually<00:03:28.650> works<00:03:28.919> with

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
reason this piston actually works with

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.659 
reason this piston actually works with
this<00:03:29.400> setup<00:03:29.669> and<00:03:30.030> i'm<00:03:30.269> not<00:03:30.480> sure<00:03:30.540> why<00:03:30.989> but<00:03:31.669> I'm

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
this setup and i'm not sure why but I'm

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.280 
this setup and i'm not sure why but I'm
not<00:03:32.879> questioning<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:33.780> if<00:03:33.870> anybody<00:03:34.230> can

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
not questioning it but if anybody can

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.159 
not questioning it but if anybody can
explain<00:03:34.859> it<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.129> me<00:03:35.329> that<00:03:36.329> would<00:03:36.540> be<00:03:36.599> really

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
explain it to me that would be really

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.940 
explain it to me that would be really

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
it back up thanks for watching I forgot

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.809 
it back up thanks for watching I forgot
to<00:03:56.220> show<00:03:57.049> this<00:03:58.049> going<00:03:58.620> back<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:59.069> its<00:03:59.370> original

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
to show this going back to its original

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.110 
to show this going back to its original
state<00:04:00.299> so<00:04:00.780> I<00:04:01.069> have<00:04:02.069> this<00:04:02.480> this<00:04:03.480> hooked<00:04:03.780> up<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:04.199> a

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
state so I have this this hooked up to a

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.759 
state so I have this this hooked up to a
reversible<00:04:06.120> signal<00:04:06.569> generator<00:04:07.280> so<00:04:09.620> my<00:04:10.620> name

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
reversible signal generator so my name

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.129 
reversible signal generator so my name
is<00:04:10.799> going<00:04:11.160> back<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:12.060> get<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.510> double<00:04:12.959> piss

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
is going back you get the double piss

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.629 
is going back you get the double piss
next<00:04:13.440> nine<00:04:13.620> years<00:04:13.650> from<00:04:13.919> the<00:04:14.040> top<00:04:14.250> pulling

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
next nine years from the top pulling

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.120 
next nine years from the top pulling
that<00:04:14.760> back<00:04:15.000> up<00:04:15.269> pulling<00:04:16.229> that<00:04:16.380> back<00:04:16.620> down<00:04:16.859> and

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
that back up pulling that back down and

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.969 
that back up pulling that back down and
then<00:04:17.250> sidelines<00:04:18.139> when<00:04:19.139> in<00:04:19.289> pull<00:04:19.530> those<00:04:19.709> back

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
then sidelines when in pull those back

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.839 
then sidelines when in pull those back
out<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.459> side<00:04:20.669> so<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.539> got<00:04:22.349> all<00:04:22.530> these

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
out to the side so I got all these

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.540 
out to the side so I got all these
designs<00:04:23.849> for<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.840> double<00:04:25.229> piston<00:04:25.440> extenders

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
designs for the double piston extenders

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.770 
designs for the double piston extenders
and<00:04:28.159> well<00:04:29.159> justjust<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.819> piston<00:04:30.270> extenders

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
and well justjust the piston extenders

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.240 
and well justjust the piston extenders
from<00:04:31.110> minecraft<00:04:31.680> attics<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.810> circuit<00:04:33.810> gallery

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
from minecraft attics a circuit gallery

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.529 
from minecraft attics a circuit gallery
and<00:04:35.250> then<00:04:35.430> I<00:04:35.550> just<00:04:35.759> figured<00:04:36.150> out<00:04:36.240> how<00:04:36.479> to

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
and then I just figured out how to

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.080 
and then I just figured out how to
attach<00:04:37.289> them<00:04:37.800> all<00:04:37.949> together<00:04:38.129> I<00:04:38.400> had<00:04:38.849> to<00:04:38.970> do

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
attach them all together I had to do

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.969 
attach them all together I had to do
some<00:04:39.620> modifications<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:42.620> well<00:04:43.620> for<00:04:43.889> example

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
some modifications to well for example

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.790 
some modifications to well for example
to<00:04:44.430> get<00:04:44.610> these<00:04:45.449> stacked<00:04:46.110> on<00:04:46.349> top<00:04:46.379> of<00:04:46.590> each

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
to get these stacked on top of each

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.559 
to get these stacked on top of each
other<00:04:47.069> and<00:04:48.979> yeah<00:04:50.090> mostly<00:04:51.090> just<00:04:51.300> for<00:04:51.479> these

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
other and yeah mostly just for these

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.580 
other and yeah mostly just for these
side<00:04:51.840> ones<00:04:52.110> i<00:04:52.379> had<00:04:52.830> to<00:04:53.720> change<00:04:54.720> up<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:54.990> circuit

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
side ones i had to change up the circuit

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.619 
side ones i had to change up the circuit
so<00:04:55.770> they<00:04:55.919> would<00:04:56.099> work<00:04:56.310> with<00:04:56.550> with<00:04:57.360> them

00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:57.629 
so they would work with with them

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:05.350 
so they would work with with them
stacked<00:04:57.990> up

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.419 

you
