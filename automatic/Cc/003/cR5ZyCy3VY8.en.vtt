is no way there's no options of actually
changing<00:01:49.580> this<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:50.060> if<00:01:50.150> we<00:01:50.240> go<00:01:50.360> into<00:01:50.480> the

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
changing this so if we go into the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.960 
changing this so if we go into the
options<00:01:50.810> you<00:01:51.650> know<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:51.800> can't<00:01:52.070> do<00:01:52.520> this<00:01:52.730> I'm

actually<00:03:39.410> went<00:03:39.560> back<00:03:39.770> and<00:03:40.040> tried<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:41.060> myself

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
actually went back and tried it myself

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.450 
actually went back and tried it myself
and<00:03:41.750> for<00:03:41.960> some<00:03:42.230> reason<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.770> just<00:03:42.800> didn't<00:03:43.430> work

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
but for 0.12 it actually did so it's

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.050 
but for 0.12 it actually did so it's
really<00:03:47.150> really<00:03:47.420> cool<00:03:47.660> so<00:03:48.140> after<00:03:48.530> hitting<00:03:48.709> save

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
really really cool so after hitting save

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.160 
really really cool so after hitting save
basically<00:03:50.060> you<00:03:50.180> can<00:03:50.330> just<00:03:50.360> close<00:03:50.660> this<00:03:50.810> up<00:03:50.990> you

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
basically you can just close this up you

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.960 
basically you can just close this up you
don't<00:03:51.320> need<00:03:51.530> that<00:03:51.770> you<00:03:52.220> don't<00:03:52.340> even<00:03:52.610> need<00:03:52.790> the

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970

world chord hello world but you guys

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.860 
world chord hello world but you guys
probably<00:04:04.550> named<00:04:04.820> it<00:04:05.000> it's<00:04:05.090> probably

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
probably named it it's probably

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.080 
probably named it it's probably
something<00:04:06.800> better<00:04:07.010> than<00:04:07.280> that

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
something better than that

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.480 
something better than that
so<00:04:08.390> we're<00:04:08.480> gonna<00:04:08.570> click<00:04:08.959> on<00:04:08.990> that<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:09.590> what<00:04:10.340> we

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
so we're gonna click on that and what we

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.370 
so we're gonna click on that and what we
should<00:04:10.700> see<00:04:10.940> is<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.890> f5<00:04:12.890> mode<00:04:13.430> how<00:04:14.209> sick<00:04:15.140> is

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
should see is the f5 mode how sick is

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.340 
should see is the f5 mode how sick is
that<00:04:15.440> but<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:16.730> only<00:04:16.910> thing<00:04:17.270> is<00:04:17.510> if<00:04:17.780> you<00:04:17.959> switch

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
that but the only thing is if you switch

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.530 
that but the only thing is if you switch
back<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.830> like<00:04:19.520> first<00:04:19.820> person<00:04:20.270> and<00:04:20.420> then

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
back to like first person and then

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.050 
back to like first person and then
switch<00:04:21.170> back<00:04:21.200> to<00:04:21.440> third<00:04:21.890> person<00:04:22.160> I<00:04:22.550> don't

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
switch back to third person I don't

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.950 
switch back to third person I don't
think<00:04:23.480> it's<00:04:23.750> gonna<00:04:23.960> still<00:04:24.590> stay<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.520> same<00:04:25.960> so

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
think it's gonna still stay the same so

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.300 
think it's gonna still stay the same so
yeah<00:04:27.140> as<00:04:27.260> you<00:04:27.320> can<00:04:27.410> see<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:27.770> just<00:04:27.950> went<00:04:28.130> back<00:04:28.280> to

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
yeah as you can see it just went back to

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.010 
yeah as you can see it just went back to
the<00:04:28.430> back<00:04:28.700> view<00:04:28.910> and<00:04:29.150> basically<00:04:29.810> you<00:04:29.990> just

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
the back view and basically you just

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.490 
the back view and basically you just
have<00:04:30.290> to<00:04:30.470> redo<00:04:30.950> that<00:04:31.190> all<00:04:31.400> again<00:04:31.910> so<00:04:32.720> that
