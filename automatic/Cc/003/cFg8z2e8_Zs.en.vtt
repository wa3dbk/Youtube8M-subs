other favorite foundation brush it
doesn't<00:01:00.329> look<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.660> little<00:01:00.899> bit<00:01:01.140> similar<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
doesn't look a little bit similar to the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.399 
doesn't look a little bit similar to the
sigmax<00:01:03.359> one<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:03.989> one<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> little

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
sigmax one but this one is a little

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.109 
sigmax one but this one is a little
pinched<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.580> little<00:01:05.760> thinner

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
pinched here so it's a little thinner

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.390 
pinched here so it's a little thinner
and<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> lot<00:01:07.200> less<00:01:07.439> dense<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.189> gives

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and it's a lot less dense so this gives

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.880 
and it's a lot less dense so this gives
me<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> more<00:01:08.850> natural<00:01:09.540> still<00:01:10.260> beautiful

airbrush but it's not going to be as
full<00:01:12.840> coverage<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.619> more<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.830> my

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
have three blush brushes to talk about

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.680 
have three blush brushes to talk about
and<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.229> first<00:04:24.500> has<00:04:24.860> really<00:04:25.789> opened<00:04:26.000> my<00:04:26.390> eyes

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
and the first has really opened my eyes

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.020 
and the first has really opened my eyes
up<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.020> cream<00:04:27.740> blushes<00:04:28.250> for<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.669> longest<00:04:28.910> time

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
up to cream blushes for the longest time

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.640 
up to cream blushes for the longest time
it<00:04:29.240> wasn't<00:04:29.390> a<00:04:29.510> huge<00:04:29.720> fan<00:04:29.750> of<00:04:29.960> cream<00:04:30.289> blush<00:04:30.470> and

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
it wasn't a huge fan of cream blush and

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.650 
it wasn't a huge fan of cream blush and
I<00:04:30.710> think<00:04:30.979> it<00:04:31.100> was<00:04:31.280> because<00:04:31.460> my<00:04:31.850> fingers<00:04:31.910> or<00:04:32.570> the

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
I think it was because my fingers or the

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.330 
I think it was because my fingers or the
brushes<00:04:32.990> that<00:04:33.020> I<00:04:33.140> were<00:04:33.380> using<00:04:33.800> weren't
