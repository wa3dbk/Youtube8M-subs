00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.369 
today we're going to be looking at
inflating<00:00:03.899> bike<00:00:04.259> tires<00:00:05.990> did<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.080> know<00:00:07.200> that

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
inflating bike tires did you know that

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.379 
inflating bike tires did you know that
the<00:00:07.589> majority<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.370> flats<00:00:08.760> are<00:00:09.000> caused<00:00:09.179> because

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
the majority of flats are caused because

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.780 
the majority of flats are caused because
of<00:00:09.570> improper<00:00:10.019> tire<00:00:10.380> pressure<00:00:10.679> what<00:00:11.400> happens

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
of improper tire pressure what happens

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.940 
of improper tire pressure what happens
is<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.300> get<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.480> pinch<00:00:12.750> flat<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.590> happens

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
is you get a pinch flat and that happens

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.630 
is you get a pinch flat and that happens
when<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.700> unint<00:00:15.830> your<00:00:16.830> tire<00:00:17.039> compresses

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
when the unint your tire compresses

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.779 
when the unint your tire compresses
enough<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.750> inner<00:00:18.990> tube<00:00:19.430> is<00:00:20.430> cut<00:00:20.760> by

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
enough that the inner tube is cut by

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.660 
enough that the inner tube is cut by
that<00:00:21.090> by<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.300> rim<00:00:22.130> now<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.369> avoid<00:00:23.490> all

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
that by the rim now you can avoid all

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.640 
that by the rim now you can avoid all
these<00:00:23.910> problems<00:00:24.180> by<00:00:24.510> simply<00:00:25.230> starting<00:00:25.560> to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
these problems by simply starting to

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.009 
these problems by simply starting to
ride<00:00:25.800> with<00:00:26.279> enough<00:00:26.550> tire<00:00:26.760> pressure<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
ride with enough tire pressure so the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.120 
ride with enough tire pressure so the
first<00:00:28.260> thing<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.529> want<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.710> do<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.980> identify

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
first thing you want to do is identify

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.560 
first thing you want to do is identify
what<00:00:29.699> kind<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:30.080> bike<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.349> valve<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.219> have

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
what kind of bike of valve you have

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.569 
what kind of bike of valve you have
there<00:00:33.570> are<00:00:33.600> two<00:00:33.809> kinds<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.469> first<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
there are two kinds the first is the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.090 
there are two kinds the first is the
European<00:00:36.390> valve<00:00:37.230> or<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:38.070> presta<00:00:38.610> valve

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.359 
recommend 30 to 50 psi I suggest maybe
going<00:02:06.719> somewhere<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.409> middle<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:07.950> 40

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
going somewhere in the middle like 40

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.520 
going somewhere in the middle like 40
from<00:02:08.700> there<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.239> increase<00:02:09.629> your<00:02:09.959> tire

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
from there you can increase your tire

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.949 
from there you can increase your tire
pressure<00:02:10.800> if<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.160> want<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.430> have<00:02:11.580> have<00:02:11.970> harder

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
pressure if you want to have have harder

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.820 
pressure if you want to have have harder
tires

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
tires

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.370 
tires
or<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.130> can<00:02:14.310> decrease<00:02:14.700> your<00:02:15.390> tire<00:02:16.110> pressure

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
or you can decrease your tire pressure

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.590 
or you can decrease your tire pressure
if<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.620> want<00:02:16.830> them<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.010> be<00:02:17.130> softer<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:18.420> only

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
if you want them to be softer the only

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.690 
if you want them to be softer the only
thing<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.900> learned<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.470> must<00:02:19.980> warn<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.520> if

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
thing I learned I must warn you of is if

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.940 
thing I learned I must warn you of is if
you<00:02:21.060> do<00:02:21.300> decrease<00:02:22.140> your<00:02:22.170> tire<00:02:22.470> pressure<00:02:22.740> you

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
you do decrease your tire pressure you

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.800 
you do decrease your tire pressure you
do<00:02:23.070> run<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.250> risk<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.610> getting<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.270> painful<00:02:24.660> at

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
do run the risk of getting a painful at

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.720 
do run the risk of getting a painful at
a<00:02:24.840> pinch<00:02:25.110> fly<00:02:25.910> now<00:02:27.230> we'll<00:02:28.230> start<00:02:28.470> with

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
a pinch fly now we'll start with

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.150 
a pinch fly now we'll start with
inflating<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.540> presta<00:02:30.960> valve<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.950> first

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
inflating the presta valve so the first

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.030 
inflating the presta valve so the first
thing<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.460> want<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.700> do<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:33.000> unscrew<00:02:34.040> the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
thing you want to do is unscrew the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.690 
thing you want to do is unscrew the
valve<00:02:36.890> once<00:02:37.890> it's<00:02:38.040> on<00:02:38.100> screwed<00:02:38.400> i<00:02:38.520> always

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
valve once it's on screwed i always

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.580 
valve once it's on screwed i always
recommend<00:02:38.850> just<00:02:39.720> tapping<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.170> valve<00:02:40.320> just<00:02:40.470> a

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
recommend just tapping the valve just a

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.290 
recommend just tapping the valve just a
little<00:02:40.740> bit<00:02:40.830> just<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.070> case<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.430> seized<00:02:41.670> so

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
little bit just in case is seized so

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.900 
little bit just in case is seized so
that<00:02:42.450> you're<00:02:42.630> ready<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.900> go<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:43.560> tap<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.700> valve

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
that you're ready to go so tap the valve

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.530 
that you're ready to go so tap the valve
from<00:02:45.390> there<00:02:47.390> take<00:02:48.390> your<00:02:49.340> your<00:02:50.340> pump<00:02:50.550> head<00:02:50.760> and

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
from there take your your pump head and

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.270 
from there take your your pump head and
make<00:02:51.840> sure<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:52.140> in<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.350> locked<00:02:52.590> in<00:02:52.800> any

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
make sure it's in it locked in any

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.449 
make sure it's in it locked in any
unlocked<00:02:54.620> motion<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.709> majority<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.130> pumps

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
unlocked motion the majority of pumps

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.220 
unlocked motion the majority of pumps
when<00:02:57.000> it's<00:02:57.120> when<00:02:57.330> it's<00:02:57.360> unlocked<00:02:57.870> they're

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
when it's when it's unlocked they're

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.870 
when it's when it's unlocked they're
down<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.890> simply<00:02:59.280> insert<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:01.380> pump<00:03:01.650> head<00:03:01.880> onto

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
down so simply insert the pump head onto

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.449 
down so simply insert the pump head onto
the<00:03:03.209> valve<00:03:03.680> now<00:03:04.680> you'll<00:03:04.800> hear<00:03:04.980> some<00:03:05.160> tightness

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
the valve now you'll hear some tightness

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.949 
the valve now you'll hear some tightness
and<00:03:05.700> pressure<00:03:05.820> come<00:03:06.180> out<00:03:06.300> don't<00:03:06.480> worry<00:03:06.690> you're

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
and pressure come out don't worry you're

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.360 
and pressure come out don't worry you're
going<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.140> be<00:03:07.230> putting<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.680> more<00:03:07.890> air<00:03:08.040> in<00:03:08.130> there

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
going to be putting it more air in there

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.370 
going to be putting it more air in there
anyway<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.000> doesn't<00:03:09.060> really<00:03:09.330> matter<00:03:09.600> from

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
anyway so it doesn't really matter from

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.690 
anyway so it doesn't really matter from
there<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.950> lock<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.670> head<00:03:11.990> and<00:03:13.310> pup<00:03:14.310> isn't<00:03:14.520> as
