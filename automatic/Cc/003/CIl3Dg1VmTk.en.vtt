00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
pretty cool bus powered raid that you

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.910 
pretty cool bus powered raid that you
can<00:00:15.179> basically<00:00:15.450> put<00:00:15.750> two<00:00:15.900> drives<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.500> for<00:00:16.740> some

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
can basically put two drives in for some

can basically put two drives in for some
pretty<00:00:17.039> cool<00:00:17.510> portable<00:00:18.510> storage<00:00:18.869> got<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.560> bunch

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
pretty cool portable storage got a bunch

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.040 
pretty cool portable storage got a bunch
of<00:00:19.890> different<00:00:20.130> configurations<00:00:20.789> both<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.330> 5500

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
of different configurations both in 5500

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.070 
of different configurations both in 5500
rpm<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.650> 7200<00:00:23.369> rpm<00:00:23.730> basically<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.900> drive

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
rpm and 7200 rpm basically the drive

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.830 
rpm and 7200 rpm basically the drive
starts<00:00:25.410> out<00:00:25.590> at<00:00:25.800> about<00:00:26.010> 1<00:00:26.390> 9999<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.750> can

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
starts out at about 1 9999 and you can

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.870 
starts out at about 1 9999 and you can
get<00:00:27.960> various<00:00:28.260> configurations<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.310> grant

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
get various configurations on that grant

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.980 
get various configurations on that grant

bus power so a pretty cool option there
grant<00:01:10.619> again<00:01:10.830> will<00:01:10.979> tell<00:01:11.159> us<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:11.340> more

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
grant again will tell us a little more

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.080 
grant again will tell us a little more
about<00:01:11.549> it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
about it

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.480 
about it
we<00:01:12.630> also<00:01:13.049> different<00:01:13.500> format<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> OWCA

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
we also different format on the OWCA

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.090 
we also different format on the OWCA
side<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.420> things<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:15.900> created<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.409> elite<00:01:16.710> pro

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
side of things we created the elite pro

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.580 
side of things we created the elite pro
dual<00:01:17.430> mini<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.180> has<00:01:18.299> two<00:01:18.659> two<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.140> half<00:01:19.290> inch

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
dual mini it has two two and a half inch

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.130 
dual mini it has two two and a half inch
drives<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.130> as<00:01:20.310> side-by-side<00:01:21.180> configuration

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
drives but as side-by-side configuration

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.289 
drives but as side-by-side configuration
so<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.680> really<00:01:23.009> slips<00:01:23.430> easily<00:01:23.759> into<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
so it really slips easily into a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.390 
so it really slips easily into a
photography<00:01:25.170> gear<00:01:25.380> bag<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:25.890> fact<00:01:26.130> there's

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
photography gear bag and in fact there's

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.039 
photography gear bag and in fact there's
a<00:01:26.460> pretty<00:01:26.939> big<00:01:27.119> announcement<00:01:27.299> coming<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.930> in

the latest revision is a slightly wider
and<00:01:49.560> has<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> little<00:01:50.009> thinner<00:01:50.250> design<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:51.240> this

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
and has a little thinner design so this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.940 
and has a little thinner design so this
is<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.720> match<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.799> this

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
is going to match up with that so this

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.080
