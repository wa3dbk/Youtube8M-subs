the<00:03:09.790> first<00:03:09.940> thing<00:03:10.150> I<00:03:10.240> thought<00:03:10.390> about<00:03:10.630> when

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
the first thing I thought about when

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.060 
the first thing I thought about when
people<00:03:11.350> were<00:03:11.440> talking<00:03:11.620> about<00:03:11.770> bringing

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
people were talking about bringing

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.340 
people were talking about bringing
holding<00:03:12.430> in<00:03:12.550> was<00:03:12.820> was<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.300> anonymous<00:03:13.780> raw<00:03:13.990> GM

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
holding in was was the anonymous raw GM

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.620 
holding in was was the anonymous raw GM
and<00:03:14.770> I<00:03:15.400> thought<00:03:15.820> it<00:03:15.910> would<00:03:16.000> be<00:03:16.060> cool<00:03:16.270> i<00:03:16.330> thought

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
and I thought it would be cool i thought

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.000 
and I thought it would be cool i thought
it'd<00:03:16.720> actually<00:03:16.870> be<00:03:17.050> a<00:03:17.170> funny<00:03:17.470> slap<00:03:17.800> in<00:03:17.980> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
it'd actually be a funny slap in the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.320 
it'd actually be a funny slap in the
face<00:03:18.100> for<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.730> know<00:03:18.820> people<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:19.180> like<00:03:19.300> to

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
face for you know people that like to

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.910 
face for you know people that like to
look<00:03:19.600> into<00:03:19.840> stuff<00:03:19.960> a<00:03:20.140> little<00:03:20.260> bit<00:03:20.440> too<00:03:20.560> much<00:03:20.710> I

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
look into stuff a little bit too much I

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.920 
look into stuff a little bit too much I
I<00:03:21.160> tend<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.760> do<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.240> I<00:03:22.270> like<00:03:22.480> doing<00:03:22.720> that

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
I tend to do that and I like doing that

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.410 
I tend to do that and I like doing that
is<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.740> know<00:03:24.190> just<00:03:24.430> looking<00:03:24.700> into<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.060> angles

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
is you know just looking into the angles

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.490 
is you know just looking into the angles
and<00:03:25.570> taking<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.900> stuff<00:03:26.050> out<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:26.410> really

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
and taking the stuff out that really

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.380 
and taking the stuff out that really
doesn't<00:03:26.740> make<00:03:26.980> sense<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.490> it<00:03:27.550> fully<00:03:27.970> was<00:03:28.210> be

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
doesn't make sense and it fully was be

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.930 
doesn't make sense and it fully was be
anonymous<00:03:28.750> raw<00:03:28.960> GM<00:03:29.260> this<00:03:29.500> goes<00:03:29.710> back<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:29.980> well

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
anonymous raw GM this goes back to well

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.180 
anonymous raw GM this goes back to well
over<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.360> year<00:03:31.450> ago<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:32.260> that's<00:03:32.590> basically

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
over a year ago and that's basically

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.300 
over a year ago and that's basically
when<00:03:33.550> he<00:03:33.610> was<00:03:33.790> TNA<00:03:34.240> champion<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.110> just<00:03:36.100> that

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
when he was TNA champion and just that

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.530 
when he was TNA champion and just that
and<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.520> other<00:03:36.550> and<00:03:36.970> basically<00:03:37.300> it<00:03:37.480> just

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
and the other and basically it just

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.990 
and the other and basically it just
would<00:03:38.200> make<00:03:38.350> it<00:03:38.470> seem<00:03:38.680> like<00:03:38.710> Foley<00:03:39.130> was<00:03:39.250> in<00:03:39.520> TNA

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
would make it seem like Foley was in TNA

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.400 
would make it seem like Foley was in TNA
and<00:03:40.240> he<00:03:40.300> was<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.630> champion<00:03:40.840> but<00:03:41.200> he<00:03:41.290> was

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
and he was the champion but he was

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.020 
and he was the champion but he was
watching<00:03:41.590> raw<00:03:41.950> watching<00:03:42.490> the<00:03:42.550> pay<00:03:42.640> per<00:03:42.700> views

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
watching raw watching the pay per views

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.090 
watching raw watching the pay per views
and<00:03:43.180> he<00:03:43.240> felt<00:03:43.450> like<00:03:43.600> that<00:03:43.750> was<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:43.960> bigger<00:03:44.830> thing

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
and he felt like that was a bigger thing

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.340 
and he felt like that was a bigger thing
to<00:03:45.190> do<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.490> take<00:03:45.670> this<00:03:45.790> job<00:03:46.030> for<00:03:46.480> mr.<00:03:46.870> McMahon

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
to do to take this job for mr. McMahon

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.010 
to do to take this job for mr. McMahon
and<00:03:48.210> sometimes<00:03:49.210> it's<00:03:49.360> fun<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.540> break<00:03:49.810> stuff

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
and sometimes it's fun to break stuff

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.510 
and sometimes it's fun to break stuff
that<00:03:50.200> down<00:03:50.440> like<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.040> just<00:03:51.190> be<00:03:51.310> funny
