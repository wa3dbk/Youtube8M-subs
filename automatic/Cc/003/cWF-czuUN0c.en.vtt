00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.159
 I am currently in Brandenburg in the former GDR 

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:16.886
 in Jüterbog, there is a beautiful kart track on the site of an old military airfield of the Russians 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.088
 You can see him here in the background, this is the hangar of the military airfield. 

00:00:23.382 --> 00:00:30.488
 And there is, as I said, this kart track and here we do a kart race which takes a total of 99 hours 

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:33.599
 And that would be the longest kart race in history 

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:36.312
 and that would be a world record accordingly 

00:00:36.312 --> 00:00:43.027
 I am in a team and show you something about the environment, the team and the kart race 

00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:15.117
 Dave, tell 'how it looks so far? 

00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:20.127
 Yes, Pät crossed the track very fast, overtook everyone 

00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:24.731
 is left and right past the opponents, forward and backward! 

00:01:25.798 --> 00:01:26.866
 Has given everything, I'm proud of you! 

00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:29.768
 Very nice, and how is the team, so far? 

00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:32.648
 Yes, just as fast! 

00:01:34.296 --> 00:01:35.065
 this means? 

00:01:36.502 --> 00:01:39.010
 We are just as fast as we are tired 

00:01:40.814 --> 00:01:44.580
 No, it works fine, if it stays dry we are satisfied 

00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:48.300
 , 

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:55.610
 By the way, here in Jüterbog with me is Marc Lynn, the bass player of "Gotthard" (www.gotthard.com). 

00:01:56.053 --> 00:02:02.580
 He is in the same team as me and we ride the 99 hours together and have a lot of fun 

00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:05.300
 Marc: Shit, shit! Pät: Tell me, what happened? 

00:02:06.698 --> 00:02:11.800
 I drive out to refuel, brake and there is a slippery surface and I'm just past the tank 

00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:15.020
 I actually thought I'd go to the bistro to order a coffee 

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:19.830
 Then they pushed me back 

00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:26.450
 "Hey, what are you doing" and me: "yes what are you doing" ... other floor, it was pointless, but you ... 

00:02:26.448 --> 00:02:27.460
 we could still refuel. 

00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:34.900
 unfortunately not really .... 

00:02:35.783 --> 00:02:36.550
 How is the well-being? 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.550
 Yes, not bad, a little tired 

00:02:38.546 --> 00:02:39.960
 But you gave everything? 

00:02:39.962 --> 00:02:42.170
 Yes, definitely! 

00:02:57.308 --> 00:03:00.400
 I'll take you to our hospitality tent 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.720
 This is where there is always something to eat and drink 

00:03:05.061 --> 00:03:06.060
 For us and our possible guests 

00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:11.910
 HInter me you already see the Swiss cross, that's exactly where we go now. 

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:30.590
 The most important thing of course: the fridge 

00:03:38.012 --> 00:03:40.960
 Look, you have to open it with remote control 

00:03:47.693 --> 00:03:49.750
 There is nothing in it for Pät! 

00:03:52.325 --> 00:03:54.870
 You see, the most important thing in this fridge is ... 

00:03:54.872 --> 00:03:56.680
 Right: the beer! 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:02.930
 Two of our super drivers! 

00:04:04.553 --> 00:04:06.550
 would you like to say something? Mutzi 

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:07.060
 Speechless! 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.040
 Hans? 

00:04:08.036 --> 00:04:11.500
 Yes, we are not bad, especially for Pät ​​we are doing very well! 

00:04:12.494 --> 00:04:13.280
 Schleimer! 

00:04:16.929 --> 00:04:20.880
 But the Pät will now organize beer for the fridge! 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.050
 It's like this: In our apartment we have beer but the others do not know that! 

00:04:27.262 --> 00:04:29.750
 In that case we go to Pät in the apartment! 

00:04:32.947 --> 00:04:34.390
 Miri: I'll be at 1000 soon, did you shoot your photo soon? 

00:04:36.387 --> 00:04:41.430
 Pät: No! You have to go on! 

00:04:49.948 --> 00:04:53.500
 Dani, as you can see you drove in the rain for a good hour, how did you like it? 

00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:55.840
 It was a wet thing ... 

00:04:57.494 --> 00:05:00.910
 Wet and slippery! Mario: But you look great in the case! Dani: It was wet and slippery 

00:05:01.697 --> 00:05:07.460
 And what do you say to that you only lost 10 seconds on those who rode with rain tires 

00:05:07.455 --> 00:05:09.800
 unlike you, who drove with slicks? 

00:05:09.801 --> 00:05:14.470
 Of course, while driving, it was stupid, it has overtaken you everything, I thought, someday I should also change 

00:05:14.468 --> 00:05:20.040
 but we held out and could catch up a bit 

00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:22.660
 Let's see what comes out 

00:05:22.664 --> 00:05:26.080
 Too bad we have a fine cashed when driving in, that's a shame 

00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:35.480
 Marc shows our driver Claudio that he already drove 60 minutes 

00:05:35.482 --> 00:05:38.480
 and therefore has 60 more minutes to drive! 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:54.430
 With light! 

00:06:06.945 --> 00:06:08.380
 It goes into the last night 

00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:13.050
 I do not know, we already have 4 nights behind us 

00:06:13.052 --> 00:06:16.230
 and I'm actually done with driving. 

00:06:16.233 --> 00:06:20.160
 Now my job is to put out the pits and stuff like that 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.480
 and then that's just the last night here 

00:06:23.478 --> 00:06:28.610
 and then we are done with this world record 

00:06:28.609 --> 00:06:35.130
 and are all holders of a world record, the longest kart race in history 

00:06:35.134 --> 00:06:37.740
 99 hours we will have driven by then 

00:06:37.735 --> 00:06:43.660
 and there is supposed to be a sequel, meaning a night race of 111 or 130 hours 

00:06:37.735 --> 00:06:43.660
 and there is supposed to be a sequel, meaning a night race of 111 or 130 hours 

00:06:44.933 --> 00:06:45.580
 and you never know, maybe I'll be back. 

00:06:47.487 --> 00:06:48.650
 Here it goes even further with a night 

00:06:48.648 --> 00:06:53.150
 I'll take a few more pictures, as these karts badly lit. 

00:06:53.153 --> 00:06:58.190
 both the karts and the track badly lit ... 

00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:00.350
 rumblochen 

00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:01.950
 that makes a lot of fun in the night to drive! 

00:07:42.953 --> 00:07:48.570
