and<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:30.180> move<00:01:30.329> out<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> push

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
and then you just move out of the push

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.039 
and then you just move out of the push
that<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.740> gives<00:01:32.100> now<00:01:33.060> I'd<00:01:33.270> say<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:33.689> best<00:01:33.840> for

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
that it gives now I'd say it's best for

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.630 
that it gives now I'd say it's best for
defending<00:01:34.799> up<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:35.100> if<00:01:35.189> you're<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.490> a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
defending up here if you're just a

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.219 
defending up here if you're just a
one-man<00:01:35.850> army<00:01:36.240> probably<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.869> good<00:01:37.049> if<00:01:37.140> you

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
one-man army probably not good if you

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.530 
one-man army probably not good if you
have<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:37.500> 15<00:01:37.860> players<00:01:38.100> up<00:01:38.369> here<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
have like 15 players up here so the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.810 
have like 15 players up here so the
offshore<00:01:40.110> house<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> very<00:01:41.070> awesome<00:01:41.369> place

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
offshore house is a very awesome place

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.550 
offshore house is a very awesome place
to<00:01:41.939> defend<00:01:42.060> as<00:01:42.360> well<00:01:42.390> because<00:01:43.140> there's<00:01:43.350> more

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
to defend as well because there's more

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.080 
to defend as well because there's more
room<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.310> look<00:01:44.460> around<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.939> there's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
room to really look around and there's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.090 
room to really look around and there's
an<00:01:45.270> attic<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.780> kind<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.110> stay<00:01:46.320> back<00:01:46.530> behind<00:01:46.740> if

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
an attic to kind of stay back behind if

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.429 
an attic to kind of stay back behind if
you<00:01:47.189> wish<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.299> when<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> ran<00:01:48.869> them<00:01:49.110> when<00:01:49.409> I

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
you wish so so when I ran them when I

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.350 
you wish so so when I ran them when I
was<00:01:49.649> running<00:01:49.860> low<00:01:50.040> on<00:01:50.189> my<00:01:50.369> budget<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.939> decided

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
was running low on my budget I decided

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.179 
was running low on my budget I decided
to<00:01:51.509> make<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.810> house<00:01:51.990> look<00:01:52.259> really<00:01:52.770> damaged

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
to make this house look really damaged

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.590 
to make this house look really damaged
and<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.490> kind<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.790> worked<00:01:54.000> because<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> didn't

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and it kind of worked because I didn't

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.179 
and it kind of worked because I didn't
really<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.930> too<00:01:55.320> many<00:01:55.409> pieces<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:56.009> make<00:01:56.130> it

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
really have too many pieces to make it

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.399 
really have too many pieces to make it
look<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.490> nice<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.270> suppose<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:58.140> could<00:01:58.380> have

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
look that nice I suppose I could have

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.620 
look that nice I suppose I could have
but<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.009> really<00:01:59.310> do<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.729> fill<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.149> doesn't

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
but I really do like the fill it doesn't

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.300 
but I really do like the fill it doesn't
really<00:02:00.719> make<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:00.990> feel<00:02:01.140> cozy<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.040> kind<00:02:02.250> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
really make you feel cozy but it kind of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.789 
really make you feel cozy but it kind of
does<00:02:02.490> there's<00:02:03.360> also<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.899> secret<00:02:04.380> way<00:02:04.530> in

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
does there's also this secret way in

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.350 
does there's also this secret way in
because<00:02:05.189> it's<00:02:05.340> kind<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.670> overpowered<00:02:06.240> with

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
because it's kind of overpowered with

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.419 
because it's kind of overpowered with
the<00:02:06.479> die<00:02:06.659> just<00:02:06.960> being<00:02:07.170> too<00:02:07.380> uh<00:02:07.409> placed<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
the die just being too uh placed in and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.639 
the die just being too uh placed in and
on<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.119> updated<00:02:09.539> version<00:02:09.660> there's<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.410> little

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
on the updated version there's a little

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.199 
on the updated version there's a little
bit<00:02:10.739> easier<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.099> drop<00:02:11.370> down<00:02:11.580> there<00:02:11.760> if<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.030> are

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
bit easier to drop down there if you are

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.530 
bit easier to drop down there if you are
the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.880 
the
and<00:02:12.780> that's<00:02:12.900> something<00:02:13.170> he<00:02:13.230> just<00:02:13.260> kind<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.590> got

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and that's something he just kind of got

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.140 
and that's something he just kind of got
to<00:02:14.010> figure<00:02:14.250> out<00:02:14.370> when<00:02:14.489> you<00:02:14.580> get<00:02:14.730> real

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
to figure out when you get real

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.539 
to figure out when you get real
desperate<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.840> time<00:02:16.110> comes<00:02:16.409> down<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:16.980> I

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
desperate and time comes down to the I

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.199 
desperate and time comes down to the I
guess<00:02:18.060> zero<00:02:18.360> seconds<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.860> begin<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.849> jump

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
guess zero seconds and you begin to jump

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.300 
guess zero seconds and you begin to jump
around<00:02:21.569> this<00:02:21.750> little<00:02:21.989> house<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.530> try<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.769> find

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
around this little house and try to find

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.220 
around this little house and try to find
ways<00:02:23.489> in<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.939> that<00:02:24.540> was<00:02:24.659> actually<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.019> way<00:02:25.200> I

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
ways in and that was actually a way I

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.990 
ways in and that was actually a way I
found<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.739> it<00:02:25.769> wasn't<00:02:26.159> purposed<00:02:26.640> like<00:02:26.819> that

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
found in it wasn't purposed like that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.869 
found in it wasn't purposed like that
but<00:02:27.269> now<00:02:27.599> it<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.769> yes<00:02:28.980> just<00:02:29.190> watch<00:02:29.489> out<00:02:29.730> for

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
but now it is so yes just watch out for

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.550 
but now it is so yes just watch out for
that<00:02:29.970> little<00:02:30.150> open<00:02:30.540> spot<00:02:30.810> right<00:02:30.959> here<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.409> of

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
that little open spot right here and of

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.520 
that little open spot right here and of
course<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.920> dye<00:02:32.190> entrance<00:02:33.019> but<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:34.200> came<00:02:34.379> in

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
course the dye entrance but it came in

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.990 
course the dye entrance but it came in
handy<00:02:34.650> because<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:35.159> open<00:02:35.400> part<00:02:35.610> here<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:35.879> an

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
handy because the open part here is an

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.449 
handy because the open part here is an
alternate<00:02:36.390> way<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.930> floor<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:37.530> enter<00:02:37.920> see<00:02:38.340> me

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
alternate way the floor can enter see me

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.890 
alternate way the floor can enter see me

middle<00:02:53.489> of<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.670> map<00:02:53.849> is<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.299> most<00:02:54.480> abstract

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
middle of the map is the most abstract

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.809 
middle of the map is the most abstract
place<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.379> survive<00:02:55.650> though<00:02:55.920> seeming<00:02:56.639> you're

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
place to survive though seeming you're

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.670 
place to survive though seeming you're
exposed<00:02:57.299> at<00:02:57.540> much<00:02:57.780> room<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.170> shoot<00:02:58.379> and<00:02:58.620> the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
exposed at much room to shoot and the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.440 
exposed at much room to shoot and the
zombies<00:02:58.980> have<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.190> few<00:02:59.459> places<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.909> reach<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.389> a

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
zombies have a few places to reach you a

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.449 
zombies have a few places to reach you a
few<00:03:00.629> paths<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.440> jump<00:03:01.709> as<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:01.859> man<00:03:02.129> cannon

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
few paths to jump as the man cannon

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.000 
few paths to jump as the man cannon
right<00:03:02.549> here<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.750> jump<00:03:03.959> up<00:03:04.079> here<00:03:04.260> has<00:03:04.500> you

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
right here just jump up here has you

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.649 
right here just jump up here has you
know<00:03:05.129> actually<00:03:05.549> if<00:03:05.639> you<00:03:05.760> jump<00:03:06.239> up<00:03:06.359> here<00:03:06.569> it

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
know actually if you jump up here it

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.539 
know actually if you jump up here it
doesn't<00:03:06.870> really<00:03:06.989> work<00:03:07.290> if<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.680> are<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:08.190> if

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
doesn't really work if you are the if

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.759 
doesn't really work if you are the if
you're<00:03:08.730> using<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.180> default<00:03:09.989> flood<00:03:10.319> game<00:03:10.560> type

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
you're using the default flood game type

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.410 
you're using the default flood game type
because<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.159> jump<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:11.849> too<00:03:12.030> high<00:03:12.209> it<00:03:12.269> just

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
because the jump is too high it just

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.819 
because the jump is too high it just
makes<00:03:12.659> you<00:03:12.780> hit<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.079> ceiling<00:03:13.409> to<00:03:13.500> fall<00:03:13.650> back

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
makes you hit the ceiling to fall back

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.250 
makes you hit the ceiling to fall back
down<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.790> would<00:03:15.090> say<00:03:15.299> that's<00:03:15.510> kind<00:03:15.959> of<00:03:16.049> a

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
down so I would say that's kind of a

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.379 
down so I would say that's kind of a
bonus<00:03:16.739> if<00:03:17.129> you<00:03:17.160> have<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.639> custom<00:03:18.000> game<00:03:18.150> type

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
bonus if you have the custom game type

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.360 
bonus if you have the custom game type
with<00:03:18.569> you<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:19.349> can<00:03:19.620> use<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.190> it's<00:03:20.280> a

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
with you you can use this and it's a

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.069 
with you you can use this and it's a
little<00:03:20.609> bit<00:03:20.760> easier<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.449> more<00:03:21.569> fun<00:03:21.810> for<00:03:21.840> the

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
little bit easier and more fun for the

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.920 
little bit easier and more fun for the
zombies<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:24.209> yes<00:03:24.419> it's<00:03:24.599> actually<00:03:24.690> a

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
zombies and so yes it's actually a

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.659 
zombies and so yes it's actually a
really<00:03:25.199> good<00:03:25.349> place<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.829> cover<00:03:26.069> your<00:03:26.280> friends

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
really good place to cover your friends

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.909 
really good place to cover your friends
and<00:03:26.879> other<00:03:27.209> surviving<00:03:27.750> locations<00:03:28.290> though

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
and other surviving locations though

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.439 
and other surviving locations though
when<00:03:29.160> you're<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.459> zombie<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:29.879> spawn<00:03:30.209> in<00:03:30.239> this

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
when you're the zombie you spawn in this

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.449 
when you're the zombie you spawn in this
room<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:30.989> enter<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.440> teleporter<00:03:32.010> which

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
room and you enter this teleporter which

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.220 
room and you enter this teleporter which
makes<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.910> closer<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.569> water<00:03:33.870> killing

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
makes you closer to the water killing

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.409 
makes you closer to the water killing
you<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.709> basically<00:03:35.430> what<00:03:35.699> this<00:03:35.849> does<00:03:35.910> that<00:03:36.329> it

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
you and basically what this does that it

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.110 
you and basically what this does that it
kills<00:03:36.930> about<00:03:37.109> a<00:03:37.230> 10<00:03:37.650> seconds<00:03:38.069> or<00:03:38.190> so<00:03:38.220> about<00:03:38.669> 15

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
kills about a 10 seconds or so about 15

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.960 
kills about a 10 seconds or so about 15
seconds<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.599> that's<00:03:40.470> for<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:40.919> humans<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.609> go

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
seconds and that's for the humans to go

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.509 
seconds and that's for the humans to go
find<00:03:42.299> their<00:03:42.510> spa<00:03:42.750> give<00:03:43.019> them<00:03:43.199> time<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.519> find

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
find their spa give them time to find

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.490 
find their spa give them time to find
their<00:03:44.730> their<00:03:45.299> good<00:03:45.449> location<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:45.989> survive<00:03:46.260> and

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
their their good location to survive and

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.689 
their their good location to survive and
make<00:03:46.590> up<00:03:46.680> their<00:03:46.829> mindset<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.340> get<00:03:47.579> their

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
make up their mindset and get their

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.819 
make up their mindset and get their
groups<00:03:47.970> together<00:03:48.269> later<00:03:49.049> on<00:03:49.139> might<00:03:49.560> come<00:03:49.739> out

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
groups together later on might come out

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.589 
groups together later on might come out
with<00:03:49.949> a<00:03:49.980> better<00:03:50.310> substitute<00:03:50.940> for<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.269> if<00:03:51.510> you

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
with a better substitute for this if you

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.210
