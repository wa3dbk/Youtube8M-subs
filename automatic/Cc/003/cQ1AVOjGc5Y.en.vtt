 Calamardo... 

00:00:43.998 --> 00:00:46.078

 I personally do not want to be stuck here all eternity. 

00:01:05.517 --> 00:01:09.590
 Eternity is a very long time, you understand! 

00:01:09.948 --> 00:01:13.397

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.186
 Oh I'm sorry! 

00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:39.031

00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:41.418
 Did you want chewing gum? 

00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:44.992
 Well, if we are going to be here forever ... 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.668

00:01:52.537 --> 00:01:54.942
 Come on, Mr. Dutch, let us out! 

00:01:55.343 --> 00:01:56.233
 Do not be so bad! 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.807
