we're<00:00:10.980> going<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.219> be<00:00:11.340> demonstrating<00:00:11.490> how<00:00:12.420> to

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
we're going to be demonstrating how to

of<00:00:45.960> things<00:00:46.200> then<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:46.980> want<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.219> go<00:00:47.340> back<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.850> do

our transient throttle enrichment that

our transient throttle enrichment that
is<00:00:50.640> our<00:00:50.760> final<00:00:51.030> pumps<00:00:51.649> what<00:00:52.649> happens<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.129> when

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
is our final pumps what happens is when

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.160 
is our final pumps what happens is when
we<00:00:53.460> stay<00:00:53.699> about<00:00:53.850> swaddle<00:00:54.239> swaddle<00:00:54.780> opens<00:00:55.050> very

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
we stay about swaddle swaddle opens very

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.560 
we stay about swaddle swaddle opens very
quickly<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.070> air<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.760> moves<00:00:57.000> very<00:00:57.120> fast

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
quickly and the air it moves very fast

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.930 
quickly and the air it moves very fast
because<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:57.989> very<00:00:58.079> light<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.890> fuel<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.879> a

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
because it's very light the fuel is a

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.060 
because it's very light the fuel is a
lot<00:01:00.180> heavier<00:01:00.510> than<00:01:00.719> air<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.379> takes<00:01:01.920> some

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
lot heavier than air so it takes some

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.460 
lot heavier than air so it takes some
time<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.280> catch<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.969> what<00:01:03.359> happens<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.930> we

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
time to catch up so what happens is we

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.920 
time to catch up so what happens is we
stab<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> throttle<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.760> get<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.090> lean<00:01:06.570> spot

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
stab the throttle and we get a lean spot

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.320 
stab the throttle and we get a lean spot
that<00:01:07.590> causes<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> engine<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.369> stumble<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that causes the engine to stumble to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.090 
that causes the engine to stumble to
prevent<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.720> from<00:01:09.840> happening<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:10.950> what

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
prevent this from happening we do what

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.700 
prevent this from happening we do what
we<00:01:11.189> call<00:01:11.400> throttle<00:01:12.119> pumps<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:13.260> when<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.500> stab

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
we call throttle pumps so when we stab

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.469 
we call throttle pumps so when we stab
the<00:01:13.860> throttle<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.369> fuel<00:01:14.760> injectors<00:01:15.210> they

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the throttle the fuel injectors they

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.600 
the throttle the fuel injectors they
inject<00:01:15.780> some<00:01:15.930> extra<00:01:16.350> fuel<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:17.100> keep<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.460> with

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
inject some extra fuel to keep up with

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.539 
inject some extra fuel to keep up with
that<00:01:17.700> extra<00:01:17.880> air<00:01:18.380> how<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.439> tune<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.950> well

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
that extra air how to tune this well

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.429 
that extra air how to tune this well
it's<00:01:21.000> actually<00:01:21.119> quite<00:01:21.540> simple<00:01:21.840> what<00:01:22.110> we<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.320> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
it's actually quite simple what we do is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.410 
it's actually quite simple what we do is
we<00:01:22.560> go<00:01:22.680> into<00:01:22.890> our<00:01:22.950> how<00:01:23.159> tech<00:01:23.400> software<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:24.270> go

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
we go into our how tech software we go

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.410 
we go into our how tech software we go
to<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> transient<00:01:25.229> throttle<00:01:25.619> setup<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.420> we

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
to the transient throttle setup and we

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.780 
to the transient throttle setup and we
adjust<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.900> maps<00:01:28.140> until<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:29.310> engine<00:01:29.579> runs

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
adjust the maps until the engine runs

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.630 
adjust the maps until the engine runs
smoothly

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.789 

so<00:01:38.640> too<00:01:38.700> little<00:01:39.119> fuel<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.750> we'll<00:01:40.649> get<00:01:40.740> a

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
so too little fuel and we'll get a

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.770 
so too little fuel and we'll get a
misfire<00:01:41.280> immediately<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.420> stab<00:01:42.630> this

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
misfire immediately as we stab this

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:54.530 
misfire immediately as we stab this
funnel

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.130 

too<00:01:55.440> much<00:01:55.680> fuel<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.400> the<00:01:57.390> engine<00:01:57.720> will<00:01:57.870> bog

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
too much fuel and the engine will bog

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:10.890 
too much fuel and the engine will bog
down<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.740> rev<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:59.040> very<00:01:59.280> slowly

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.320 

now<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.959> idea<00:02:12.349> is<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:13.099> have<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.430> engine<00:02:13.730> rev

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
now the idea is to have the engine rev

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.050 
now the idea is to have the engine rev
crisply<00:02:15.050> when<00:02:15.530> we<00:02:15.709> stab<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.489> accelerator

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
crisply when we stab the accelerator

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:27.309 
crisply when we stab the accelerator
