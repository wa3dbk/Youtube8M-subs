the next years and keep on adding this

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.250 
the next years and keep on adding this
is<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.590> strategy<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:04.400> helped<00:03:04.970> me<00:03:05.210> build<00:03:05.900> two

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
is the strategy that helped me build two

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.710 
is the strategy that helped me build two
separate<00:03:06.710> multi-million<00:03:07.550> dollar<00:03:07.730> companies

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
separate multi-million dollar companies

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.390 
separate multi-million dollar companies
when<00:03:08.900> we<00:03:09.050> started<00:03:09.410> when<00:03:09.740> I<00:03:09.800> started<00:03:10.070> applying

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
when we started when I started applying

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.430 
when we started when I started applying
it<00:03:10.670> myself<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.330> then<00:03:11.690> starting<00:03:12.050> to<00:03:12.170> teach

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
it myself and then starting to teach

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.930 
it myself and then starting to teach
other<00:03:12.710> people<00:03:12.800> to<00:03:13.130> do<00:03:13.280> exactly<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.910> same

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
other people to do exactly the same

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.510 
other people to do exactly the same
thing<00:03:14.120> we<00:03:14.870> produced<00:03:15.230> tremendous<00:03:15.980> success<00:03:16.310> why

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
thing we produced tremendous success why

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.060 
thing we produced tremendous success why
cuz<00:03:17.000> we're<00:03:17.210> talking<00:03:17.510> about<00:03:17.600> coffee<00:03:17.990> tea<00:03:18.590> hot

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
cuz we're talking about coffee tea hot

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.040 
cuz we're talking about coffee tea hot
chocolate<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:19.670> mocha<00:03:19.940> this<00:03:20.480> is<00:03:20.630> not<00:03:20.780> rocket

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
chocolate and mocha this is not rocket

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.770 
chocolate and mocha this is not rocket
science<00:03:21.620> it's<00:03:22.100> simple<00:03:22.670> so<00:03:23.210> what<00:03:23.390> was<00:03:23.540> step<00:03:23.750> one

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
science it's simple so what was step one

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.380 
science it's simple so what was step one
that<00:03:24.140> we<00:03:24.230> just<00:03:24.350> talked<00:03:24.590> about<00:03:24.790> step<00:03:25.790> one<00:03:25.820> was

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
that we just talked about step one was

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.300 
that we just talked about step one was
what<00:03:26.630> become<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.320> product<00:03:27.710> of<00:03:27.740> the<00:03:27.830> product<00:03:28.040> and

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
what become a product of the product and

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.760 
what become a product of the product and
now<00:03:28.700> step<00:03:29.030> two<00:03:29.060> is<00:03:29.390> you<00:03:29.540> make<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:29.960> contact<00:03:30.500> list

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
now step two is you make it contact list

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.250 
now step two is you make it contact list
you<00:03:30.920> stop<00:03:31.190> everything<00:03:31.610> right<00:03:31.910> now<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.330> start

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
you stop everything right now and start

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.280 
you stop everything right now and start
that<00:03:33.560> contact<00:03:34.040> list<00:03:34.280> ASAP<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:35.840> is<00:03:36.020> your<00:03:36.170> way

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
that contact list ASAP this is your way

tired of being sick and tired this is

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.730 
tired of being sick and tired this is
the<00:03:40.820> way<00:03:40.910> out<00:03:41.060> make<00:03:41.600> that<00:03:41.810> contact<00:03:42.230> list<00:03:42.500> meet

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
so that's step number two go on to the

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.320 
so that's step number two go on to the
next<00:04:00.290> video<00:04:00.590> number<00:04:00.770> three<00:04:01.280> what<00:04:01.880> is<00:04:02.030> what<00:04:02.300> is

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
next video number three what is what is

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.610 
next video number three what is what is
step<00:04:02.570> number<00:04:02.600> three<00:04:03.020> when<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.230> talked<00:04:03.530> about

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
step number three when I talked about

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.640 
step number three when I talked about
the<00:04:03.860> power<00:04:04.100> of<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.490> cjm<00:04:05.330> ok<00:04:06.080> the<00:04:06.230> power<00:04:06.440> of<00:04:06.590> the

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
the power of the cjm ok the power of the

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.400 
the power of the cjm ok the power of the
cjm<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.430> step<00:04:07.700> three<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:08.930> how<00:04:09.050> we<00:04:09.110> did<00:04:09.380> it

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
cjm and step three this is how we did it

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.080 
cjm and step three this is how we did it
this<00:04:09.710> is<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.070> this<00:04:10.310> is<00:04:10.370> about<00:04:10.610> as<00:04:10.760> complicated

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
this is the this is about as complicated

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.150 
this is the this is about as complicated
as<00:04:11.660> it's<00:04:11.810> going<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:11.960> get<00:04:12.140> click<00:04:12.740> on<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:12.920> next
