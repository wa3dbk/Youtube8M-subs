00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
so it will tell you actual street names

reality of you coming up here
as<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.110> said<00:02:35.170> there's<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.500> bluetooth-enabled

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920

as I said there's a bluetooth-enabled
versions<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.760> mean<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.450> can<00:02:38.260> actually

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
versions that I mean so you can actually

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.200 
versions that I mean so you can actually
switch<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.010> phone<00:02:39.220> mode<00:02:39.490> where<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:39.850> can<00:02:39.940> use

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
switch to a phone mode where you can use

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.040 

in<00:02:57.870> reality<00:02:58.830> so<00:02:59.580> it's<00:02:59.909> not<00:03:00.300> giving<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.629> specific

you see here is the actual number of

the<00:03:12.090> left-hand<00:03:12.629> side

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170

the left-hand side
this<00:03:15.170> image<00:03:15.470> will<00:03:15.709> essentially<00:03:16.010> persist

this image will essentially persist

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.050 
this image will essentially persist
until<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:17.900> passed<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.980> signs<00:03:19.489> until<00:03:19.880> you

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
until you passed the signs until you

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.550 
until you passed the signs until you
leave<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.239> science<00:03:20.599> behind<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:21.110> so<00:03:21.319> this

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
leave the science behind you so this

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.010 
leave the science behind you so this
looks<00:03:21.739> static<00:03:22.130> now<00:03:22.310> in<00:03:22.520> a<00:03:22.640> in<00:03:23.569> this<00:03:23.750> sort<00:03:23.989> of

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
looks static now in a in this sort of

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.120 
looks static now in a in this sort of
environment<00:03:24.459> but<00:03:25.459> it's<00:03:25.790> actually<00:03:26.300> a

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
environment but it's actually a

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.059

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
more dynamic environment you also see

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.120 
more dynamic environment you also see
here's<00:03:33.019> a<00:03:33.080> speed<00:03:33.349> limit<00:03:33.440> so<00:03:33.769> this<00:03:33.920> is<00:03:34.040> the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
here's a speed limit so this is the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.000 
here's a speed limit so this is the
