00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.629
 we baked with you chocolate sponge cake 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:16.419
 now is the time to make cream for it 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.970
 and chocolate glaze let's start with the glaze 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:22.900
 because she needs to cool for glaze 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.390
 we 'll take a pack of 250 grams of cream somewhere 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.270
 200 grams of dark chocolate we have it 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.270
 crushed and 50 grams of butter 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.350
 cream we need to warm up 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.690
 almost to the boil when the first go 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.860
 we will remove the bulls from the heat and 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.660
 and we'll melt the chocolate cream there 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.989
 we began to boil we immediately 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:54.460
 remove from heat and add chocolate here 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:58.810
 and stir until dissolved 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.640
 chocolate I want to immediately say that 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.980
 the proportions are very 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.199
 relative everything depends on your 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.030
 taste who more chocolate loves who does not 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.549
 depends on it you can 100 grams 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.850
 add chocolate can add 200 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.610
 250 can brown chocolate in the sense 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.310
 dairy can add black me 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.850
 just a fan of dark chocolate therefore 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.360
 I add quite a lot about 200 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.920
 gram black chocolate 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.710
 the mass must be absolutely absolutely 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.000
 to become smooth in general, chocolate loves 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:37.060
 to his long imasheva Do 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.070
 right silky mass becomes after all 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:45.549
 here we add the last step oil 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.560
 the oil should also melt in principle 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.720
 it certainly will melt away without our help 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.299
 Well , we repeat chocolate very much 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.330
 so you hung so rolls 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:02:01.799
 magician oil and interfere and our frosting 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.799
 our oil will be ready melted 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.630
 chocolate has become glossy like 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.220
 silky his transfused mold 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.180
 separate and let cool because 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.580
 hot course cake is not worth it 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.830
 the next step is to make a cream for 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.480
 chocolate sponge cake since sponge cake 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.490
 I emphasize chocolate again 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.320
 do white cream on contrast it will 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.470
 more beautiful for the cream we take the cheese on 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.620
 smartphone and 500 grams a pack of 100 grams 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.310
 powdered sugar and grams 300 milliliters 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:37.640
 300 whipping cream 38 percent 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.450
 for starters, we cream is not a full pack 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.180
 set to whip 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.700
 the cream must be cold 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.140
 while mascarpone cheese should 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.140
 be room temperature 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:57.110
 as long as the cream sticks we will 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.230
 fray through 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:04.110
 really fray sense spatula 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.850
 powdered sugar just until uniform 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.150
 a little bit of icing sugar add 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.150
 cream 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.430
 cream began to keep drawing master key 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.400
 interrupt them do not need now we need 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.840
 combine cream from and at the same time them too 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.150
 shuffle as they can 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.990
 you can't just beat them 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.990
 I mix 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.389
 our mascarpone cream with ready and squid 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.489
 cream and icing we can ready 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.789
 start assembling cake cake we 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.110
 cut into 3 cakes 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.970
 here we did the prescription where 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.800
 used butter therefore 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:33.310
 separate impregnations for this cake are not 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.310
 required immediately you can put straight 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:47.559
 we lay cherries a little sunken 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:50.479
 Naturally cherry I took frozen 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:57.050
 just it will melt there and a little bit 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:59.449
 soak the cake in general combination 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.680
 chocolate with cherry cream cream this 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.680
 practically classic 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.780
 we cover with the next cake and repeat 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.659
 all the same 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.659
 slightly press and again cream and cherry 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.039
 we cover with the last shortcake 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.539
 which we had below that is the bottom 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.970
 our biscuit because it is more 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.949
 smooth and smooth it is better to leave it on top 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.340
 it was convenient to pour icing on it 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:49.710
 we have to cover this cake with icing 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.870
 our glaze has cooled down a little 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.069
 case they are hot i'm not at all 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.069
 worrying pour out 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.809
 In this form, we take about ten minutes 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:08.279
 then shift the refrigerator to another 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:11.699
 plate and decorate 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:13.379
 we froze the eye in just enough 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.749
 that we were able to shift the cake and 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:24.719
 the last step is to try it 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:29.839
 I decorate from from the post made of 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:29.839
 mastic made numbers and want to make 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:37.610
 cake like he is to the new year 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.610
 can someone come in handy such an idea
