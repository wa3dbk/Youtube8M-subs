00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 very good to all of us today we are going to make a 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.130
 video of making a team with 40,000 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.660
 coins 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.700
 is going to be the russian league is going to be a team 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.730
 with a lot of rhythm and good 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.940
 let's start at the goal we're going to 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.090
 have the best goalkeeper in the pink league 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.470
 although the report has already left but 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.840
 good 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.940
 this is still good 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.940
 well the centers are going to have 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:36.110
 abbott changing rhythm 76 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.300
 and I like more 76 pace 79 defense and 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.960
 80 pitch another central that we're going to 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.960
 be older 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.750
 the juice with this that seems pretty 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.880
 good very good 77 rhythms 78 defense and 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.460
 73 headboard 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.969
 we 've got it for 350 coins or 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.550
 be that 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.420
 I do not know if not the same person 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.140
 on the right we're going to have 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.619
 Yuko 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.180
 78 of rhythms 79 phase 74 of beam dribling 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.870
 74 defense 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.460
 it cost me 950 meters and good for the 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.520
 left 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.310
 we're going to have 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.480
 it's grown pretty good I've 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.760
 achieved by 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.990
 3800 coins and it's pretty good the 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.689
 training is a 4-2-2-2 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.119
 gives you depth plus four defenses 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.159
 two midfielders you can reach 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.159
 the theory of defense and the two 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.050
 extremes have been extreme 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.640
 Offensive midfielder as he leads 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.980
 that was going pretty well for the one here 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.260
 they also serve you if they are quick to 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.490
 defender or left center midfielder 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.120
 offensive on the left we're going to have 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.840
 to Carlos Eduardo and 83 rhythm 74 shots 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.920
 to 18 points 87 dribbling and well I have 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.430
 cost 1,500 coins and in the other as 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.409
 you will have already seen where we are going which is the 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:10.119
 better than there 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:13.620
 82 pace 81 shot 78 pass 81 drilling and 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.810
 72 has not cost millions 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.810
 then in the middle of the field we have 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.330
 from emitter 36 of rhythm 70 say 80's 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.140
 for 68 dribbling 78 100 is pretty 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.470
 complete 352 the note and in the other 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.860
 We will have 12 from Real Madrid Lassana 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.990
 diarrhea with 79 rhythm and the shot does not 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.730
 course but about 74 and bass is a 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.140
 traitor or stribling and what matters to me 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.260
 in these poor 80 think 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.750
 and attack we are going to have 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.280
 well there are many people who could choose 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.960
 to others but there we go another 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.590
 especially this forward since 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.080
 host 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.080
 in 12 matches 9 goals 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.380
 and button 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.020
 it cost me two thousand eight hundred 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.420
 coins and good is that the hard plugs 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.910
 and then to accompany you we have the 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.910
 day to the real samuel eto'o 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.400
 2. 3 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.049
 and good 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.799
 and this has been all we see ourselves in a 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.799
 next video
