anything leaks you want to be able to
shut<00:02:47.970> off<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.180> supply<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:49.079> so<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.590> want<00:02:49.769> to

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
shut off the supply to it so you want to

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.069 
shut off the supply to it so you want to
probably<00:02:50.040> put<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.519> past<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:51.120> shutoff<00:02:51.359> valve<00:02:51.750> you

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
probably put it past a shutoff valve you

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.809 
probably put it past a shutoff valve you
don't<00:02:52.260> want<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.470> go<00:02:52.590> too<00:02:52.650> far<00:02:53.099> away<00:02:53.160> from<00:02:53.730> the

don't want to go too far away from the
hot<00:02:54.000> water<00:02:54.269> heater<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:55.230> we're<00:02:55.530> going<00:02:55.739> to

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
hot water heater so we're going to

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.130 
hot water heater so we're going to
choose<00:02:56.099> a<00:02:56.159> location<00:02:56.670> somewhere<00:02:57.599> right<00:02:57.870> here

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
choose a location somewhere right here

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.949 
choose a location somewhere right here
so<00:02:58.650> here's<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.280> saddle<00:02:59.760> valve<00:02:59.790> secured<00:03:00.450> make

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
so here's the saddle valve secured make

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.630 
so here's the saddle valve secured make
sure<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:01.319> not<00:03:01.500> over<00:03:01.859> tightened<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.430> not

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
sure it's not over tightened it's not

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.399 
sure it's not over tightened it's not
squeezing<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.390> pipe<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:03.930> don't<00:03:04.140> want<00:03:04.319> to

squeezing the pipe you don't want to

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.319 
squeezing the pipe you don't want to
deform<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.859> pipe<00:03:05.159> with<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.459> saddle<00:03:05.849> valve<00:03:06.000> now

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
deform the pipe with a saddle valve now

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.300 
deform the pipe with a saddle valve now
we<00:03:06.390> can<00:03:06.690> easily<00:03:06.870> move<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.470> water<00:03:07.680> supply<00:03:08.099> for
