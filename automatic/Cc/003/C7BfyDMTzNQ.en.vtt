all<00:00:10.140> right<00:00:10.320> so<00:00:10.470> here<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.650> am<00:00:10.770> practicing

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
all right so here I am practicing

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.790 
all right so here I am practicing
corners<00:00:11.850> and<00:00:12.230> we're<00:00:13.230> going<00:00:13.380> down<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.650> road

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:13.800 
corners and we're going down the road

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.500 
corners and we're going down the road
I'm<00:00:14.040> going<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.700> know<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.850> little<00:00:15.090> bit<00:00:15.240> under

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.510 
I'm going you know a little bit under

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.000 
I'm going you know a little bit under
the<00:00:15.600> speed<00:00:15.809> limit<00:00:15.840> mainly<00:00:16.380> because<00:00:16.529> I'm<00:00:16.770> just

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the speed limit mainly because I'm just

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.380 
the speed limit mainly because I'm just
trying<00:00:17.189> to<00:00:17.250> get<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.490> road<00:00:17.640> conditions<00:00:18.180> and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
trying to get the road conditions and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.820 
trying to get the road conditions and
I'm<00:00:18.540> working<00:00:18.689> on<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.050> mechanics<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.650> turn

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
I'm working on the mechanics of a turn

early after this next right-hand turn

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.150 
early after this next right-hand turn
you'll<00:00:34.860> see<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> perfect<00:00:35.489> example<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:37.160> after

perfect example of what turning into
early<00:00:41.640> causes<00:00:42.150> I<00:00:42.300> wish<00:00:43.020> I'd<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.260> had<00:00:43.350> a

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
early causes I wish I'd have had a

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.930 
early causes I wish I'd have had a
behind<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.950> bike<00:00:44.160> or<00:00:44.400> in<00:00:44.460> front<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.790> bike

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
behind the bike or in front of the bike

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.520 
behind the bike or in front of the bike
camera<00:00:45.330> shot<00:00:45.540> so<00:00:45.840> it'd<00:00:46.110> be<00:00:46.140> better

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
camera shot so it'd be better

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.180 
camera shot so it'd be better
illustrated<00:00:47.220> but<00:00:48.140> this<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.500> left-hand<00:00:50.010> turn

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
illustrated but this this left-hand turn

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.640 
illustrated but this this left-hand turn
right<00:00:50.430> here<00:00:50.990> you<00:00:51.990> know<00:00:52.110> I'm<00:00:52.200> going<00:00:52.380> pretty

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
right here you know I'm going pretty

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.970 
right here you know I'm going pretty
good<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.400> I<00:00:54.300> turn<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.110> actually<00:00:55.260> gas<00:00:55.710> it

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
good and I turn in and actually gas it

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.620 
good and I turn in and actually gas it
right<00:00:56.160> here<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.820> turn<00:00:57.060> in<00:00:57.240> a<00:00:57.300> little<00:00:57.510> bit

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
right here and I turn in a little bit

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.920 
right here and I turn in a little bit
more<00:00:57.900> and<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.770> ruined<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.880> early<00:01:00.180> slid<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.720> rear

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
more and I ruined it early slid the rear

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.130 
more and I ruined it early slid the rear
out<00:01:01.230> got<00:01:01.740> got<00:01:02.370> back<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.880> which<00:01:03.360> was<00:01:03.540> good<00:01:03.810> I'd

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
out got got back up which was good I'd

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.999 
out got got back up which was good I'd
have<00:01:04.259> been<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> little<00:01:04.589> faster<00:01:04.979> I

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
have been going a little faster I

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.969 
have been going a little faster I
probably<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> low<00:01:05.549> side<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.090> and

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
probably the low side of that and

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.469 
probably the low side of that and
recovered<00:01:07.979> had<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> few<00:01:08.670> choice<00:01:08.850> curse<00:01:09.210> words

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
recovered had a few choice curse words

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.830 
recovered had a few choice curse words
for<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.869> camera<00:01:10.110> that's<00:01:10.470> right<00:01:11.369> there<00:01:11.840> so

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
for the camera that's right there so

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.380 
for the camera that's right there so
we're<00:01:13.799> driving<00:01:14.009> down<00:01:14.219> again<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:14.999> do<00:01:15.060> this

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
we're driving down again but I do this

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.389 
we're driving down again but I do this
repeatedly<00:01:15.899> in<00:01:16.109> left-hand<00:01:16.560> turns<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.950> get<00:01:17.159> too

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
repeatedly in left-hand turns I get too

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.349 
repeatedly in left-hand turns I get too
close<00:01:17.429> to<00:01:17.999> the<00:01:18.090> centerline<00:01:19.039> of<00:01:20.039> my<00:01:20.609> lane<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:20.969> get

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
close to the centerline of my lane I get

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.660 
close to the centerline of my lane I get
to<00:01:21.539> center<00:01:21.929> to<00:01:22.409> centered<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.189> see<00:01:23.369> I'm<00:01:23.460> right

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
to center to centered like see I'm right

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.340 
to center to centered like see I'm right
right<00:01:24.210> dead<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> middle<00:01:24.719> of<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.319> I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
right dead in the middle of that and I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.989 
right dead in the middle of that and I
come<00:01:25.530> out<00:01:25.560> right<00:01:26.039> on<00:01:26.159> top<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.399> that<00:01:26.609> yellow<00:01:26.759> on

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:26.999 
come out right on top of that yellow on

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:29.300 
come out right on top of that yellow on
so<00:01:27.749> you<00:01:27.810> got<00:01:28.139> to<00:01:28.229> get<00:01:28.350> over<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.859> extreme

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
so you got to get over to the extreme

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.309 
so you got to get over to the extreme
outside<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.969> every<00:01:30.179> turn<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.869> outside

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
outside of every turn so it's outside

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.219 
outside of every turn so it's outside
inside<00:01:31.950> outside<00:01:32.249> is<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.630> mechanics<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.139> a

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
inside outside is the mechanics of a

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.160 
inside outside is the mechanics of a
turn<00:01:34.469> extreme<00:01:35.249> outside<00:01:35.869> safely<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:36.959> there's<00:01:37.109> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
turn extreme outside safely if there's a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.599 
turn extreme outside safely if there's a
big<00:01:37.289> hole<00:01:37.469> there<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.039> you're<00:01:38.189> going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> fall

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
big hole there and you're going to fall

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.309 
big hole there and you're going to fall
it<00:01:38.819> and<00:01:39.090> obviously<00:01:39.359> we'll<00:01:39.749> go<00:01:39.959> that<00:01:40.109> far<00:01:40.259> over

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
it and obviously we'll go that far over

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.230 
it and obviously we'll go that far over
but<00:01:40.649> if<00:01:41.100> there's<00:01:41.340> debris<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> side<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.179> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
but if there's debris on the side of the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.529 
but if there's debris on the side of the
road<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.509> leaves<00:01:42.749> grass<00:01:43.200> wet<00:01:44.119> mud<00:01:45.119> dirt

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
road like leaves grass wet mud dirt

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.779 
road like leaves grass wet mud dirt
gravel<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.350> don't<00:01:46.499> want<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.679> get<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:46.979> but

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
gravel you don't want to get in it but

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.309 
gravel you don't want to get in it but
you<00:01:47.880> want<00:01:47.999> to<00:01:48.030> go<00:01:48.149> as<00:01:48.270> far<00:01:48.299> over<00:01:48.539> as<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.959> safely

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
you want to go as far over as you safely

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.709 
you want to go as far over as you safely
can<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.609> outside<00:01:50.999> of<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> turn<00:01:51.329> turn
