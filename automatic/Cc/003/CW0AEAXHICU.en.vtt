00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 his son from 3 years to 1 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.299
 the kid is doing the greatest good on his planet but with him 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.719
 but what do we do we discover 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.059
 the planet 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.229
 and then all of a sudden the adventures magot motte power all that 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.140
 lido women kids and three 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.900
 we did it stove 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.109
 a woman got married 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.399
 we realize that we only talk about the world three girls on the planet 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.739
 and he has a son 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.739
 naturally these but why or both 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.400
 the salient point that's why 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.900
 why 3 why lanfeust 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.610
 why belgium and it's true that suddenly 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.260
 that implies 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.300
 if we explain that his simple and claiming that he was much less room 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.989
 for the time being 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.989
 I do the tome 1 by making believe 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.560
 I was already the five barrels and abandoning fantasy was the first 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.140
 box in phase 3 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.040
 I was not designers of tomorrow 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.040
 this will not be split 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.210
 before releasing the first pages we made canvas 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.970
 good it's true it's it took a little bit to acclimatize 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.970
 it's very easy to see now that we have to limit album under the eyes 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.340
 one controller per merrion master 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.340
 between the first album is the last earthquake plus the same success 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.720
 we are different for it but it's true that we needed 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.740
 that's what I wanted 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.880
 I have climate what 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.340
 in the beginning we grope 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.200
 he is curiously 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.650
 I'm not a case finally doubt 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.540
 of childlike practices for his technique is more a matter of 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.840
 decomplexing 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.840
 especially if their part is practicing if I will not acquire 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.540
 of the technique by the practice I understand them that m 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.980
 it's not that difficult 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.980
 I surround myself with people who read oil 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.850
 but who is not interested in lanfeust 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.970
 so that means the final dead Tuesday 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.180
 so much better that the world believes that the body of water of people under other 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.470
 others pleaded 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.460
 with to others obviously falling when one says of a baby in false flat 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.100
 social another type of product so here we get to the derivatives the 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.499
 pump africa 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:17.689
 and so much the better 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.869
 the bdc is a popular art that exists only if consume 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:23.899
 even if people do not want it, I do not know 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:26.709
 we do not even have right end of the pub for babies 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.859
 on TV or on them 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.329
 this is how this office does not force anyone to buy them like this 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.059
 if people are not 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:36.979
 it's because it's because they like it because your pc 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.289
 so for me it puts me out of me it does not bother me 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.289
 what was bothering me down would be to find myself with them 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.999
 eventually freedom 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.389
 on the world 3 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.359
 that is to say, my stuff stuck 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:51.530
 compared to 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.609
 what was said in our series 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.949
 now there sometimes that I think what to do 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:59.299
 Well, it's a bit like 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.559
 this meaning the one that marks more severe falls to the young leave 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.679
 what we can get hold of 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:09.989
 they leave behind them behind him 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.649
 so suddenly baj 

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:15.969
 I know I'm going bongo and I say goodbye to him or goodbye and 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:17.559
 I do not even know if finding it 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:19.319
 in this direction 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.609
 so suddenly 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.789
 when I think it's safe 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:28.649
 but on the other hand we also have what russians this duo to pump starsky and 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:32.099
 hutch and two children bishops came back healthy between polar cold
