00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.599
 old times commission shops 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.309
 enjoyed special popularity there 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.370
 could find the most fashionable and 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.350
 actual things dress in commission 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.330
 could not afford everything because there with 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.310
 enviable periodicity appeared 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.439
 branded imported clothing textiles and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.150
 much more 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.490
 over the years of independence about the commission 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.800
 the stores are almost forgotten and here they are 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.840
 come back again though in the new role 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.059
 now in commission stores you can 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.600
 find vintage and how fashionable now 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.790
 speak 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.800
 vintage items as well as purchase 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.370
 products of very good quality and 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.559
 low price no stayed modern 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:51.149
 thrift shop what we saw there 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:53.190
 look in the plot to hand over all unnecessary in 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.989
 commission a few years ago this 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.350
 sounded like hello from the past 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.070
 old times especially gives soviet 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.799
 Union when there was a shortage of everything 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.300
 what could the body buy for itself 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.480
 though 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.940
 put on shoes alik furniture some 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:18.030
 things on was scarce in terms of 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:23.250
 market relations well, that's for me personally 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:26.700
 as they disappeared from the general form 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.440
 gotten between the motives of c content and 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.070
 among the colossal number of subjects 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.700
 and clothes and shoes and household items 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.230
 everyday life 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.690
 however, recently the situation 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.640
 changed and commissions found a new 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.440
 sense so today in commission 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.240
 the store you can find unique things 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.840
 which or meet on the counter 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.420
 ordinary 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.320
 which is why rare book hunters 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.230
 Look into these stores now 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.000
 It has been shown that many have those 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.790
 goods that they no longer need by 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.880
 for some reason they can bring 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.180
 on commission others can purchase something 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.230
 what do they need well do not think that 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.300
 commission shops are not for the poor 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.950
 people are not on the Cossacks to still remembers 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.570
 Soviet commissions therefore with 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.150
 enjoy using the services 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.220
 modern thrift shop 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.530

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.550
 range from children's clothing and 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.730
 adult shoes 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.950

 I take pleasure at home 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.280
 Products in the thrift shop is worth 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.410
 cheaper than usual even if the thing 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.420
 new and just did not fit her owner 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.430
 in size to the average cost of goods 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.140
 at its delivery on the commission decreases in two 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.180
 times most modern 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.660
 commissions deal with specific types 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.239
 goods 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.250
 clothing furniture or equipment however 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.050
 there are such a range of which 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.019
 quite wide and diverse 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.790
 our store brings everything to the commission 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.580
 we take all the household appliances 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.130
 clothes shoes dishes 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.980
 large furniture 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.660
 popular demand because on the whole 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.730
 superfluous mobile market we have prices 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.390
 of course very large un and difficult 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.730
 pick up any furniture we marten 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.310
 however, there are some products that 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.560
 bring more and snapping up faster on 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.550
 Today we have big 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.820
 assortment 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.820
 women's clothing women's shoes 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.069
 dishes of a separate category stand out here 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.930
 children's goods and clothing which also 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.390
 often appear in stock 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.580
 and here the main difference from the commission 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.440
 second-hand stores besides 1 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.180

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.550
 in assessing the commission of things 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.120
 We agree with our deliverer price 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.400
 well, basically it 's about 50 percent 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.769
 5 am initial cost 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.210
 the thing must be pure after 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.830
 dry cleaning container after washing 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.420
 proper form calves too 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.640
 honors foot commissions from ordinary 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.700
 stores for consumers is something 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.770
 that the goods cannot be exchanged and returned 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.930
 citizen committee gave the goods on

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.540
 stale on the shelf after determining 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.850
 Prices need to conclude an agreement with 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.250

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.810

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.000
 You are not perma a month if the goods are not 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.040

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.830
 customer demand and offer 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.180

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.670
 as for further popularization 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.320
 commission trade experts consider 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.030
 that today such a shop only 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.130
 begin to occupy their niche among 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.290
 the rest besides some of them 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.300
 already mastering the Internet space 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:25.070
 therefore, it is possible that soon they 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.070
 will appear already in the new format
