motivated when you weren't known well I

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.050 
motivated when you weren't known well I
guess<00:00:15.630> when<00:00:16.529> he<00:00:16.619> started<00:00:17.010> now<00:00:17.190> it's<00:00:17.760> probably

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
guess when he started now it's probably

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.000 
guess when he started now it's probably
down<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.630> feedback<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.439> if<00:00:19.650> you'd<00:00:19.800> ruin

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
down to the feedback and if you'd ruin

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.620 
down to the feedback and if you'd ruin
it<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.220> if<00:00:20.730> you're<00:00:20.939> injuring<00:00:21.180> at<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.449> same

it this if you're injuring at the same

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.970 
it this if you're injuring at the same
time<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.199> that's<00:00:22.289> definitely<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.769> good<00:00:22.830> thing

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
time and that's definitely a good thing

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.189 
time and that's definitely a good thing
but<00:00:23.369> if<00:00:23.609> you're<00:00:24.000> getting<00:00:24.240> feedback<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:25.080> get

used to rise it it's definitely
motivated<00:00:29.220> me<00:00:29.369> before<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> was<00:00:30.000> even<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.420> team

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
motivated me before I was even in a team

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.930 
motivated me before I was even in a team
and<00:00:30.980> even<00:00:31.980> when<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.309> started<00:00:32.430> out<00:00:32.790> you

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
and even when I just started out you

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.910 
and even when I just started out you
know<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.270> odd<00:00:33.540> comment<00:00:33.930> was<00:00:34.020> really<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.770> know

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920

really<00:00:35.130> motivational<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:37.040> obviously<00:00:38.040> if

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
really motivational so obviously if

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.100 
really motivational so obviously if
you're<00:00:38.280> doing<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:38.969> get<00:00:39.930> him<00:00:40.020> out

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
you're doing it but if you get him out

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.690 
you're doing it but if you get him out
feedback<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.739> want<00:00:41.040> even<00:00:41.370> if<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.610> just

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
feedback that you want even if it's just

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.310 
feedback that you want even if it's just
a<00:00:41.879> few<00:00:42.030> comments<00:00:42.390> our<00:00:42.510> likes<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.989> then<00:00:43.200> it

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
a few comments our likes and then it

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.110 
a few comments our likes and then it
starts<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.649> grow<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.219> definitely<00:00:44.910> kept<00:00:45.090> me

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
starts to grow that definitely kept me

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.880 
starts to grow that definitely kept me
motivated<00:00:45.300> when<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.410> know<00:00:46.440> when<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.680> just

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
motivated when I you know when I just

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.720 
motivated when I you know when I just
started<00:00:46.980> out<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.610> i<00:00:47.850> guess<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:49.399> it<00:00:50.399> easier

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
started out so i guess that is it easier

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.830 
started out so i guess that is it easier
to<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:51.030> clips<00:00:51.360> alone<00:00:51.690> or<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.170> full<00:00:52.379> party

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
to get clips alone or in a full party

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.240 
to get clips alone or in a full party
well<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.050> lot<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.320> people<00:00:55.379> think<00:00:56.100> differently

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
well a lot of people think differently

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.979 
well a lot of people think differently
for<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.390> lot<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.539> people<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.870> their

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
for this and a lot of people have their

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.569 
for this and a lot of people have their
own<00:00:58.050> different<00:00:58.230> opinion<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:58.829> my<00:00:59.070> opinion<00:00:59.460> on

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
own different opinion but my opinion on

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.180 
own different opinion but my opinion on
this<00:00:59.730> is<00:01:00.000> basically<00:01:00.989> i<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.410> easier<00:01:01.829> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
this is basically i think it's easier to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.700 
this is basically i think it's easier to
get<00:01:02.340> clips<00:01:02.579> renew<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> full<00:01:03.180> party<00:01:03.710> just

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
get clips renew in a full party just

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.160 
get clips renew in a full party just
down<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> fact<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.990> know<00:01:07.110> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
down to the fact that you you know you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.020 
down to the fact that you you know you
can<00:01:07.770> control<00:01:08.220> where<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.460> enemies<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:08.850> going

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
can control where the enemies are going

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.789 
can control where the enemies are going
to<00:01:09.090> be<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.840> control<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> spawn<00:01:10.560> so

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
to be you can control the spawn so

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.080 
to be you can control the spawn so
you've<00:01:10.950> got<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.130> full<00:01:11.369> team<00:01:11.580> or<00:01:11.970> all

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
you've got a full team or all

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.600 
you've got a full team or all
communicate<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:12.990> say<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:14.369> when<00:01:14.520> you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
communicate and you can say and when you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.490 
communicate and you can say and when you
play<00:01:14.729> by<00:01:14.970> yourself<00:01:15.090> then<00:01:15.900> that's<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.380> whole

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
play by yourself then that's a whole

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.200 
play by yourself then that's a whole
different<00:01:16.799> matter<00:01:17.040> because<00:01:17.580> you've<00:01:17.700> got<00:01:17.880> you

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
different matter because you've got you

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.359 
different matter because you've got you
know<00:01:18.240> random<00:01:18.869> teammates<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.650> you're<00:01:20.220> not

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
know random teammates that you're not

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.950 
know random teammates that you're not
really<00:01:20.700> talking<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.420> thing<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.720> can't

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
really talking with thing you can't

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.660 
really talking with thing you can't
really<00:01:22.110> communicate<00:01:22.799> where<00:01:23.369> everyone's

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
really communicate where everyone's

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.340 
really communicate where everyone's
going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.299> i<00:01:24.330> definitely<00:01:24.689> think<00:01:25.020> that

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
going to be so i definitely think that

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.620 
going to be so i definitely think that
clips<00:01:25.979> by<00:01:26.250> yourself<00:01:26.670> or<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.180> couple<00:01:27.600> of

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
clips by yourself or with a couple of

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
clips by yourself or with a couple of
friends<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:28.140> definitely<00:01:28.530> more<00:01:28.890> impressive

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
friends are definitely more impressive

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.240 
friends are definitely more impressive
you<00:01:29.490> could<00:01:29.640> say<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.880> cuts<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.780> full<00:01:30.960> part

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
you could say that cuts in a full part

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.890 
you could say that cuts in a full part
and<00:01:32.250> definitely<00:01:32.579> harder<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.970> get<00:01:33.350> okay

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
and definitely harder to get okay

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.740 
and definitely harder to get okay

was unlike machinima or something and it
was<00:01:57.520> just<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:58.060> regular<00:01:58.390> card<00:01:58.780> for<00:01:58.960> montage<00:01:59.380> with

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.340 
was just a regular card for montage with
the<00:01:59.710> few<00:01:59.920> sniper<00:02:00.160> kills<00:02:00.660> it<00:02:01.660> wasn't<00:02:02.020> anyone<00:02:02.320> in

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
I thought I want to do something like

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.320 
I thought I want to do something like
that<00:02:05.680> looks<00:02:05.980> kind<00:02:06.130> of<00:02:06.250> fun<00:02:06.460> that's<00:02:07.180> how<00:02:07.300> I

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
that looks kind of fun that's how I

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.910 
that looks kind of fun that's how I
basically<00:02:07.720> got<00:02:08.020> into<00:02:08.260> it<00:02:08.380> wasn't<00:02:08.770> like<00:02:08.890> I

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
basically got into it wasn't like I

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.190 
basically got into it wasn't like I
wanted<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.369> be<00:02:09.520> so<00:02:09.729> when<00:02:09.880> it<00:02:09.970> was<00:02:10.060> just<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:10.570> saw<00:02:11.140> a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
wanted to be so when it was just I saw a

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.500 
wanted to be so when it was just I saw a
video<00:02:11.410> on<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:11.950> looked<00:02:12.490> cool<00:02:12.640> so<00:02:12.700> that's

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
video on it and it looked cool so that's

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.460 
video on it and it looked cool so that's
how<00:02:13.630> i<00:02:13.690> got<00:02:13.780> into<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.170> guess<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:16.230> if<00:02:17.230> there

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
how i got into I guess and if there

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.110 
how i got into I guess and if there
wasn't<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.950> call<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.340> duty<00:02:18.370> do<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:18.790> think<00:02:19.000> you'd

give<00:06:47.400> montage<00:06:48.060> makers<00:06:48.449> out<00:06:48.569> there<00:06:48.630> that<00:06:48.990> are

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
give montage makers out there that are

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.640 
give montage makers out there that are
trying<00:06:49.289> to<00:06:49.380> get<00:06:49.470> bigger<00:06:49.740> and<00:06:49.949> better<00:06:51.650> well

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
trying to get bigger and better well

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.310 
trying to get bigger and better well
what<00:06:53.370> everyone<00:06:53.669> says<00:06:54.150> this<00:06:54.389> they<00:06:54.539> just<00:06:54.780> say<00:06:54.990> be

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
what everyone says this they just say be

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.050 
what everyone says this they just say be
original<00:06:55.860> but<00:06:55.979> they<00:06:56.099> never<00:06:56.220> expands<00:06:56.909> so<00:06:57.030> I

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 
original but they never expands so I

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.390 
original but they never expands so I
guess<00:06:58.669> the<00:06:59.669> idea<00:07:00.030> is<00:07:00.090> that<00:07:00.270> you<00:07:00.449> need<00:07:01.050> to<00:07:01.400> make

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
guess the idea is that you need to make

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.879 
guess the idea is that you need to make
your<00:07:02.639> videos<00:07:03.030> better<00:07:03.960> than<00:07:04.259> everyone<00:07:04.500> else<00:07:04.710> is

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:04.889 
your videos better than everyone else is

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.089 
your videos better than everyone else is
in<00:07:04.919> different<00:07:05.909> ways<00:07:06.210> so<00:07:06.710> when<00:07:07.710> you're<00:07:07.860> playing
