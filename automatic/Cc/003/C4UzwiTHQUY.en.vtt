 I'll find you today 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.619
 to make you a little video yet 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.550
 cooking on a pie that I do so 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:27.130
 with leeks essentially 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.910
 spinach a little mushrooms and some 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.150
 chicken sausages 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.750
 finally good here is the recipe more 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.150
 so I already cut in late summer the 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.000
 cut into small pieces an onion and 2 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:44.200
 leeks so here to go a little 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.489
 things have not read my wish is 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.489
 young and a little olive oil 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.420
 here I am putting some herbs 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.420
 Provence 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:21.670
 some pepper a little bit of pepper 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:23.320
 fort de cayenne and a little later in 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.780
 the preparation I add it and indicate 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.400
 so only chicken trick I believe that 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.430
 these poultry defatting something 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.710
 like that so there some of all five 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.060
 kapissa minutes and understand comes back 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.350
 in the canvas so I'm learning 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:44.190
 minced mushrooms game by being she 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.190
 the same I think it's positive warthogs 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.190
 you must have noticed that I like 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.800
 to cook with a little wine so there 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.110
 the state I had at home we had 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.850
 brought for my birthday and good 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.800
 jovi live since I do not see the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.200
 last months like that and actually I like 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.050
 well put me in the middle of cooking 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.009
 so that's the time to climb to pony 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.860
 and two passes 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.569
 and perhaps for the alcohol 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.790
 the agreement was not finalized 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.799
 the term here in the end remains just a 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.810
 little ping has sympathetically sipa 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.569
 Alcoholic roadside at the age of 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.849
 their son or daughter in the es17 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:32.219
 I take advantage of the fact that there is a little bit of 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.219
 liquid in my faith and I put my son 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:46.419
 I add a little water and I leave 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.549
 simmer it all at gainy minutes plus 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:51.939
 late I add a tomato that I have 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:54.849
 diced so if you like koboko 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:58.299
 tomatoes either from kyoto do a good one by 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.819
 At the same time, it delays the komagata 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.980
 is also perceived afraid of my trust my 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:08.459
 moral consultants go eat from the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:12.359
 crazy tomato or tribe so from there but 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.359
 in the middle of a massive 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.280
 and the same I will push them to throw me 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:23.370
 in 05 min 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.900
 Cambodia has remained more pub is 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.960
 so I actually put the whole thing 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:34.270
 platelet because morning she's going 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:36.820
 be like that I have no meat 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.790
 added a little like that I 'm going a little 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.620
 salad next door but now ready 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.640
 I take this is the peace place and I 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.990
 puts all in 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.300
 now I've cut my 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.900
 sausages in pieces I put them in 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.900
 pan 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.030
 for France to pass I put a little 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.569
 of water in the pan and I leave it all 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.819
 simmered 5 to 10 min 29 I'll add the 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.080
 box to set h and therefore never the 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.550
 everything is really a woman with 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.489
 the sailboat has a lot of stuff in it 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.720
 the ax and in the end because there they 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.959
 are hashed that I do not want them 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.210
 attach both the arm and everything so 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.090
 this is the last thing I 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:30.940
 lead and then after I 'll put it all 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.940

 put it all in badaboum badaboum 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.910
 I did not have that much 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.070
 so I already read but deep down I think 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.130
 maybe you hear it in the background 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.130
 sound 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:07.550
 I just lit it frozen set 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:13.310
 200 to 180 Â° and I leave my hue fleeing 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:19.460

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:21.320

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.900
 I take in mixing a very game 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.280
 patriot mental hike and I take 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.630
