here and then there's a sample one

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.380 
here and then there's a sample one
that's<00:04:12.469> gonna<00:04:12.560> come<00:04:12.829> like<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.280> single<00:04:14.090> strand

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
that's gonna come like a single strand

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.029 
that's gonna come like a single strand
here<00:04:14.659> not<00:04:14.870> like<00:04:14.959> a<00:04:14.989> single<00:04:15.469> sense<00:04:15.650> room<00:04:15.829> but<00:04:16.009> a

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
here not like a single sense room but a

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.699 
here not like a single sense room but a
set<00:04:16.820> of<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.479> extension<00:04:17.959> that<00:04:18.440> you<00:04:18.500> can

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
set of the extension that you can

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.199 
set of the extension that you can
actually<00:04:18.829> open<00:04:19.130> that<00:04:19.340> see<00:04:19.789> if<00:04:19.940> it<00:04:20.030> matches

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
actually open that see if it matches

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.729 
actually open that see if it matches
your<00:04:20.479> hair<00:04:20.690> before<00:04:20.900> you<00:04:21.079> open<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.440> bottom

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
your hair before you open the bottom

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.189 
your hair before you open the bottom
piece<00:04:21.979> and<00:04:22.160> then<00:04:22.910> you<00:04:23.360> can<00:04:23.539> decide<00:04:23.750> if<00:04:23.960> it's<00:04:24.080> a

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
piece and then you can decide if it's a

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.330 
piece and then you can decide if it's a
perfect<00:04:24.530> match<00:04:24.650> or<00:04:24.860> not<00:04:24.919> and<00:04:25.220> you<00:04:25.310> can

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
perfect match or not and you can

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.340 
perfect match or not and you can
exchange<00:04:25.669> it<00:04:26.030> but<00:04:26.900> I<00:04:26.930> think<00:04:27.169> that's<00:04:27.289> really

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
exchange it but I think that's really

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.200 
exchange it but I think that's really
cool<00:04:27.680> because<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:28.100> just<00:04:28.250> never<00:04:28.759> know<00:04:28.880> when

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
cool because you just never know when

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.550 
cool because you just never know when
you're<00:04:29.330> ordering<00:04:29.479> here<00:04:29.870> extensions<00:04:30.350> if<00:04:30.440> it's

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590
