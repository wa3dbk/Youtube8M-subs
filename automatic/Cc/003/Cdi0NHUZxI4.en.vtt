00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.625
 All right, students! 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.159
 Today we are going to learn what? 

00:00:29.118 --> 00:00:31.118
 What? 

00:00:31.393 --> 00:00:33.393
 WHAT??? 

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.834
 Nobody knows? 

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:37.836
 NOBODY KNOWS? 

00:00:42.818 --> 00:00:47.818
 We are going to learn the Natural Numbers today 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.500
 Can anyone tell me what Natural Numbers are? 

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:56.755
 Can you? 

00:00:56.378 --> 00:00:58.378
 NOBODY? 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:03.729
 Very well. 

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:07.564
 The Natural Numbers are a series of numbers 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.900
 What are the ones from here that I'm going to put on the blackboard? 

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:10.685
 All these sets of numbers, among others, 

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:12.704
 are Natural Numbers. 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.500
 The numbers BELOW ZERO 

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:17.676
 THEY ARE NOT NATURAL! 

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:21.046
 Do you understand? 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.220
 Any questions? 

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:34.526
 Not? Assurance? 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.500
 Remember that doubts can not be saved! 

00:01:43.143 --> 00:01:45.140
 Very well!
