00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello gave me your character here in a 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.790
 new video and good here we are from 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.880
 our quick social of how to place a 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.190
 map that you want downloaded as spam 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.470
 from the good server we start first 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.680
 We look for some map that we want in 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:20.119
 google and here google search and 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.119
 well then we download it 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.370
 obviously that now compressed because 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.710
 then it will have to decompress 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.080
 because they are different folders and they have 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.050
 that has a map and all that and good 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.800
 as you will see here are the maps this is 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.809
 read this is the entity and this is the normal 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.980
 if we open it here it has all the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.010
 configuration the sessions the level the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.629
 players that entered the map and this 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.850
 is the data no idea after good this you 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.350
 what is the server 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.579
 if you do not have the first core multiverse 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.960
 the way to make a spam would be 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.960
 download and then 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.960
 unzip it 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.590
 once compressed we open the folder and 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.020
 we copy the one inside these 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.240
 records 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.799
 then we copy this 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.570
 and we put the folder here later to 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.950
 that we take the map because if 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.940
 we enter the server will not take us 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.400
 the map then we have here 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.620
 where did I make this world is the map that 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.190
 take as spawn for example if we have 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.330
 here a map that the sky block the map and 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.850
 here we put sky block 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.430
 the map that you are going to take about the one 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.200
 says sky which says world why 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.970
 depends on what we say here today is going to 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.160
 generate a new folder will take the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.930
 map that has or will load it 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.570
 then to replace this with this 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:02.360
 we do the following this we eliminate 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:06.760
 and this one we passed the name by world 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.760
 and now we start the server 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.259
 we enter 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:22.620
 and here is loading everything as I charge 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.620
 here word 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.670
 and to see 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.540
 now we wait 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.540
 16.4 play 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.530
 now to see 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.709
 that is 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.380
 here we can change it to any 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.810
 name that we want to be generated 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.400
 the folders can be generated different 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.770
 folders depends on the name that 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.080
 let's place if she has a folder 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.840
 created with a name that we place the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.520
 server dot properties there is that folder 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.620
 is going to how to import and then 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.370
 there he will take and he will place has 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:11.220
 to serve now the 5 565 here 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.440
 what I mean the local ip or 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.340
 without writing it to her 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.340
 now we enter 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.890
 we wait to see 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.890
 our spam 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.340
 to see see 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.880
 the lighting 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.030
 well first this due and only me 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.030
 like let's see 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.000
 here it has to be 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.090
 come back see 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.829
 I can not use because I still do not 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.359
 I have a name 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.359
 to see here 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.340
 I can not 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.630
 so 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.840
 they went to the video 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.020
 to place 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.850
 and well here we are back and I have 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.910
 these maps so I'm going to place 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:02.249
 some for example placed this of 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.700
 I copied towers here I can here 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:06.550
 now 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.620
 really the closed server eliminated the 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.010
 world 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.340
 I open change the name of the tower by 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.169
 word 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.169
 I start the server back 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.750
 I hope it charges 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.210
 now I go to the server 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:36.069
 and now you have the map of the world 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:39.250
 the tower side when paddling and one here 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:41.220
 I would be and as you can see it does not take me 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.740
 blocks 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.800
 that is, the student who commanded that they had 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:51.470
 to take me to the place that's why 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.470
 now I explain it to a server 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.570
 this also some things and be server 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.950
 I will make see and this to activate them 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.849
 command block 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.469
 we put this inside 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.800
 and then after starting the 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:06.800
 server 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:16.430
 there is a time 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.430
 we go to the server we enter 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.080
 and I broke this come here and now yes 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.009
 leads us 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:29.400
 and here we would be like the web server 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:32.180
 of towers is because the map 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.180
 but good 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.710
 I hope you liked this is a 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:39.040
 quick tutorial to get the doubts in 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.020
 the comments 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.850
 comment if they have any flaws any 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.950
 mistake or want to know something of some 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.410
 plugin whatever I do the tutorial and 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:52.530
 since it does not cost me anything to subscribe 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.530
 law 'comment until another goodbye
