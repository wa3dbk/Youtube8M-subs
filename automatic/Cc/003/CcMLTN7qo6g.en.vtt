because<00:02:05.830> working<00:02:06.459> together<00:02:06.759> in<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.149> kitchen

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
because working together in the kitchen

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.850 
because working together in the kitchen
was<00:02:07.720> something<00:02:08.050> that<00:02:08.080> we<00:02:08.319> actually<00:02:08.590> had<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.769> do

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
was something that we actually had to do

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.109 
was something that we actually had to do
in<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.009> movie<00:02:09.190> we<00:02:09.429> had<00:02:09.550> all<00:02:09.640> these<00:02:09.759> chefs<00:02:09.970> we

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
in the movie we had all these chefs we

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.729 
in the movie we had all these chefs we
have<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.360> work<00:02:10.539> together<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.410> doing<00:02:11.650> it

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
have to work together so doing it

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.589 
have to work together so doing it
ourselves<00:02:11.830> would<00:02:12.430> give<00:02:12.580> us<00:02:12.700> an<00:02:12.819> idea<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.360> what

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
ourselves would give us an idea of what

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.589 
ourselves would give us an idea of what
are<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:14.019> dynamics<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.910> think<00:02:15.910> we<00:02:16.030> had<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.269> great

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
are the dynamics I think we had a great

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.630 
are the dynamics I think we had a great
bonding<00:02:17.080> experience<00:02:17.200> as<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.800> team<00:02:18.040> during

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
this stuff that we'd never done as

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.119 
this stuff that we'd never done as
individuals<00:02:22.659> together<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.739> we<00:02:23.860> actually

individuals together and we actually

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.030 
individuals together and we actually
made<00:02:24.340> something<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.989> cooking<00:02:26.290> class<00:02:26.500> kind<00:02:26.950> of

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
made something the cooking class kind of

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.979 
made something the cooking class kind of
