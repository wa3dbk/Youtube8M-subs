00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
one here and one here we're going to

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.400 
one here and one here we're going to
double<00:03:05.610> crochet<00:03:05.730> into<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:07.320> third<00:03:07.620> stitch<00:03:09.410> in

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
double crochet into the third stitch in

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.060 
double crochet into the third stitch in
our<00:03:10.680> row<00:03:11.390> okay<00:03:12.390> then<00:03:12.570> we're<00:03:12.690> going<00:03:12.990> to<00:03:13.070> cross

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
our row okay then we're going to cross

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.000 
our row okay then we're going to cross

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
back to this first double crochet where

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.790 
back to this first double crochet where
I<00:03:17.040> guess<00:03:17.310> it's<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.580> second<00:03:17.910> one<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.800> double

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
I guess it's the second one and double

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:29.309 
I guess it's the second one and double
crochet<00:03:19.920> into<00:03:20.610> that<00:03:20.970> stitch

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.890 

okay<00:03:29.920> then<00:03:30.159> we're<00:03:30.250> going<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.519> repeat<00:03:30.900> that

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
okay then we're going to repeat that

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.369 
okay then we're going to repeat that
sequence<00:03:32.290> until<00:03:33.099> we<00:03:33.310> reach<00:03:33.579> the<00:03:34.359> last<00:03:34.840> stitch

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
sequence until we reach the last stitch

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.170 
sequence until we reach the last stitch
in<00:03:35.739> our<00:03:36.159> row<00:03:36.430> so<00:03:36.640> let's<00:03:36.790> do<00:03:36.879> that<00:03:36.969> one<00:03:37.120> more

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
in our row so let's do that one more

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.449 
in our row so let's do that one more
time<00:03:37.299> just<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:38.620> show<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.890> real<00:03:39.129> quick<00:03:39.280> we're

time just to show you real quick we're

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.220 
time just to show you real quick we're
going<00:03:39.579> to<00:03:39.670> skip<00:03:40.209> this<00:03:40.450> next<00:03:40.810> double<00:03:41.140> crochet

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
that one as normal

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.300 
that one as normal
okay<00:03:58.989> so<00:03:59.049> just<00:03:59.379> continue<00:03:59.739> repeating<00:04:00.159> that

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
okay so just continue repeating that

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.619 
okay so just continue repeating that
until<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.209> end<00:04:01.359> of<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.659> row<00:04:03.359> now<00:04:04.359> when<00:04:04.540> you

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
until the end of the row now when you

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.059 
until the end of the row now when you
get<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:04.959> end<00:04:05.109> of<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.349> row<00:04:05.500> it's<00:04:05.680> going<00:04:05.950> to

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
get to the end of the row it's going to

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.309 
get to the end of the row it's going to
look<00:04:06.250> like<00:04:06.430> there's<00:04:06.700> no<00:04:07.239> more<00:04:07.599> stitches<00:04:08.049> there

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
look like there's no more stitches there

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.920 
look like there's no more stitches there
but<00:04:08.560> there<00:04:08.859> is<00:04:09.159> one<00:04:09.519> and<00:04:09.909> it's<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:10.450> chain

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
but there is one and it's this chain

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.740 
but there is one and it's this chain
three<00:04:11.260> from<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.560> previous<00:04:12.159> row<00:04:12.459> so<00:04:13.180> what<00:04:13.629> we

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
three from the previous row so what we

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.140 
three from the previous row so what we
need<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:13.959> do<00:04:14.200> is<00:04:14.470> work<00:04:14.980> one<00:04:15.370> double<00:04:15.609> crochet

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
need to do is work one double crochet

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.930 
need to do is work one double crochet
into<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:16.750> top<00:04:16.780> chain<00:04:17.500> of<00:04:17.769> this<00:04:18.370> chain<00:04:18.699> three

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
into the top chain of this chain three

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.120 
into the top chain of this chain three
now<00:04:18.970> if<00:04:19.150> you<00:04:19.239> wanted<00:04:19.599> to<00:04:19.660> you<00:04:20.530> could<00:04:20.739> just<00:04:20.979> work

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
now if you wanted to you could just work

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.120 
now if you wanted to you could just work
into<00:04:21.549> this<00:04:21.820> space<00:04:22.240> here<00:04:22.690> and<00:04:22.840> that<00:04:23.560> would<00:04:23.770> be

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
into this space here and that would be

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.499 
into this space here and that would be
just<00:04:24.400> fine

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 
just fine

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.810 
just fine
but<00:04:25.750> technically<00:04:26.320> you<00:04:26.680> should<00:04:26.979> work<00:04:27.250> into

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
but technically you should work into

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.779 
but technically you should work into
this<00:04:28.120> chain<00:04:28.570> here<00:04:29.560> on<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.919> top<00:04:30.130> so<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.400> third

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
this chain here on the top so that third

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:38.070 
this chain here on the top so that third
chain<00:04:30.820> of<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:32.680> chain<00:04:33.160> three<00:04:36.690> okay<00:04:37.690> and<00:04:37.930> that

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
chain of that chain three okay and that

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.290 
chain of that chain three okay and that
will<00:04:38.229> finish<00:04:38.470> row<00:04:39.430> two<00:04:39.490> now<00:04:40.000> you're<00:04:40.120> going<00:04:40.240> to

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
will finish row two now you're going to

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.409 
will finish row two now you're going to
repeat<00:04:40.720> row<00:04:41.500> two<00:04:41.820> until<00:04:42.820> you've<00:04:43.000> reached<00:04:43.180> your
