00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.940
 I know what it particularly has to do with

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:14.540
 series or continuous lloyd of the comic 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.400

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.739
 ninjago this golden ninja 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:37.560
 I wonder if they will ever let him out 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:42.560
 this list other games and the number of 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:46.290

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.260
 chain one shoulder on the back and this 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.660
 double-headed dagger we have gods 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.890
 characters to cut out if you want 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.800
 charge him somewhere 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:07.069
 this was the magazine and now we pass 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:09.230
 at the legendary here is the mini envelope 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.390
 figures dic write 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.190
 as you see the character we find 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.140
 inside this here here instead there 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.950
 are images of other versions of the 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:23.810
 same character as usual envelope 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.720
 sealed with a thin adhesive layer 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:39.890
 no rips and breaks will do much 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:42.760
 appreciated in my opinion and pull down the 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.760
 content 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:55.300
 obviously framing helps better in 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.300
 this position 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.970
 here is our composed character 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.980
 of legs and head course 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:13.670
 let's go and see it with these 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:16.070
 purple pants with a part of the 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:20.180
 bandage and bust that comes 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:23.979
 reported these fine chain pants 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.680
 ni tattoo with snakes on the chest 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:31.160
 also face tattooed on the front sides of the eyes 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.260
 reddened very bad no painting 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.890
 on the back of the head while the continuation 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.890
 of the snake tattoo on the back 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:51.410
 to finish this helmet in the shape of 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:55.440
 rubber snake a beautiful object then 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.030
 another one so without bracket 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.320
 sense 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.510
 this sword comes with a chievo handle 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.630
 those of the lightsaber perhaps but 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:10.890
 white I don't know the reason for this choice 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:16.650
 to add a handle 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:19.470
 ok this is the kraft character that 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.140

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.220

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.220
