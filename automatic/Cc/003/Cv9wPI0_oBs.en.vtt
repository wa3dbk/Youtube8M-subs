00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.790
 at the Microsoft press conference during the January 3 when it was said 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.049
 everyone who was present will receive an equal 60 cleverly a new explosion 60 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.660
 and besides that car that has gotten one in holly but that went crazy a lot 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:14.229
 ate 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:18.339
 You always have that to a family where you can find everything that has been wrong 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:19.369
 to show and land 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.960
 yes i took him out of my house and work this is a million 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.089
 amsterdam new day new packaging 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.630
 it's easier to make a war but also with a man but I do 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.090
 we had a lot 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.530
 we are met and then what strikes me is that the glind is actually whole 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.210
 very 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.950
 with that turning ten has the princes about apples 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.550
 with a little ps3 8 years after the first prize is not was of course 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.090
 mpe also shiny new is mat well exactly which in advance entirely own that 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.850
 that is very much more correct 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.960
 putting it down horizontally while being exactly sixty for that can nevertheless be far 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.050
 is vertical 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.910
 and apart from the shiny shots I think it's a nice box of effects 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.590
 tough look the clerck and on the sides we see stars 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.400
 and below and above 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.120
 You also see what it will therefore be a little mini PC already know it 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.380
 system cupboard 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.250
 and the silver comes back nicely in that name 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.350
 on off button in the industry in the the frame came to the ball and even one 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.240
 check 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.700
 yes those who want to catch up later that day 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.420
 and cyril dessel shiny the balls on my restaurant ball and if you 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.540
 that old time 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.680
 however what 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.050
 so header but that they do have very details to the outside about us we do 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.420
 not difficult about it but you can just do it everywhere 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.409
 then I think you will also have this process in June 9 with in the immediate vicinity 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.670
 lied about those are the steel really so 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.369
 sns 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.060
 next to it 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.390
 then you just see that it is three centimeters shorter but a little more 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.890
 her own say the eye 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.260
 we distinguish by year yes that seems to be now in both are in 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.250
 and 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.990
 the advantage of this competition is happening from 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.450
 learn that yes 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.810
 then you can see that we now see that it is a lot harder 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.039
 and if you then also to the side 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.530
 from my studies and on the road 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.939
 spring with you a secret belly 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.009
 and you see that 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.599
 the 250 gigabyte hard disk is also a lot of money played 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.629
 the institute you look forward to the bill just weird but where we are 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:23.950
 yet 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.369
 when the background have an hour of copies 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:30.849
 tchitÃ© really sorted out all he pushed together is very close 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.859
 you have already cleared each other from the three usb and jet porto about his swearing 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.379
 make two 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:37.509
 I'm in here 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:38.519
 rear end 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.959
 more DSB points crammed pretty close together 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.610
 and from that 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.779
 Kamal and sound capacity are very close together if you just have a little better one 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:56.299
 quality and he filled the office that are often very thick and buds 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:56.980
 sit on it 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.749
 and if you also have that sound 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:00.769
 I have I do sound glass myself 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.130
 that's right here 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.260
 so yeah i'm not bothered if you only use it for it 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.759
 sound then you come home it appears that there is not very well thought out 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:13.620
 what is well thought about is this ingredients drive cars 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.920
 for external devices and it already has an orange line here and yes that is 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.390
 course for kinect suggested that the dead are sticking with kinect and 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.050
 Immediately afterwards it is said that it is nice sitting a lot of time 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.739
 what must be promised and should be in construction 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.739
 but just let it sit tested 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:37.110
 also this is the test was serious young spread to his house he says damen 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.920
 that later confirmed that our have 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.390
 we are not going through the brit nba star they are not going to instigate any youth 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.889
 is right 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:48.600
 in europe i think the on off button also made me sorry but i countered 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.909
 employed the 3 2 another time also members refuse 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.259
 and tel 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:56.370
 he was really right 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.910
 very good for a small prize in the final against real madrid 0 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:03.119
 are exactly the same vs 

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:06.329
 deep down the slightly earlier said he recommends her own fraction of nothing 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.439
 but this is just talking about it 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.039
 but again comes first with his 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:13.329
 and 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.509
 this is just right 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:15.530
 the playground 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.170
 real jos ice tm wo the holes at the same time on the grounds 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.150
 where button press yes i find it very exciting to keep pressing zero became 3 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.909
 2 0 and then press and release the fabric and 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.129
 9 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:30.020
 what the breeder rehearses 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.970
 2 m 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.410
 0 also the year in which there was not quite the same a very small one and has 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.779
 never falls there 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:40.240
 negative 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.699
 but before i start there is more vacuuming start ma 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.330
 look is 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.280
 it doesn't matter much that was just a good end difference the two years later 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.280
 stand the vacuum cleaner 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:55.249
 and that is a bit like it seems 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.180
 I have made the questions here about this is a small lead 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:07.869
 slightly faster but that signal for the experience is important if you do one 

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:09.319
 much faster processor 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.089
 I think it's essentially not that much 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:15.089
 soon even better 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.990
 January others 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:25.729
 if a bit difficult because we had driven but I hope and I think so 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.729
 not want to say anything about putting a moped in the scooter and a scooter 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.560
 but that was this terribly profound test we have the noise 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.909
 have tested how fast it has been tested, the koenders factor boelenspark 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:43.630
 have discussed torrent design after rest remained the question do you buy this as is for 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:45.360
 success we are because 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.120
 there are some participation and in the end it is just a puck 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.120
 drove so I think the fans will buy it 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.210
 we just people 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.360
 still 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.780
 he went for achmea people who are now about to yes that seems to me 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.800
 It is clear that this is just some deliverable exports at the moment and 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.080
 he did that completely out of the assortment 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.349
 in the end yes, and in addition, smaller ones demand less 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:10.009
 he looks a bit slimmer to you 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:11.809
 it's from a municipality 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:14.880
 screening is very diverse play is breaking points 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.319
 You have 40 of the US PET Bottles circuit of things like that at home 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:22.460
 then you have nothing left that you can honor that have now been collected 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.830
 untraceable 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.850
 to be the 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.520
 if necessary they go from a trip in which the guy edese the 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.689
 prevail you see too 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:30.860
 but that the 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.020
 Yes of course 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.089
 you can get your flu 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:36.139
 in the long run we want to make it get rid of it 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.960
 I have the Swiss switch to the peace process and seven other two players 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.690
 think this is a festive shed 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.770
 I prefer justice you are right in it is one then but we have already tested 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.689
 but you can also say for half a year if he is still testing 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:52.760
 because yes then have to see that some ex boxers quit 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.749
 prematurely yes but that allow that joke name buried and just not 

00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:00.060
 beautiful device advantage of giving the doubt about free speech everywhere 

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:03.529
 each other again and then I just assume that he is still too 

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:06.529
 drink a lot and and and vener 

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:08.949
 does its job I wanted too
