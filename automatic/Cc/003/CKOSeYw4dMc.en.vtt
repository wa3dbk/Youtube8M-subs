00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
start building a base for Inferno squad

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.540 
start building a base for Inferno squad
I<00:00:09.719> already<00:00:09.870> tore<00:00:10.200> down<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> last<00:00:10.710> one<00:00:11.010> that's

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
all the things for that base are done so

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.640 
all the things for that base are done so
sort<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.650> like<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.840> guess<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.050> could<00:00:19.080> say<00:00:19.410> a

a lot of plant pieces for detailing
outside<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> base<00:01:13.680> I'm<00:01:14.040> getting<00:01:14.909> more

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
outside of the base I'm getting more

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.330 
outside of the base I'm getting more
because<00:01:15.750> I'm<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:16.049> up<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.170> lego<00:01:16.470> store<00:01:16.799> that
