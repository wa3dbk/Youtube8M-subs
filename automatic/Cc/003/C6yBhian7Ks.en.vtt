00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.490
 Hi 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.820
 Are you preparing something? 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.519
 different here back very beautiful 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.980
 this one is a new wallpaper that 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.439
 I just put the kingdom two roles 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.680
 Wall was beautiful to put on the wall 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.840
 a website they know about wallpaper 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.359
 cute cuddly and the coolest they are 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.980
 self-adhesive wall papers so do not 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.410
 It's that wallpaper you have 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.870
 to pass that liquid glue and then 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.120
 paste on the wall is super easy to pass 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.530
 works more or less as a contact 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.930
 I think I still had never shown 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.090
 a double room for you is a 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.210
 room that I have not moved too much says 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.289
 hates and is, although you want to do many 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.600
 changes 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.489
 so when I moved I made a head of 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.610
 field my bed was none too 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.930
 well I did not like the result 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.879
 and since then I already knew that I wanted to 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.309
 take off my head because I did not have 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.010
 liked the way it was and put a 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.379
 wallpaper when the wall million 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.610
 I said now that I take the one that 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.920
 will be ugly and puts the faults of pretty 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.110
 the walls were no longer painted on it 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.549
 each more or less with a half thing 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.340
 beige and not yellowish beige do not know 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.070
 this is the color if you never with paper of 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.470
 wall before it's first cool to spend a 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.259
 cloth in all the profiles that you 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.509
 will the paper remain to take some 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.119
 Such dirt and if you see that the wall 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.450
 has fairly regular surface 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.340
 she did not know and with sandpaper and licha well 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.930
 to leave beijing handsets that 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.090
 will leave the attitude even more 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.759
 nice after you with the wall 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.290
 just start applying the application of the 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.960
 dad 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.570
 see this is super easy to part 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.540
 It's even harder for you to start there. 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.090
 because then everything is quiet and 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.190
 also the most difficult part to do is 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.350
 always the part that one wall 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.420
 with the other because the fold of 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.120
 a wall for other times may not be 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.910
 so neat and the wallpaper goes 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.399
 a bit crooked but it's just a dog that 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.830
 everything works out when I'm up there 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.710
 and the first leaves the wallpaper well 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.200
 right across the wall and I use the 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.510
 crepe tape to help fix it there 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.610
 up and then put the first 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.000
 centimeters had already made up the tape 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.970
 crepe does not strip the color of the adhesive does not strip 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.610
 the plaster of the wall has not done anything she has 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.620
 people to contact the wall with both the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.170
 paper that I have here is 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.510
 fairly large and needs seven sheets 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.850
 to cover it each stage has more or 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.730
 two meters and 30 meters if I do not 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.160
 cheating out there is more than two meters 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.200
 so if you do not have a right foot 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.450
 very high if you live in a 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.780
 apartment suddenly the right foot 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.820
 tends to cede messi 30 out there a leaf 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.890
 you can cover the roof until the mall 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.769
 so it's super easy do not need to do 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.750
 no kind of income if you live in a 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.030
 place with the highest right foot you 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.239
 you'll probably have to do some 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.269
 amended then to buy a wallpaper 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.269
 with a larger height width of that paper 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.880
 wall that received 50 centimeters 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.550
 so I had to do seven months 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.670
 the application of the leaves I received four 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.380
 goals and every goal comes with two sheets 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.650
 then the total received eight leaves but 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.660
 somerset 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.090
 if you have ever used any wallpaper 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.500
 that it is not adhesive that needs 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.330
 hang glue 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.490
 You will love this wallpaper. 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.830
 sticker because it's much easier a lot 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.740
 more practical and the Garfe this paper 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.910
 wall is washable so if you only dirty 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.670
 it's not any fault 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.280
 everything in peace does not wear a print on the 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.140
 beginning and at the end of each leaf you go 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.900
 have to use a stylus to cut the 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.450
 then it comes very calm in the stylus 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.030
 not to cut the plaster from the wall or 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.830
 nothing if you have some outlet in the middle 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.740
 the wall you are going to apply the paper 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.080
 wall is just you paste normally and 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.270
 remove the excess with stylet when 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.000
 you finish one leaf go to another if 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.770
 you have patience you can join and 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.750
 make it sometimes 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.989
 You will find in it a more 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.090
 harmonious I did not cut off from far or give 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.480
 to realize that some flowers do not 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.660
 they were very accurate but if you 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.610
 have patience mainly you can 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.400
 do this and then more or less 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.770
 five hours of application was so I 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.440
 I loved the result I thought the paper 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.880
 leaving the environment well 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.030
 cozy because the background of this paper 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.160
 wall is half yellowish is not white 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.090
 then left the mood warm and 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.550
 Cozy and today I will not wear 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.860
 the loving partner she did not like 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.380
 here in my double room I solved 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.720
 not to put something so cute 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.520
 so pink as much as I like 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.770
 very colorful outside 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.350
 I said I will not put one more thing 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.770
 neutral because it's a double room, right? 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:08.199
 so I can not get no focal floral 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.330
 but it is the ones were on the WB is a convenience 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.520
 I will leave all the social networks of 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.949
 mark down here the shop is 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.320
 wallpaper dot com there you 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.330
 you can choose from multiple print options 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.190
 Wallpaper and is also cool 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.729
 because you have a calculator you can 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.250
 calculate the height and width of the 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.620
 wall you want to stay and they already give 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.940
 How many meters do you have to buy? 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.979
 you do not have to do a math 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.020
 very difficult, I hope you have 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.210
