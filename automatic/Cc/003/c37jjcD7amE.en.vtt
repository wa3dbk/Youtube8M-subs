see<00:01:22.200> some<00:01:22.470> interesting<00:01:22.740> things<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
see some interesting things going on and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.020 
see some interesting things going on and
change<00:01:24.600> with<00:01:25.170> Android<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.729> general

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
change with Android and in general

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.359 
change with Android and in general
because<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:28.259> haven't<00:01:28.530> really<00:01:28.650> seen<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.040> much

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
because we haven't really seen that much

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.120 
because we haven't really seen that much
interesting<00:01:29.850> happen<00:01:30.350> with<00:01:31.350> things<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
interesting happen with things like the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.039 
interesting happen with things like the
notification<00:01:32.729> area<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.119> think<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.689> needs<00:01:33.930> a

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
notification area I think that needs a

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.710 
notification area I think that needs a
lot<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.320> improvements<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.880> Android<00:01:36.390> because

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
lot of improvements in Android because

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.450 
lot of improvements in Android because
you<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.229> DoubleTap<00:01:37.950> sometimes

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
you have to like DoubleTap sometimes

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.660 
you have to like DoubleTap sometimes
even<00:01:39.119> tap<00:01:39.420> three<00:01:39.869> times<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.740> UI<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.130> use<00:01:41.520> to

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
even tap three times in the UI to use to

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.569 
even tap three times in the UI to use to
change<00:01:41.939> some<00:01:42.780> very<00:01:43.320> simple<00:01:43.680> basic<00:01:44.189> stuff<00:01:44.369> like

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
change some very simple basic stuff like

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.399 
change some very simple basic stuff like
brightness<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.600> sometimes<00:01:46.020> if<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.380> just

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
brightness and sometimes if you just

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.190 
brightness and sometimes if you just
want<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> change<00:01:47.009> rotation<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.659> not<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.110> to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
want to change rotation and not have to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.749 
want to change rotation and not have to
give<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.530> fully<00:01:49.770> into<00:01:50.009> settings<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.640> mean

you have to go for way into settings and

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.399 
you have to go for way into settings and
good<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.549> displaying<00:01:54.000> change<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:55.079> then<00:01:55.320> I

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
good like displaying change that then I

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.749 
good like displaying change that then I
think<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.619> screen<00:01:55.890> rotation<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.460> something

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
think a screen rotation is something

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.510 
think a screen rotation is something
that<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.060> many<00:01:57.930> times<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:59.219> want<00:01:59.430> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that you many times you you want to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.039 
that you many times you you want to
change<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.060> up<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.990> lot<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.570> like<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.780> kind

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
change that up a lot so like that kind

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.200 
change that up a lot so like that kind
of<00:02:04.079> sucks<00:02:04.350> over<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.219> face<00:02:05.399> doesn't<00:02:05.759> som<00:02:05.939> some

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
of sucks over the face doesn't som some

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.660 
of sucks over the face doesn't som some
and<00:02:06.450> refer<00:02:06.689> with<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> version<00:02:07.310> it<00:02:08.310> probably

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and refer with the version it probably

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.100 
and refer with the version it probably
will<00:02:08.759> come<00:02:08.970> here<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.300> like<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.450> 2k<00:02:09.929> resolution

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
will come here with like a 2k resolution

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.860 
will come here with like a 2k resolution
display<00:02:11.360> which<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.690> also<00:02:12.840> argue<00:02:13.110> like

all that so this will definitely be able
to<00:02:29.500> push<00:02:29.680> out<00:02:29.830> more<00:02:30.040> pixels<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:30.930> then<00:02:32.010> it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
to push out more pixels and then it

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.380 
to push out more pixels and then it
would<00:02:33.280> be<00:02:33.430> it's<00:02:33.760> going<00:02:33.879> to<00:02:33.909> be<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.030> big<00:02:34.269> it's

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
would be it's going to be a big it's

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.250 
would be it's going to be a big it's
gonna<00:02:34.480> be<00:02:34.629> a<00:02:34.659> bit<00:02:34.810> see<00:02:34.959> what's<00:02:35.079> going<00:02:35.200> to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
gonna be a bit see what's going to

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.869 
gonna be a bit see what's going to
happen<00:02:35.500> here<00:02:35.620> with<00:02:35.860> my<00:02:35.980> phone<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.370> mean<00:02:36.549> all

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
happen here with my phone so I mean all

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.100 
happen here with my phone so I mean all
ready<00:02:37.239> 1080p<00:02:37.510> phones<00:02:38.290> have<00:02:39.069> an<00:02:39.489> insane<00:02:40.480> pixel

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
ready 1080p phones have an insane pixel

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.000 
ready 1080p phones have an insane pixel
density<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.970> even<00:02:43.420> with<00:02:43.569> 2k<00:02:43.780> display<00:02:44.319> does<00:02:44.769> it

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
density so even with 2k display does it

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.830 
density so even with 2k display does it
scan<00:02:45.159> definitely<00:02:45.519> going<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.700> be<00:02:45.760> good<00:02:45.910> here

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
scan definitely going to be good here

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.680 
scan definitely going to be good here
for<00:02:47.200> if<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.709> would<00:02:47.950> be<00:02:48.099> like<00:02:48.459> an<00:02:48.609> 8-inch<00:02:49.209> tablet

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
for if it would be like an 8-inch tablet

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.289 
for if it would be like an 8-inch tablet
hopefully<00:02:50.319> also<00:02:50.440> they<00:02:50.620> will<00:02:50.650> be<00:02:50.829> able<00:02:50.920> to

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
hopefully also they will be able to

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.470 
hopefully also they will be able to
switch<00:02:52.299> up<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.599> maybe<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.620> camera<00:02:54.359> on<00:02:55.359> this

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
switch up the maybe the camera on this

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
switch up the maybe the camera on this
phone<00:02:55.540> even<00:02:55.959> though<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.200> I'm<00:02:56.319> not<00:02:56.470> sure

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
phone even though and I'm not sure

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.910 
phone even though and I'm not sure

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
that much on tablets but still fun to

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.830 
that much on tablets but still fun to
cover<00:03:12.370> these<00:03:12.730> cool<00:03:13.060> concepts<00:03:13.659> and

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
cover these cool concepts and

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.299 
cover these cool concepts and
interesting<00:03:14.260> designs<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:14.980> yeah<00:03:15.730> quick<00:03:16.000> video
