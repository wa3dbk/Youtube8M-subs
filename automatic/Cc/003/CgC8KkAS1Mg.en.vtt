00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.500
 he is seen his last time how hard it can be Roth in the 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.999
 Bavaria 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:11.009
 Percent have decreased around 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.409
 to act on the team have the surf old album 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:15.459
 Everything is possible 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.159
 and then he did that as well 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:20.429
 I am glad that we did it afterwards and now I'm overjoyed 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.890
 Percent does not convey much more exciting Brunner 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.150
 caught on the bad start by already she has used or so already 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.199
 survived 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.910
 as different as we had imagined, it was hard of course we have to do that 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.130
 Weather very compact in the back stands and 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.970
 Pacino often goes down and then he started so early the 1 0 course ours ours 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.720
 Concert thrown the mouth heap 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.820
 then there are further applied percent make only deserved compensation and 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.930
 the area yield has even made the 3 0 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.810
 He calls it 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.610
 We stayed here and certainly helped a bit 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.430
 where you have to say that will 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.490
 this will certainly also exclude the way they come back to disappear 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.830
 I missed and even defy it even outnumbered 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.290
 That would have allowed quite a few opportunities 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.790
 Of course, Bremen has 16 years of well combined wife Lisa Stöhr with two 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.040
 Man less 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.290
 in these strange more and but have little allowed and then he is 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.020
 the last minute have to be standard around 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.520
 Jens Rumpel Insite Meet is exchanging warmer calls but exchanged 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.530
 could concentrate well for the first game 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.650
 Erika if both offered appealing performance 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.580
 and behold games of the fire department Isa 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.640
 the sportsmanship has percent 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.730
 I do 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.060
 Vanessa already present at the game 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.160
 the score their friendship 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.850
 to some extent there was a guest of course hardware 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.880
 the stock market pro still 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.020
 Currently researched roots change less poor 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.790
 he's so well prepared I'm always gonna do it. " 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.230
 knew about them in the future too 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.479
 that with nine men in front 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.500
 Warner had to have their ingredients 30 yards from goal 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.320
 Nevertheless, it is quite feasible for De Wevers, for the first time in a few percent 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.800
 there are always trying to find the gaps 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.180
 and then yes that we are one or the other counter of that was us 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.299
 clear before 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.409
 they make it very well that you have to say of the 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.839
 Single players switch quickly and 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:17.889
 You have to compliment it harder 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.809
 There you have to say when percent possible in overpaid two men more pension 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.439
 he must be scary percent 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.530
 schwergetan age through the compact defensive 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.789
 to penetrate the Berlin and 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.849
 that made me so good we are then testing the funds would 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.599
 In the meantime, if that happens, it will turn out for Oslo »for our new one 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.980
 Situation and duties are part of it 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.479
 «We got along well that this was a fight victory 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.530
 after the game for us and 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.249
 m Weller harder storm so you meet then the break start in front 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:51.249
 only what way for new elections give the counter around 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.849
 unfortunately we were never to flour or the note in some situations 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.199
 abandoned and that was 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.559
 our plus every use then listening to the ball being held up too long 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:03.889
 should have faster game students 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.159
 the players must search so on 1 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.870
 and wherever it is focused on the outside and at the right concept 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.079
 and yes 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.659
 Pauli logical that percent had to go through a standard situation in China and he 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.909
 so also comes short drive I believe the UL that was the point it will be 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.379
 Somehow we knew we were finished twice a year 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.419
 Brentel we are those of Stetten under the ground as really scared 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:27.639
 you had the feeling 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.039
 just like they are with you 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.829
 Sete had to have lost SAP and ca 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:36.939
 the percent 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.709
 That's the only way I would do that Chrysler can come up with such a situation 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.129
 the rattle 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.129
 the games Viletta be in Hannover or in Stuttgart 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.629
 German clapping got 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.209
 to Wiersch one could still hope and and and do better 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.230
 want this year this is all well done so far is all happenings 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.779
 are team play 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:58.499
 to average 16 points after 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:02.650
 that's the way it's annoying Mersch what we expected but 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:06.059
 I know what we want and what we expect from us 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:09.789
 Of course he wants to slow me down but Schonach came 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.810
 yes and about fences team stuck and i believe that we still have his im 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:17.639
 Field you can see it at Luther's percent that is finished instead of one 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.750
 Week after week always great atmosphere and percent down otherwise see 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:22.300
 me too 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.870
 pushed forward until then until the end - "and that's just important 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.379
 central 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:28.669
 Percent beautiful 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.240
 here in Bremen also OLG discounts last summer but at home 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.300
 far from good, Davide di 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.950
 to collect the points and percent as well as the way further
