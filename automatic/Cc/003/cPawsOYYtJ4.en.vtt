thought that Virginia share when she did
it<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.730> 7x<00:00:45.269> plan<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.629> don't<00:00:45.840> cheat<00:00:46.199> but<00:00:46.469> I

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
it and I 7x plan I don't cheat but I

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.470 
it and I 7x plan I don't cheat but I
