00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.710
 I have a little something on New Year's Eve 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.929
 tinkering that is a candle 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.420
 and when it burns, you see 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.710
 then someday the saying of himself 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.470
 hides underneath 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.270
 i thought thats a sweet idea to someone 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.720
 a little joy to prepare 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.230
 a little lucky charm fortune cookie 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.960
 so to speak only as a candle so luck 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.170
 candle I wish you a lot of fun 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.170
 when tinkering and giving away 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.910
 needed for it are different 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.640
 Dekkoartikel you then at the 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.090
 Bordered by the candle attached to it 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.700
 a rock cloverleaf middle class 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.010
 Print the device or the flowers 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.010
 There are different possibilities 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.980
 you can choose then you still need 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.940
 a candle that is, a teelicht it is 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:04.089
 Of course great if the tealight the 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.740
 But it is mobile if you are 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.930
 Now your daughter has that easy on him 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.390
 could pull out completely that is 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.610
 so could all of the simplest 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.270
 that is much easier then 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.250
 fix 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.340
 I have another document for you 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.280
 created it in the infobox of the link 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.079
 You've got everything ready for you 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.759
 you have to just cut a 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.960
 making small hole in and then have 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.569
 you have the speech ready 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.399
 then needed a hole tongs or a 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:32.590
 Nail scissors could also be used 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.350
 make the hole 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.149
 a stand-still device around now 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:44.210
 dekomaterial to do it now here 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:46.760
 leafy cloverleaves a pistol 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.409
 in their full you can print 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.450
 they just get off 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.909
 that's very convenient, you have 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.130
 all the same with sayings hold 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.830
 but to make it yourself wanted a smooth 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.320
 completely together and takes 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.660
 so it records and then becomes 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.270
 simply diligently cut around 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.040
 the harder it is and there you have to 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.910
 but every single place itself 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.730
 label 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.230
 the country just does a lot more work 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.090
 as the things of the individual 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.300
 to cut out I found now personally 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.250
 then take a punch or you can 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.500
 Also take a nail scissors around that 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.930
 small hole to make it for the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.690
 but had namely by which is 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.280
 very important because I not 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.790
 stability brings because if not so 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.950
 is then there just because you to the 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.500
 page and then there was the fact with 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.420
 So put the candle through it 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.670
 but these are the best candles to 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.110
 The other candles can take for that 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.180
 are a bit harder to show 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.100
 but then I will and then 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.020
 we stick the pages now 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.580
 I have some sticky tape now 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.010
 and now I just have that 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.750
 made around 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.360
 Of course you can also join us 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.930
 individual pieces work that makes you 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.019
 then turn it on with the hot glue gun or 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.450
 halter roman and all kinds you can 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.989
 Actually, everything is sticking on it 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.400
 what you like about what you like 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.400
 that it is completely up to you 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.400
 more difficult it now these 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:28.240
 candle then he is 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:32.380
 teneriffa detach the lower part 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:35.050
 he is empty so it is 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.050
 harder because he has to be really real 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.270
 flashing otherwise gives you the best 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.820
 the other candles next to it are easier 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.720
 now you have to go through it 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.380
 and also quite right the smell 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.230
 catch 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.670
 The whole thing looks like it is still there 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.490
 partly burned or not 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.810
 burned and that's what they look like when 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.209
 it starts then 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.980
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.470
 neighbor i hope it has you 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.580
 again my video presses 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.410
 I like it and subscribe 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.000
 So it's good and slipped 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.000
 bÃ¤ndchen demanding
