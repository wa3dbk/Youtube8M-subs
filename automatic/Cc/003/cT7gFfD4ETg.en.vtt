00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.060
 a little bit scared 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.210
 we are both not necessarily fans 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.500
 from star wars star trek blablabla up 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.910

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.869

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.699
 It even costs us on a super t-shirt 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.350
 actually in 1990 and yes as I always do 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.960
 say the t shirts have great quality 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.570
 we are absolutely satisfied because you have 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.020

 These are chewing gum and taste great 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.939
 Delicious but the inside is quite whole 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.950
