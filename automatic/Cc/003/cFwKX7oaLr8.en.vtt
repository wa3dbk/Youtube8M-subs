from up here you want to count over this
massive<00:01:07.490> event<00:01:07.750> machine<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:08.900> then<00:01:09.500> jump<00:01:09.799> out

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
massive event machine and then jump out

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.399 
massive event machine and then jump out
across<00:01:10.189> to<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.640> other<00:01:10.670> one<00:01:11.060> now<00:01:11.689> this<00:01:11.960> one<00:01:12.020> can

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
across to the other one now this one can

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.780 
across to the other one now this one can
get<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.590> little<00:01:12.799> bit<00:01:12.890> tricky<00:01:13.130> now<00:01:13.369> doing<00:01:13.580> this

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
get a little bit tricky now doing this

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.310 
get a little bit tricky now doing this
because<00:01:14.030> what<00:01:14.299> you<00:01:14.360> got<00:01:14.479> to<00:01:14.570> do<00:01:14.659> is<00:01:14.689> gonna<00:01:14.960> jump

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
because what you got to do is gonna jump

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.410 
because what you got to do is gonna jump
at<00:01:15.500> that<00:01:15.560> wall<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:16.520> when<00:01:16.759> you<00:01:16.850> jump<00:01:17.030> in<00:01:17.119> at<00:01:17.210> war

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
at that wall and when you jump in at war

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.330 
at that wall and when you jump in at war
you<00:01:17.570> can't<00:01:17.780> do<00:01:17.930> this<00:01:18.110> thing<00:01:18.350> here<00:01:18.619> now<00:01:19.040> you<00:01:19.100> do

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
you can't do this thing here now you do

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.039 
you can't do this thing here now you do
feel<00:01:19.549> sometimes<00:01:19.880> at<00:01:20.299> it<00:01:20.420> so<00:01:20.570> you<00:01:20.659> go<00:01:20.750> try<00:01:21.020> it

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
feel sometimes at it so you go try it

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.899 
feel sometimes at it so you go try it
again<00:01:21.200> once<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.159> do<00:01:22.280> it<00:01:22.369> again<00:01:22.610> you'll

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
again once you do it again you'll

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.700 
again once you do it again you'll
actually<00:01:23.150> jump<00:01:23.570> into<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.140> wall<00:01:24.290> which<00:01:24.470> nice

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
actually jump into the wall which nice

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.920 
actually jump into the wall which nice
is<00:01:24.920> a<00:01:24.979> really<00:01:25.310> cool<00:01:25.520> because<00:01:25.909> I've<00:01:26.450> never<00:01:26.509> seen

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
is a really cool because I've never seen

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.929 
is a really cool because I've never seen
anything<00:01:27.229> like<00:01:27.320> this<00:01:27.650> before<00:01:27.829> basically<00:01:28.820> it

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
anything like this before basically it

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.359 
anything like this before basically it
actually<00:01:29.240> now<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.869> drop<00:01:30.079> down<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:30.560> serve

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
actually now you drop down and serve

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.069 
actually now you drop down and serve
like<00:01:31.610> coming<00:01:31.909> outwards<00:01:32.119> you<00:01:32.630> go<00:01:32.780> actually

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
like coming outwards you go actually

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.350 
like coming outwards you go actually
into<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:33.920> wall<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:34.700> now<00:01:34.880> you're<00:01:35.060> in<00:01:35.180> a<00:01:35.240> war

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
into the wall so now you're in a war
