system just by increasing the virtual

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.750 
system just by increasing the virtual
memory<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.730> are<00:00:52.100> enabling<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.370> system<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
memory we are enabling the system to

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.270

have<00:00:53.910> more<00:00:54.149> cache<00:00:54.570> memory<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.170> due<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> which

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
have more cache memory and due to which

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.799 
have more cache memory and due to which
your<00:00:56.460> system<00:00:56.789> will<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:57.090> significant

had<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.220> use<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:12.330> move<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.690> my

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
had to use it just move it on my

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.750 
had to use it just move it on my
computer<00:02:13.200> advanced<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.280> performance

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
computer advanced and in the performance

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.760 
computer advanced and in the performance
settings<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.630> will<00:02:15.750> go<00:02:15.900> for<00:02:16.080> advanced<00:02:16.530> again

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
settings you will go for advanced again

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.350 
settings you will go for advanced again
and<00:02:17.010> then<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.370> go<00:02:17.580> for<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.850> virtual<00:02:18.120> memory

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
and then you go for the virtual memory

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.840 
and then you go for the virtual memory
change<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.770> this<00:02:19.890> virtual<00:02:20.310> memory<00:02:20.489> you

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
change and in this virtual memory you

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.309 
change and in this virtual memory you
find<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.390> pendrive<00:02:21.660> here

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
find the pendrive here

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.070 
find the pendrive here
Oh<00:02:23.489> Grey's<00:02:23.819> one<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.209> my<00:02:24.330> friends<00:02:24.690> been<00:02:24.840> dry

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
Oh Grey's one of my friends been dry

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.130 
Oh Grey's one of my friends been dry
which<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.770> think<00:02:26.010> 4gb<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.110> is

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
which is I think 4gb and in this it is

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.440 
which is I think 4gb and in this it is
asking<00:02:28.590> for<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:28.800> size<00:02:29.130> here<00:02:29.400> actually<00:02:29.550> actually

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
asking for a size here actually actually

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.949 
asking for a size here actually actually
I<00:02:30.690> already<00:02:30.989> changed<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.780> here<00:02:33.780> as<00:02:33.930> you

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
I already changed it and here as you

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.840 
I already changed it and here as you
find<00:02:34.320> when<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.590> click<00:02:34.769> on<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.100> grace<00:02:35.400> you

find when you click on this grace you
will<00:02:36.739> you<00:02:37.739> will<00:02:37.860> find<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.459> custom<00:02:38.880> size

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
will you will find that this custom size

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.699 
will you will find that this custom size
here<00:02:39.680> would<00:02:40.680> not<00:02:40.830> have<00:02:41.010> got<00:02:41.220> enabled<00:02:42.709> this

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
its enable because I clicked it you just

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.850 
its enable because I clicked it you just
select<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.030> custom<00:02:48.390> size<00:02:48.600> go<00:02:49.170> for<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.500> custom

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
select the custom size go for the custom

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.500 
select the custom size go for the custom

size and when you go for custom size

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.570 
size and when you go for custom size
probably<00:02:52.440> like<00:02:52.739> if<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:52.950> are<00:02:52.980> using<00:02:53.040> any<00:02:53.370> duo

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
probably like if you are using any duo

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.540 
probably like if you are using any duo
call<00:02:53.880> code<00:02:54.720> quad<00:02:55.050> core<00:02:55.290> duo<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.920> mean<00:02:56.370> whatever

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
call code quad core duo I mean whatever

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.430 
call code quad core duo I mean whatever
its<00:02:56.880> if<00:02:57.150> it's<00:02:57.269> off<00:02:57.450> if<00:02:57.750> your<00:02:57.930> system<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.290> of

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
its if it's off if your system is of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.750 
its if it's off if your system is of
higher<00:02:58.590> higher<00:02:59.100> versions<00:02:59.489> of<00:02:59.579> your

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
higher higher versions of your

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.100 
higher higher versions of your
motherboard<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.209> processor<00:03:00.600> then<00:03:00.750> it's<00:03:00.870> okay

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
motherboard and processor then it's okay

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.770 
motherboard and processor then it's okay
fine<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:02.040> can<00:03:02.070> even<00:03:02.730> go<00:03:02.970> ahead<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.239> set<00:03:03.660> this

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
fine you can even go ahead and set this

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.690 
fine you can even go ahead and set this
to<00:03:03.840> higher<00:03:04.079> values<00:03:04.470> but<00:03:05.100> I'll<00:03:05.220> tell<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.489> what

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
to higher values but I'll tell you what

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.759 
to higher values but I'll tell you what
well<00:03:05.880> here<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.329> I<00:03:06.570> think<00:03:07.260> it's<00:03:07.470> better<00:03:07.680> if

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
well here is it I think it's better if

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.430 
well here is it I think it's better if
you<00:03:07.950> go<00:03:07.980> for<00:03:08.450> 1gb<00:03:09.450> RAM<00:03:09.660> you're<00:03:10.230> just

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
you go for 1gb RAM you're just

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.740 
you go for 1gb RAM you're just
increasing<00:03:11.250> your<00:03:11.760> virtual<00:03:12.120> memory<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.480> be<00:03:12.570> 1

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
increasing your virtual memory to be 1

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.030 
increasing your virtual memory to be 1
GB<00:03:13.049> so<00:03:13.739> 1<00:03:14.010> GB<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.459> had<00:03:14.549> including<00:03:15.180> euro<00:03:16.040> insert

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
GB so 1 GB you had including euro insert

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.560 
GB so 1 GB you had including euro insert
the<00:03:17.160> values<00:03:17.519> here<00:03:17.670> as<00:03:17.850> is<00:03:18.000> as<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.329> is<00:03:18.420> stated

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
the values here as is as it is stated

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.199 
the values here as is as it is stated
you<00:03:18.870> are<00:03:18.989> insert<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.410> values<00:03:19.940> initial<00:03:20.940> value

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
you are insert the values initial value

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.830 
you are insert the values initial value
on<00:03:21.329> maximum<00:03:21.720> size<00:03:21.959> in<00:03:22.230> MB<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.730> let's<00:03:24.540> say<00:03:24.690> we

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
on maximum size in MB so let's say we

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.199 
on maximum size in MB so let's say we
are<00:03:24.870> going<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.109> make<00:03:25.340> 1<00:03:26.340> GB<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.730> virtual<00:03:27.060> memory

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
are going to make 1 GB of virtual memory

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:35.270 
are going to make 1 GB of virtual memory
1<00:03:27.720> GB<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.230> around<00:03:29.480> 1024<00:03:30.480> MB<00:03:33.260> this<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.440> 8,000<00:03:34.920> 24

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
1 GB is around 1024 MB this is 8,000 24

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.960 
1 GB is around 1024 MB this is 8,000 24
MB<00:03:35.720> so<00:03:36.720> just<00:03:37.459> take<00:03:38.459> this<00:03:38.640> value<00:03:39.030> off<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.810> type

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
MB so just take this value off and type

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.180 
MB so just take this value off and type
thousand<00:03:42.440> 2020<00:03:43.440> will<00:03:43.560> do<00:03:43.650> don't<00:03:43.859> exactly

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
thousand 2020 will do don't exactly
