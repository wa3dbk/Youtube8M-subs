in<00:00:02.850> this<00:00:03.360> lesson<00:00:03.570> we're<00:00:03.840> going<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:03.989> talk<00:00:04.200> about

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
in this lesson we're going to talk about

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.640 
in this lesson we're going to talk about
pitcher<00:00:04.950> release<00:00:05.280> points<00:00:05.900> really<00:00:06.900> if<00:00:07.200> we're

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:07.650 
pitcher release points really if we're

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.820 
pitcher release points really if we're
interested<00:00:07.860> in<00:00:08.340> eating<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.669> baseball<00:00:09.150> it's

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
interested in eating the baseball it's

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.230 
interested in eating the baseball it's
crucial<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:11.039> pick<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.580> ball<00:00:11.789> up<00:00:11.820> as

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
crucial that we pick the ball up as

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.089 
crucial that we pick the ball up as
early<00:00:12.509> as<00:00:12.749> we<00:00:12.900> can<00:00:12.929> out<00:00:13.289> of<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.469> pitchers<00:00:13.619> hand

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
early as we can out of the pitchers hand

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.550 
early as we can out of the pitchers hand
and<00:00:14.369> so<00:00:14.999> in<00:00:15.329> order<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.599> do<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.170> for<00:00:16.410> any

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
and so in order to do that for any

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.050 
and so in order to do that for any
pitcher<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:17.189> need<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.460> know<00:00:17.609> what<00:00:17.880> his

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
pitcher you need to know what his

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.720 
pitcher you need to know what his
release<00:00:18.390> point<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.619> release<00:00:19.920> point<00:00:20.250> is

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
release point is the release point is

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.079 
release point is the release point is
where<00:00:21.449> his<00:00:21.720> hand<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.289> where<00:00:22.650> his<00:00:22.800> arm<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.369> when

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:24.089 
where his hand is where his arm is when

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.849 
where his hand is where his arm is when
he's<00:00:24.359> released<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:24.990> baseball<00:00:25.500> as<00:00:25.589> part<00:00:25.830> of

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
he's released in the baseball as part of

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.349 
he's released in the baseball as part of
his<00:00:25.980> pitching<00:00:26.400> motion<00:00:26.820> that's<00:00:27.000> that's

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
his pitching motion that's that's

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.480 
his pitching motion that's that's
considered<00:00:27.900> his<00:00:28.080> release<00:00:28.439> point<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.980> that's

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
considered his release point and that's

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.710 
considered his release point and that's
where<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.789> want<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.999> be<00:00:30.060> able<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.330> pick<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:30.509> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
where we want to be able to pick up the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.200 
where we want to be able to pick up the
ball<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.650> some<00:00:32.070> pictures<00:00:32.490> come<00:00:32.730> over<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.180> top

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
ball so some pictures come over the top

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.270 
ball so some pictures come over the top
and<00:00:33.780> they're<00:00:34.289> going<00:00:34.379> to<00:00:34.440> have<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> very<00:00:34.800> high

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
and they're going to have a very high

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.850 
and they're going to have a very high
release<00:00:35.760> point<00:00:36.149> next<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.690> their<00:00:36.840> head<00:00:37.079> some

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
release point next to their head some

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.560 
release point next to their head some
pictures<00:00:38.250> are<00:00:38.460> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.699> be<00:00:38.879> more<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
pictures are going to be more to the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.290 
pictures are going to be more to the
side<00:00:39.809> some<00:00:40.320> will<00:00:40.500> even<00:00:40.530> be<00:00:40.949> lower<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.120> need

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
side some will even be lower so we need

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.240 
side some will even be lower so we need
to<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.449> able<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.930> pick<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.289> that<00:00:43.320> ball<00:00:43.800> from

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
to be able to pick up that ball from

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.340 
to be able to pick up that ball from
that<00:00:44.430> release<00:00:44.760> point<00:00:44.879> that's<00:00:45.600> one<00:00:45.899> reason<00:00:46.109> why

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
that release point that's one reason why

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.319 
that release point that's one reason why
it's<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.770> critical<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.399> stay<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.940> picture

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
it's so critical to stay the picture

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.540 
it's so critical to stay the picture
when<00:00:48.510> you're<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.530> dugout<00:00:49.739> or<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
when you're in the dugout or on the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.759 
when you're in the dugout or on the
on-deck<00:00:50.760> circle<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.989> need<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.289> know<00:00:52.469> where

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
on-deck circle you need to know where

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.319 
on-deck circle you need to know where
the<00:00:52.920> ball<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.129> coming<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:54.030> able<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the ball is coming out and be able to

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.569 
the ball is coming out and be able to
pick<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.539> up<00:00:54.859> now<00:00:55.859> there's<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.190> couple<00:00:56.399> of

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
pick that up now there's a couple of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.330 
pick that up now there's a couple of
ways<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.480> one<00:00:58.109> way<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.679> can<00:00:59.010> try<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
ways to do it one way you can try to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.240 
ways to do it one way you can try to
follow<00:00:59.640> his<00:01:00.090> hand<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:01.050> entire<00:01:01.500> way<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:01.920> you're

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
follow his hand the entire way so you're

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.009 
follow his hand the entire way so you're
just<00:01:02.370> going<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.640> try<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.879> follow<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.510> ball<00:01:03.719> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
just going to try to follow the ball and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.679 
just going to try to follow the ball and
so<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.890> pitcher<00:01:04.920> gets<00:01:05.460> into<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.820> stretch<00:01:06.240> as<00:01:06.540> he

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
so the pitcher gets into a stretch as he

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.450 
so the pitcher gets into a stretch as he
starts<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.110> stretch<00:01:07.470> maybe<00:01:07.680> his<00:01:07.920> arm<00:01:08.130> drops

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
starts to stretch maybe his arm drops

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.880 
starts to stretch maybe his arm drops
back<00:01:08.790> comes<00:01:09.330> through<00:01:09.750> you're<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.560> watching

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
back comes through you're just watching

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.460 
back comes through you're just watching
that<00:01:11.189> all<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.729> way<00:01:11.909> okay<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.110> try

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
that all the way okay so you can try

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.429 
that all the way okay so you can try
that<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:14.100> method<00:01:14.720> some<00:01:15.720> pictures<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.320> can

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
that as one method some pictures you can

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.520 
that as one method some pictures you can
do<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.890> with<00:01:17.159> others<00:01:17.970> do<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.720> pretty<00:01:19.320> good<00:01:19.409> job

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
do that with others do a pretty good job

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.499 
do that with others do a pretty good job
of<00:01:19.740> hiding<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.340> baseball<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.329> watch

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
of hiding the baseball and if you watch

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.179 
of hiding the baseball and if you watch
Major<00:01:21.810> League<00:01:22.049> Baseball<00:01:22.439> tell<00:01:22.650> castles

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
Major League Baseball tell castles

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.710 
Major League Baseball tell castles
sometimes<00:01:23.700> you'll<00:01:23.850> hear<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.119> announcer<00:01:24.479> say

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
sometimes you'll hear the announcer say

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.190 
sometimes you'll hear the announcer say
the<00:01:25.439> picture<00:01:25.770> really<00:01:26.040> hides<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.610> ball<00:01:26.790> well

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
the picture really hides the ball well

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.899 
the picture really hides the ball well
basically<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.409> means<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.430> picture

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
basically what that means is a picture

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.840 
basically what that means is a picture
comes<00:01:30.180> forward<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.590> ball<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.829> behind<00:01:32.159> his

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
comes forward the ball is behind his

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.960 
comes forward the ball is behind his
body<00:01:33.149> so<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.470> here<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.430> can't<00:01:35.729> see

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
body so you can see here you can't see

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.300 
body so you can see here you can't see
the<00:01:36.149> baseball<00:01:36.390> at<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.049> point<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.740> then

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the baseball at this point and then

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.679 
the baseball at this point and then
that's<00:01:38.579> what's<00:01:38.820> considered<00:01:39.119> hiding<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
that's what's considered hiding the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.389 
that's what's considered hiding the
baseball<00:01:40.170> well<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.680> then<00:01:40.890> all<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.369> sudden

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
baseball well and then all of a sudden

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.300 
baseball well and then all of a sudden
it<00:01:41.850> will<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.180> appear<00:01:42.689> as<00:01:42.930> he<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.439> he<00:01:43.950> turns

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
it will just appear as he as he turns

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.760 
it will just appear as he as he turns
and<00:01:44.610> delivers<00:01:44.969> the<00:01:45.149> baseball<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.590> that

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and delivers the baseball and so that

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.499 
and delivers the baseball and so that
can<00:01:46.920> make<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.250> difficult<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:48.210> type<00:01:48.479> of

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
can make it difficult that type of

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.300 
can make it difficult that type of
picture<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.200> very<00:01:49.500> difficult<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.040> try<00:01:50.250> to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
picture can be very difficult to try to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.910 
picture can be very difficult to try to
follow<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.729> ball<00:01:51.000> all<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.270> way<00:01:51.560> what<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.590> can

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
follow the ball all the way what you can

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740 
follow the ball all the way what you can
do<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> pitcher<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.909> does<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.420> or<00:01:54.570> with

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
do with a pitcher that does that or with

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.740 
do with a pitcher that does that or with
really<00:01:55.079> any<00:01:55.320> pitcher<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.180> use<00:01:57.450> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
really any pitcher is you can use a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.109 
really any pitcher is you can use a
reference<00:01:58.259> point<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.070> pitchers<00:01:59.460> body<00:01:59.759> and

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
reference point on the pitchers body and

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.209 
reference point on the pitchers body and
the<00:02:00.240> reason<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.719> do<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.950> our

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
the reason we do that is to have our

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.300 
the reason we do that is to have our
eyes<00:02:02.659> it<00:02:03.659> basically<00:02:03.840> adjusted<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.039> same

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
eyes it basically adjusted it the same

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.490 
eyes it basically adjusted it the same
distance<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.719> ball<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.439> be

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
distance that the ball is going to be

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.650 
distance that the ball is going to be
coming<00:02:07.680> from<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.340> we're<00:02:08.880> staring<00:02:09.240> off<00:02:09.630> into

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
coming from if we're staring off into

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.130 
coming from if we're staring off into
centerfield<00:02:11.120> some<00:02:12.120> players<00:02:12.330> are<00:02:12.630> able<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.990> do

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
centerfield some players are able to do

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.040 
centerfield some players are able to do
it<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.410> never

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
it I never

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.230 
it I never
if<00:02:14.410> I'm<00:02:14.590> staring<00:02:14.980> off<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.370> centerfield<00:02:16.000> and

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
if I'm staring off to centerfield and

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.020 
if I'm staring off to centerfield and
all<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.840> sudden<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.320> ball<00:02:17.560> appears<00:02:18.030> that

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
all of a sudden the ball appears that

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.930 
all of a sudden the ball appears that
the<00:02:19.620> adjustment<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.740> my<00:02:20.890> eyes<00:02:21.070> have<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.700> make

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
the adjustment that my eyes have to make

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.020 
the adjustment that my eyes have to make
to<00:02:22.240> get<00:02:22.420> from<00:02:23.020> center<00:02:23.710> field<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:24.370> where<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
to get from center field to where the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.000 
to get from center field to where the
ball<00:02:25.240> is<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:26.110> felt<00:02:26.320> like<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:26.590> couldn't<00:02:26.830> pick

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
it up early enough it took me too long

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.380 
it up early enough it took me too long
to<00:02:28.750> adjust<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:30.160> what<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.370> try<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.790> do<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.240> what<00:02:31.360> a

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
to adjust so what I try to do and what a

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.940 
to adjust so what I try to do and what a
lot<00:02:31.630> of<00:02:31.750> players<00:02:31.930> do<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.410> they<00:02:32.500> try<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.740> pick

something that you're going to have a

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.620 
something that you're going to have a
tough<00:02:59.620> time<00:02:59.830> doing<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.430> for<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.700> long<00:03:00.910> period

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
tough time doing that for a long period

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.780 
tough time doing that for a long period
of<00:03:01.870> time<00:03:01.930> so<00:03:02.440> really<00:03:02.770> what<00:03:02.950> we<00:03:03.100> want<00:03:03.130> on<00:03:03.700> the

of time so really what we want on the
picture<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.270> just<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.630> soft<00:03:04.930> focus<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:06.070> you

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
picture is just a soft focus so you

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.010 
picture is just a soft focus so you
might<00:03:06.550> pick<00:03:06.790> out<00:03:07.000> if<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.300> pitchers<00:03:07.660> release

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
might pick out if the pitchers release

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.260 
might pick out if the pitchers release
point<00:03:08.380> is<00:03:08.500> right<00:03:08.770> next<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.160> their<00:03:09.400> hat<00:03:09.640> you

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
might just soft focus right in on the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.880 
might just soft focus right in on the
Hat<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.570> as<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.140> picture<00:03:14.350> is<00:03:14.500> going<00:03:14.710> through

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
Hat so as the picture is going through

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.230 
Hat so as the picture is going through
is<00:03:15.010> wind<00:03:15.250> up<00:03:15.460> you're<00:03:15.610> watching<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.030> hat

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
is wind up you're watching a hat

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.120 
is wind up you're watching a hat
watching<00:03:16.690> your<00:03:16.750> hat<00:03:16.990> watch<00:03:17.230> in<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.710> hat<00:03:17.920> and

watching your hat watch in the hat and

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.010 
watching your hat watch in the hat and
then<00:03:18.610> as<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.910> ball<00:03:19.090> comes<00:03:19.300> up<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.840> release
