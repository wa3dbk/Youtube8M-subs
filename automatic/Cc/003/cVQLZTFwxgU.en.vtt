00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
of that vibrant red color that I had

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.840 
of that vibrant red color that I had
gotten<00:03:17.430> from<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.330> first<00:03:18.540> time<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.810> did<00:03:18.959> henna

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
with the red wine vinegar I really

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.590 
with the red wine vinegar I really
thought<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:23.010> was<00:03:23.190> gonna<00:03:23.400> get<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:24.360> more

you guys have seen however I know that

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.650 
you guys have seen however I know that
once<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.459> oxidizes<00:03:30.060> it's<00:03:30.239> gonna<00:03:30.360> look<00:03:30.540> a

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
once it oxidizes it's gonna look a

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.960 
once it oxidizes it's gonna look a
little<00:03:30.780> bit<00:03:30.959> different<00:03:31.320> so<00:03:32.220> I<00:03:32.250> do<00:03:32.430> like<00:03:32.760> this

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
little bit different so I do like this

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.110 
little bit different so I do like this
color<00:03:33.239> it's<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.870> very<00:03:34.080> nice<00:03:34.320> color<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.030> once<00:03:36.030> I

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
color it's a very nice color and once I

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.610 
color it's a very nice color and once I

red<00:04:10.890> and<00:04:11.510> it's<00:04:12.510> was<00:04:12.989> covered<00:04:13.440> covering<00:04:14.160> the

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
red and it's was covered covering the

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.670 
red and it's was covered covering the
natural<00:04:15.630> red<00:04:15.750> that<00:04:15.900> I<00:04:15.930> had<00:04:16.140> so<00:04:16.290> it's<00:04:16.380> probably

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
natural red that I had so it's probably

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.800 
natural red that I had so it's probably
why<00:04:16.769> it's<00:04:16.919> a<00:04:16.979> little<00:04:17.160> bit<00:04:17.250> darker<00:04:17.580> because<00:04:18.570> I

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
why it's a little bit darker because I

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.570 
why it's a little bit darker because I
hadn't<00:04:19.080> Oliver<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.500> going<00:04:19.739> it's<00:04:20.310> really

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
hadn't Oliver and going it's really

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.430 
hadn't Oliver and going it's really
gonna<00:04:20.669> depend<00:04:20.760> on<00:04:21.150> your<00:04:21.330> hair<00:04:21.750> color<00:04:21.989> when<00:04:22.350> you

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
gonna depend on your hair color when you

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.730 
gonna depend on your hair color when you
first<00:04:23.120> apply<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.270> so<00:04:25.020> if<00:04:25.140> my<00:04:25.320> hair<00:04:25.560> would<00:04:25.710> have

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
first apply it so if my hair would have

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.110 
first apply it so if my hair would have
been<00:04:25.830> lighter<00:04:26.190> I<00:04:26.310> think<00:04:26.640> that<00:04:26.789> this<00:04:26.940> would

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
been lighter I think that this would

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.170 
been lighter I think that this would
have<00:04:27.240> taken<00:04:27.390> a<00:04:27.810> lot<00:04:28.320> brighter<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:29.460> here<00:04:29.940> it<00:04:30.030> is

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
have taken a lot brighter so here it is

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.820 
have taken a lot brighter so here it is
