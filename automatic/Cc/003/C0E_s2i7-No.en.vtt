procedure using a computer transmitter
as<00:00:27.259> well<00:00:27.439> so<00:00:28.189> let's<00:00:28.369> get<00:00:28.490> to<00:00:28.609> the<00:00:28.669> receiver

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.380 

first<00:00:36.500> step<00:00:36.770> once<00:00:36.949> the<00:00:37.129> canopy<00:00:37.520> is<00:00:37.640> removed<00:00:37.940> on

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
first step once the canopy is removed on

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.880 
first step once the canopy is removed on
this<00:00:38.809> particular<00:00:39.050> vehicle<00:00:39.379> you'll<00:00:39.680> see<00:00:39.859> a

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
this particular vehicle you'll see a

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.410 
this particular vehicle you'll see a
little<00:00:40.399> fly<00:00:40.579> lead<00:00:40.789> with<00:00:40.940> nothing<00:00:41.239> plugged

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
little fly lead with nothing plugged

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.599 
little fly lead with nothing plugged
into<00:00:41.600> it<00:00:41.780> that's<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.230> bind<00:00:42.469> port<00:00:42.770> so<00:00:43.520> we're

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
into it that's the bind port so we're

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.189 
into it that's the bind port so we're
going<00:00:43.699> to<00:00:43.760> bind<00:00:43.969> plate<00:00:44.270> which<00:00:44.570> is<00:00:44.719> included

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
going to bind plate which is included

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:46.779 
going to bind plate which is included
with<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.500> car<00:00:45.710> it's<00:00:45.980> a<00:00:46.010> little<00:00:46.250> hardware<00:00:46.579> pack

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
with the car it's a little hardware pack

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.310 
with the car it's a little hardware pack
that<00:00:47.480> plugs<00:00:47.750> into<00:00:47.960> there<00:00:49.510> like<00:00:50.510> that<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:50.930> then

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
that plugs into there like that and then

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.439 
that plugs into there like that and then
we'll<00:00:52.070> turn<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:52.280> battery<00:00:52.550> on<00:00:52.789> or<00:00:53.059> we'll<00:00:53.300> plug

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
we'll turn the battery on or we'll plug

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.000 
we'll turn the battery on or we'll plug
the<00:00:53.510> battery<00:00:53.719> in<00:00:54.019> and<00:00:54.260> turn<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.769> car<00:00:54.949> on

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
the battery in and turn the car on

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.290 
the battery in and turn the car on
leaving<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.730> transmitter<00:00:56.210> off<00:01:01.030> as<00:01:02.030> you<00:01:02.210> can

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
leaving the transmitter off as you can

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.090 
leaving the transmitter off as you can
see<00:01:02.449> once<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.870> bind<00:01:03.079> plugs<00:01:03.350> in<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:03.859> power

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
see once the bind plugs in and the power

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.040 
see once the bind plugs in and the power
is<00:01:04.370> on<00:01:04.520> a<00:01:04.820> little<00:01:05.150> green<00:01:05.360> light<00:01:05.570> on<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.780> top<00:01:05.960> of

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
is on a little green light on the top of

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.930 
is on a little green light on the top of
the<00:01:06.110> receiver<00:01:06.200> will<00:01:06.590> start<00:01:06.860> flashing<00:01:07.130> from

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
the receiver will start flashing from

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.580 
the receiver will start flashing from
here<00:01:08.210> we<00:01:08.330> can<00:01:08.480> do<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.780> transmitter<00:01:09.320> part<00:01:09.530> of

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
here we can do the transmitter part of

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.340 
here we can do the transmitter part of
the<00:01:09.680> procedure<00:01:10.210> so<00:01:11.210> we'll<00:01:11.360> put<00:01:11.480> the<00:01:11.600> DX<00:01:11.870> to<00:01:12.140> L

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
the procedure so we'll put the DX to L

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.900 
the procedure so we'll put the DX to L
which<00:01:12.560> is<00:01:12.710> included<00:01:13.130> with<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.310> kalahari<00:01:13.760> in

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
which is included with the kalahari in

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.280 
which is included with the kalahari in
turbine<00:01:14.210> mode<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:14.720> we'll<00:01:14.810> hold<00:01:14.960> down<00:01:15.170> the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
turbine mode so we'll hold down the

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.420 
turbine mode so we'll hold down the
button<00:01:15.380> on<00:01:15.620> the<00:01:15.680> top<00:01:15.830> of<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:15.980> transmitter

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
button on the top of the transmitter

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.520 
button on the top of the transmitter
where<00:01:16.580> it<00:01:16.640> says<00:01:16.790> bind<00:01:17.030> hold<00:01:17.450> that<00:01:17.570> down<00:01:17.720> power

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
where it says bind hold that down power

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.280 
where it says bind hold that down power
on<00:01:19.300> wait<00:01:20.300> a<00:01:20.330> couple<00:01:20.480> of<00:01:20.660> seconds<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.140> then

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
on wait a couple of seconds and then

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.030 
on wait a couple of seconds and then
release<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.370> bind<00:01:22.520> button<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:24.530> light<00:01:24.800> on<00:01:24.950> the

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
release the bind button the light on the

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.120 
release the bind button the light on the
receiver<00:01:25.340> will<00:01:25.520> change<00:01:25.820> how<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:26.120> flashes<00:01:26.570> and

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
receiver will change how it flashes and

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.190 
receiver will change how it flashes and
it<00:01:28.130> will<00:01:28.250> come<00:01:28.400> on<00:01:28.520> solid<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.540> that's<00:01:29.780> found

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
it will come on solid and that's found

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.220 
it will come on solid and that's found
and<00:01:31.360> if<00:01:32.360> you're<00:01:32.480> running<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.840> spectrum

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
and if you're running a spectrum

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.930 
and if you're running a spectrum
computer<00:01:33.710> transmitter<00:01:34.160> can<00:01:34.370> surface

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
computer transmitter can surface

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.970 
computer transmitter can surface
transmitter<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.660> I'll<00:01:36.440> show<00:01:36.590> you<00:01:36.680> how<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:36.800> get

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
transmitter and I'll show you how to get

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.380 
transmitter and I'll show you how to get
into<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.250> bind<00:01:37.430> mode<00:01:37.610> on<00:01:37.760> that<00:01:37.910> so<00:01:38.180> we'll<00:01:38.270> turn

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
into the bind mode on that so we'll turn

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.200 
into the bind mode on that so we'll turn
the<00:01:38.540> transmitter<00:01:38.810> on<00:01:39.670> click<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.760> roller<00:01:40.970> down

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
wait until the receiver binds so there

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.080 
wait until the receiver binds so there
you<00:01:55.730> go<00:01:55.850> guys

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
you go guys

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.180 
you go guys
that's<00:01:56.450> how<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.690> bind<00:01:56.930> either<00:01:57.380> a<00:01:57.560> computer<00:01:57.890> or
