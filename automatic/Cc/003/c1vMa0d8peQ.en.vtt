00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.819
 before this simple folk besides this 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:09.040
 to achieve for me it is not very easy and 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.200
 just for this we need why 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.810
 So 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.750
 which prime can be looked 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.750
 a small amount 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.750
 butter 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.839
 cut off a small piece 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.839
 the reasons 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.330
 laying 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.640
 and the score here is that used to 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.100
 cooking pineapple 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.940
 a small piece of pineapple and 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.420
 natural for everyone hot 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.440
 sandwiches we need circus 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.440
 just cut a slice of cheese 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.440
 we cover our on us sandwich ready 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.140
 Here are some comments tropical 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.110
 posed for us they turned out 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.110
 pledged Varyags 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.500
 the second dish which we cook the last 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.540
 the day is called has become that in the window and 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.340
 to cook it 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.840
 will need to cut off a small piece will 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.150
 whether 5 6 centimeters 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
 cut off 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.250
 we will do a little dimple now 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.250
 they will show us and what it is all done 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.520
 it can be done with a spoon 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.200
 can be hands 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.040
 so the charges are smeared 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040
 small amount of trash 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.830
 laying a small amount of green 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.060
 after which he lay on 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.320
 lattice 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.490
 once again I use average 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.490
 lattice 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.609
 Nastya the most important volitional deepening 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:12.809
 made by us 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:16.209
 egg 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.099
 for making hot sandwiches and 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.459
 became a cat school we need a little 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.809
 just 12 minutes 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.969
 install 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.419
 maximum temperature 206a 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.419
 degrees 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.919
 high air velocity 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.559
 and most importantly press the start button 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.559
 cooking time has gone 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:48.779
 12 minutes have passed and the sun baskets be 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:51.469
 glad you get a cap mid 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.999
 grilles on which our be laid 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.999
 Europe 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:10.999
 at what prices it left us to play
