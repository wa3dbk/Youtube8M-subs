out again I take it back you want to cut

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.790 
out again I take it back you want to cut
against<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:52.970> grain<00:03:53.170> because<00:03:54.170> if<00:03:54.560> you<00:03:54.650> look

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
against the grain because if you look

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.710 
against the grain because if you look
that's<00:03:55.130> a<00:03:55.280> lot<00:03:55.430> better<00:03:55.670> of<00:03:55.790> a<00:03:55.880> cut<00:03:56.120> then<00:03:56.390> this

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
that's a lot better of a cut then this

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.830 
that's a lot better of a cut then this
is<00:03:56.900> with<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.290> grain<00:03:57.530> it's<00:03:57.740> you<00:03:58.130> know<00:03:58.220> kind<00:03:58.580> of

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
is with the grain it's you know kind of

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.030 
is with the grain it's you know kind of
ready<00:03:59.840> I<00:03:59.990> guess<00:04:00.260> you'd<00:04:00.500> call<00:04:00.530> it

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
ready I guess you'd call it

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.850 
ready I guess you'd call it
so<00:04:01.580> cut<00:04:02.480> against<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:02.870> grain<00:04:02.930> I'm<00:04:03.350> learning

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
so cut against the grain I'm learning

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.840 
so cut against the grain I'm learning
