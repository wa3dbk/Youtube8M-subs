 Hannah musician 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.970
 a real SSW pull makes career Anette it freezes 34 SC Paderborn and 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.420
 has been an actress and comedian for several years 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.119
 camera 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.239
 despite its popularity, it has remained true to its roots of the free 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:19.029
 Cologne theater scene Always plays on small stages played on 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.119
 most common in the theater in the building tower and right here has a nice fair now 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.499
 also for the first time Rashid SZ on a piece that she has rewritten herself 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.499
 According to this is called the last night was the premiere 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.220
 a TV star on his way to work 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.450
 but this time it's not for Annette Frier in the tv studio but in the small 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.450
 Theater im Bauturm on the Aachener StraÃŸe in Cologne 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.140
 all people were so many innovations 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.290
 For the first time, it is all the more important and for the first time she gives the instructions 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.909
 over ten successful years as an actress 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.399
 and if they just try something new and is now directing 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.390
 I would like to even contest even sometimes 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.710
 and not only complain at home and do not say that consistent and that's true 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.380
 me and then you have to do it yourself and also on the nose 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.930
 fly with one or the other corner 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.090
 the responsibility with the train itself is genuine of the actual one 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.120
 consistent 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.720
 other ways to try 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.720
 also you 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.570
 the speech 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.969
 as a piece, Annette Frier has also chosen something very special 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.799
 she has staged not a well-known but just one 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.799
 Taken Roman and rewrote him to the play 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.490
 e on a slope, the novel and the play in it will be an encounter between two men 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.840
 described who get to know each other by accident and advised to chat 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.280
 but after a short time, the discussions go into the depths 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.240
 she talked Corp 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.180
 they finally need that 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.600
 the older one told of his wife's mysterious death 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.710
 and gradually to the audience that the two connects more than the previous one 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.540
 even seem to know 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.580
 Vice Rector 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.659
 Euro 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:13.490
 Unfortunately, this little two-hour piece does not happen anymore 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.919
 than that the two men talk 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:20.249
 no question the two performers do their thing very well and have the direction 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:24.399
 In addition also interesting pictures conceived because otherwise hardly a 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:28.489
 Actually, there is a bit of dragging on the matter 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.839
 shorter and poet staging would have this otherwise consistent performance 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.849
 well done 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.659
 in the end there was long-lasting applause and "4" offer clever 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.859
 from the premiere audience 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.409
 and I enjoyed that very much very well entertaining very well played 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.379
 but the piece of gardening 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:55.569
 Suspicion stays beautifully staged very subtly Rehn praised it says it will 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.349
 At a scene later in a very beautiful I really liked 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.519
 stay independent 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.179
 I have to say Contador 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:05.229
 and now the local time criticism 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:09.429
 you get her a challenging attempt to get that from the radio 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:13.169
 Is told to performers with exciting intensity 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.509
 because the implementation of the novel inevitably gets her little 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:17.479
 Action has 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:21.119
 but it is a bit cumbersome and sluggish 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:22.450
 but all in all 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.829
 three stars for on the slope in the Cologne theater in Bauturm
