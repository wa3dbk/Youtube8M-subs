00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.020
 and you 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.570
 hi friends, how are we some times 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.070
 I bring the tweet and it 's widget with this 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.740
 tweet let's give it a touch of 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.190
 customization to our multitasking 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.810
 a very different way to all you 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.300
 I quickly show for example I 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.760
 I want to go to music I do not have music 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.250
 but good now what is it that I'm going to 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.490
 do I'm going to open multitasking and you can 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.739
 see that I get a blank multitasking 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.530
 while I have open multitasking 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.679
 I can continue working I can be 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.969
 within the same application without any 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:45.769
 problem you can see I can be with the 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.329
 music application without any problem 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:51.469
 and now I want to go directly to 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.179
 spotify then good I open spotify and not 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.760
 I have no problem still working 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:01:00.319
 in the right way I open it again and 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.929
 I do not want to go now to silvia I'm going 

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:05.479
 to syria here I have the sources I have 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.729
 everything will open the multitasking and I can 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.360
 keep working without any problem in 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.010
 cydia 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.500
 now I attribute adjustments well I do what 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.220
 same and this gives us the option of not being 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.860
 answered 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.540
 a whatsapp and keep writing and have 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.920
 multitasking open in case you do not want 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.480
 that some game is closed 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.090
 application that you are occupying not so good 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.550
 you can have it open now if we 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.100
 we go for example to the screen 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.560
 main I open the multitasking and you can 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.560
 see that it works in the same way no 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.350
 I can eliminate until I release 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.350
 completely no images there is no 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.350
 as you can call animations that you 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.660
 it helps not to save ram memory and 2 te 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.150
 helps save battery since we do not 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.860
 Fan the images completely to me 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.450
