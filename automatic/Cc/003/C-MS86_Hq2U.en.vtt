00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
I think if you give you actually it's a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.360 
I think if you give you actually it's a
ripple<00:00:55.199> effect<00:00:55.589> and<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.799> actually<00:00:55.920> get<00:00:56.190> more

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
ripple effect and you actually get more

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.299 
ripple effect and you actually get more
back<00:00:56.639> even<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.659> times<00:00:58.199> where<00:00:58.589> I<00:00:58.620> think<00:00:59.010> I'm<00:00:59.159> in

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
back even in times where I think I'm in

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.669 
back even in times where I think I'm in
dire<00:00:59.459> straits<00:00:59.999> I<00:01:00.329> look<00:01:00.899> around<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.649> realize

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
dire straits I look around and I realize

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.479
