00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
using the CDJ 2000 s and hid mode means

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.820 
using the CDJ 2000 s and hid mode means
you<00:00:15.299> don't<00:00:15.450> even<00:00:15.599> need<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.870> tractor<00:00:16.230> sound<00:00:16.590> card

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
you don't even need a tractor sound card

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.279 
you don't even need a tractor sound card
or<00:00:17.010> timecode<00:00:17.550> cds<00:00:17.880> all<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.630> need<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> USB

connection for each CD J connected to
the<00:00:21.570> laptop<00:00:21.750> first<00:00:22.289> we're<00:00:22.470> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.619> look<00:00:22.710> at

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
the laptop first we're going to look at

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.230 
the laptop first we're going to look at
what<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.039> need<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.279> do<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.519> get<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.760> CDJs

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
what you need to do to get the CDJs

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.300 
what you need to do to get the CDJs
ready<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.660> work<00:00:24.810> with<00:00:24.840> tractor<00:00:25.439> next<00:00:26.189> we're

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
ready to work with tractor next we're

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.200 
ready to work with tractor next we're
going<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.490> look<00:00:26.550> at<00:00:26.670> how<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.060> actually

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
going to look at how you can actually

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.300 
going to look at how you can actually
set<00:00:27.510> up<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> CDJs<00:00:28.170> as<00:00:28.439> your<00:00:28.619> sound<00:00:28.890> card<00:00:28.949> for

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
set up the CDJs as your sound card for

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.410 
set up the CDJs as your sound card for
tractors<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.029> don't<00:00:30.210> need<00:00:30.359> a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
tractors so that you don't need a

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.479 
tractors so that you don't need a
tractor<00:00:30.689> sound<00:00:30.990> card<00:00:31.199> at<00:00:31.410> all<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.830> next<00:00:32.399> we're

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
tractor sound card at all and next we're

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.590 
tractor sound card at all and next we're
going<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> show<00:00:32.700> why<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.210> actually<00:00:33.300> better

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
going to show why it's actually better

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.440 
going to show why it's actually better
to<00:00:33.690> use<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.170> hid<00:00:34.590> mode<00:00:34.890> over<00:00:35.340> timecode<00:00:36.090> cds<00:00:36.420> or

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
to use the hid mode over timecode cds or

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.049 
to use the hid mode over timecode cds or
just<00:00:37.140> using<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.469> CDJs<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.190> midi<00:00:38.550> controllers

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
just using the CDJs as midi controllers

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.729 
just using the CDJs as midi controllers
so<00:00:39.629> let's<00:00:40.140> get<00:00:40.230> into<00:00:40.500> it

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
so let's get into it

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.750 
so let's get into it
the<00:00:40.829> first<00:00:41.070> thing<00:00:41.160> you'll<00:00:41.280> need<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.550> do<00:00:41.640> is

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the first thing you'll need to do is

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.160 
the first thing you'll need to do is
make<00:00:41.940> sure<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.360> firmware<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.840> your<00:00:42.870> CD

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
make sure that the firmware on your CD

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.380 
make sure that the firmware on your CD
J's<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.680> up<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.950> date<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.789> tractor<00:00:45.180> you'll

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
J's is up to date for tractor you'll

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.690 
J's is up to date for tractor you'll
need<00:00:45.570> at<00:00:45.690> least<00:00:45.719> firmware<00:00:46.230> 4.2<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.579> can

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
need at least firmware 4.2 you can

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.040 
need at least firmware 4.2 you can
easily<00:00:47.940> find<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> firmware<00:00:48.420> version<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
easily find the firmware version on the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.319 
easily find the firmware version on the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
which so you'll need to need to quickly

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.910 
which so you'll need to need to quickly
test<00:02:38.269> it<00:02:38.450> out<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.750> see<00:02:38.989> if<00:02:39.139> it's<00:02:39.319> a<00:02:39.439> sign<00:02:39.769> to

the right outputs and I'll assign that

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.509 
the right outputs and I'll assign that

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
our large shift as well we hold this

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.620 
our large shift as well we hold this
shift<00:06:20.620> box<00:06:20.830> over<00:06:21.010> here<00:06:21.310> like<00:06:22.180> that<00:06:22.330> we<00:06:22.480> can

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
shift box over here like that we can

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.920 
shift box over here like that we can
synch<00:06:23.260> our<00:06:23.380> track<00:06:23.650> as<00:06:23.860> well<00:06:24.690> the<00:06:25.690> biggest

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
synch our track as well the biggest

advantage<00:06:26.350> of<00:06:26.410> using<00:06:26.560> hid<00:06:27.040> mode<00:06:27.310> is<00:06:27.460> that<00:06:27.580> you

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
advantage of using hid mode is that you

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.340 
advantage of using hid mode is that you
get<00:06:27.820> this<00:06:27.940> rich<00:06:28.240> display<00:06:28.720> with<00:06:28.930> all<00:06:29.110> this

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
get this rich display with all this

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.500 
get this rich display with all this
track<00:06:29.620> information<00:06:29.980> you<00:06:30.820> get<00:06:30.940> a<00:06:31.000> waveform

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
track information you get a waveform

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.200 
track information you get a waveform
here<00:06:31.900> and<00:06:32.080> the<00:06:32.620> the<00:06:32.950> platter<00:06:33.370> also<00:06:33.730> operates

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
here and the the platter also operates

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.970 
here and the the platter also operates
at<00:06:34.450> a<00:06:34.480> high<00:06:34.750> resolution<00:06:34.960> as<00:06:35.470> opposed<00:06:35.770> to<00:06:35.830> just

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
at a high resolution as opposed to just

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.490 
at a high resolution as opposed to just
standard<00:06:36.370> MIDI<00:06:36.580> so<00:06:37.240> this<00:06:37.420> is<00:06:37.600> far<00:06:37.960> superior<00:06:38.140> to

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
standard MIDI so this is far superior to

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.320 
standard MIDI so this is far superior to
using<00:06:38.830> timecode<00:06:39.310> which<00:06:39.520> you<00:06:39.730> don't<00:06:39.940> get<00:06:40.120> any

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330
