00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.030
 traditionally we really have everything 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.679
 to save him what he wants to take 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.679
 a boat so his first 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.900
 this is six weeks next clap to 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.840
 take a picture slowly 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.490
 hello how these motorcycles 125 kg so 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.300
 between montmagny to learn to 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.690
 drive without problems is really 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.090
 nice level saving gas to my 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.010
 advantage we will say that alopecia areata very 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.210
 strict 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.250
 we're going to tell an elite I'm losing 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.040
 150 and the beast for 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.410
 so by rolling or more simply than 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.450
 more kilometers so it's really 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.079
 advantage in terms of the price of gasoline 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.730
 currently so 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.659
 and very pleasant to drive we have 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.800
 some small flaws 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.800
 for example, hazard warning lights 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.170
 perf level here I am ready to jump 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.810
 bias 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.409
 so we had a drop in 10 kg 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.740
 for the speed goda motorcycle on the head 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:20.299
 I arrive at 111 105 so despite a 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:25.170
 book to small typed the 110 or ben 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:30.030
 here I am about 60 km h have 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:34.380
 so regulations and viable 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.930
 3 porn and that's so we try on my 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.189
 road stops more simple already 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.619
 recommend to those who want to learn 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.619
 to the bike to learn had really 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:53.900
 and so that's what it costs 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.970
 what does it cost and 2100 but well actually I 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.090
 right the promotion on the pole of 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:04.679
 Brussels 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:06.210
 this ag understood otherwise I believe that 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.670
 it's 2005 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.069
 thank you 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.260
 without a convention so it's relatively 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.540
 ok to have a good little 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.250
 not too expensive to learn and 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.430
 those who are asking the question which 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.870
 start often it's a question about 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.580
 the 2014 model 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.100
 I know back on the old ones there was no 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.970
 I do not know if you give 2013 gaza ago 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.830
 well an account turns so x 1 against 8 s 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.080
 and just meaning for a single point in front of 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.560
 farrelly nature in base and grill 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.930
 the more the pilot was there the horn the 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.720
 big headlights for the start of 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.549
 electric dams do not have been 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.440
 gas inhalation headlights if one has the 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:54.650
 lc task otherwise good there i have to make a 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.980
 about 60 km very straight position or at 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.370
 bike very nice not bad ass not 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.440
 Too bad at least so that's it 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.780
 it is available in three colors on 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.510
 red burgundy like this the white 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.040
 and the right to a just one thing is 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.390
 sure see here 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.680
 do not worry when you go 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.220
 but the bike is normal that far 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.790
 directly minimum wage and for the 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.100
 beginners 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.600
 do not hesitate when you put a 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.489
 speed is that there is an appetite it's 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.770
 normal that the bike stops it's a 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.410
 safety for you to plant 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.720
 customers route so that's it 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.910
 gone on the road disappointed I had 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.380
 questions and had not rested on 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.630
 some motorcycles who wanted to take over the 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.160
 dyed like me if you're a beginner and 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.510
 that you want to take the plunge 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.510
 frankly his superiors
