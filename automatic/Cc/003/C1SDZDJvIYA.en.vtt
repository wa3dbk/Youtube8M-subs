00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.300 
that cook on low for a few hours usually
I<00:01:43.220> do<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.430> about<00:01:44.579> 7<00:01:45.240> hours<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.770> check<00:01:47.280> on

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
I do this about 7 hours I just check on

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.969 
I do this about 7 hours I just check on
it<00:01:47.610> towards<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> end<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> day<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.170> then

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
it towards the end of the day and then

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.710 
it towards the end of the day and then
when<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.670> done<00:01:51.710> it<00:01:53.180> you<00:01:54.180> know<00:01:54.210> will<00:01:54.509> crumble

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
when it's done it you know will crumble

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.469 
when it's done it you know will crumble
apart<00:01:54.930> really<00:01:55.320> nicely<00:01:55.649> each<00:01:56.250> crock<00:01:56.700> pot<00:01:57.090> cooks

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
apart really nicely each crock pot cooks

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.380 
apart really nicely each crock pot cooks
differently<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.549> you<00:01:59.549> know<00:01:59.670> mine<00:02:00.000> may<00:02:00.210> cook

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
differently so you know mine may cook

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.090 
differently so you know mine may cook
faster<00:02:00.869> than<00:02:01.020> your<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.680> keep<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.950> online

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
faster than your so just keep it online

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.240 
faster than your so just keep it online
