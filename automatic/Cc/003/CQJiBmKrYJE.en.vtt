00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
can be tamed by I think fish so let's go

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.429 
can be tamed by I think fish so let's go
ahead<00:02:40.349> and<00:02:40.500> try<00:02:41.099> that<00:02:41.129> out<00:02:42.170> not<00:02:43.170> sure<00:02:43.290> if<00:02:43.349> it's

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
ahead and try that out not sure if it's

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.349 
ahead and try that out not sure if it's
going<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.590> be<00:02:43.709> like<00:02:43.829> cooked<00:02:44.250> or<00:02:44.430> raw<00:02:44.459> fish<00:02:44.969> so

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
going to be like cooked or raw fish so

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.399 
going to be like cooked or raw fish so
I'm<00:02:46.170> gonna<00:02:46.290> get<00:02:46.469> a<00:02:46.500> little<00:02:46.620> bit<00:02:46.769> of<00:02:46.829> both<00:02:46.980> I

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
I'm gonna get a little bit of both I

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.259 
I'm gonna get a little bit of both I
let's<00:02:49.409> see<00:02:49.469> if<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.560> can't<00:02:49.769> tame<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.129> one<00:02:50.879> I<00:02:50.909> hit

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
let's see if I can't tame this one I hit

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.879 
let's see if I can't tame this one I hit
maybe<00:02:51.749> it's<00:02:51.900> how<00:02:52.049> you<00:02:52.109> breed<00:02:52.560> them<00:02:52.590> it's

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
maybe it's how you breed them it's

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.920 
maybe it's how you breed them it's
either<00:02:52.950> breeding<00:02:53.430> or<00:02:53.519> taming<00:02:53.969> one<00:02:54.599> of<00:02:54.719> the<00:02:54.780> day

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
either breeding or taming one of the day

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.689 
either breeding or taming one of the day
and<00:02:55.049> mother<00:02:57.949> well<00:02:58.949> looks<00:02:59.129> like<00:02:59.189> they<00:02:59.370> digged

00:02:59.689 --> 00:02:59.699 
and mother well looks like they digged

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:03.289 
and mother well looks like they digged
too<00:03:00.540> far<00:03:00.750> away<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:00.959> me<00:03:01.109> to<00:03:01.260> do<00:03:01.469> it<00:03:02.090> it's<00:03:03.090> free

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
too far away for me to do it it's free

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.899 
too far away for me to do it it's free
dick<00:03:03.449> off<00:03:03.569> more<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.609> think<00:03:05.609> it<00:03:05.760> might<00:03:05.849> be

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
dick off more I think it might be

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.559 
dick off more I think it might be
actually<00:03:06.090> for<00:03:06.419> breeding<00:03:06.659> the<00:03:06.900> fish<00:03:07.109> instead

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
actually for breeding the fish instead

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.059 
actually for breeding the fish instead
they're<00:03:09.569> not<00:03:09.689> taking<00:03:10.109> it<00:03:10.199> although<00:03:10.919> they're

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
they're not taking it although they're

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.559 
they're not taking it although they're
really<00:03:11.310> hard<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:11.699> get<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.150> really<00:03:12.269> take

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
really hard to get to really take

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.439 
really hard to get to really take
anything<00:03:15.739> I'm<00:03:16.739> also<00:03:16.889> in<00:03:17.129> a<00:03:17.310> crate<00:03:17.790> modo<00:03:18.209> might

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
anything I'm also in a crate modo might

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.050 
anything I'm also in a crate modo might
be<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.569> little<00:03:18.719> bit<00:03:18.870> different<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:19.439> I<00:03:19.790> do<00:03:20.790> know
