00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you drive down the road a little bit

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.000

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
cannot drive a car pass so you just walk

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.000 
cannot drive a car pass so you just walk
past<00:01:04.409> here<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:06.260> get<00:01:07.260> rid<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.500> anything<00:01:07.740> in

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
your way so right here I'm just gonna

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.899 
your way so right here I'm just gonna
skip<00:01:10.740> forward<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.159> little<00:01:11.280> bit<00:01:11.430> because<00:01:11.670> it's

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
skip forward a little bit because it's

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.039 
skip forward a little bit because it's
pretty<00:01:12.210> self-explanatory<00:01:13.790> but<00:01:14.930> you're<00:01:15.930> going

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
pretty self-explanatory but you're going

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.679 
pretty self-explanatory but you're going
to<00:01:16.110> get<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.560> little<00:01:16.830> break<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.150> I

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
to get to this little break in the I

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.219 
to get to this little break in the I
guess<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.500> could<00:01:19.530> say<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.130> greenery<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.229> you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
guess you could say the greenery and you

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.260 
guess you could say the greenery and you
just<00:01:22.439> run<00:01:22.710> through<00:01:22.920> there<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.520> continue

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
just run through there and continue

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.920 
just run through there and continue
following<00:01:24.630> onto<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.170> path<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:26.330> just<00:01:27.330> you

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
following onto the path and just you

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.899 
following onto the path and just you
just<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.409> basically<00:01:28.770> follow<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.610> dotted

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
just have to basically follow the dotted

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.270 
just have to basically follow the dotted
line<00:01:30.060> from<00:01:30.299> here<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.689> there's<00:01:30.990> no<00:01:31.280> real

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
line from here on there's no real

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.160 
line from here on there's no real
complication<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.960> keep

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
complication to it's just to keep

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.499 
complication to it's just to keep
walking<00:01:34.710> you're<00:01:35.340> probably<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.939> find<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
walking you're probably going to find a

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.230 
walking you're probably going to find a
couple<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.900> guys<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.560> think<00:01:37.799> there's<00:01:38.240> probably

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
couple of guys I think there's probably

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.249 
couple of guys I think there's probably
one<00:01:40.140> or<00:01:40.170> two<00:01:40.829> enemies<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.850> way<00:01:42.060> there<00:01:42.299> I'm

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
one or two enemies on the way there I'm

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.039 
one or two enemies on the way there I'm
not<00:01:43.470> exactly<00:01:43.799> sure<00:01:44.450> which<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.630> coming<00:01:45.930> up

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
not exactly sure which is coming up

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.420 
not exactly sure which is coming up
right<00:01:46.229> now<00:01:46.290> he's<00:01:46.649> going<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:46.979> behind<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
right now he's going to be behind the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.420 
right now he's going to be behind the
truck<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.619> I'm<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.740> going<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.950> take<00:01:50.159> him<00:01:50.310> out

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
truck and I'm just going to take him out

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.910 
truck and I'm just going to take him out
real<00:01:50.729> quick<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.270> then<00:01:51.329> after<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.560> just

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
