sort of storyline definitely we're gonna
have<00:01:16.830> some<00:01:17.040> sort<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.280> story<00:01:17.520> line<00:01:17.730> to<00:01:17.910> this<00:01:18.000> EXO

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
zombies mode the real question is the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.850 
zombies mode the real question is the
Easter<00:01:20.970> eggs<00:01:21.180> now<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:21.780> very<00:01:21.990> confident<00:01:22.680> we

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
Easter eggs now I'm very confident we

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.370 
Easter eggs now I'm very confident we
are<00:01:22.980> having<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.550> story<00:01:23.940> mode<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
are having the story mode because a the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.310 
are having the story mode because a the
chapter<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.070> B<00:01:26.670> because<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.060> think

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
chapter and B because I think

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.810 
chapter and B because I think
sledgehammer<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.560> putting<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.980> lot<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.250> effort

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
sledgehammer is putting a lot of effort

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.000 
sledgehammer is putting a lot of effort
into<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.420> mode<00:01:30.750> whether<00:01:31.050> they<00:01:31.290> started<00:01:31.800> at<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
into this mode whether they started at a

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.040 
into this mode whether they started at a
long<00:01:32.220> time<00:01:32.460> ago<00:01:32.610> or<00:01:32.850> not<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> don't<00:01:33.300> think<00:01:33.660> so<00:01:33.870> I

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
long time ago or not I don't think so I

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.200 
long time ago or not I don't think so I
think<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:34.680> might<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.250> maybe<00:01:35.430> started<00:01:36.060> it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
think they might have maybe started it

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.990 
think they might have maybe started it
once<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.560> community<00:01:38.070> sort<00:01:38.370> of<00:01:38.490> uproar

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
once the community sort of uproar

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.480 
once the community sort of uproar
demanding<00:01:39.810> zombies<00:01:40.380> once<00:01:41.040> they<00:01:41.190> really

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
demanding zombies once they really

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.290 
demanding zombies once they really
figured<00:01:41.760> out<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.060> everyone<00:01:42.540> wanted<00:01:42.900> this

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
figured out that everyone wanted this

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.370 
figured out that everyone wanted this
perhaps<00:01:45.300> that's<00:01:45.510> it<00:01:45.720> or<00:01:45.870> perhaps<00:01:45.990> they've

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
perhaps that's it or perhaps they've

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.660 
perhaps that's it or perhaps they've
been<00:01:46.500> working<00:01:46.620> on<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.100> whole<00:01:47.130> time<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:47.610> I

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
been working on it the whole time but I

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.210 
been working on it the whole time but I
think<00:01:47.970> they<00:01:48.090> need<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> storyline<00:01:49.050> if<00:01:49.770> they<00:01:50.010> want

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
think they need a storyline if they want

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.580 
think they need a storyline if they want
anything<00:01:50.550> to<00:01:50.790> be<00:01:50.910> successful<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:52.350> think

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
anything to be successful and I think

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.990 
anything to be successful and I think
they're<00:01:52.680> definitely<00:01:52.950> gonna<00:01:53.310> they're

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
they're definitely gonna they're

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.520 
they're definitely gonna they're
definitely<00:01:54.030> gonna<00:01:54.570> deliver<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.230> with<00:01:55.380> in

definitely gonna deliver it with in
terms<00:01:55.800> of<00:01:55.980> story<00:01:56.430> but<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.690> thing<00:01:58.050> that

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
terms of story but the thing that

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.440
