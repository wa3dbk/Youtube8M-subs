you can set a work resistance level and
also<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.710> try<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.890> keep<00:01:02.100> up<00:01:02.280> keep<00:01:02.670> an<00:01:02.820> eye<00:01:02.940> on

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
also just try to keep up keep an eye on

about the bike is that your head is
staying<00:01:59.119> very<00:02:00.320> stationary<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.430> know<00:02:02.520> if

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
staying very stationary so you know if

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.459 
staying very stationary so you know if
you<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.240> read<00:02:03.450> or<00:02:03.479> something<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.259> that

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
you like to read or something like that

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.810 
you like to read or something like that
and<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.710> worry<00:02:04.950> about<00:02:05.009> not<00:02:05.369> being<00:02:05.520> able<00:02:05.700> to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
and you worry about not being able to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.609 
and you worry about not being able to
keep<00:02:05.969> up<00:02:06.180> with<00:02:06.390> your<00:02:06.540> reading<00:02:06.990> or<00:02:07.140> whatever<00:02:07.350> it

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
is you just want to read a magazine or

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.300 
is you just want to read a magazine or

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
or watch the ballgame

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.540 
or watch the ballgame
you<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.879> do<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
you can do that and

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.850 
you can do that and
not<00:02:12.760> be<00:02:12.940> too<00:02:13.300> nauseating<00:02:13.990> sometimes<00:02:14.500> trying

not be too nauseating sometimes trying

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.680 
not be too nauseating sometimes trying
to<00:02:14.950> do<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.190> on<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.340> treadmill<00:02:15.610> number<00:02:16.030> one<00:02:16.240> is

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
to do it on a treadmill number one is

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.930 
to do it on a treadmill number one is
dangerous<00:02:17.460> number<00:02:18.460> two<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.910> just

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
dangerous number two is just

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.990 
dangerous number two is just
extraordinarily<00:02:19.420> difficult<00:02:19.960> so<00:02:20.670> that's<00:02:21.670> the

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
extraordinarily difficult so that's the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.270 
extraordinarily difficult so that's the
one<00:02:22.750> advantage<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.260> riding<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.100> stationary

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280
