00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.220
 Petersburg Metro in Mykraft 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.869
 Well, I solved the problem with shaders 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.990
 it turns out it was all because of the driver 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.810
 for gta 5, that's not helped, but de chicco's name 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.750

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.059
 Big I give him thanks and here 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.219
 principle in today's release prepared 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.320
 a new subway station is also more lakes 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.730
 from the rules and a little station limit 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.020
 Metro Avenue of Education Qatar 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.300
 reviewed in the last issue 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.829
 so let's see our update 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.559
 at the station Prospect education 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.300
 But I added here that the walls are melting 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.760
 there used to be just a bare wall vodka 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.710
 drink youtube well, pass now here 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.140
 added there will be some money near the wall 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.090
 we drove the hotel on the avenue 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.629
 enlightenment wheels tomsk tut he day her 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.199
 walls and that's the same in some in 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.290
 of some 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.110
 the walls also closed and supplies the seat then 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.939
 there is here we are now blocking it 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.990
 this is also like in Petersburg we have such 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.490
 there are water seats between the columns 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.880
 through every column of all we have 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.530
 6 have at the station 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.409
 and here are two now let's look a little more 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.189
 tunnel update there i added 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.530
 arrows 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.220
 well here's one regular arrow and another 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.409
 cross 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.780
 but let's start see the usual 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.899
 there she is here and so goes basically 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.460
 there is a field wraps right here as in 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.009
 reality came there search skull 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.579
 rights wraps rides there let's say your 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.420
 sump 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:45.250
 I do not know her there is arranged 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.250
 the next book there is basically the same thing 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.520
 That is, there is a train rides rides and arrives 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.920
 the arrow to paris and then the usual arrow 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.530
 it is an absolute the same distance is the same 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.360
 and here we drink here we have narrowed 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.250
 haul connects another tunnel and 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.140
 here we are such a cross arrow and 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.409
 I build trades and got with such 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.789
 the way we have is a train going as if 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.450
 does not turn namely come 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.310
 arrow 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.209
 Well, of course you can now still lever 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.500
 put in order there suddenly I don't know what 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.050
 Well fix there in the mouth switch 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.270
 arrow let's say 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.400
 Here though it is principle it will not be necessary for us 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.890
 we're not going to print the arrow 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.170
 we let the trains go soi that night when 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.540
 By the way, right now there was an old tunnel 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.250
 somehow their ghost turns out that's because 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.940
 we are such a stain on the brand we still 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.500
 It left but that I put on memory here 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.670
 here in society let's see now 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.620
 new metro station 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.570
 This zerkin she turned out especially 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.400
 because she does not find 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.350
 Well, the principle as the prospect of education 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.780
 just imagine without columns and all 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.630
 and it is much higher watches a little bit 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.790
 graft them here here's an arrow well in this 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.640
 There is no station, that is, it is simply without 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.830
 arrows sow right and all here it is also 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.690
 long got 2 now visible on it 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.360
 so it looks like you can 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.210
 by the way here if by some 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.040
 our station looks like well what am I 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.750
 I can tell you about it on the basis of nothing 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.750
 intersection avenue of course I forgot 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.370
 read the wiki about it well or sign such 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.280
 stations are called where they have no columns 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.390
 just how high such a ceiling is all so 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.070
 what else has turned out pretty 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.110
 interesting chandelier so she 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.940
 looks like reality 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.410
 Only the lighting would change to blue 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.150
 such a 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.570
 need turquoise there in reality is 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.280
 lighting want us such lighting 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.960
 stenochki standard we have 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.850
 Advertisements of course 15 described lakes 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.440
 Here also we have some garbage I do not know 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.630
 what is this a room for? 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.660
 staff but did not decide to do something 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.580
 well, that doesn't look like it in general 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.470
 we have some room well as a reality 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.530
 there is some kind of diagram shown on 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.750
 the ceiling of the one on the wall in the floor is shorter 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.490
 there is also a mosaic and and forgot to do well 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.100
 of course do about here somewhere 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.440
 Here the main should be well and in principle 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.690
 im such one station turned out type or 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.120
 well it will be all updates on this one 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.890
 release in the third issue by the way still 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.200
 I wanted to say something somewhere in the third 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.150
 slaughter in the fourth issue of the pioneer 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.630
 this is the next metro station and black 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.430
 river 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.390
 there the principle of the station is the same that is 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.880
 there are also no such bars there 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:22.440
 immediately go the same station that is 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.970
 so to speak without these pillars I think I 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.010
 I will immediately take two stations off although I do not know 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.740
 I thought basically to see screenshots 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.960
 These stations will see the complexity and 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.550
 so on and here comes the black river 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.830
 Then 4 gatsko she already long 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.560
 interesting get well this of course in 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.970
 the future will see somewhere in May, probably well 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.220
 Well, I hope you enjoyed this release 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.220
 the wedding Skeeter all good luck to all until
