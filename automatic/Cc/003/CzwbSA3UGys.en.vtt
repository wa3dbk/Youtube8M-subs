exactly not even a band yeah possibly
the<00:02:00.509> only<00:02:00.840> other<00:02:00.990> part<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.770> that

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
the only other part that of this that

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.380 
the only other part that of this that
seemed<00:02:02.189> disturbing<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.640> me<00:02:02.700> was<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.000> maybe

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
seemed disturbing to me was that maybe

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.139 
seemed disturbing to me was that maybe
if<00:02:03.869> somehow<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.649> image<00:02:05.040> was<00:02:05.219> not<00:02:05.250> created<00:02:05.969> by

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
if somehow that image was not created by

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.630 
if somehow that image was not created by
her<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.350> know<00:02:07.439> actually<00:02:07.890> taking<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.280> selfie<00:02:08.610> or

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
her you know actually taking a selfie or

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.010 
her you know actually taking a selfie or
something<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.899> was<00:02:09.989> a

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
something like that but that it was a

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.330 
something like that but that it was a
webcam<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.500> she's<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:10.920> sitting<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.190> front

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
webcam and she's just sitting in front

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.760 
webcam and she's just sitting in front
of<00:02:11.400> our<00:02:11.430> computer<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.060> somehow<00:02:12.270> they<00:02:12.510> got

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
of our computer and somehow they got

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.080 
of our computer and somehow they got
that<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.190> would<00:02:13.430> be<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.610> whole<00:02:13.790> other<00:02:13.820> story

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
that that would be a whole other story

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.210 
that that would be a whole other story
but<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.600> guess<00:02:14.840> that's<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.650> total<00:02:15.980> speculation

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
but I guess that's a total speculation

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.480 
but I guess that's a total speculation
but<00:02:16.700> that's<00:02:16.850> all<00:02:17.000> other<00:02:17.240> things
