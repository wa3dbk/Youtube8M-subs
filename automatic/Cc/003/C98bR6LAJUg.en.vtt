April May June and the reason we we
stalk<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.969> lakes<00:00:12.510> in<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.719> springtime<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.380> the

stalk the lakes in the springtime is the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.450 
stalk the lakes in the springtime is the
the<00:00:14.610> water<00:00:14.820> temperatures<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:16.200> the<00:00:16.379> lake<00:00:16.560> are

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
the water temperatures of the lake are

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.070 
the water temperatures of the lake are
closely<00:00:17.730> matched<00:00:18.119> what<00:00:18.360> are<00:00:18.480> what<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.900> rear

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
closely matched what are what the rear

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.300 
closely matched what are what the rear
and<00:00:19.230> temperatures<00:00:19.680> are<00:00:19.919> at<00:00:20.009> the<00:00:20.130> hatchery

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
and temperatures are at the hatchery

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.120 
and temperatures are at the hatchery
which<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.119> around<00:00:21.300> 10<00:00:21.570> or<00:00:21.599> 11<00:00:21.720> degrees<00:00:22.200> so<00:00:22.950> we

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
which is around 10 or 11 degrees so we

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.769 
which is around 10 or 11 degrees so we
want<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:23.610> want<00:00:23.759> to<00:00:23.820> match<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.509> want<00:00:24.660> to

want to we want to match that we want to
as<00:00:24.989> you<00:00:25.140> see<00:00:25.290> the<00:00:25.380> water<00:00:25.529> coming<00:00:25.829> out<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.130> out

00:00:26.299 --> 00:00:26.309 
as you see the water coming out of out

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:29.389 
as you see the water coming out of out
of<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:27.020> fill<00:00:28.020> in<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> truck<00:00:28.470> its<00:00:29.130> ground

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:29.399 
of the fill in the truck its ground

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.010 
of the fill in the truck its ground
water<00:00:29.669> it's<00:00:29.939> there<00:00:30.090> same<00:00:30.300> water<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.719> we<00:00:30.809> rare

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
water it's there same water that we rare

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.900 
water it's there same water that we rare
fish<00:00:31.259> in<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.770> you'll<00:00:32.250> see<00:00:32.399> at<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> bottom<00:00:32.730> of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
fish in and you'll see at the bottom of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.060 
fish in and you'll see at the bottom of
the<00:00:33.000> bottom<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.809> tanks<00:00:34.230> there's<00:00:34.920> some

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
the bottom of the tanks there's some

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.369 
the bottom of the tanks there's some
oxygen<00:00:35.399> racks<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.839> to<00:00:36.960> oxygenate

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
oxygen racks and we have to oxygenate

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:38.799 
oxygen racks and we have to oxygenate
the<00:00:37.440> water<00:00:37.710> because<00:00:37.980> these<00:00:38.100> fish<00:00:38.339> are<00:00:38.489> being

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
the water because these fish are being

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.060 
the water because these fish are being
carried<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.989> these<00:00:40.170> trucks<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.620> very<00:00:40.890> high

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
carried in these trucks and very high

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.790 
carried in these trucks and very high
densities<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.839> have<00:00:43.019> to<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.289> constant

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
densities so we have to have a constant

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.709 
densities so we have to have a constant
flow<00:00:43.949> of<00:00:44.010> oxygen<00:00:44.489> which<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.600> be

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
flow of oxygen which have to be

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.380 
flow of oxygen which have to be
monitored<00:00:46.170> very<00:00:46.289> closely<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.949> transit<00:00:47.429> you

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
monitored very closely in transit you

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.630 
monitored very closely in transit you
can<00:00:48.510> see<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> gauges<00:00:49.019> here<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:50.039> that'll<00:00:50.339> just

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
can see the gauges here and that'll just

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.989 
can see the gauges here and that'll just
meter<00:00:51.059> out<00:00:51.269> the<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.109> flow<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.409> pure<00:00:53.070> oxygen<00:00:53.429> if

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
meter out the the flow of pure oxygen if

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:55.880 
meter out the the flow of pure oxygen if
he<00:00:54.269> of<00:00:54.359> course<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.929> more<00:00:55.109> biomass<00:00:55.499> in

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
he of course if you have more biomass in

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.680 
he of course if you have more biomass in
the<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.249> truck<00:00:56.550> you'll<00:00:57.300> need<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> little

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the in the truck you'll need a little

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.259 
the in the truck you'll need a little
bit<00:00:57.809> more<00:00:58.190> more<00:00:59.190> liters<00:00:59.370> per<00:00:59.850> minute<00:00:59.969> of

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
bit more more liters per minute of

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.360 
bit more more liters per minute of
oxygen<00:01:00.780> small<00:01:01.260> fish<00:01:01.530> tend<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> take<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.190> more

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
oxygen small fish tend to take up more

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.280 
oxygen small fish tend to take up more
oxygen<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.879> large<00:01:03.089> fish<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.989> all<00:01:04.110> has<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
oxygen on large fish and it all has to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.140 
oxygen on large fish and it all has to
be<00:01:04.440> monitored<00:01:04.890> by<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.100> fish<00:01:05.339> cultures<00:01:05.790> and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
be monitored by the fish cultures and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.540 
be monitored by the fish cultures and
this<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.750> its<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.680> all<00:01:07.800> done<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.100> transit<00:01:08.490> so

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
this is its it's all done in transit so

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.700 
this is its it's all done in transit so
it's<00:01:08.730> quite<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.910> put<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.630> quite<00:01:09.870> a<00:01:09.900> chip<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.470> some

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
it's quite a put up quite a chip in some

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.020 
it's quite a put up quite a chip in some
ways<00:01:10.860> quite<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.040> challenge<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.460> get<00:01:11.670> these<00:01:11.790> fish

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
ways quite a challenge to get these fish

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.310 
ways quite a challenge to get these fish
from<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> hatchery<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> lake<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.170> we

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
from the hatchery to the lake but we

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.110 
from the hatchery to the lake but we
first<00:01:13.920> mean<00:01:14.160> doing<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.520> many<00:01:14.640> years<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
first mean doing it for many years and

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.510 
first mean doing it for many years and
the<00:01:15.750> more<00:01:15.960> or<00:01:16.050> less<00:01:16.140> perfected<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.890> technique

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the more or less perfected the technique

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
the more or less perfected the technique
a<00:01:18.290> couple<00:01:19.290> days<00:01:19.440> before<00:01:19.800> we<00:01:20.490> stocked<00:01:21.300> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
a couple days before we stocked the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.210 
a couple days before we stocked the
lakes<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.110> fishes<00:01:22.440> are<00:01:22.560> gonna<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:22.920> stocked

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
lakes the fishes are gonna be stocked

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.040 
lakes the fishes are gonna be stocked
into<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> lakes<00:01:23.880> are<00:01:24.090> actually<00:01:24.510> starved<00:01:24.870> for

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
into the lakes are actually starved for

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.020 
into the lakes are actually starved for
a<00:01:25.110> couple<00:01:25.410> days<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.830> that's<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.610> they<00:01:26.730> so

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
a couple days and that's just so they so

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.480 
a couple days and that's just so they so
they<00:01:27.150> haul<00:01:27.360> better<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:27.870> they're<00:01:28.200> they<00:01:28.500> they

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
they haul better and they're they they

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.980 
they haul better and they're they they
just<00:01:29.520> perform<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.120> lot<00:01:30.270> better<00:01:30.300> in<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> truck

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
just perform a lot better in the truck

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.110 
just perform a lot better in the truck
if<00:01:31.530> they're<00:01:31.830> on<00:01:32.430> an<00:01:32.550> empty<00:01:32.790> stomach

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
if they're on an empty stomach

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.330 
if they're on an empty stomach
so<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:34.020> will<00:01:34.290> do<00:01:34.410> the<00:01:34.560> day<00:01:34.680> before<00:01:35.100> or

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
so what we will do the day before or

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.010 
so what we will do the day before or
even<00:01:35.370> the<00:01:35.730> same<00:01:36.180> day<00:01:36.330> that<00:01:36.360> their<00:01:36.630> stock<00:01:36.780> we'll

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
even the same day that their stock we'll

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.680 
even the same day that their stock we'll
do<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> sample<00:01:37.470> count<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.460> what<00:01:38.940> we<00:01:39.060> will<00:01:39.480> do

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
do a sample count so what we will do

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.480 
do a sample count so what we will do
will<00:01:39.930> determine<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.530> number<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.890> fish<00:01:41.220> per

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
will determine the number of fish per

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.460 
will determine the number of fish per
kilo<00:01:41.730> for<00:01:42.000> example<00:01:42.750> there's<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.990> hundred<00:01:43.260> fish

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
with her with their outlet pipes so you

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.640 
with her with their outlet pipes so you
basically<00:02:57.090> just<00:02:57.390> pull<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.840> pull<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.380> plunger

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650

on<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.070> gate<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.550> fish<00:02:59.730> go<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.330> go<00:03:00.630> out

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
on the gate and the fish go and go out

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.110 
on the gate and the fish go and go out
into<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.110> lake<00:03:01.230> now<00:03:02.190> you'll<00:03:02.580> see<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.880> scale

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
into the lake now you'll see the scale

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.420 
into the lake now you'll see the scale
on<00:03:03.420> there<00:03:03.660> it's<00:03:04.350> fairly<00:03:04.650> accurate<00:03:04.770> I<00:03:05.280> mean

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
on there it's fairly accurate I mean

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.400 
on there it's fairly accurate I mean
it's<00:03:05.580> for<00:03:05.760> big<00:03:05.910> fish<00:03:06.090> we<00:03:06.330> use<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.810> much<00:03:07.110> finer

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
it's for big fish we use it a much finer

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.250 
it's for big fish we use it a much finer
scale<00:03:07.800> for<00:03:08.070> small<00:03:08.310> fish<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:09.360> that'll<00:03:10.110> that'll

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
scale for small fish and that'll that'll

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.290 
scale for small fish and that'll that'll
act<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:11.130> will<00:03:11.520> keep<00:03:11.670> track<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.150> weight

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
act the will keep track of the weight

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.530 
act the will keep track of the weight
and<00:03:12.860> just<00:03:13.860> every<00:03:14.100> Lake<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.550> is<00:03:15.030> metered<00:03:15.420> out

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540

we'll have our water set up here for the

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.190 
we'll have our water set up here for the
tank<00:03:39.310> systems<00:03:39.819> which<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:40.780> probably<00:03:40.930> already

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
tank systems which you probably already

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.990 
tank systems which you probably already
went<00:03:41.470> through

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
went through

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.790 
went through
they've<00:03:43.300> already<00:03:43.470> calculated<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.530> number<00:03:44.770> of

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
they've already calculated the number of

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.380 
they've already calculated the number of
fish<00:03:45.099> they're<00:03:45.310> gonna<00:03:45.459> require<00:03:45.790> for<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.239> whole

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
fish they're gonna require for the whole

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.900 
fish they're gonna require for the whole
trip<00:03:46.739> what<00:03:47.739> we<00:03:47.860> do<00:03:48.010> then<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.400> I'll<00:03:48.550> look<00:03:48.700> at

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
trip what we do then is I'll look at

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.300 
trip what we do then is I'll look at
their<00:03:49.690> list<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.319> what<00:03:50.650> they've<00:03:50.830> done<00:03:51.069> is

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
their list and what they've done is

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.759 
their list and what they've done is
they've<00:03:51.519> made<00:03:51.550> a<00:03:52.290> priority<00:03:53.290> list<00:03:53.410> or<00:03:53.650> a

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
they've made a priority list or a

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.729 
they've made a priority list or a
wonderful<00:03:54.430> pattern<00:03:54.819> throughout<00:03:55.720> our<00:03:56.140> route

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
wonderful pattern throughout our route

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.150 
wonderful pattern throughout our route
that<00:03:57.430> allows<00:03:57.730> us<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:58.260> do<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.290> fairly<00:03:59.650> efficient

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
that allows us to do a fairly efficient

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.250 
that allows us to do a fairly efficient
run<00:04:00.340> through<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.090> different<00:04:01.209> Lakes<00:04:01.600> and<00:04:01.959> once

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
run through the different Lakes and once

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.720 
run through the different Lakes and once
we<00:04:02.410> depart<00:04:02.769> here<00:04:02.950> we'll<00:04:03.130> head<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.549> first

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
we depart here we'll head to the first

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.880 
we depart here we'll head to the first
one<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.060> then<00:04:04.150> just<00:04:04.209> carry<00:04:04.660> on<00:04:04.750> down<00:04:05.650> through

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
one and then just carry on down through

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.710 
one and then just carry on down through
it<00:04:06.040> but<00:04:06.489> also<00:04:06.640> talk<00:04:07.090> here<00:04:07.390> about<00:04:07.420> their

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
it but also talk here about their

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.289 
it but also talk here about their
different<00:04:08.170> which<00:04:09.069> species<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.819> whether

different which species and whether

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.890 
different which species and whether
which<00:04:11.260> fish<00:04:11.470> will<00:04:11.620> go<00:04:11.739> where<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.790> idea<00:04:13.090> is<00:04:13.180> I

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
which fish will go where the idea is I

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.349 
which fish will go where the idea is I
use<00:04:14.290> these<00:04:14.590> maps<00:04:14.860> here<00:04:15.130> to<00:04:15.250> help<00:04:15.430> determine

use these maps here to help determine
which<00:04:17.169> will<00:04:17.410> go<00:04:17.560> where<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.070> it'll<00:04:18.280> help<00:04:18.459> me<00:04:18.639> if

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
which will go where and it'll help me if

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.099 
which will go where and it'll help me if
there's<00:04:19.239> some<00:04:19.389> of<00:04:19.419> these<00:04:19.540> lakes<00:04:19.780> you<00:04:19.900> know

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
there's some of these lakes you know

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.810 
there's some of these lakes you know
there's<00:04:20.590> some<00:04:20.769> obscure<00:04:21.190> names<00:04:21.370> I<00:04:21.549> don't<00:04:21.729> know

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
there's some obscure names I don't know

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.250 
there's some obscure names I don't know
them<00:04:21.940> all<00:04:22.090> yet<00:04:22.360> but<00:04:24.030> once<00:04:25.030> we're<00:04:25.270> within<00:04:26.110> a

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
them all yet but once we're within a

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.020 
them all yet but once we're within a
proximity<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:27.070> usually<00:04:27.340> about<00:04:27.550> two<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.850> three

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
proximity and usually about two to three

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.790 
proximity and usually about two to three
minutes<00:04:28.330> out<00:04:28.419> they<00:04:28.630> have<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:28.990> dumping<00:04:29.590> pail

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
minutes out they have the dumping pail

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.920 
minutes out they have the dumping pail
there<00:04:30.070> I'll<00:04:30.940> let<00:04:31.150> them<00:04:31.270> know<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:31.690> then<00:04:31.810> they

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
there I'll let them know and then they

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.690 
there I'll let them know and then they
will<00:04:32.110> allocate<00:04:32.350> his<00:04:32.620> number<00:04:32.860> of<00:04:32.950> fish<00:04:33.160> on<00:04:33.430> to

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
will allocate his number of fish on to

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.430 
will allocate his number of fish on to
that<00:04:33.850> pail<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.300> then<00:04:34.870> within<00:04:35.050> two<00:04:35.320> minutes

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
that pail and then within two minutes

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.110 
that pail and then within two minutes
they'll<00:04:35.800> open<00:04:36.010> up<00:04:36.100> the<00:04:36.220> door<00:04:36.430> I<00:04:36.669> will<00:04:36.880> do<00:04:37.000> an

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
they'll open up the door I will do an

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.840 
they'll open up the door I will do an
approach<00:04:37.479> and<00:04:38.200> a<00:04:38.289> very<00:04:38.500> kind<00:04:39.250> of<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.370> low<00:04:39.550> and

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
approach and a very kind of a low and

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.000 
approach and a very kind of a low and
slow<00:04:40.500> flight<00:04:41.500> over<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:43.030> lake<00:04:43.620> at<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.680> speed

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
slow flight over the the lake at a speed

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.190 
slow flight over the the lake at a speed
that<00:04:45.250> allows<00:04:45.550> them<00:04:45.820> to<00:04:46.030> dump<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.570> fish<00:04:46.750> off<00:04:46.930> so

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
that allows them to dump the fish off so

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.529 
that allows them to dump the fish off so
it<00:04:47.320> doesn't<00:04:47.620> harm<00:04:47.740> them<00:04:47.979> upon<00:04:48.729> landing<00:04:49.390> into

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
it doesn't harm them upon landing into

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.300 
it doesn't harm them upon landing into
the<00:04:49.720> lake<00:04:49.870> itself<00:04:50.200> and<00:04:50.320> then<00:04:50.800> we<00:04:50.860> just<00:04:51.010> move<00:04:51.160> on

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
the lake itself and then we just move on

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.900 
the lake itself and then we just move on
to<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.490> next<00:04:51.789> ones<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.570> we<00:04:52.870> go<00:04:52.990> through<00:04:53.910> 25

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
to the next ones and we go through 25

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:16.890 
to the next ones and we go through 25
today<00:04:55.150> if<00:04:55.780> for<00:04:56.020> each<00:04:56.080> each<00:04:56.650> shift
