00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.529
 all this without any cost everything happened very simple short 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.929
 it was a show in the world feel present in the cycling world 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.329
 as port make the system 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.069
 automatically detects 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.659
 okami better said automatically the printer settings 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:35.489
 default depending on the harrington we are connected for example can be 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.879
 assaulted in your home and automatically when you connect them to a printer 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.210
 when for example they see their laptop at work 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.290
 and connects to the work network 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.290
 it will automatically detect the work printer 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.980
 the only thing is an assumption 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.990
 I think we have to do 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.860
 is that not only was it encouraged and mission 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.480
 don if the control panel 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.480
 inside the control panel and in your case I have the hows 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.480
 we are not and what they are 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.350
 devices in three hours 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.420
 explains and 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.400
 is going to be what we are devices entrepreneurs do not hide the devices 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.930
 because we are going to work on printers 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.570
 only with the wishes to the team to any of the printers this case 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.410
 to the team 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.960
 amy hp printers 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.810
 and the other to know the click to the printer the top right side is going to 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.210
 appear this option 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.210
 the default printers of the matica and 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.190
 I was going to go to this window 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.740
 Obolo figures in Beijing once and always always use the same person 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.390
 common person predetermined 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.490
 we are going to change it to the second option 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.930
 change printer 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.970
 default when you changed network 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.570

 and the houses included added 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.740
 I want that when there are not any 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.019
 no network is committed 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.479
 that automatically 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.159
 it is a decline to what is read 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.029
