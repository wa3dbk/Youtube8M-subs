Diagnostics recovery toolset now you can

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.540 
Diagnostics recovery toolset now you can
actually<00:00:15.839> analyze<00:00:16.349> these<00:00:16.710> mini<00:00:17.040> dump<00:00:17.279> files

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.500 
actually analyze these mini dump files
with<00:00:18.419> a<00:00:18.450> blue<00:00:19.230> screen<00:00:19.470> view<00:00:19.860> who<00:00:20.730> crashed<00:00:21.150> and

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
with a blue screen view who crashed and

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.790 
with a blue screen view who crashed and
where<00:00:22.019> ever<00:00:22.199> there's<00:00:22.380> loads<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.650> different

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
where ever there's loads of different

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.859 
where ever there's loads of different
programs<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.460> actually<00:00:23.609> analyze<00:00:24.480> these<00:00:24.660> but

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
programs to actually analyze these but

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.089 
programs to actually analyze these but
we're<00:00:24.990> gonna<00:00:25.080> be<00:00:25.230> using<00:00:25.380> their<00:00:25.769> thought

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
we're gonna be using their thought

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.029 
we're gonna be using their thought
software<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:28.259> happens<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.710> when<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.949> get

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
software so what happens is when you get

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.999 
software so what happens is when you get
blue<00:00:29.310> screens<00:00:30.109> it<00:00:31.109> starts<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.650> create<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
blue screens it starts to create a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.430 
blue screens it starts to create a
little<00:00:32.279> folder<00:00:32.809> inside<00:00:33.809> your<00:00:33.870> windows

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
little folder inside your windows

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.590 
little folder inside your windows
directory<00:00:34.710> called<00:00:35.070> mini<00:00:35.370> dump<00:00:35.610> ok<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.449> this

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
directory called mini dump ok and this

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.799 
directory called mini dump ok and this
will<00:00:36.809> create<00:00:36.960> dump<00:00:37.379> files<00:00:37.680> like<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.629> we're

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
will create dump files like so and we're

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.000 
will create dump files like so and we're
gonna<00:00:39.900> be<00:00:40.080> showing<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.409> how<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> read<00:00:40.830> these

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
gonna be showing you how to read these

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.549 
gonna be showing you how to read these
files<00:00:41.400> they<00:00:42.269> could<00:00:42.570> use<00:00:42.720> blue<00:00:42.930> screen<00:00:43.229> viewers

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
files they could use blue screen viewers

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.990 
files they could use blue screen viewers
I<00:00:43.680> said<00:00:43.920> I'm<00:00:44.309> gonna<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.610> showing<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.879> how<00:00:44.970> to

I said I'm gonna be showing you how to

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.039 
I said I'm gonna be showing you how to
use<00:00:45.710> dot<00:00:46.850> which<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.000> short<00:00:48.269> for<00:00:48.330> Microsoft

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.049 
use dot which is short for Microsoft

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.680 
use dot which is short for Microsoft
Diagnostics<00:00:49.710> recovery<00:00:50.670> tool<00:00:50.879> set<00:00:51.119> so<00:00:51.330> it's<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
Diagnostics recovery tool set so it's a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.160 
Diagnostics recovery tool set so it's a
reboot<00:00:52.080> system<00:00:53.330> to<00:00:54.330> help<00:00:54.449> diagnose<00:00:54.960> our

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
reboot system to help diagnose our

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.479 
reboot system to help diagnose our
problem

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.660 

okay<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.329> I've<00:01:00.629> rebooted<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.140> my<00:01:01.290> CD<00:01:01.500> now<00:01:02.340> I'm

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
okay so I've rebooted to my CD now I'm

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.840 
okay so I've rebooted to my CD now I'm
using<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.120> custom<00:01:03.570> built<00:01:04.260> CD<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.610> may

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
using a custom built CD here but you may

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.870 
using a custom built CD here but you may
have<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.049> actual<00:01:07.350> ard<00:01:08.130> or<00:01:08.630> MOX<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.869> that

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
have just the actual ard or MOX of that

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.969 
have just the actual ard or MOX of that
version<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.050> custom<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.650> won't<00:01:13.860> be

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
version so this is a custom you won't be

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.240 
version so this is a custom you won't be
seeing<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:15.020> version<00:01:16.020> here<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.860> will<00:01:17.040> be

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
seeing this version here but it will be

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.700 
seeing this version here but it will be
the<00:01:17.369> same<00:01:17.640> thing<00:01:17.909> when<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.330> boot<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.810> so

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
the same thing when you boot to it so

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.830 
the same thing when you boot to it so
I'm<00:01:19.800> going<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.950> boot<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.300> windows<00:01:21.300> 7<00:01:21.509> version

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
I'm going to boot to windows 7 version

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:33.330 
I'm going to boot to windows 7 version
they're<00:01:22.759> very<00:01:23.759> two<00:01:23.940> bit<00:01:25.729> let<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.820> load<00:01:27.060> up

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.520 

and<00:01:33.820> what's<00:01:34.030> this<00:01:34.149> is<00:01:34.360> loaded<00:01:34.720> in<00:01:34.840> we<00:01:35.350> can

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
and what's this is loaded in we can

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.880 
and what's this is loaded in we can
actually<00:01:35.829> diagnose<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.720> pressure<00:01:38.409> on<00:01:38.590> files

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
actually diagnose the pressure on files

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:47.480 
actually diagnose the pressure on files
there

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.770 

so<00:01:48.090> I'm<00:01:48.180> gonna<00:01:48.270> say<00:01:48.480> yes<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.780> is

I'm going to say yesterday just gonna go
next<00:01:56.900> here<00:01:58.540> let's<00:01:59.540> search<00:01:59.810> for<00:01:59.840> Windows

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
next here let's search for Windows

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:11.540 
next here let's search for Windows
installations

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.600 

they're<00:02:12.150> not<00:02:12.300> going<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.540> go<00:02:12.660> next<00:02:13.170> here

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
they're not going to go next here

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.490 
they're not going to go next here
and<00:02:15.700> then<00:02:16.360> will<00:02:16.570> I<00:02:16.720> want<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:16.960> come<00:02:17.110> down<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.410> the

and then will I want to come down to the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.800 
and then will I want to come down to the
bottom<00:02:17.650> here<00:02:17.980> where<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.460> says<00:02:18.600> box<00:02:19.600> of

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
bottom here where it says box of

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.950 
bottom here where it says box of
diagnostics<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.740> recovery<00:02:21.340> tool<00:02:21.550> set<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.870> I'm

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
diagnostics and recovery tool set so I'm

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.710 
diagnostics and recovery tool set so I'm
going<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.200> click<00:02:23.320> on<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:23.710> and<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:25.330> gives<00:02:25.360> us<00:02:25.690> a

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
going to click on that and it gives us a

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.230 
going to click on that and it gives us a
load<00:02:25.990> of<00:02:26.220> options<00:02:27.220> here<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:27.850> what<00:02:28.060> we're

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
load of options here and what we're

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.490 
load of options here and what we're
looking<00:02:28.360> for<00:02:28.590> in<00:02:29.590> this<00:02:29.860> video<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:31.990> crass

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
looking for in this video is a crass

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.680 
looking for in this video is a crass
analyzer<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:33.850> we're<00:02:33.970> going<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.150> go<00:02:34.300> into<00:02:34.570> this

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
analyzer so we're going to go into this

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.870 
analyzer so we're going to go into this
one<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:35.110> will<00:02:35.650> be<00:02:35.770> making<00:02:35.980> some<00:02:36.130> videos<00:02:36.400> about

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
one I will be making some videos about

use them so what we're going to do is go

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.380 
use them so what we're going to do is go
into<00:02:40.990> crash<00:02:41.350> analyzer<00:02:41.890> for<00:02:42.220> this<00:02:42.340> one<00:02:42.520> now

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
into crash analyzer for this one now

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.390 
into crash analyzer for this one now
normally<00:02:43.750> go<00:02:44.140> straight<00:02:44.470> into<00:02:44.650> next<00:02:44.980> here<00:02:45.250> and

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
normally go straight into next here and

normally go straight into next here and
leave<00:02:45.520> automatic<00:02:46.260> configure<00:02:47.260> tools<00:02:47.470> I'm

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
leave automatic configure tools I'm

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.340 
leave automatic configure tools I'm
going<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.130> take<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.400> out<00:02:48.990> just<00:02:49.990> to<00:02:50.080> show<00:02:50.110> you

and this is what's happening and it's
gonna<00:02:55.120> go<00:02:55.330> see<00:02:55.989> cymbals<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:57.880> can<00:02:58.090> put<00:02:58.239> the

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
gonna go see cymbals and you can put the

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.479 
gonna go see cymbals and you can put the
ticking<00:02:58.630> there<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.959> delete<00:02:59.260> cymbals<00:02:59.709> once

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
ticking there to delete cymbals once

you've finished your job so it deletes

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.740 
you've finished your job so it deletes
them<00:03:03.190> off<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.489> system<00:03:03.880> especially<00:03:04.090> if<00:03:04.480> it's<00:03:04.630> a

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
them off the system especially if it's a

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.070 
them off the system especially if it's a
customer's<00:03:05.170> PC<00:03:05.530> you<00:03:05.650> may<00:03:05.800> want<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.040> do<00:03:06.190> that

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
customer's PC you may want to do that

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.760 
customer's PC you may want to do that
so<00:03:08.080> I'm<00:03:08.170> gonna<00:03:08.260> go<00:03:08.410> next<00:03:08.590> here<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:11.530> is

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
so I'm gonna go next here and this is

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.070 
so I'm gonna go next here and this is
basically<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.459> list<00:03:12.880> of<00:03:13.120> crash<00:03:13.510> dump<00:03:13.780> files

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
basically the list of crash dump files

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.680 
basically the list of crash dump files
in<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.040> place<00:03:15.489> that<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:15.760> showed<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.150> in<00:03:16.360> my<00:03:16.390> C

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
in that place that I showed you in my C

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.199 
in that place that I showed you in my C
windows<00:03:17.140> so<00:03:17.950> what<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.220> need<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.489> do<00:03:18.640> here<00:03:19.000> is

I'm going to select the latest one which

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.080 
I'm going to select the latest one which
is<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.170> top<00:03:23.350> one<00:03:23.530> here<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:24.100> then<00:03:24.790> just<00:03:24.970> go

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
next okay so it's loaded there symbols

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.870 
next okay so it's loaded there symbols
and<00:03:28.330> it's<00:03:29.170> now<00:03:29.320> loaded<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:29.980> drivers<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.760> it

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
and it's now loaded the drivers and it

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.080 
and it's now loaded the drivers and it
will<00:03:31.000> now<00:03:31.120> start<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.570> scan<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.140> system<00:03:33.090> for

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
will now start to scan the system for

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.009 
will now start to scan the system for
errors<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:36.670> it'll<00:03:36.880> read<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.180> dump<00:03:37.390> file<00:03:37.660> and

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
errors and it'll read the dump file and

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.990 
errors and it'll read the dump file and
it<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.320> read<00:03:38.590> order<00:03:38.980> system<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.459> let<00:03:39.730> you<00:03:39.850> know
