00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.490 
principle but it wasn't like we must
keep<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.370> at<00:00:59.520> Oscorp<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.719> flowed<00:01:01.260> naturally

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
keep it at Oscorp it flowed naturally

friend Roth cornet who actually

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.270 
friend Roth cornet who actually
conducted<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.869> interview<00:01:13.080> oh<00:01:13.650> yeah<00:01:14.100> that's

conducted this interview oh yeah that's
right<00:01:14.369> yes<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:15.780> then<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.159> for<00:01:17.340> what<00:01:17.490> he

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
right yes and then for that for what he

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640 
right yes and then for that for what he
said<00:01:17.909> yeah<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.180> think<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.570> makes<00:01:18.720> sense<00:01:18.930> i<00:01:19.229> like

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
said yeah I think it makes sense i like

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.300 
said yeah I think it makes sense i like
it<00:01:19.890> i<00:01:20.040> think<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.580> terms<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.439> storyline<00:01:22.860> for

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
it i think in terms of the storyline for

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.370 
it i think in terms of the storyline for
the<00:01:23.430> movies<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.180> makes<00:01:24.240> more<00:01:24.720> sense<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.200> it

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the movies it makes more sense that it

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.190 
the movies it makes more sense that it
comes<00:01:25.619> from<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:26.250> place<00:01:26.610> versus<00:01:27.119> having<00:01:27.869> all

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
comes from one place versus having all

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.109 
comes from one place versus having all
these<00:01:28.380> different<00:01:28.740> origin<00:01:29.400> stories<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:29.970> all

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
these different origin stories for all

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.819 
these different origin stories for all
these<00:01:30.390> different<00:01:30.630> villains<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.229> great<00:01:31.530> for

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
these different villains it's great for

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.850 
these different villains it's great for
the<00:01:31.920> comic<00:01:32.310> books<00:01:32.520> right<00:01:32.790> now<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.710> almost

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the comic books right now but it almost

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.950 
the comic books right now but it almost
gets<00:01:35.189> kind<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.579> silly<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.540> put<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
gets kind of silly if you put in the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.140 
gets kind of silly if you put in the
movie<00:01:37.229> contacts<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.100> guy<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.880> thing

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
movie contacts like this guy this thing

sudden<00:01:47.399> suddenly<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.090> becomes<00:01:48.450> more

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
sudden suddenly just becomes more

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.139 
sudden suddenly just becomes more
comical<00:01:49.259> right<00:01:49.590> instead<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.220> realistic<00:01:50.700> until

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
comical right instead of realistic until

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.859 
comical right instead of realistic until
I<00:01:51.210> think<00:01:51.420> with<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> Oscorp<00:01:51.869> thing<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.470> think

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
I think with the Oscorp thing I think

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.539 
I think with the Oscorp thing I think
taking<00:01:54.869> all<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> villains<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.680> are<00:01:55.829> that

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
taking all the villains that are that

that<00:02:50.639> spark<00:02:51.030> point<00:02:51.269> is<00:02:51.419> going<00:02:51.599> to<00:02:51.659> be<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.930> scorp

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
that spark point is going to be a scorp

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.409 
that spark point is going to be a scorp
that<00:02:52.980> everything<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:53.849> happens<00:02:54.180> there<00:02:54.299> is

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 
that everything that happens there is

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:55.819 
that everything that happens there is
going<00:02:54.629> to<00:02:54.689> stream<00:02:55.079> out<00:02:55.230> from<00:02:55.530> there<00:02:55.709> and

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
going to stream out from there and

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.530 
going to stream out from there and
whatever<00:02:55.980> their<00:02:56.340> grand<00:02:56.669> scheme<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.209> which<00:02:57.389> we

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
whatever their grand scheme is which we

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.750 
whatever their grand scheme is which we
still<00:02:57.689> don't<00:02:57.750> know<00:02:57.930> what<00:02:58.109> that<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.290> really<00:02:58.829> so

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
still don't know what that is really so

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.649 
still don't know what that is really so
I<00:02:59.790> like<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.180> fact<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:00.419> they're<00:03:00.569> gonna

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
I like the fact that they're gonna

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:01.909 
I like the fact that they're gonna
connect<00:03:00.959> all<00:03:01.109> these<00:03:01.349> things<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.680> one<00:03:01.799> thing

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
connect all these things to one thing

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.039 
connect all these things to one thing
because<00:03:02.189> it's<00:03:02.700> also<00:03:02.909> less<00:03:03.269> coincidental<00:03:04.019> that

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
because it's also less coincidental that

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.159

story<00:03:27.449> mechanism<00:03:27.959> in<00:03:28.019> Oz<00:03:28.139> Corp<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.620> they<00:03:28.769> can

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
story mechanism in Oz Corp that they can

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.619 
story mechanism in Oz Corp that they can
have<00:03:29.040> all<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.310> this<00:03:29.699> stuff<00:03:29.909> come<00:03:30.120> out<00:03:30.209> of<00:03:30.449> and

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
have all of this stuff come out of and

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.689 
have all of this stuff come out of and
it<00:03:31.169> just<00:03:31.530> makes<00:03:31.859> sense<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.370> then<00:03:32.489> we<00:03:32.609> don't

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:32.699 
it just makes sense and then we don't

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:33.890 
it just makes sense and then we don't
have<00:03:32.819> to<00:03:32.909> get<00:03:33.090> into<00:03:33.180> some<00:03:33.359> big<00:03:33.510> convoluted

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
have to get into some big convoluted

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.140 
have to get into some big convoluted
thing<00:03:34.290> about<00:03:34.470> how<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:35.549> know<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.790> Sinister

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
thing about how you know the Sinister

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.789 
thing about how you know the Sinister
Six<00:03:36.180> all<00:03:36.510> come<00:03:36.659> together<00:03:36.810> something<00:03:37.590> that

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
Six all come together something that

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.140 
Six all come together something that
chap<00:03:37.949> or<00:03:38.099> is<00:03:38.159> asking<00:03:38.489> wait<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.819> minute<00:03:39.030> what

chap or is asking wait a minute what
about<00:03:39.180> venom<00:03:39.629> and<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.810> alien<00:03:40.229> summit<00:03:40.560> will

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
about venom and the alien summit will

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.420 
about venom and the alien summit will
the<00:03:41.040> will<00:03:41.639> it<00:03:41.729> still<00:03:41.970> be<00:03:42.000> an<00:03:42.150> alien<00:03:42.599> entity<00:03:43.049> I

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
the will it still be an alien entity I

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.729 
the will it still be an alien entity I
don't<00:03:44.430> know<00:03:44.639> he<00:03:45.509> does<00:03:45.870> open<00:03:46.139> the<00:03:46.259> door<00:03:46.530> that

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
don't know he does open the door that

don't know he does open the door that
Oscorp<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.549> mean<00:03:47.699> this<00:03:48.329> spider-man<00:03:48.780> universe

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
Oscorp I mean this spider-man universe

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:55.030 
Oscorp I mean this spider-man universe
it<00:03:49.620> isn't<00:03:51.229> really<00:03:52.229> necessary<00:03:53.359> for<00:03:54.359> the<00:03:54.540> venom

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
it isn't really necessary for the venom

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.610 
it isn't really necessary for the venom
entity<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.220> have<00:03:56.340> come<00:03:56.519> from<00:03:56.549> outer<00:03:57.060> space

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
entity to have come from outer space

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.439 
entity to have come from outer space
although<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.919> still<00:03:59.579> makes<00:03:59.909> perfect<00:04:00.269> sense

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
although it still makes perfect sense

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:01.939 
although it still makes perfect sense
that<00:04:00.629> it<00:04:00.900> did<00:04:01.109> come<00:04:01.259> from<00:04:01.319> outer<00:04:01.560> space<00:04:01.799> and

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
that it did come from outer space and

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.469 
that it did come from outer space and
Oscorp<00:04:02.370> got<00:04:02.519> their<00:04:02.669> hands<00:04:02.970> on<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.389> then

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
Oscorp got their hands on it and then

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.899 
Oscorp got their hands on it and then
manipulated<00:04:04.259> it<00:04:04.379> by<00:04:04.859> bonding<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.459> to<00:04:05.579> a<00:04:05.609> human

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
manipulated it by bonding it to a human

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.610 
manipulated it by bonding it to a human
being<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.449> making<00:04:07.019> that<00:04:07.109> happen<00:04:07.229> so<00:04:07.470> there's

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
being and making that happen so there's

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.509 
being and making that happen so there's
still<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:07.799> lot<00:04:07.919> how<00:04:08.189> do<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.280> think<00:04:08.430> you're

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
still a lot how do you think you're

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.619 
still a lot how do you think you're
going<00:04:08.639> to<00:04:08.669> handle<00:04:08.909> the<00:04:08.970> venom<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.269> mean<00:04:09.449> either

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
going to handle the venom I mean either

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.420 
going to handle the venom I mean either
way<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.959> think<00:04:10.349> I'm<00:04:10.470> fine<00:04:10.709> with<00:04:10.889> it<00:04:10.949> whether

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
way I think I'm fine with it whether

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.939 
way I think I'm fine with it whether
they<00:04:11.759> created<00:04:12.329> in<00:04:12.509> their<00:04:12.720> own<00:04:12.840> labs<00:04:13.139> or<00:04:13.470> if

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
they created in their own labs or if

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.279 
they created in their own labs or if
they<00:04:14.250> found<00:04:14.909> it<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.359> then<00:04:15.479> you<00:04:15.930> know<00:04:16.049> they're

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
they found it and then you know they're

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.920 
they found it and then you know they're
holding<00:04:16.979> it<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:17.310> think<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.180> big<00:04:18.359> question<00:04:18.509> is

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
holding it I think the big question is

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.469 
holding it I think the big question is
is<00:04:19.259> the<00:04:19.919> tsendi<00:04:20.250> i'm<00:04:20.370> going<00:04:20.849> to<00:04:20.970> go<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.209> peter

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
is the tsendi i'm going to go to peter

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.050 
is the tsendi i'm going to go to peter
parker<00:04:21.810> first<00:04:22.260> before<00:04:23.250> it<00:04:23.310> goes<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.610> venom<00:04:23.880> or

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
parker first before it goes the venom or

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.580 
parker first before it goes the venom or
is<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.270> going<00:04:24.389> to<00:04:24.450> go<00:04:24.570> straight<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:25.260> just<00:04:25.469> met

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
is it going to go straight to just met

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.210 
is it going to go straight to just met
