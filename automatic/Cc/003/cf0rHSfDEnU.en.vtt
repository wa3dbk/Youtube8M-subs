00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.730
 in this video I will explain how 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.490
 perform the crochet or high point 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.900
 first let's make a chain 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.900
 we start by making a slipknot 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.830
 and then let's make the string myself 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.620
 this case I will make it 8 points 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.370
 one 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.060
 two 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.200
 3 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.740
 4 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.740
 5 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.960
 7 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.360
 8 if you want to see how to make a chain 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.600
 you can click on the image that 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.220
 appears here or search below in the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.540
 description of the video I will leave the 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.200
 link 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.610
 well once we have the chain 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.990
 let's do 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.590
 three chains plus one 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.590
 two 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:09.430
 3 and then we will make a loop and 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:13.620
 let's introduce the string in the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.620
 room 1 2 3 4 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:22.310
 in the fourth point 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.350
 we introduce we take out we have 3 and 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.000
 now we are going to make one more loop and 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.040
 let's go through inside the two 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.590
 first 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.620
 laced 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.110
 coat 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.930
 inside of the two I have two of 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.020
 new and now I'm going to make a loop 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.730
 again and I'm going to take out inside 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:49.310
 the two then it would be that we are taking out 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.310
 two by two let's do it again 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.280
 laced 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.759
 I put the needle in the next 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.759
 point 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.710
 I take the thread with the hook 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.930
 coat 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.039
 3 remain 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.780
 made a loop again and I'm going to 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.780
 draw inside the first two 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.470
 I have two left and now he took out again 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.380
 inside the two 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.490
 and so we would have the point vareta 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.000
 laced 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:35.550
 introduce in the next point he took the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.800
 thread I have three lasso 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:43.590
 inside the first two are left 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.590
 two and pulled inside 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:07.000
 and so we will be staying 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:10.130
 the point vareta but I leave 3 remain 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.650
 loop sack inside the two 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.910
 first two are left and now the room 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.840
 again and pulled by 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.840
 we 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.020
 in the living room 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:28.860
 introduced with the next point he took the 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:31.680
 and he got it out 3 left behind 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.930
 step inside the first two I 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.930
 there are two left and I step inside the two 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.750
 the last two points remain 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.390
 and we are going to do 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.390
 a little bit of the second round 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.250
 now the last 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.390
 here we have our first round for 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.390
 do the second one let's do 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.660
 three chains 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.920
 we turn the fabric 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.920
 and we do the same a loop 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.960
 we introduce 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.560
 not in this but in what 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.200
 we produce the needle we take the thread we 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.190
 3 remain 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.190
 linked 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:49.310
 I introduce as the child sack 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.340
 there are 3 lazada step inside the 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.970
 first two I have two left and now 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.210
 postponed again and passed through the others 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.210
 arms 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.000
 and so 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.669
 the point is made vareta 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.690
