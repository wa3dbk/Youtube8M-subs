really run properly as you can see is

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.750 
really run properly as you can see is
doing<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> ballistic<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:50.070> will<00:00:50.190> take<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
doing a ballistic so we will take the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.700 
doing a ballistic so we will take the
control<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.090> mouse<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.539> keyboard<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.989> see

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
control of mouse and keyboard and see

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.069 
control of mouse and keyboard and see
how<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.070> performs<00:00:54.500> as<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:56.190> can<00:00:56.340> see<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
how this performs as you can see the the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.920 
how this performs as you can see the the
frame<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.559> pretty<00:00:58.770> smooth<00:00:59.120> if<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.539> see

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the shadows low / we have tried it on

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.469 
the shadows low / we have tried it on
high<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.770> medium<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.520> famous<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.030> that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
smooth but on low it runs pretty well

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.999 
smooth but on low it runs pretty well
and<00:01:17.700> since<00:01:18.509> his<00:01:18.689> world<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.049> warcraft<00:01:19.439> you

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009

and since his world of warcraft you
don't<00:01:20.189> really<00:01:20.280> need<00:01:20.780> high<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.930> graphics

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
don't really need high in graphics

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.399 
don't really need high in graphics

anyway so as you can see it's running

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.200 
anyway so as you can see it's running
pretty<00:01:25.439> smoothly<00:01:26.280> there<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.790> no<00:01:26.850> sound<00:01:27.030> of
