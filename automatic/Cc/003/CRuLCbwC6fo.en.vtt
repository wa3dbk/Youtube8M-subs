00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.860
 people it's false ceilings to buy 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.240
 I hope you have blamed for 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.070
 a new video on the channel a 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.240
 new review a review of a legend 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.040
 it's been quite a while that I have not 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.330
 out of legend review so for 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.310
 the occasion I decided to do the review 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.040
 of steps in the heart the Croatian striker 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.900
 which is available low on the market 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.949
 for more than fourteen already it's not 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.900
 a new legend is people who 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.690
 has been around for quite some time 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.890
 you signed so I had you at 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.150
 put on pause to put back in 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.739
 rear know observed at the level 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.970
 of the team I decided to stall him in 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.559
 a hybrid because it's true that its 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.770
 nationality if you do not have for example 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.680
 other legends to m with him that's 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.450
 complicated enough for the teams of the coup 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.390
 I did a little mix series at juventus 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:05.119
 argentina germany liga bbva a team 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.140
 really nice rather original already 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.060
 because we are not used to seeing 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.759
 what kind of equipped and who is really 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.140
 very very good for the live so the 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.600
 Sunday at the launch of the topic 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.610
 now between 95 miles and 140 miles 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.070
 credit its price range this is a 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.299
 accessible player and there are some there are 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.070
 some legends that are not 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.210
 findable on the transfer market 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.170
 him there is still a lot there 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.140
 had two three pages when I 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.610
 watched last time and he's 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.720
 accessible as accessible in terms of 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.820
 price and seen the quality of the player 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.740
 honestly it's a good investment 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.030
 I advise you now at 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.680
 level of the positives because he 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.210
 there are no negatives finally there are 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.990
 a negative point that I regret it is 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.270
 at the level of mistakes 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.670
 I had a number cut 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.110
 countless times in the surface of 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.619
 repair without the mistakes being 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.030
 whistled with three examples in the review 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.890
 it's very complicated to get 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.479
 mistakes when the doithire gets done 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.340
 to tackle unevenly I did not understand 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.360
 why, moreover, it serves to make an observation 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.340
 that I had done for big 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.600
 players during captions or detox the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.950
 referees in the game tend to 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.920
 whistle a lot less faults 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.259
 and well it was verified on a lot of 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.149
 situations with the marketer so at 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.739
 positive pros level now everything 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.900
 what is ball striking 88 in 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.100
 finish 84 shocks me the end 4 in 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.450
 hitting power you can hit from to 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.670
 just about anywhere with it 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.900
 has the advantage of having the four stars 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.579
 bad foot blow you can hit 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.200
 left foot right foot 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.130
 it's the same for him besides scama 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.000
 positive points go 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.130
 generally I find that the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.170
 leftists who must rather mean in the 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.180
 game gold there is not at all the case 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.860
 and not for those who will play as 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.480
 that scorer me I'm going to offensively because 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.640
 that I prefer it to this post but for 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.570
 those who will play the game as 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.280
 scorer 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.320
 here he has the qualities required to 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.610
 put a lot of goals 1 hour I did 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.360
 and I put more goals than I did 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.950
 two assists 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.180
 as usual when I played middle 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.430
 offensive generally I tend to 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.200
 force quite a bit on the scorers side of the 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.700
 player at the pass quality level 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.650
 for those who will make it play in 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.100
 as a midfielder south 1 79 years 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.270
 pass on the map but 79 that makes 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.280
 rather average like this talent especially 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.660
 for a legend but honestly it's 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.030
 not that it's not stages like that and 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.770
 he does not know I do not know that 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.180
 felt how very very big he is 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.160
 quality of passes either passes 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.440
 in depth it's past dawn and 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.140
 with him the greeks she a triangle 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.990
 it's totally anything with him 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.390
 at the 4-star technique level and 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.240
 technical gestures 88 in dribbling a game 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.190
 he is very impressive technically 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.530
 in the game it feels pretty good 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.720
 a great skiing pleasure but with him I 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.870
 I made a lot of fun you 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.629
 there are enough nice clip tosh 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.129
 new technical level in model in 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.230
 shook up his head game that takes 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.330
 a lot of balloons of the head 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.630
 hylas 1 88 years accuracy of head with 1 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.250
 84 in balance knowing in 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.560
 83 years old at the earliest knowing that he is making a 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.069
 meter 83 he takes a lot of balloons 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.690
 of the head 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.510
 so after I did not have them in 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.920
 offensive position ie gender in 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.300
 center head 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.790
 you need a balloon in the surface was 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.590
 especially on defensive phases I 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.620
 recovered a lot of balloons field 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.739
 overhead with the shock hours and after at 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.590
 physical level 74 in strength 84 in 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.020
 balance 90 in agility 83 years where I the 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.640
 accurate and just before it really holds 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.090
 very very good very difficult poles 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.239
 to move 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.160
 and bah as I explained the only ones 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.750
 times when he got really moved 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.000
 it was faults in the surface that 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.889
 have not been whistled so there you have 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.700
 the balance sheet of the seller that appears 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.590
 in front of your eyes 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.240
 so at the level of the positive rates the 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.370
 four stars and technical gestures the 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.200
 four stars bad foot his vision of 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.970
 the 82-year-old vision what is really 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.410
 very correct for one for those who are going 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.070
 play it as a medium 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.590
 aggressive 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.790
 his striking long cat finish you can 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.500
 knock on just about anywhere and 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.889
 Mark and Dale resume his foremost 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.790
 speed there are 81 speed on the map 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.280
 but when it is launched 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.080
 it's anything he does not have 80 it's 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.820
 a bit like the times it is 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.220
 say that once launched after having 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.110
 chained one or two rakes it speeds up 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.479
 it's really very very complicated to 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.940
 catch up with a little speed of gay 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.350
 dribble 88 in dribbling physics game 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.669
 balance of strength 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.770
 he really is very very good at 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.550
 the shoulder his head game he is very good 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.350
 in the air sector 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.400
 aggression that I did not talk about it but 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.229
 people pressing the wearer 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.690
 balloon to try to precisely 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.610
 to rake ball leap in front of the 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.440
 opposing surface always positioning 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.110
 well placed always makes the right call he 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.550
 really stays ahead all the time he's 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.650
 the strong offensive contribution 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.419
 defensive contribution saw that that him 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.610
 allows to stay in front of all the time and 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.789
 so its quality not 79 jobs on the 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.780
 map and but that's a felt a lot 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.400
 more here it is 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.540
 he's not 79 he's lying he's 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.430
 able to make very very beautiful 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.110
 opening for those who will play it in 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.250
 as a midfielder so that's it 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.440
 that's all for this overflow review 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.760
 shocker I hope this review has you 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.410
