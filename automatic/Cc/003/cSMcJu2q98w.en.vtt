00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.820
 Hello everyone Bender and today I 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.300
 I would like to start what I have already planned 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.340
 long time ago and it will be a series of tutorials yes yes 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.000
 You heard the series of tutorials but 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.940
 why same 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.520
 by huge fashion called royal 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.890
 kraft so many people wanted me 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.840
 left small mods and started 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.810
 talk about huge big 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.519
 interesting fashions and they were right no this 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.560
 doesn't mean that little mods are no longer 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.510
 will be on the channel just extra 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.760
 There will be a series of tutorials on 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.430
 big mod today we 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.980
 We begin a series of tutorials on fashion under 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.469
 name royal kraft mod which 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.289
 really deserves the right to call 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.210
 yourself huge hefty and interesting and 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.280
 what is in this fashion and what 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.140
 actually this castle is such a mod 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.600
 Maykroft adds a huge 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.000
 number of trains 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.760
 rails trolleys which is not only in this 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.730
 fashion all that is connected with the railway 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.830
 here is he adds maykravt not 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.320
 just some new sleepers and he 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.540
 adds a system that 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.880
 approximate to reality 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.560
 how in real life are made of iron 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.030
 the roads will be partly here 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.430
 make railways 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.460
 I'll say right away that these series will not be 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.100
 big maybe they will be 58 10 minutes 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.259
 how much it will turn out and perhaps today I 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.990
 I would like to tell you about the stove 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.180
 coke oven what is it this thing 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.250
 which you will need to do to 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.710
 somehow interact with this mod 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.720
 to do different things here and yes 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.520
 I will immediately say that in this fashion 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.990
 you will need a huge 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.060
 amount of resources 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.909
 really huge so better 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.829
 stock up in advance but the resources nor 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.770
 less today we will proceed to 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.729
 crafting coke oven 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.509
 first we need the following 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.659
 resources are cheat well 33 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.360
 300k sand we need and also us 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.800
 need one hundred and four bricks and mind 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.780
 sand we need 130 if they 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.480
 afraid yes we will need one hundred and four 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.729
 bricks and 130 sand 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.050
 brick and you yourself know how to do but 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.930
 for those who do not know, I will tell you 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.630
 need coal and glue which you 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.480
 will glue that is not glue as glue 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.760
 glue as prim I forgot that this is so 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.680
 my gosh guys this is clay 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.290
 naturally clay from which we will 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.150
 make yourself bricks let's go back 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.390
 when we will have the quantity we need 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.580
 bricks and so for the time being 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.380
 melted bricks I got 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.900
 Some resources with added one more 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.820
 the stove made the iron that we have today 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.400
 i will also need them a little 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.080
 forgotten but nonetheless I did it and 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.570
 now we will do 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.000
 blocks of which we will do more precisely 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.680
 build a coke oven to 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.920
 make these blocks we need 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.750
 bricks and a lot of those things i do a little 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.360
 more than you need but nothing terrible and 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.340
 workbench now we post the following 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.800
 the design is actually how to craft 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.380
 coke oven blocks we have two 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.700
 option the first option well it's simpler on 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.739
 my mind does not need much 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.370
 bother for him what we need 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.530
 we need 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.660
 the sand we take here is such a scheme 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.510
 we lay out from the list and from bricks 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.180
 Put the following scheme just such 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.040
 here is the scheme we get as avent brik we 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.160
 take as many as 16 blocks 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.810
 but we will need 26 of these blocks 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.400
 so let's make them a little more 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.350
 great we have a few left 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.530
 resources and now I will show you the second 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.530
 a way to craft these cock 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.570
 up and break or coke oven blocks 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.330
 second way next we will need 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.220
 all the years the same resources are sand 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.280
 bricks lay out the next 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.470
 we get a brick sand construction 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.260
 brick block so here it is called 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.970
 we need two such phone blocks 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.700
 something came to me from Moscow time 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.620
 Excellent 2 block do and now 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.989
 Put the following construction and 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.610
 there is no such construction at first 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.950
 we need to make bricks like this 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.800
 I'm sorry, I forgot these bricks and 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.750
 now lay out 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.400
 the next design and why are n't you 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.040
 work strange guys it should 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.590
 work apparently we need these now 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.170
 blocks of them already we can do that 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.690
 what we need, or rather, such 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.730
 block what brick we all got this 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.500
 block in two different ways we still 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.900
 one fruit is really needed what 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.600
 As for resources, they are absolutely 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.390
 equally costly both of these options but 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.540
 The first seems to me a little bit simpler and 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.770
 so got 26 of these blocks what of 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.400
 we should build them 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.230
 we have to build a huge 3 by 3 cube 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.660
 but hollow, that is, inside must 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.000
 stay one free space in 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.050
 Kraft or rather build it all 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.610
 in the following way 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.520
 be sure to remember this if you 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.650
 want to play with this mod in the middle 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.080
 there must be a hollow space 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.900
 sure so we almost built it 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.150
 left to put two one block and how 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.070
 see it we all changed and 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.560
 there were such strange 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.350
 holes if you poke it right 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.300
 click then see this 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.790
 scary place, even the menu itself 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.710
 saying what do we have here we have 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.330
 here is the first window in it we can 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.840
 lay either 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.740
 here are the boards and either coal and from coal we 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.800
 will receive 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.080
 if i'm not wrong coke coke it's almost 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.410
 the same as coal only he 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.990
 much much more gives the opportunity 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.630
 fry or melt something and 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.880
 also we will get kris kotova i butter 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.400
 I hope I said the creosote correctly 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.740
 and oils and so let's be strictly speaking 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.040
 you yourself will see all this now we are putting 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.650
 here is coal and as you can see the process 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.430
 the process started and the process started 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.419
 long 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.400
 he will go for two and a half minutes 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.230
 or three in my opinion something between 2 and so 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.419
 friends I came back and as you can see 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.700
 the result was not a coke claw 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.130
 killed food operation was two and a half 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.140
 minutes I clarified two and a half minutes 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.810
 in this stove will be forwarded 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.790
 regular golf coke and coal 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.710
 yes of course you can build right away 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.600
 several of these stoves and then your 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.330
 production will improve but let's 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.400
 take a look at the following what is the panel that 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.419
 we don't even have a panel here but just 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.660
 data window 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:22.790
 This is our panel creosote hoo fuel 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.660
 window the dirt of this fuel here we have 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:28.100
 It shows that we now have 500 of 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.350
 64000 now I will explain to you 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.910
 quack for your fuel we will recruit 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.740
 buckets just for that we needed 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.530
 make iron bars and then already 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.470
 make buckets and to collect one bucket 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.820
 Creosote Vova oil such fuel will 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.010
 call him so well most likely this 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.130
 it is exactly creosote oil to dial 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:48.229
 one bucket we will need one thousand one thousand 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.660
 Creosot Vova oil in this window 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:53.240
 so boldly throwing another coal 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.700
 and wait again for 2 and a half men 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.790
 so finally i got my 2 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:01.610
 coking coal and also filled with us 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:04.130
 here the dirt of this oil is exactly 1000 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:07.100
 now we put a bucket in this window and 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:09.290
 get a bucket of dirt new oil 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.950
 which we will need later on 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:14.660
 to create a roadbed 

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.940
 actually 1 series of this 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.780
 pilot release can be said 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.180
 tutorials 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.039
 a huge fashion railcraft fit 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.350
 end both because it was night 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:26.120
 so it's time to say goodbye to this 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.830
 actually all with you was bender 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.990
 subscribe to the channel support it 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.180
 Like video and then I understand what it costs 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.100
 keep making these videos on this 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.139
 actually all thanks to all and in 

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.970
 the next series in the next series we 

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:40.340
 learn how to make a roadbed and 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:42.289
 a lot of interesting things on it all 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.649
 Thank you for watching 

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:44.649
 until
