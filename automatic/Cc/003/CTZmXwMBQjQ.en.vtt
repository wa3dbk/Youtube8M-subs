00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.090
 Gunpla Kit Review of Mobile Suit Gundam Gundam Model Collection Deluxe 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.530
 Zock 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.430
 Gunpla Collection Deluxe is a gunpla for ladies and gentlemen released in 2007 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.390
 Is 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:20.230
 Package of Mobile Suit Gundam old kit released at the time of gun plastic boom 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:24.580
 The left half of 1 scale of 44 minutes guests in the proportions 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.110
 In other words, only the plastic model series reproduced in 2801/8 scale 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.610
 Love between parts has improved compared to the old kit 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:34.520
 Because it is selling that leaving the feature including the fault surely though it is 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.680
 Even won lads have not experienced the Gundam boom Sir 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.830
 I'm bad Plamo of you of just a can Eee 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.460
 Because it is a blind specification, I do not understand what the contents of the box naturally 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:49.110
 Speaking of the kit of the blind specification sd Gundam's Gundam x collection 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.940
 Us to satisfy the Kke it a little playful has been sold in the previous 100 yen for Nante 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:57.670
 Provoking production that are bought kit for you'll Anyway these mon glad everyone of your neighborhood 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.730
 I don't know what I would say if I was blessed 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.180
 It is correct act to buy in are you? Net 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.960
 Really Ne 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.960
 The lineup is larger than vol 1 vol 2 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.460
 Gunpla such as geong or zock is targeted and decide the box 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.950
 The size of the box is half the size of the original kit, and if you collect the box of the kit, the gunpla sales floor 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.460
 Because I can make a diorama 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.360
 That's what it means 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.470
 It is certainly I'm not so at least the young child 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.190
 Anplazara 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.570
 At least a 30-year-old man who can see and feel the art loaded 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.040
 It's only a modeler 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.210
 It is a 40-year-old overage who can drink alcohol after watching Gunpla line up 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.980
 I'm a modeler 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:44.490
 In other words, it is unusual for only heavy users in 34 to buy bangs for gunpla 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:48.950
 And effective spice to such old man it would be large bold decision of Bandai that what Te thought 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.950
 It is Ewa east time nostalgia 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.869
 The guy who bought Zac at the top is not living well The guy who bought at Ikebukuro is 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.580
 Again I love was a difficult thing to say that sunlight to make in 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.090
 It is important to choose a sales area, so I don't think so 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.950
 Wife N' 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.369
 This time I do not understand that what the house is saying 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:14.739
 The price of Zokku of Gundam collection version of tax 400 yen Dosue 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.090
 There is a feature in the size of the box, so 2 seems to be sure that it is contained in the feel of the hand 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.500
 I'm there 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.769
 The figure of a 40-over old man tinkering with toys seriously at the point of sale impresses you 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.940
 There is something there, but I think there will be no police station 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:31.090
 Maybe Chung much is or near miss 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:35.560
 Hey do not know aside recent byte-kun if shopkeeper builders Orekireki 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.660
 The result of the kit is the old kit street by the latest technology of Ulsan at that time 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.920
 I reproduce the proportions 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:46.629
 Originally Zock was a good kit with proportions in the old kit 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:51.080
 Even though there was a defect that the joints were poor, it was a name kit that people would know 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:55.520
 Well that there is not much attention for the popularity itself of Joch Chok itself 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:59.240
 It's because it was small, but there are a lot of Zock followers of the old kit quite 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.540
 Was Ne mistake Once There are Zokku's around the shop of Kamanchi Yoee 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.920
 That 's why this kit has shrunk in half 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:11.480
 Box to only surely the original volume is not odd even I parts of even series largest kit 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:16.310
 Especially the huge body parts that caught the eye even with the old kit are alive and well this time 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.400
 It feels like it's right here in Zock-I opened the box 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.390
 Oh yeah this is what 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:26.830
 What awakening memories of the era of gun plastic boom 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:30.040
 Furthermore , speaking of Gundam Zocks, it's a troubled part with insufficient volume. 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.880
 Thinning parts that are less round than in anime play 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:41.120
 It is an essential element in reproducing Zock's kit correctly . 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:44.900
 Even if you think about it, it's so easy for you to reproduce your hard work according to your settings . 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:49.010
 What is Mr. Zock's troubled perpetrator? 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:54.110
 For example the fluent sense of what Dosu essential elements do in order to reproduce the time 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.760
 The difference in the effect that so dare Bandai went open to remind at the time of the trauma I, et al. 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.560
 Hey you're not good 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.110
 This is true to the fact that the proportions of the old kit still work well enough 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.770
 Reproduce 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:08.450
 It is the right choice as a good point 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:13.610
 So it's a sinful way to make a polypate 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:16.160
 The nails of the rock are sloppy-the guy who says that I'm going to do pate pros can be shaped 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.489
 Konchikusho it says determined to 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:24.140
 The entire balance Come to a normal kit is usually 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.760
 The arms and legs do not work so much , but the joints are ball joints so I have a back fuck 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:30.530
 I'm glad I can 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.190
 There is unfortunately a point that fast but hey maintenance of the joint also being Chi Nde made of plastic does not work 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.220
 But 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.180
 It's a small scale kit, so please forgive me that much 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.969
 Old kit if you give already 200 yen 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.999
 It's not red 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:45.060
 So right this so subtle 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:48.030
 Exquisite price setting is a fan of the old model plastic old series 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.950
 Gunpla times Let's set up the people 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.160
 It must have been the evil of Mt. 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.160
 Perhaps
