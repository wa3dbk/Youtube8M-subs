00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.139
 Hi, how are youtube people talking to you? 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.480
 to all revolution 5 and good in this 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.540
 video I bring you a theme for winter 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.000
 pretty good board here can 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.100
 appreciate the icons as they are we see 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.670
 that in the status bar what we 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:34.030
 changes are the wifi and 3g signals 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.429
 the battery also changes and here they can 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.519
 see the icons you can see that the name 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:43.030
 of the icons disappears and has a 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:45.460
 quite different appearance and conserves 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.469
 the touch of ios that is what to me 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.829
 I like the topics I do not like so much that 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.809
 lose touch of what ios that 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.899
 You can see that there are several icons 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.660
 that change here gives us the day and the 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.810
 date 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.720
 and well the truth is pretty good 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.970
 I really liked this topic, we can also 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.010
 note that changes when we enter 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.720
 navigate for example in the menu 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.720
 adjustments let's see it 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.329
 change a little that is 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.869
 It's not much but if you notice the 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:25.700
 difference when we also enter 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.399
 an application we are going to enter a 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.219
 adjustment is there you can see what appears 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:34.039
 while entering then it is quite 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.289
 well then I hope you like it and 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.760
 let's proceed to the installation as 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:43.890
 we will always go to cydia 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.890
 and here we are going to wait for him to load 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.950
 for this we are going to have the option of 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:56.360
 buy the theme of the network that comes by 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.330
 defect in cydia or install it from a 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.000
 free way to test it and know if 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.200
 they like or do not like the name of the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.050
 theme is the following 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.710

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.110
 The only thing we are going to do is to address 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.750
 search for 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:36.340

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.500
 and well here I'm going to appear two 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.410
 options let's look first at the option

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.830
 if you want to install the theme what 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.760
 The only thing we are going to do is add a 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:25.170
 source let's go to drive 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.130

 edit and add and we will add the 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.910
 next network 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.910
 repo punto y zanelli 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.310
 dotcom and you are going to add 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.570

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.400

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.640
 that at the bottom of the page say instant the 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:01.950

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.950
 time we just installed we entered 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.470

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.090

 let's go back here here in this 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:56.869
 part will appear something that says 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.959
