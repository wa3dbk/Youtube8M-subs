 1998 I found it in france and 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.000

 thomas edison 30 years it was back then 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.489
 30 were a race and were on vacation 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.300
 about my other 404 a very nice one 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.640
 perline that 70 and found him there in the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.480
 local newspaper called you and 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.480
 agreed 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.270
 car well viewed there a few months 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.550
 later on 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.229
 blackbird broke and a few 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.390
 months later I am with a friend of 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.670
 drove me back 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.670
 to pick up the car with an ambulance 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.830
 is a syrup and ds21 injection 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.010
 electrolyte 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.910
 it's a family break hey what for 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.970
 me it is an injection from the factory 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.440
 wilson an extra option so it's best 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.440
 very special there aren't that many of them 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.630
 I just got out a year later 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.320
 Perfection actually broke the motor 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.700
 and everything there replacing sirens 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.289
 but everything is all the lower 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.490
 everything above the stone taste for you 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:56.789
 was perfectly built together in one 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.420
 put notes again and then I have because the 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.729
 engine one 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.750
 was actually new when I got the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.410
 counter reset to zero 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.819
 so he now has wintry weather 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.819
 small it walked 8000 kilometers 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.690
 I have fourteen or so I have it 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.580
 purchased in Luxembourg from the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.550
 goodyear tire manufacturer 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.390
 it was a the test car former 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.940
 testing car 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.450
 the car is indeed original 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.210
 Dutch car 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.000
 it was purchased by tno and converted 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.130
 become a university in Delft 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.230
 they made a hole in the floor 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.210
 for a square meter in size 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.600
 directly behind my 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.270
 for seat here and they have two extra 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.360
 hydraulic suspension placed to 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.880
 with which to perform tire testing 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.320
 yes i have made some improvements 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:56.120
 because the 404 pull family or all 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.290
 range are right and the free 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.970
 unfavorable rear wheel rear axle production 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.800
 making you an insane high 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.760
 rPM 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.680
 so still runs away quickly if you are with 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.020
 Your family is France on the one hand 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.100
 that we don't do it now so I have one 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.860
 another prophet under built with one 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.959
 last name from behind as production 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.440
 similar to that of the river 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.480
 rings well for technology is the 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.140
 original him claws of a 404 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.519
 leadership pay everything about 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.610
 so in fact it is still common 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.830
 original much you only need it is one 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:41.019
 small adjustment to such as that from the 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.019
 factories scolded 1968 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.200
 a 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.049
 but
