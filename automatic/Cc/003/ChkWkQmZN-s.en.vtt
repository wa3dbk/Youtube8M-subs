00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
too hard 180 so when you want to learn

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.010 
too hard 180 so when you want to learn
your<00:00:32.070> double<00:00:32.309> pick<00:00:32.510> 280<00:00:33.510> you're<00:00:33.690> gonna<00:00:33.840> want

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
your double pick 280 you're gonna want

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.040 
your double pick 280 you're gonna want
to<00:00:34.050> find<00:00:34.320> like<00:00:34.830> a<00:00:34.920> super<00:00:35.400> super<00:00:36.239> low<00:00:36.540> round

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
to find like a super super low round

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.790 
to find like a super super low round
rail<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.680> sports<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> street<00:00:38.340> rail

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
rail and sports the street rail

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.160 
rail and sports the street rail
so<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.860> find<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.580> a<00:00:41.640> round<00:00:42.000> rail<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.900> sort

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
so I find on a round rail you can sort

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.990 
so I find on a round rail you can sort
of<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.220> double<00:00:44.460> peg<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.879> can

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
of get in the double peg and you can

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.340 
of get in the double peg and you can
lean<00:00:45.180> your<00:00:45.330> weight<00:00:45.360> over<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.930> little<00:00:46.140> bit<00:00:46.290> more

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
lean your weight over a little bit more

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.530 
lean your weight over a little bit more
so<00:00:46.680> you're<00:00:46.800> more<00:00:46.920> locked<00:00:47.220> into<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.699> grind<00:00:47.940> so

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
so you're more locked into the grind so

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.210 
so you're more locked into the grind so
when<00:00:48.690> you're<00:00:48.809> gonna<00:00:49.110> want<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.769> to<00:00:50.129> the

resistance<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:06.870> you're<00:01:07.020> not<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.590> not

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
resistance like you're not just it's not

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.380 
resistance like you're not just it's not
natural<00:01:08.220> doesn't<00:01:08.370> feel<00:01:08.610> quite<00:01:08.760> as<00:01:08.850> natural<00:01:09.090> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390

just
recipe<00:01:58.150> history

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.289 

just<00:02:01.229> got<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.649> what<00:02:01.979> did<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.130> say<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.399> trust

just got it what did you say you trust
your<00:02:03.539> buyers<00:02:03.920> rescue<00:02:04.920> buzz<00:02:06.649> yeah<00:02:07.649> it's<00:02:08.099> sort

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
your buyers rescue buzz yeah it's sort

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.949 
your buyers rescue buzz yeah it's sort
of<00:02:08.310> almost<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.789> thrust<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.750> was<00:02:09.869> a

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
of almost like a thrust it was a

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:18.320 
of almost like a thrust it was a
thrusting<00:02:10.470> motion<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.890> guess<00:02:17.030> common<00:02:18.030> mistake

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
thrusting motion I guess common mistake

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.490 
thrusting motion I guess common mistake
when<00:02:18.480> you're<00:02:18.599> trying<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.810> do<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> hard<00:02:19.140> 180<00:02:19.410> a

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
when you're trying to do a hard 180 a

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.250 
when you're trying to do a hard 180 a
full<00:02:19.709> edge<00:02:19.800> is<00:02:20.190> trying<00:02:20.940> too<00:02:21.239> hard<00:02:21.269> almost<00:02:21.840> like

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
full edge is trying too hard almost like

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.500 
full edge is trying too hard almost like
if<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.650> just<00:02:23.489> get<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:23.940> end<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.450> just

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
if you just get to the end and you just

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.620 
if you just get to the end and you just
say<00:02:24.810> guy<00:02:25.200> I'm<00:02:25.620> going<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.280> right<00:02:26.910> just<00:02:27.330> yank

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
say guy I'm going like right just yank

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.540 
say guy I'm going like right just yank
the<00:02:27.870> 180<00:02:28.200> then<00:02:28.500> it's<00:02:28.680> it's<00:02:28.980> not<00:02:29.190> gonna<00:02:29.340> work

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
the 180 then it's it's not gonna work

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.100 
the 180 then it's it's not gonna work
like<00:02:29.610> it's<00:02:29.970> gonna<00:02:30.150> your<00:02:30.420> bigs<00:02:30.599> gonna<00:02:30.780> slide

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
work out I see this coming ahead of

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.390 
work out I see this coming ahead of
naturally<00:02:35.480> CT<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:37.019> yeah<00:02:37.500> just<00:02:37.650> slide<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.310> off

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
you can sort of physics you know it's

00:02:41.430 --> 00:03:13.380 
you can sort of physics you know it's
gonna<00:02:41.610> work
