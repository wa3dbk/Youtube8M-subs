 we are extremely complex construction 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.230
 passed from the classic hidden hayter 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.369

 minimum reality 6 was born in a manner 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.580
 quite random 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.530
 or after the first two episodes in which 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:46.630

 prove if there are first things 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.040
 which I thought and from there I started 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.869
 to express immediately in the 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.850
 opinions support and shakes and I have to say 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.960
 that the thing was beautiful because 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.439
 people really took me 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.420
 communities are not yet strangers to 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.799
 quarters of this smoothie and then there 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.799

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.250

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.880
 of the other fantastic roads now 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.190
 always tends to give a space anyway 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.370
 a little bit everyone and from there the idea of ​​was born 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.550
 put the small pieces of me like 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.140

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.290

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.649
 from this project and then I lived it 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.260
 close to them but plotting their shoulders 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.930
