00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.230
 HallÃ¶chen friends I am told mtv 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.270
 place and I get a little 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.980
 tutorial javi varas 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.919
 I am alone I am just eating 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.359
 so if he's any rhine 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.359
 is walking ltd 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.809
 and now comes over here and we 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:49.750
 make our states text as well as this 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.909
 Pictures and storage are the same as the 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:01:12.280
 Undercity again that's easy 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:01:14.549
 and is like created text or the 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.549
 week 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.119
 because it has an inscription 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:38.710
 I did not even say that 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:41.060
 fans then you have to put bonner 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.060
 and then you need the plug-in 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.980
 woman they will provide one video 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.720
 not bad luck I have shown only 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:53.000
 a text-state I'll get it this 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:55.760
 She did not want to see it will not 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.820
 more involved so I can there yes 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.010
 can you you any number of 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.070
 20 that will make the text of course natural 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.170
 25 years so break that still takes a while 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.440
 a bit because now it's just decomposing 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.440
 Soccer 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:16.690
 40% percent finished 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.490
 so 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.590
 and who did it now if now 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.790
 I'll show you this one now 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.920
 want to have stuff then you have to 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.730
 last select other colors the 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.800
 to be created 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:42.310
 please no you then have to for your 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:44.670
 color then again this time and then 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.560
 if now the second color here is this 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.170
 outer layer and sees the penultimate and 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:56.650
 but you have to choose yourself just like that 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:03:06.430
 gray black and then let's start 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:13.510
 then you have to start if now 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:17.040
 would would the floor must Labbadia 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.040
 that's what simulation is all about 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.650
 and then 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.870
 now comes the part where it explodes 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.980
 so if I play for example 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.739
 It would be a bit like this 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.970
 a little bit because I come from there 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.090
 Records come that was the same 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:42.130
 determine 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:44.489
 then you have to have a catholic object 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.489
 put 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:55.550
 and then you do it a bit 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:58.650
 be smaller 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.800
 then you just do it your letter 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.800
 purely 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:13.800
 and it would have to be done by everyone 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.800
 have to earn eight 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.720
 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:28.000
 Now we do a little bit 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.930
 you should not hide afterwards 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.930
 really see it that way 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:42.319
 so we have to do it now with everyone 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.279
 can not I take forever time 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.080
 just do that a bit 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:05:00.979
 messy so forgive me if I am 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:05:03.139
 kinda go that way now 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.269
 you have finished with this 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:09.709
 whole objects also as widget badia 

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:12.589
 I think if I do that 

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:14.149
 for years scrap like that and now if 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:16.969
 now in the frame would go on, well 

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:19.269
 if first frame continues then eleven 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:21.559
 this somehow starts to explode 

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:26.749
 So do not really explode and then 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:30.769
 if you have a screenshot maybe and 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:33.339
 then then only then really is there 

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:35.929
 it could only change it 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:38.929
 example how destroyed so ok you can 

00:05:35.929 --> 00:05:39.319
 Do not do it now but understand what I mean 

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:44.749
 my 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:46.579
 it may be the cool if you recognize 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:48.519
 to recognize this ball came then must 

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:55.719
 you move her a bit 

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:58.039
 not really more, but you 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:59.419
 can be yes but there you have to 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:06.919
 everything back , so you are 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:08.829
 Just click or we want as 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.419
 make screenshot and you have yours 

00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:13.789
 means picture can also change the color 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:18.619
 change if you want 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:21.199
 the newcomer also stands or like you 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:24.559
 want is your imagination free 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:26.930
 presented again position 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:31.880
 I 'll do it for a minute 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:40.009
 global illumination on so that times and 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:41.030
 we'll see each other and there we are again 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:42.440
 I forgot to make light 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:46.330
 otherwise you can not set ten 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:49.610
 locations and that's how it looks like 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.919
 can also background better where not 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.960
 Lowering any matter is for a test or 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:56.690
 can you set it up on soft 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:00.199
 and then let 's do it that's it 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:02.590
 actually even you've got yet 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:02.590
 what to say 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.270
 explodes 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:20.410
 although we film everything if the walters 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:28.060
 so if you want to do that then 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:32.710
 just subscribe 25 why he 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:34.830
 so much fun and beautiful life i am 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.830
 Naturally
