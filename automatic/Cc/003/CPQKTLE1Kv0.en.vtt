00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
the gate basically the game looks like

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.260 
the gate basically the game looks like
okay<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:14.310> I'm<00:03:14.430> gonna<00:03:14.490> let<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.760> get<00:03:15.030> all<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
gonna get to finish the game that was

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:30.710 
gonna get to finish the game that was
basically<00:03:20.630> how<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.660> went<00:03:22.020> down

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.460 

I<00:03:32.060> think<00:03:33.060> sonic<00:03:33.360> 1<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.660> good<00:03:33.900> game<00:03:34.050> it's<00:03:34.290> just

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
I think sonic 1 is a good game it's just

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.430 
I think sonic 1 is a good game it's just
a<00:03:34.590> victim<00:03:34.770> looks<00:03:35.130> like<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.870> worst<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.320> the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
a victim looks like the worst of the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.520 
a victim looks like the worst of the
lately<00:03:37.770> farrier<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.420> other<00:03:39.570> two<00:03:39.900> on<00:03:40.200> the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
lately farrier to the other two on the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.240 
lately farrier to the other two on the
same<00:03:40.710> console<00:03:43.190> mm-hmm<00:03:45.500> but<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.530> think<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:46.980> same

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
same console mm-hmm but I think the same

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.960 
same console mm-hmm but I think the same
is<00:03:47.280> true<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.670> Super<00:03:48.180> Mario<00:03:48.210> Brothers<00:03:49.970> well
