00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.740
 yo everyone i hope you go 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.769
 well it's israel find themselves for a 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.000
 new video guide on the internet 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.430
 today we will talk about hours 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.859
 grilling on weapons since one can 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.730
 improve weapons 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.739
 so then so I'm going to take a 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.120
 weapon not to improve if I have one 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.960
 normally I only took a hockey that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:48.050
 I'm going to see it right away at aulas 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.050
 she is here she is there very well 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.910
 these one will put it there and I will 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.150
 to start 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.170
 so when you find a weapon she 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.690
 is like these, that is, she 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.610
 is empty 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.630
 yahia ya nothing over no glasses not 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.090
 of no silencer no two grids 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.880
 of flu for it to move - and 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.130
 it's in sight and well it's simple 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.910
 we'll be able to improve that I put 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.229
 three glasses three different souls 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.110
 Men are different 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.820
 this one point we will take this as 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.960
 that I show you then you go 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.970
 can find some improvements 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.500
 everywhere you have to know that some more 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.630
 rare than others like for example the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.580
 bayonet that is extremely rare that 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.450
 I showed you right after on on my 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.039
 main mill then to power 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.780
 ask an improvement of what you 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.740
 must surely have found that 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.869
 You do not know how 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.320
 just once you have tears 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.539
 in the hands to support safety when 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.160
 you press on sailboats hop on 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.770
 here the improvements that appear 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.380
 that's what I took pains 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.030
 who was on the ground age is not 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.670
 of improvement in the bag like that does not 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.140
 not show up so all the shits 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.659
 any forgiveness improvements that you 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.860
 will have in the bag will show up as 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.019
 these weary the different glasses 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.480
 the three glasses that I have so we go 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.709
 to choose one for example the psychological zoom 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.010
 times see that up 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.329
 I changed glasses just 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.829
 remember safety and choose our 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.010
 glasses 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:23.870
 and so it's up to you to see 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.420
 according to what you find according to that 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.600
 what you like me for example I read 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.190
 m 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.880
 this one i'll show you to 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:39.630
 different weapons 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.630
 the age and hood field with the zoom to 7 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.390
 what do I have on it what does 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.810
 I have two subjects a suppressor so 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.560
 I have a muffler and I have a grip for 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.690
 that when I say see life there the 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.270
 bezel does not move so I'm not 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.830
 shaking and so that's it 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.130
 it's pretty nice the silent is 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.420
 pretty cool too since like you 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.430
 are in town and you shoot at 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.840
 zombies and well the others makes you 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.110
 less noise a simply that 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.100
 silent and bouna fat not the others 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.090
 the other zombies 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.070
 I do not know if it's French 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.850
 finally short then we'll see now 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.770
 the bayonet on my main weapon 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.580
 then the bayonet is against 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.420
 the place of the grip 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.950
 here I see I do not have any 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.200
 silent I can remove it on the other 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.650
 I think a good question that are going 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.150
 remove blues so do not know the 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.880
 bayonet how to use it once 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.040
 that you have placed it since since 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.390
 since we do not know how to explain it 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.700
 just press f like this so 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.250
 more weapons gendarmes bedrooms 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.040
 sincerely I have not tested so I 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.400
 can not really tell you 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.409
 if it hurts like katana 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.750
 or an ax or whatever else 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.390
 weapon in melee but it's rather 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.439
 interesting example here is when you 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.370
 pull you see you no longer have 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:03.870
 down to have the bayonet for to kill 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.200
 the zombies who follow us 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.209
 here is different ave gred as 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.540
 as we have seen it is silent 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:15.030
 here the bayonet and the seated grip that 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.259
 there we will have silencers and it is in 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.470
