00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
cutscene I showed this on my my blog a

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.670 
cutscene I showed this on my my blog a
few<00:00:17.190> days<00:00:17.340> ago<00:00:17.869> running<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.140> editor<00:00:19.439> but

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
few days ago running in the editor but

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.740 
few days ago running in the editor but
this<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.160> running<00:00:20.580> on<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.939> actual<00:00:21.539> iphone

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
this is it running on the actual iphone

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.679 
this is it running on the actual iphone
so<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.380> see<00:00:22.560> there's<00:00:22.740> particles<00:00:23.539> for<00:00:24.539> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
so you can see there's particles for the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.670 
so you can see there's particles for the
the<00:00:25.019> Jets<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.590> Jetpack<00:00:26.039> snake<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:28.230> those<00:00:28.410> work

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the Jets on Jetpack snake so those work

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.470 
the Jets on Jetpack snake so those work
it's<00:00:28.949> got<00:00:29.130> quite<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> lot<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.849> particles<00:00:30.330> on

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
it's got quite a lot of particles on

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.010 
it's got quite a lot of particles on
screen<00:00:30.779> at<00:00:30.900> once<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:32.329> they<00:00:33.329> stay<00:00:33.660> down<00:00:33.840> there

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
screen at once and they stay down there

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.389 
screen at once and they stay down there
for<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.230> minute<00:00:34.380> because<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.860> actually<00:00:34.980> being

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
for a minute because it's actually being

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.360 
for a minute because it's actually being
simulated<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> space<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.989> if<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.370> when

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
simulated in the space so if you when

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.100 
simulated in the space so if you when
they<00:00:38.489> move<00:00:38.520> they<00:00:39.030> actually<00:00:39.420> elongate<00:00:40.079> and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
they move they actually elongate and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.860 
they move they actually elongate and
stay<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.649> position<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.760> period<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.270> time<00:00:42.480> so

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
stay in position for a period of time so

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.750 
stay in position for a period of time so
that's<00:00:43.530> good<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.010> works<00:00:44.250> i<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.640> have

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
that's good that that works i can have

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.750 
that's good that that works i can have
nice<00:00:45.570> particle<00:00:46.110> effects<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.430> spells

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
nice particle effects and the the spells

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.229 
nice particle effects and the the spells
and<00:00:48.140> environment<00:00:49.140> stuff<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:50.940> another<00:00:51.120> thing

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
and environment stuff so another thing

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.930 
and environment stuff so another thing
here<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:53.070> beginnings<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.640> battle

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
here is a the beginnings of a battle

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.970 
here is a the beginnings of a battle
system<00:00:55.280> so<00:00:56.280> here<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.530> pretty<00:00:58.530> much<00:00:58.710> what

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
system so here is the pretty much what

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.459 
system so here is the pretty much what
the<00:00:59.100> battle<00:00:59.370> system<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.789> going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.210> look<00:01:00.390> like

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
the battle system is going to look like

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.410 
the battle system is going to look like
when<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.620> get<00:01:01.800> into<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.190> battle<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:03.180> will<00:01:03.300> have

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
when you get into a battle it will have

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.950 
when you get into a battle it will have
an<00:01:03.570> initial<00:01:03.780> camera<00:01:05.450> angle<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.630> then<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.869> will

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
an initial camera angle and then it will

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.830 
an initial camera angle and then it will
start<00:01:07.200> switching<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.890> random<00:01:08.450> camera<00:01:09.450> angles

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
start switching to random camera angles

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.630 
start switching to random camera angles
as<00:01:10.110> long<00:01:10.260> as<00:01:10.409> there's<00:01:10.560> no<00:01:10.710> action<00:01:11.130> being<00:01:11.340> done

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
as long as there's no action being done

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.910 
as long as there's no action being done

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
you can see there's two jetpack snakes

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.120 
you can see there's two jetpack snakes
right<00:01:14.280> now<00:01:14.460> very<00:01:14.760> imposing<00:01:15.409> it's<00:01:16.409> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> be

right now very imposing it's going to be

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.280 
right now very imposing it's going to be
a<00:01:17.159> real<00:01:17.520> time<00:01:17.850> battle<00:01:18.299> system<00:01:18.630> right<00:01:18.780> now<00:01:18.960> so

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
a real time battle system right now so

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.770 
a real time battle system right now so
these<00:01:19.500> bars<00:01:19.979> right<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:20.909> there's<00:01:21.210> one<00:01:21.299> there

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
these bars right here there's one there

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.960 
these bars right here there's one there
one<00:01:22.380> at<00:01:22.560> about<00:01:22.799> fifty<00:01:23.070> percent<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.759> thirty

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
percent once those reach all the way to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.670 
percent once those reach all the way to
the<00:01:26.549> bottom<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.330> background<00:01:27.840> behind<00:01:28.229> the

up<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.990> hitting<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.130> tap<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.670> screen

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
up and hitting if you tap on the screen

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.459 
up and hitting if you tap on the screen
at<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.240> certain<00:02:03.450> time<00:02:03.719> you'll<00:02:03.960> do<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> bit<00:02:04.439> more

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
at a certain time you'll do a bit more

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.520 
at a certain time you'll do a bit more
damage<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.310> same<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:05.880> defending<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.930> I'm

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
damage and same for defending and I'm

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.309 
damage and same for defending and I'm
not<00:02:07.680> sure<00:02:07.710> about<00:02:07.890> magic<00:02:08.550> yet<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.959> far<00:02:10.170> it's

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
not sure about magic yet but so far it's

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.880 
not sure about magic yet but so far it's
guaranteed<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.250> attack<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.940> defense

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
guaranteed for attack and defense

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.770 
guaranteed for attack and defense
so<00:02:13.890> that's<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.310> also<00:02:14.580> put<00:02:14.879> in<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.239> way<00:02:15.720> to

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
so that's that I also put in a way to

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.009 
so that's that I also put in a way to
randomize<00:02:16.500> which<00:02:16.980> enemies<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:18.000> get<00:02:18.209> so

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
randomize which enemies that you get so

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.199 
randomize which enemies that you get so
if<00:02:19.080> we<00:02:19.200> go<00:02:19.319> back<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.739> menu<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.640> then

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
if we go back to the menu here and then

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.970 
if we go back to the menu here and then
do<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.019> again<00:02:22.319> we<00:02:22.470> might<00:02:22.650> get<00:02:22.769> a<00:02:22.830> different

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
do this again we might get a different

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.820 
do this again we might get a different
set<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.459> enemies<00:02:23.790> no<00:02:24.569> that's<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.959> same<00:02:25.200> it's

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
set of enemies no that's the same it's

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.130 
set of enemies no that's the same it's
random<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.549> never<00:02:26.640> know<00:02:26.879> let's<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:27.989> try

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
random so you never know let's just try

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.350 
random so you never know let's just try
this<00:02:28.200> one<00:02:28.440> more<00:02:28.470> time<00:02:28.620> see<00:02:29.129> what<00:02:29.159> we<00:02:29.310> get<00:02:29.489> okay

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
this one more time see what we get okay

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.539 
this one more time see what we get okay
so<00:02:30.420> yeah<00:02:30.780> now<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.049> get<00:02:31.260> your<00:02:31.799> up<00:02:31.920> against<00:02:32.310> five

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
so yeah now you get your up against five

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.039 
so yeah now you get your up against five
these<00:02:33.000> dog<00:02:33.329> things<00:02:34.190> i<00:02:35.540> only<00:02:36.540> have<00:02:36.720> it's<00:02:36.870> that

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
these dog things i only have it's that

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.600 
these dog things i only have it's that
there's<00:02:37.230> three<00:02:37.530> different<00:02:37.650> sets<00:02:38.129> of<00:02:38.250> enemies

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
there's three different sets of enemies

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.619 
there's three different sets of enemies
right<00:02:38.819> now<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.890> once<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:41.579> goes<00:02:42.000> full-scale

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
right now but once this goes full-scale

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.690 
right now but once this goes full-scale
basically<00:02:43.170> i<00:02:43.200> can<00:02:43.440> make<00:02:43.620> any<00:02:43.860> combination<00:02:44.610> of

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
basically i can make any combination of

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.130 
basically i can make any combination of
enemies<00:02:45.590> as<00:02:46.590> this<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:48.140> change

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
enemies as this and you can change

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.680 
enemies as this and you can change
around<00:02:49.379> the<00:02:49.829> which<00:02:50.609> player<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.239> want<00:02:51.359> which

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
around the which player you want which

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.900 
around the which player you want which
position<00:02:52.260> i'm<00:02:53.099> not<00:02:53.280> sure<00:02:53.489> if<00:02:53.609> there's<00:02:53.760> going

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
position i'm not sure if there's going

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.380 
position i'm not sure if there's going
to<00:02:53.970> be<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.090> forward<00:02:54.660> in<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.870> back<00:02:55.049> yet<00:02:55.349> but

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
to be a forward in the back yet but

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.630 
to be a forward in the back yet but
that's<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.599> way<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:57.870> now<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:59.040> still<00:02:59.489> haven't

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
that's the way it is now I still haven't

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.180 
that's the way it is now I still haven't
put<00:02:59.940> in<00:03:00.030> any<00:03:00.239> actual<00:03:00.659> gamey<00:03:01.079> stuff<00:03:01.530> yet<00:03:01.829> for

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
put in any actual gamey stuff yet for

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.770 
put in any actual gamey stuff yet for
the<00:03:02.340> other<00:03:02.519> battle<00:03:02.790> system<00:03:03.120> I've<00:03:03.269> just<00:03:03.480> got<00:03:03.629> it

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
the other battle system I've just got it

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.199 
the other battle system I've just got it
set<00:03:04.049> up<00:03:04.200> for<00:03:04.609> everything<00:03:05.609> in<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.790> beginning

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
set up for everything in the beginning

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.880 
set up for everything in the beginning
of<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.359> battle<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:06.989> all<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.230> these<00:03:07.530> enemies

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
of the battle so all of these enemies

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.830 
of the battle so all of these enemies
spawn<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.670> their<00:03:08.790> correct<00:03:09.060> positions<00:03:09.599> I'll

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
spawn in their correct positions I'll

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.059 
spawn in their correct positions I'll
the<00:03:09.930> players<00:03:10.230> spawn<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.739> their<00:03:10.859> correct

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
the players spawn in their correct

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.069 
the players spawn in their correct
positions<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:11.970> now<00:03:12.569> i'm<00:03:12.690> going<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.870> start

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
positions and now i'm going to start

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.979 
positions and now i'm going to start
moving<00:03:13.230> into<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.709> more<00:03:13.859> complicated<00:03:14.989> menus

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
moving into the more complicated menus

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.830 
moving into the more complicated menus
and<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.950> actual<00:03:17.220> battle<00:03:17.669> mechanics<00:03:17.790> but<00:03:18.540> so

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
and the actual battle mechanics but so

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.659 
and the actual battle mechanics but so
far<00:03:19.019> everything's<00:03:19.530> working<00:03:20.010> exactly<00:03:20.280> how<00:03:20.639> I

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
far everything's working exactly how I

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:24.890 
far everything's working exactly how I
wanted<00:03:21.139> the<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.470> frame<00:03:22.739> rate<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.549> bit<00:03:24.510> slow

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
wanted the the frame rate is a bit slow

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.640 
wanted the the frame rate is a bit slow
on<00:03:25.349> older<00:03:26.250> models<00:03:26.280> this<00:03:27.209> is<00:03:27.359> on<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.690> 3gs<00:03:28.290> and

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
on older models this is on the 3gs and

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.339 
on older models this is on the 3gs and
it's<00:03:28.829> it's<00:03:29.790> definitely<00:03:30.269> playable<00:03:30.720> bond<00:03:30.959> older

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
it's it's definitely playable bond older

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.990 
it's it's definitely playable bond older
ones<00:03:31.560> I'm<00:03:31.859> definitely<00:03:32.099> definitely<00:03:32.519> gonna

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
ones I'm definitely definitely gonna

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.970 
ones I'm definitely definitely gonna
have<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.209> optimize<00:03:34.109> a<00:03:34.260> lot<00:03:35.419> so<00:03:36.419> let's<00:03:36.629> go<00:03:36.780> into

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
have to optimize a lot so let's go into

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.879 
have to optimize a lot so let's go into
the<00:03:37.980> game<00:03:38.160> proper<00:03:39.440> like<00:03:40.440> you've<00:03:40.590> all<00:03:40.709> seen

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
the game proper like you've all seen

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.920 
the game proper like you've all seen
this<00:03:41.040> before<00:03:41.250> but<00:03:41.699> now<00:03:41.879> i<00:03:41.910> put<00:03:42.239> in<00:03:42.389> a<00:03:42.599> step

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
this before but now i put in a step

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.610 
this before but now i put in a step
counter<00:03:43.349> so<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.739> boom<00:03:44.459> right<00:03:44.730> there<00:03:45.470> if<00:03:46.470> this

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
counter so that boom right there if this

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.470 
counter so that boom right there if this
were<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.829> real<00:03:47.069> game<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.609> get<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:48.060> pretty

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
were the real game you get the pretty

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.599 
were the real game you get the pretty
much<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.690> screen<00:03:49.079> would<00:03:49.290> stop<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.949> i<00:03:50.190> do<00:03:50.250> some

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
much a screen would stop and i do some

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.369 
much a screen would stop and i do some
sort<00:03:50.849> of<00:03:50.940> effect<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.629> then<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:51.930> go<00:03:52.109> into<00:03:52.349> a

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
sort of effect and then you go into a

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.439

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
it just took me a while to try and

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.430 
it just took me a while to try and
figure<00:04:20.760> out<00:04:20.909> how<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.209> do<00:04:21.479> this<00:04:21.659> so<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.019> little

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
figure out how to do this so that little

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.860 
figure out how to do this so that little
white<00:04:23.280> thing<00:04:23.610> down<00:04:23.849> there<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.450> camera<00:04:24.840> is

white thing down there the camera is

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.510 
white thing down there the camera is
actually<00:04:25.169> locked<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:26.190> that

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
actually locked to that

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.850 
actually locked to that
and<00:04:26.910> not<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.419> player<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:28.020> I<00:04:28.440> have<00:04:28.650> that

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
and not to the player and I have that

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.400 
and not to the player and I have that
little<00:04:29.129> capsule<00:04:29.940> they're<00:04:30.150> locked<00:04:31.139> to<00:04:31.379> the

little capsule they're locked to the

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.320 
little capsule they're locked to the
player<00:04:31.830> so<00:04:32.280> that's<00:04:32.460> my<00:04:32.669> kind<00:04:32.910> of<00:04:32.970> work<00:04:33.120> around

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
player so that's my kind of work around

player so that's my kind of work around
to<00:04:33.780> get<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.080> follow<00:04:35.009> camera<00:04:35.490> working

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
to get the follow camera working

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.689

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
correctly and here's another thing that

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.770 
correctly and here's another thing that
I<00:04:38.729> put<00:04:39.030> in<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:39.840> this<00:04:40.289> is<00:04:40.319> an<00:04:40.680> iphone<00:04:41.780> so

will<00:06:12.300> pay<00:06:12.479> off<00:06:12.659> in<00:06:12.960> the<00:06:13.020> other<00:06:13.259> near<00:06:13.560> future<00:06:13.819> so

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819 
will pay off in the other near future so

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.180 
will pay off in the other near future so
once<00:06:15.150> i<00:06:15.300> finish<00:06:15.599> my<00:06:15.630> first<00:06:15.990> game<00:06:16.229> and<00:06:16.529> I<00:06:16.740> dive

once i finish my first game and I dive
headfirst<00:06:17.460> into<00:06:18.000> this<00:06:18.210> it<00:06:18.479> should<00:06:18.630> turn<00:06:18.810> out

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
headfirst into this it should turn out

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.499 
headfirst into this it should turn out
into<00:06:19.259> something<00:06:19.860> pretty<00:06:20.069> special<00:06:20.360> so<00:06:21.360> I<00:06:21.389> think

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
into something pretty special so I think
