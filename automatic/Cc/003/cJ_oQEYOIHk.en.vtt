00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 we are here in a construction 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.600
 timber frame houses so of a 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.780
 area of ​​about 100 square meters 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.800
 bbc so exclusively bbc the advantage of 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.080
 this construction these cases were 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.540
 assembled is mounted in the space of two 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.609
 days these are panels that arrives 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.060
 up to 13 m long 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.590
 maximum length including 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.779
 exterior sealing 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.060
 is on the run and internal laying of 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.650
 joinery so the two levels 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.849
 since we are in r + 1 have been 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.270
 assembled within two days 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.550
 with roof terraces we opted 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.050
 for heating for the wound with a 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.489
 thermodynamic balloon and a profit of 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.930
 boxing the goal being to gain time at 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.329
 level of the house saturates wood at 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.620
 level of heating assemblies and 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.329
 sanitary 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.340
 so today we can say that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.629
 we will be bbc and we can go 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.820
 faster than some builders 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.710
 this is our first saturated house 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.090
 wood so we have more of the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.039
 do it for ourselves because it's a 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.170
 witness flag we propose it 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.969
 actually to the child of our future 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.040
 customer a benefit to the customer a 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.750
 house of this type can be delivered to 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.939
 from the moment of starting the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.310
 construction site until the delivery of the keys 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.930
 three to four months 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.520
 today houses of this type at a 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.650
 very good insulation more than 25 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.220
 centimeters at the thickness level of the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.570
 walls we will win between 40 and 50% 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.270
 heating at the electricity level 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.650
 also by putting to call it we have 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.750
 any 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.430
 we have no loss at the level of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.200
 heating since it is not at all 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.620
 electric souad be gas 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.690
 so it's a clean energy we 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.400
 We will also be able to propose 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.560
 heaters by type of gas by compass 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.090
 heat to respect so the new 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.990
 thermal regulation that arrives at 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.340
 Next January 1st 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.350
 or be compliant have neglected 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.530
 actually benefit from our 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.580
 range today is that we propose 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.310
 in the range sees houses 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.900
 typically contemporary we do not do 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.850
 rustic or traditional is 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.880
 that from the roof terraces with 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.020
 geometric shapes a bit peculiar 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.970
 we are able to respond to any 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.990
 request but the goal being to make 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.510
 something they come out a little bit of 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.000
 the ordinary as you will see 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.040
 on some photos or videos you can 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.570
 to make the wooden frame house with 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.480
 roof terrace with some shapes 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.580
 different who are a different type of 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.740
 the area and that really make it to 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.450
 very very nice things to finish 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.500
 so the goal actually is to 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.390
 ability to respond to a customer 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.400
 today a little more demanding a little 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.320
 younger first-time buyers of 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.780
 enter their budget propose them 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.300
 different choices in heating 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.500
 but also nothing is static to be 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.080
 a little different from the others 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.180
 we can also offer them 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.800
 options for roof terraces 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.540
 we can also offer them 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.310
 expansion options be 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.410
 really at the most of their budget 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.510
 they this type of constructions meet 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.760
 perfectly to the new standards so 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.650
 we are ecological we are 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.470
 through the charges that will be 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.090
 very very low it's also houses 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.070
 that have been reflected at the level of 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.780
 provisions of the parts that will allow 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.610
 of high brightness so he will answer 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.220
 to the needs of a customer to their comfort 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.690
 and we will be able to meet a 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.670
 really a lot of criteria that 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.790
 will be able to satisfy and please the future 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.790
 customers
