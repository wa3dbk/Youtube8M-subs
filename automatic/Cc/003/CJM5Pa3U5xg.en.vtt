00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.880 

I've<00:01:12.960> always<00:01:13.140> been<00:01:13.350> inspired<00:01:13.590> by

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
I've always been inspired by

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.980 
I've always been inspired by
choreography<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.090> everything<00:01:15.840> that's

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
choreography and everything that's

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.540 
choreography and everything that's
involved<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.440> up<00:01:16.560> from<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.800> set<00:01:17.010> design<00:01:17.340> to

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
involved in up from the set design to

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.640 
involved in up from the set design to
the<00:01:17.580> costume<00:01:18.150> Siobhan<00:01:18.960> came<00:01:19.230> to<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> studio

the costume Siobhan came to the studio
here<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.370> propose<00:01:20.760> that<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.060> worked<00:01:21.270> together

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
here and propose that we worked together

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.510 
here and propose that we worked together
on<00:01:21.660> the<00:01:21.810> project<00:01:22.260> it<00:01:22.980> was<00:01:23.070> really<00:01:23.310> challenging

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
on the project it was really challenging

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.610 
on the project it was really challenging
I<00:01:24.060> mean<00:01:24.390> I'm<00:01:24.510> not<00:01:24.660> an<00:01:24.750> artist<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.320> designer

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
I mean I'm not an artist the designer

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.260 
I mean I'm not an artist the designer
looks<00:01:25.950> at<00:01:26.130> something<00:01:26.310> from<00:01:26.550> a<00:01:26.670> creative<00:01:26.880> point

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.540 
looks at something from a creative point
of<00:01:27.390> view<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.230> translates<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.340> plat

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
of view and then translates it in a plat

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.040 
of view and then translates it in a plat
for<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> because<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.360> have<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.690> have<00:01:30.840> been

challenging<00:02:03.810> thing<00:02:04.020> was<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.409> enzymes<00:02:04.920> you

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
challenging thing was that enzymes you

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.980 
challenging thing was that enzymes you
know<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.700> most<00:02:05.880> important<00:02:06.390> thing<00:02:06.600> as<00:02:06.810> the

movements<00:02:09.780> symbolize<00:02:10.649> different<00:02:11.400> veins<00:02:11.900> so

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
movements symbolize different veins so

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.690
