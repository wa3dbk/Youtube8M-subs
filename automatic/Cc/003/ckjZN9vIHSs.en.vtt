00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
off this energy that everyone kind of

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.890 
off this energy that everyone kind of
feels<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:17.670> rubs<00:01:17.850> off<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.210> everyone<00:01:18.509> and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
feels it and it rubs off on everyone and

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.539 
feels it and it rubs off on everyone and
you<00:01:19.590> know<00:01:19.710> once<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.070> felt<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
you know once we felt that in the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.649 
you know once we felt that in the
beginning<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.820> game<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.150> kind<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.509> set

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
beginning the game it just kind of set

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.630 
beginning the game it just kind of set
the<00:01:21.689> tone<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.200> think<00:01:22.799> mostly<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.250> Louisville

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the tone I think mostly with Louisville

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.160 
the tone I think mostly with Louisville
is<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.939> their<00:01:24.090> aggressiveness<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.930> we

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
is just their aggressiveness and we

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.359 
is just their aggressiveness and we
wanted<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.439> make<00:01:25.590> sure<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.040> limited

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
wanted to make sure that we limited

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.950 
wanted to make sure that we limited
their<00:01:26.580> threes<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.150> seems<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> way

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
their threes that seems to be the way

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.390 
their threes that seems to be the way
they<00:01:27.990> get<00:01:28.259> back<00:01:28.439> into<00:01:28.619> games<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.100> they're<00:01:29.220> down

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
they get back into games if they're down

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.280 
they get back into games if they're down
and<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:30.630> wanted<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.869> make<00:01:30.990> sure<00:01:31.049> that

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
and we just wanted to make sure that

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.020 
and we just wanted to make sure that
happen<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.650> us<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.159> emphasis<00:01:32.549> was<00:01:32.579> rebounding

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
happen to us the emphasis was rebounding
