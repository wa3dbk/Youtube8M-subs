00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
really weird okay let's just fold it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.870 
really weird okay let's just fold it
back<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.390> how<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.570> was<00:01:50.060> ok<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:52.670> think<00:01:53.670> that's

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
back to how it was ok I think that's

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.990 
back to how it was ok I think that's
right<00:01:56.659> ok<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.719> once<00:01:58.560> you've<00:01:58.710> done<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.000> you've

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
right ok so once you've done that you've

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.859 
right ok so once you've done that you've
got<00:02:00.270> um<00:02:00.509> three<00:02:01.409> sides<00:02:01.710> which<00:02:02.070> are<00:02:02.280> all<00:02:02.490> open<00:02:02.869> so

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
got um three sides which are all open so

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.959 
got um three sides which are all open so
effectively<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> book<00:02:05.009> you're<00:02:05.729> going<00:02:05.909> to
