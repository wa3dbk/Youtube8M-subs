00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hello all beach figures Mr. bullshit 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.610
 in studies today it's all about again 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.849
 this theme and indeed the absolute 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:13.469
 versus relative risk very important 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.750
 maybe you have been in 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.090
 some rainbow press subject sheet 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.320
 been that three eggs a week 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.869
 in addition, it consumes a risk for 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.170
 heart attack diarrhea prostate cancer 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:33.360
 or what the devil knows at 33 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.130
 percent are increased and think 33 January 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.110
 of 100 men so have this 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.350
 diseases shit i should rather 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.149
 never eat eggs again why that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.040
 schwachsinn the now told you 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.200
 Just take two groups to say 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.059
 We have 100 people and make one 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.670
 study with them then you give the one 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.010
 Men or human are always three 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.680
 additional eggs per week and in others 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.059
 not all well and good 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.190
 then you compare the whole and after 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.199
 Ten or twenty years, you look something 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.000
 the result is and it's okay two 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.670
 Men had a heart attack in the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.740
 group without eggs 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.409
 that means they are two at least 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.979
 percent of people suffering a heart attack 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.710
 would have 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.420
 then put the whole in proportion and 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.220
 look okay with the others it was 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.380
 three out of a hundred crass, that's three percent 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.990
 of 100 had a heart attack oh my 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.229
 God how come now but from 3 to 33 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.270
 now that you are not the absolute but 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.549
 simply calculate the relative risk 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.079
 that means you put the 2 in 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:43.560
 relation to the 3 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:48.659
 that's 66 percent yes so 0.66 1 -0 66 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.450
 are 033 means you have 33 percent 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.130
 men at once instead of 3 and that is 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.899
 the nonsense is sold to us and 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.899
 is therefore perfect bullshit 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.310
 there are many advice and we assign 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.030
 but be fooled by it in the next 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.070
 video more 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.690
 thumbs up if it helped you and 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.490
 if you know more about weight loss 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.230
 want and how you respectably and 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.520
 wisely then take on the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.520
