00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.660 
bit leggy if you remember so we sunk
them<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> little<00:00:28.650> bit<00:00:28.769> lower<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> ground

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
them a little bit lower in the ground

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.490 
them a little bit lower in the ground
and<00:00:30.349> they<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:32.099> blossomed<00:00:33.079> they're<00:00:34.079> ready<00:00:34.380> to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and they have blossomed they're ready to

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.010 
and they have blossomed they're ready to
go<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:34.980> now<00:00:35.399> when<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.640> put<00:00:36.059> these<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.780> need

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
go in now when you put these in you need

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.700

to<00:00:37.050> put<00:00:37.410> them<00:00:37.590> all<00:00:37.890> about<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:39.540> foot<00:00:40.079> apart

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
to put them all about one foot apart

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.160 
to put them all about one foot apart
because<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:42.059> color<00:00:42.360> flowers<00:00:42.629> will<00:00:42.780> grow<00:00:42.840> out

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
because the color flowers will grow out

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.470 
because the color flowers will grow out
and<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:44.040> will<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.550> broccoli<00:00:45.239> or<00:00:45.360> the

and so will the broccoli or the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600 
and so will the broccoli or the
Calabrese<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.800> Brussels<00:00:47.190> will<00:00:47.340> go<00:00:47.460> up

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
Calabrese and the Brussels will go up

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.490 
Calabrese and the Brussels will go up
but<00:00:47.760> they<00:00:47.879> still<00:00:48.270> need<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.750> space<00:00:49.110> they<00:00:49.350> have

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
but they still need that space they have

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.720 
but they still need that space they have
very<00:00:49.860> very<00:00:50.219> big<00:00:50.670> root<00:00:51.390> ball<00:00:52.160> now<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.219> need<00:00:53.550> to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
very very big root ball now we need to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.889 
very very big root ball now we need to
double<00:00:54.059> defense<00:00:55.050> these<00:00:55.440> against<00:00:56.100> nature<00:00:57.030> we

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
double defense these against nature we

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.439 
double defense these against nature we
have<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.289> put<00:00:58.500> slug<00:00:58.770> pellets<00:00:59.010> round<00:00:59.460> them<00:00:59.760> for

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
have to put slug pellets round them for

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.819 
have to put slug pellets round them for
the<00:01:00.600> slugs<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> snails<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.559> also<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829

the slugs and the snails and also the
birds<00:01:02.100> like<00:01:02.489> these<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.329> once<00:01:03.960> you've<00:01:04.199> planted

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
birds like these so once you've planted

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.670 
birds like these so once you've planted
them<00:01:04.860> all<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.159> must<00:01:05.610> put<00:01:06.540> some<00:01:06.840> netting<00:01:07.439> over

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
them all you must put some netting over

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.340 
them all you must put some netting over
it's<00:01:08.220> very<00:01:08.280> cheap<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.000> get<00:01:09.119> hold<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.200> just

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
it's very cheap to get hold of so just

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.710 
it's very cheap to get hold of so just
put<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.590> over<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.100> top<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.720> that'll

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
put that over the top and that'll

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.390 
put that over the top and that'll
protect<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.409> attach<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.040> sticks

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
protect it if you attach it to sticks

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.999 
protect it if you attach it to sticks
around<00:01:14.790> each<00:01:15.000> corner<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.200> bed<00:01:16.409> then<00:01:16.979> you

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
around each corner of the bed then you

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.920 
around each corner of the bed then you
can<00:01:17.340> raise<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.759> up<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> plants<00:01:18.540> get<00:01:18.659> taller

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
can raise it up as the plants get taller

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.010 
can raise it up as the plants get taller
and<00:01:19.140> taller<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:20.250> I'll<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.790> show<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.180> how<00:01:21.960> to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
and taller so I'll just show you how to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.920 
and taller so I'll just show you how to
have<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.740> now<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> give<00:01:23.939> these<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> little<00:01:24.780> bit

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
have this now to give these a little bit

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.140 
have this now to give these a little bit
more<00:01:25.049> stability<00:01:25.619> because<00:01:26.400> they<00:01:26.580> need<00:01:26.909> it

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
more stability because they need it

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.780 
more stability because they need it
because<00:01:27.270> they<00:01:27.600> grow<00:01:27.810> very<00:01:28.080> tall<00:01:28.310> we<00:01:29.310> need<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
because they grow very tall we need to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.050 
because they grow very tall we need to
dig<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.090> nice<00:01:30.360> big<00:01:30.420> hole<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.500> them<00:01:31.729> if<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.850> find

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
any potatoes in in the bed then we'll

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.180

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
come out and take a nice deep hole we'll

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.800 
come out and take a nice deep hole we'll
take<00:01:43.720> one<00:01:44.110> of<00:01:44.140> them<00:01:44.470> out<00:01:45.240> they've<00:01:46.240> got<00:01:46.420> a<00:01:46.450> very

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
to put them just above the first leaf so

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.410 
to put them just above the first leaf so
they've<00:01:58.780> got<00:01:59.050> a<00:01:59.380> lot<00:01:59.560> of<00:01:59.860> support<00:02:00.580> around<00:02:00.880> them

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
they've got a lot of support around them

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:21.630 
they've got a lot of support around them
then<00:02:02.140> fill<00:02:02.650> them<00:02:02.890> in<00:02:05.580> push<00:02:06.580> down<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:21.340> show

you'll<00:04:05.010> attach<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.730> other<00:04:05.880> corners<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.660> the

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
you'll attach the other corners to the

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.569 
you'll attach the other corners to the
other<00:04:06.989> ones<00:04:07.260> on<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.590> other<00:04:07.739> corners<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.489> the

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
other ones on the other corners of the

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.370 
other ones on the other corners of the
bed<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:11.370> birds<00:04:11.609> only<00:04:12.239> go<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:13.079> top

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
bed and the birds only go to the top

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.259 
bed and the birds only go to the top
they<00:04:13.709> tend<00:04:14.040> not<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.250> go<00:04:14.519> to<00:04:14.579> the<00:04:14.850> side<00:04:15.090> they

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
they tend not to go to the side they

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.229 
they tend not to go to the side they
don't<00:04:15.450> think<00:04:15.780> about<00:04:16.639> standing<00:04:17.639> on<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.000> floor

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
don't think about standing on the floor

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:25.279 
don't think about standing on the floor
and<00:04:18.419> walking<00:04:18.780> in<00:04:22.789> so<00:04:23.789> you<00:04:24.450> just<00:04:24.690> need<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:24.990> have

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
and walking in so you just need to have

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.800 
and walking in so you just need to have
them<00:04:25.530> at<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.160> lowest<00:04:26.370> point<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.150> then<00:04:27.300> as<00:04:27.570> the

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
them at the lowest point and then as the

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.870 
them at the lowest point and then as the
plants<00:04:28.169> grow<00:04:28.229> just<00:04:29.070> move<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.490> up<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.760> little

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
plants grow just move it up a little

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.120 
plants grow just move it up a little
because<00:04:30.210> if<00:04:30.479> the<00:04:30.600> birds<00:04:30.840> come<00:04:31.139> along<00:04:31.410> if<00:04:31.770> they

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
because if the birds come along if they

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.250 
because if the birds come along if they
pick<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.580> outer<00:04:32.760> leaves<00:04:33.120> that's<00:04:33.539> fine<00:04:33.930> the

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
pick the outer leaves that's fine the

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.810 
pick the outer leaves that's fine the
plant<00:04:34.500> will<00:04:34.680> still<00:04:34.950> survive<00:04:35.220> but<00:04:35.460> if<00:04:35.639> they

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
plant will still survive but if they

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.690 
plant will still survive but if they
pick<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.510> middle<00:04:36.750> ones<00:04:37.139> then<00:04:38.070> that's<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:38.580> the

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
pick the middle ones then that's it the

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.440 
pick the middle ones then that's it the
plant<00:04:38.940> is<00:04:39.210> dead<00:04:39.479> they<00:04:40.169> will<00:04:40.470> devour<00:04:41.039> them<00:04:42.000> it's

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
plant is dead they will devour them it's

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.409 
plant is dead they will devour them it's
the<00:04:42.720> pigeons<00:04:43.200> and<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:44.220> crows<00:04:44.550> like<00:04:44.940> them<00:04:45.240> as

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419

the pigeons and the crows like them as
well<00:04:45.450> so<00:04:45.930> that's<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.860> best<00:04:47.099> thing<00:04:47.430> to<00:04:47.700> do<00:04:48.060> but

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
well so that's the best thing to do but

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.110 
well so that's the best thing to do but
