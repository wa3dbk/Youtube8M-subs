00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.679
 hello everyone to all these captains has 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.000
 now find themselves today 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.800
 for a little khama trick that 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.880
 reports a lot and I think the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.439
 people are not necessarily going to do that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.250
 a brief to immediately looked after he 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.990
 it's a kraft 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.449
 I am going to show you which good valley 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.430
 kou hdv the item in question it will be 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.300
 maybe faster then hd of 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.570
 sculptors 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.370
 so here it is actually stick 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.200
 carnivores I simply had to 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:47.100
 kraft and when I needed it for 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.930
 for my parcel characters there and in fact we 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.980
 will note that kraft is worth that dal 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.360
 in fact just look at 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.100
 millecam at 1400 1400 chip four mines 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.239
 that's pretty much I was told we're gonna 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.670
 bounce at the top each time these 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.289
 half this mine we add there we have 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.809
 thirty thousand and then we are sailing to 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.700
 31000 kraft already nothing if you kraft 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.720
 and that they are selling is already doing more 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.700
 double of discount 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.710
 but the goal is not going to be to do that 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.970
 the goal is going to be besides I'm not going 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.189
 do it because I already did it 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.509
 will show you screen the purpose in 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.670
 does it's going to be east kraft and a 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.330
 dose fm then with a hard chip 3 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.240
 I'm going to show you 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.950
 is waiting for carnivores so here's the goal 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.610
 it's you take runes +3 you 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.650
 go up to 30 2 33 it goes and 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.180
 then you pass chips 10 and the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.510
 principle is up to 40 years old 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.310
 does about and so sell them 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.040
 so I did it from the time I 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.180
 had kraft and 10 actually I wanted 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.220
 I needed it for my personal package 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.300
 so I wanted to go buy some and I 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.070
 since it cost nothing to fear so 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.830
 I crafter by ten and I fm 9 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.050
 and I kept one of them at the fm 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.570
 at around 33.36 and I kept worried 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.100
 44 but I could very well fm them 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.320
 others you're 40 but I just had the 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.790
 good laziness the disadvantage is that it 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.830
 must find a high unemployment stick 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.810
 but it's good 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.490
 is not it super expensive and that 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.929
 give it that give it here I do not know if 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.989
 you see good I sold three sticks 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.160
 carnivores on the mountains people I have 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.820
 sold others but it's the only one that 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.630
 I could screen 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.100
 so they went to 252 139 200 220 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.290
 miles what's so pretty good 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.570
 it makes you a winner twice 4 x 5 x 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.080
 6 times it depends so it's really 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.820
 impressive 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.440
 so it's really a trick that 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.610
 walk I showed you the craft he 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.350
 worth the dal the only thing that is expensive 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.940
 these mushrooms luigi must know that we 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.380
 can you have success that you in 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.180
 offer from here seems to me enough 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.660
 bullshit it must be success 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.819
 champions 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.019
 maybe it's not 10 but we'll see 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.550
 in any case if you do it at 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:46.100
 many that will offer you some 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:48.230
 number sings it's not that that you 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.760
 offers one you do it to 8 perso and 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.030
 you will have g8 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.250
 finally short and otherwise you go them 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.150
 buy in hd but we savor it 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.540
 seems like it's worth 20 million to 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.670
 watch 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.260
 finally ten thousand ten thousand units even though 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.790
 these twenty thousand units it's always worth 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.500
 the shot 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.060
 look here are seven thousand units what 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.350
 so there it is clearly all good 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.090
 there are more who do not miss it 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.220
 there are times when there are none in Algeria 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.019
 but there he clearly has the mass so 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.019
 here's a tip a trick that's moving 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.610
 think 1 frankly if we go on we go 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.420
 to make a small a small estimates 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.000
 if we go on 10 stick so 10 you 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.370
 have for 31000 for each stick that 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.920
 you do a kraft that cost 310 thousand 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.920
 we will add 50 miles of hand 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.700
 we'll say it's three hundred 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.299
 sixty thousand 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.160
 then we'll add this 40000 runes 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.870
 know that the raache runes it costs ten 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.550
 one thousand the ten so we'll say that you 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.910
 take it 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.010
 you take some wines and you take 200 + 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.350
 So we're going to add 40,000 reindeer to 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.780
 about 400 miles and you 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.210
 are going to have a resale so ten times 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.350
 200 miles to we will not put too much no 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:59.590
 over 2 million so you remove 5% 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:04.530
 of 2 million no it's because I 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.530
 wanted to do we'll get there 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.120
 so here you are removing 100000 so in 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.940
 wholesale you have a resale 1 me in 9 - 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.850
 the 360 mills offered a million four 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.840
 million five years in ten minutes what 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.190
 are we going to say 20 minutes because 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.750
 fall is done but it takes a little bit 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.859
 of time so here he did not know what 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.390
 works very well do not hesitate to 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.440
 do me I sold them his very share 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.810
 well it's a breakdown in the extraordinary 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.640
 chest with two items a bonus of more 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.360
 50 of act to know that the stick of a 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.160
 up to 30 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.630
 the bell has the rate to 10 give up 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.850
 60 and as soon as you have both items 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.700
 you have 50 kg plus no small 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.410
 calculation 30 + 60 plus 50 it makes you 140 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.940
 da giant two items it's really a 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.160
 panel and who is very prized by the bl 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.600
 so that works very very well here 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.190
 so it was captain amakna on 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.270
 silhouette but a little gamma trick 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.560
 do not hesitate to put one never a 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.880
 comment to the video if that you 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.780
 press one finds oneself for others 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.780
 videos has more
