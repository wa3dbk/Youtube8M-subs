and<00:00:05.490> even<00:00:05.850> when<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.089> new<00:00:06.330> variant<00:00:06.779> comes<00:00:07.020> out<00:00:07.259> it

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
and even when a new variant comes out it

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.770 
and even when a new variant comes out it
feels<00:00:07.710> like<00:00:07.950> it's<00:00:08.099> been<00:00:08.250> honed<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.910> developed

204<00:00:34.890> miles<00:00:35.520> an<00:00:35.820> hour<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.110> new<00:00:37.350> 911<00:00:38.239> gt2

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.050 

so<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:54.780> exactly<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.890> well<00:00:56.400> imagine<00:00:56.790> the

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
so what exactly is it well imagine the

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.630 
so what exactly is it well imagine the
most<00:00:57.240> ludicrous<00:00:58.100> unnecessary<00:00:59.100> things<00:00:59.430> you

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
most ludicrous unnecessary things you

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.420 
most ludicrous unnecessary things you
could<00:00:59.790> do<00:00:59.970> to<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.210> 911<00:01:00.840> turbo<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.920> add<00:01:02.130> even

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
could do to a 911 turbo like add even

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.030 
could do to a 911 turbo like add even
more<00:01:02.640> power<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.510> make<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.930> much<00:01:04.140> lighter<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
more power and make it much lighter and

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.310 
more power and make it much lighter and
then<00:01:05.340> strip<00:01:05.700> away<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.420> safest<00:01:06.960> hangs<00:01:07.140> is

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
then strip away the safest hangs is

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.680 
then strip away the safest hangs is
four-wheel<00:01:07.740> drive<00:01:08.070> system<00:01:08.550> to<00:01:08.880> make<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.240> Larry

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
scary and rear-wheel drive well that's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.620 
scary and rear-wheel drive well that's

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
turbos just like the 911 turbo however

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.150 
turbos just like the 911 turbo however
with<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.250> increased<00:02:17.730> pressure<00:02:18.980> there<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.010> a

with the increased pressure there is a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.520 
with the increased pressure there is a
bit<00:02:20.400> more<00:02:20.430> lag<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:21.690> makes<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.080> tricky<00:02:22.410> to

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
bit more lag and that makes it tricky to

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.280 
bit more lag and that makes it tricky to
drive<00:02:22.950> not<00:02:23.610> some<00:02:23.940> slow<00:02:24.360> corners<00:02:24.900> when<00:02:25.170> you

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
drive not some slow corners when you

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.600 
drive not some slow corners when you
open<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.680> throttle<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:26.100> get<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> bit<00:02:26.520> of

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
open the throttle you get a bit of

open the throttle you get a bit of

understeer as you wait for the turbos to

understeer as you wait for the turbos to
start<00:02:29.540> spinning<00:02:30.540> up<00:02:31.370> now<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.430> gear<00:02:32.700> change<00:02:33.000> is

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540

start spinning up now the gear change is
slow<00:02:33.810> we<00:02:34.170> have<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.500> ends<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.890> bit<00:02:34.920> more<00:02:35.250> clunky
