you're ready to brew but there is
another<00:00:31.800> way<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.669> can<00:00:32.789> do<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.440> is

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
another way you can do this and that is

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.520 
another way you can do this and that is
with<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> purchase<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.899> this<00:00:36.899> little<00:00:37.199> doodad

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
with the purchase of this little doodad

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.009 
with the purchase of this little doodad
the<00:00:38.280> my<00:00:38.460> k-cup<00:00:38.699> so<00:00:39.300> I'm<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.510> going<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.690> open

the my k-cup so I'm just going to open
it<00:00:40.079> up<00:00:40.199> I've<00:00:40.890> already<00:00:41.280> taken<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.850> plastic

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
it up I've already taken the plastic

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.069 
it up I've already taken the plastic
wrapping<00:00:42.839> off<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.730> and<00:00:44.730> basically<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.600> you

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
wrapping off this and basically what you

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.439 
wrapping off this and basically what you
have<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.569> separate<00:00:48.569> K<00:00:49.109> cup<00:00:49.350> holder<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
have here is a separate K cup holder and

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.239 
have here is a separate K cup holder and
inside<00:00:52.190> instead<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.460> k-cup<00:00:53.719> is<00:00:54.920> if<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.069> is<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:56.249 
inside instead of a k-cup is if it is a

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:58.610 
inside instead of a k-cup is if it is a
filter<00:00:56.729> it's<00:00:57.089> like<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> permanent<00:00:57.659> reusable

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
filter it's like a permanent reusable

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.860 
filter it's like a permanent reusable
filter<00:00:58.979> you<00:00:59.190> use<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.519> once<00:00:59.729> wash<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.479> out<00:01:00.600> rinse

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
filter you use it once wash it out rinse

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.439 
filter you use it once wash it out rinse
it<00:01:01.109> use<00:01:01.319> it<00:01:01.469> again<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.769> again<00:01:01.979> and<00:01:02.129> again<00:01:02.519> this

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
it use it again and again and again this

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.509 
it use it again and again and again this
little<00:01:03.659> screen<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.799> probably<00:01:04.979> hard<00:01:05.339> to

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
little screen here it's probably hard to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.760 
little screen here it's probably hard to
see<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.420> basically<00:01:06.780> you're<00:01:07.290> filling<00:01:07.650> that

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
see but basically you're filling that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.160 
see but basically you're filling that
with<00:01:07.979> coffee<00:01:08.250> as<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:09.150> you're<00:01:09.330> creating<00:01:09.870> a<00:01:09.930> cake

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
with coffee as if you're creating a cake

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.100 
with coffee as if you're creating a cake
up<00:01:10.410> and<00:01:10.730> and<00:01:11.730> here<00:01:12.120> it<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.300> side<00:01:12.630> by<00:01:12.840> side

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
up and and here it is side by side

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.140 
up and and here it is side by side
pretty<00:01:13.530> much<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> same<00:01:14.100> size<00:01:14.370> so<00:01:14.730> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:14.880> see

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
pretty much the same size so you can see

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.570 
pretty much the same size so you can see
how<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.390> works

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
how that works

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.750 
how that works
now<00:01:19.070> when<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.220> use<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:21.470> you<00:01:22.470> first<00:01:22.800> have<00:01:23.730> to

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
now when you use this you first have to

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.490 
now when you use this you first have to
remove<00:01:24.120> the<00:01:25.110> existing<00:01:25.500> K<00:01:26.340> cup<00:01:26.640> holder

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
remove the existing K cup holder

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.130 
remove the existing K cup holder
assembly<00:01:28.850> from<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.120> brewer<00:01:30.360> itself<00:01:30.870> that's

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
assembly from the brewer itself that's

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.170 
assembly from the brewer itself that's
not<00:01:31.230> very<00:01:31.380> complicated<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.580> first<00:01:32.880> one<00:01:33.090> or

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
not very complicated the first one or

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.580 
not very complicated the first one or
two<00:01:33.300> times<00:01:33.510> you<00:01:33.750> do<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.050> you'll<00:01:34.200> find<00:01:34.230> it<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
two times you do is you'll find it a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.380 
two times you do is you'll find it a
little<00:01:34.650> stiff<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.550> this<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> little<00:01:36.270> odd

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
little stiff and this is a little odd

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.840 
little stiff and this is a little odd
because<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.900> fact<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.650> my<00:01:37.800> k-cup<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.430> made<00:01:38.640> by

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
because in fact the my k-cup is made by

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.110 
because in fact the my k-cup is made by
Keurig<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.930> brewer<00:01:40.230> is<00:01:40.440> made<00:01:40.710> by<00:01:40.920> Keurig<00:01:41.400> but

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
Keurig the brewer is made by Keurig but

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.080 
Keurig the brewer is made by Keurig but
the<00:01:42.270> way<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:43.290> existing<00:01:44.040> k<00:01:44.310> cup<00:01:44.550> holder<00:01:44.940> is

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the way the existing k cup holder is

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.030 
the way the existing k cup holder is
designed<00:01:45.510> it<00:01:45.900> doesn't<00:01:46.200> look<00:01:46.470> as<00:01:46.620> if<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.920> know

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
designed it doesn't look as if you know

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.590 
designed it doesn't look as if you know
they<00:01:47.130> haven't<00:01:47.280> made<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.490> easy<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.150> get<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.420> and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
they haven't made it easy to get in and

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.480 
they haven't made it easy to get in and
out<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.840> doesn't<00:01:49.140> look<00:01:49.380> as<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:49.680> they<00:01:49.920> were

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
out it doesn't look as if they were

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.700 
out it doesn't look as if they were
thinking<00:01:50.880> about<00:01:51.000> using<00:01:51.480> this<00:01:51.840> when<00:01:52.590> they

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
thinking about using this when they

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.000 
thinking about using this when they
designed<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.340> what<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.890> kind<00:01:55.890> of

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
designed this what I do is I kind of

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.280 
designed this what I do is I kind of
pinch<00:01:56.370> the<00:01:56.670> sides<00:01:56.940> together<00:01:57.300> up<00:01:57.810> near<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.260> top

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
pinch the sides together up near the top

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.820 
pinch the sides together up near the top
and<00:01:58.850> pull<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.030> out<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:01.380> there<00:02:01.650> are<00:02:01.740> these

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
and pull it out and there are these

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.590 
and pull it out and there are these
little<00:02:01.950> plastic<00:02:02.280> hooks<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.090> they<00:02:03.300> kind<00:02:03.540> of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
little plastic hooks that they kind of

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.740 
little plastic hooks that they kind of
Bend<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:04.200> grip<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.740> here<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:06.120> once<00:02:06.600> you've

the<00:02:09.239> holder<00:02:09.539> assembly<00:02:09.659> is<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.319> same<00:02:10.530> size

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the holder assembly is the same size

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.550 
the holder assembly is the same size
very<00:02:11.280> similar<00:02:11.640> construction<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:13.140> put<00:02:13.380> that

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
very similar construction you put that

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.330 
very similar construction you put that
to<00:02:13.710> one<00:02:13.860> side<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:15.390> drop

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
to one side and you drop

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.480

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
we haven't put any coffee in there so we

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.030 
we haven't put any coffee in there so we
take<00:02:25.600> out<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.650> filter<00:02:28.290> grab<00:02:29.290> ourselves<00:02:29.860> some

coffee<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.920> start<00:02:33.250> filling<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.730> up<00:02:34.140> I'm

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
coffee and and start filling it up I'm

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.530 
coffee and and start filling it up I'm
just<00:02:35.200> using<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.770> tea<00:02:36.220> spoon<00:02:36.400> here<00:02:37.000> but

basically<00:02:37.690> if<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.410> fill<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.070> top<00:02:39.430> to

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
basically if you fill it to the top to

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.920 
basically if you fill it to the top to
the<00:02:40.420> level<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.170> screen<00:02:42.450> right<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.720> top

the level of the screen right to the top
level<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.650> screen<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.640> have<00:02:45.790> enough

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
there now a word about the grind here in

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.940 
there now a word about the grind here in
the<00:03:01.570> paperwork<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:02.200> comes<00:03:02.380> with<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.830> my

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
the paperwork that comes with the my

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.400 
the paperwork that comes with the my
k-cup<00:03:03.160> they<00:03:03.640> suggest<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.330> start<00:03:04.690> with<00:03:04.840> a

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
k-cup they suggest that you start with a

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.440 
k-cup they suggest that you start with a
fairly<00:03:06.010> coarse<00:03:06.220> grind<00:03:06.580> as<00:03:06.880> if<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:07.120> were<00:03:07.209> using

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
fairly coarse grind as if you were using

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.290 
fairly coarse grind as if you were using
a<00:03:07.630> French<00:03:07.900> press<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.530> then<00:03:09.489> maybe<00:03:09.790> work<00:03:10.060> your

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
a French press and then maybe work your

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.229 
a French press and then maybe work your
way<00:03:10.510> up<00:03:10.540> towards<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.440> kind<00:03:11.769> of<00:03:11.920> finer<00:03:12.160> grind<00:03:12.459> as

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
way up towards a kind of finer grind as

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.890 
way up towards a kind of finer grind as
if<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:13.600> were<00:03:13.750> using<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.200> drip<00:03:14.440> brewer<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:16.180> found

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
if you were using a drip brewer I found

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.420 
if you were using a drip brewer I found
that<00:03:17.110> I<00:03:17.200> know<00:03:17.260> others<00:03:17.650> have<00:03:17.769> found<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.190> same

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
that I know others have found the same

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.729 
that I know others have found the same
that<00:03:18.790> if<00:03:18.910> you<00:03:19.300> make<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.600> too<00:03:19.780> coarse<00:03:20.110> like<00:03:20.530> you

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
that if you make it too coarse like you

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.940 
that if you make it too coarse like you
are<00:03:20.890> using<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.430> French<00:03:21.700> press<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:23.170> there's

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
are using a French press that there's

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.590 
are using a French press that there's
just<00:03:24.130> not<00:03:24.280> enough<00:03:24.340> flavor<00:03:24.730> extracted<00:03:25.510> from

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
just not enough flavor extracted from

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.120 
just not enough flavor extracted from
the<00:03:25.750> coffee<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.079> end<00:03:26.320> up<00:03:26.440> with<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.590> fairly<00:03:26.980> weak

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
the coffee you end up with a fairly weak

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.130 
the coffee you end up with a fairly weak
brew<00:03:27.459> so<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.180> would<00:03:28.420> suggest<00:03:28.570> you<00:03:28.870> jump

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
brew so I would suggest you jump

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.199 
brew so I would suggest you jump
straight<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.280> kind<00:03:30.489> of<00:03:30.579> grind<00:03:30.850> you<00:03:31.060> would

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
straight to the kind of grind you would

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.720 
straight to the kind of grind you would
use<00:03:31.420> for<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.720> drip<00:03:32.049> brewer<00:03:32.350> in<00:03:32.620> here<00:03:32.950> that<00:03:33.430> seems

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
use for a drip brewer in here that seems

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.509 
use for a drip brewer in here that seems
to<00:03:33.910> be<00:03:34.000> about<00:03:34.239> right<00:03:34.570> I've<00:03:35.110> also<00:03:35.519> experimented

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
to be about right I've also experimented

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.340 
to be about right I've also experimented
in<00:03:36.610> fact<00:03:36.820> in<00:03:37.030> making<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:37.690> little<00:03:37.780> bit<00:03:37.930> finer

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
in fact in making it a little bit finer

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.180 
in fact in making it a little bit finer
if<00:03:38.820> you<00:03:39.820> make<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.150> coffee<00:03:40.299> too<00:03:40.660> fine<00:03:41.049> like<00:03:42.040> you

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
if you make the coffee too fine like you

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.970 
if you make the coffee too fine like you
would<00:03:42.400> for<00:03:42.730> making<00:03:43.239> an<00:03:43.360> espresso<00:03:43.980> what

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
would for making an espresso what

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.009 
would for making an espresso what
happens<00:03:45.459> is<00:03:45.700> there<00:03:45.970> little<00:03:46.180> openings<00:03:46.750> in<00:03:46.930> the

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
happens is there little openings in the

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.430 
happens is there little openings in the
screen<00:03:47.380> get<00:03:47.709> blocked<00:03:48.100> up<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:49.290> just<00:03:50.290> gets

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
screen get blocked up it just gets

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.880 
screen get blocked up it just gets
clogged<00:03:51.370> in<00:03:51.610> there<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:52.170> water<00:03:53.170> starts<00:03:53.650> trying

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
clogged in there and water starts trying

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.440 
clogged in there and water starts trying
to<00:03:53.950> fly<00:03:54.220> out<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.579> top<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:54.820> it's<00:03:55.120> just<00:03:55.150> not<00:03:55.420> a

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
to fly out the top and it's just not a

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.449 
to fly out the top and it's just not a
good<00:03:55.660> thing<00:03:55.959> but<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.709> have<00:03:56.890> from<00:03:57.070> time<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.430> time

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
good thing but I have from time to time

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.960 
good thing but I have from time to time
gone<00:03:57.910> a<00:03:57.940> little<00:03:58.209> bit<00:03:58.739> finer<00:03:59.739> in<00:04:00.010> my<00:04:00.190> grind<00:04:00.610> than

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
gone a little bit finer in my grind than

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.289 
gone a little bit finer in my grind than
I<00:04:01.060> would<00:04:01.329> for<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:02.019> drip<00:04:02.650> Brewer<00:04:03.090> not<00:04:04.090> getting

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
I would for a drip Brewer not getting

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.000 
I would for a drip Brewer not getting
too<00:04:04.540> far<00:04:04.810> so<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.350> filter<00:04:05.650> doesn't<00:04:05.799> get

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
too far so the filter doesn't get

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.979 
too far so the filter doesn't get
clogged<00:04:06.370> but<00:04:07.000> just<00:04:07.150> a<00:04:07.209> little<00:04:07.420> way<00:04:07.570> up<00:04:07.750> and

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
clogged but just a little way up and

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.780 
clogged but just a little way up and
I've<00:04:08.110> actually<00:04:08.470> that<00:04:09.100> that's<00:04:09.280> really<00:04:09.610> work

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
I've actually that that's really work

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.090 
I've actually that that's really work
quite<00:04:10.060> well<00:04:10.239> for<00:04:10.450> me<00:04:10.510> so<00:04:10.750> here<00:04:11.500> we<00:04:11.620> are<00:04:11.650> we<00:04:11.920> have

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
quite well for me so here we are we have

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.550 
quite well for me so here we are we have
the<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:13.150> ground<00:04:13.359> coffee<00:04:13.660> in<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:14.140> filter

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
the the the ground coffee in the filter

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.650 
the the the ground coffee in the filter
basket<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.840> then<00:04:16.840> you<00:04:16.989> just<00:04:17.229> twist<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.799> close

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
basket and then you just twist and close

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.500 
basket and then you just twist and close
the<00:04:19.660> top<00:04:19.930> here<00:04:20.380> not<00:04:21.070> too<00:04:21.250> hard<00:04:21.519> I<00:04:21.789> have<00:04:22.270> one<00:04:22.419> of

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
the top here not too hard I have one of

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.210 
the top here not too hard I have one of
these<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:22.960> twisted<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.560> too<00:04:23.740> hard<00:04:24.010> and

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
these and I twisted it too hard and

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.920 
these and I twisted it too hard and
there<00:04:24.310> was<00:04:24.400> something<00:04:24.760> in<00:04:24.880> there<00:04:25.030> this

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
there was something in there this

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.960 
there was something in there this
and<00:04:26.230> that<00:04:26.530> seems<00:04:26.890> to<00:04:27.010> be<00:04:27.160> a<00:04:27.190> potential<00:04:27.760> problem

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
and that seems to be a potential problem

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.520 
and that seems to be a potential problem
with<00:04:28.150> these<00:04:28.450> so<00:04:28.720> just<00:04:28.870> give<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.110> a<00:04:29.170> simple

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
with these so just give it a simple

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.740 
with these so just give it a simple
twist<00:04:29.800> so<00:04:30.070> it's<00:04:30.190> locked<00:04:30.490> but<00:04:31.120> don't<00:04:31.450> you<00:04:31.630> know

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
twist so it's locked but don't you know

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.690 
twist so it's locked but don't you know
not<00:04:31.930> like<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.260> was<00:04:32.350> a<00:04:32.380> big<00:04:32.620> straw<00:04:32.980> to<00:04:33.340> screw<00:04:33.640> on

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
not like it was a big straw to screw on

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.430 
not like it was a big straw to screw on
top<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.360> you<00:04:34.450> were<00:04:34.540> trying<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:34.960> tighten<00:04:35.170> it

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
top and you were trying to tighten it

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.980 
top and you were trying to tighten it
don't<00:04:35.650> do<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:35.950> so<00:04:36.880> now<00:04:37.030> I<00:04:37.060> just<00:04:37.450> plug<00:04:37.750> it<00:04:37.900> in

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
don't do that so now I just plug it in

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.820 
don't do that so now I just plug it in
there<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:40.720> can<00:04:40.900> see<00:04:41.140> there's<00:04:41.620> a<00:04:41.680> little

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
there and you can see there's a little

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.760 
there and you can see there's a little
hole<00:04:42.160> here<00:04:42.730> in<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.780> same<00:04:43.990> way<00:04:44.140> that<00:04:44.290> a<00:04:44.350> hole<00:04:44.560> is

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
hole here in the same way that a hole is

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.560 
hole here in the same way that a hole is
ordinarily<00:04:45.250> punctured<00:04:45.880> in<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.150> top<00:04:46.360> of<00:04:46.480> the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
ordinarily punctured in the top of the

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.600 
ordinarily punctured in the top of the
cake<00:04:46.780> up<00:04:47.050> by<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.350> needle<00:04:47.800> up<00:04:47.950> in<00:04:48.130> there<00:04:48.400> and

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
cake up by the needle up in there and

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.390 
cake up by the needle up in there and
then<00:04:49.390> you<00:04:49.480> just<00:04:49.660> close<00:04:49.900> that<00:04:49.960> up<00:04:50.370> press<00:04:51.370> the

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
then you just close that up press the

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.090 
then you just close that up press the
button<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.090> brew<00:04:52.470> when<00:04:53.470> you're<00:04:53.680> done<00:04:53.830> you

take it out let it cool down a bit

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.000

behaving<00:05:05.860> myself<00:05:06.400> I<00:05:06.550> actually<00:05:07.440> turn<00:05:08.440> this

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
behaving myself I actually turn this

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.680 
behaving myself I actually turn this
over<00:05:09.010> into<00:05:09.310> a<00:05:09.340> little<00:05:09.550> pot<00:05:09.790> I<00:05:09.820> have<00:05:09.970> so<00:05:10.480> that<00:05:10.510> I

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
over into a little pot I have so that I

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.680 
over into a little pot I have so that I
can<00:05:10.870> add<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:11.440> coffee<00:05:12.010> grinds<00:05:12.610> to<00:05:12.880> my<00:05:13.210> compost

can add the coffee grinds to my compost

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.210 
can add the coffee grinds to my compost
when<00:05:13.930> I'm<00:05:14.050> feeling<00:05:14.320> lazy<00:05:14.470> actually<00:05:15.010> I<00:05:15.070> just

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
when I'm feeling lazy actually I just

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.770 
when I'm feeling lazy actually I just
run<00:05:15.430> some<00:05:15.640> water<00:05:15.670> into<00:05:16.120> it<00:05:16.270> and<00:05:16.420> it<00:05:16.480> all<00:05:16.570> goes

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
run some water into it and it all goes

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.540 
run some water into it and it all goes
down<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:17.140> drain

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
down the drain

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.460 
down the drain
so<00:05:18.550> why<00:05:19.030> would<00:05:19.210> I<00:05:19.300> why<00:05:19.600> would<00:05:19.630> I<00:05:19.870> actually<00:05:19.990> use

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
so why would I why would I actually use

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.180 
so why would I why would I actually use
this<00:05:21.300> when<00:05:22.300> I<00:05:22.330> can<00:05:22.570> perfectly<00:05:22.840> easy<00:05:23.260> easily

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
this when I can perfectly easy easily

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.550 
this when I can perfectly easy easily
just<00:05:24.490> get<00:05:24.670> myself<00:05:24.940> some<00:05:25.360> tea<00:05:25.570> cups<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:26.140> put

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
just get myself some tea cups and put

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.020 
just get myself some tea cups and put
them<00:05:26.710> in<00:05:26.830> here<00:05:27.070> after<00:05:27.400> all<00:05:27.490> that's<00:05:27.640> what<00:05:27.880> it

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
them in here after all that's what it

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.750 
them in here after all that's what it
was<00:05:28.090> designed<00:05:28.480> for<00:05:28.630> well<00:05:29.560> there<00:05:30.400> are<00:05:30.520> three

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.740 
was designed for well there are three
reasons<00:05:31.080> one<00:05:33.270> magically<00:05:34.270> and<00:05:34.420> it's<00:05:34.570> kind<00:05:34.720> of

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
reasons one magically and it's kind of

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.810 
reasons one magically and it's kind of

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
run out of cake ups because I can just

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.840

when this is important you know this is
not<00:06:54.740> the<00:06:54.950> most<00:06:55.100> inexpensive<00:06:55.610> way<00:06:55.850> to<00:06:56.060> make

and<00:07:00.020> this<00:07:00.140> is<00:07:00.260> more<00:07:00.500> expensive<00:07:00.740> than<00:07:01.310> just

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
and this is more expensive than just

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.900 
and this is more expensive than just
buying<00:07:02.420> ground<00:07:03.050> coffee<00:07:03.440> and<00:07:03.770> using<00:07:04.640> a<00:07:04.700> drip
