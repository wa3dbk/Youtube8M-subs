00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.000
 Christmas I love it's good no it's rsa me 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.830
 I will give you a recipe of a 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.519
 recipe that is very simple fast and 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.990
 effective 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.220
 okay and in addition to the flights in the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.670
 gut we will really make the film 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.680
 alimentary 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.699
 it's going to be very simple it's the pudding 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.470
 white for dummies 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.359
 it's now so we'll lose on 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.439
 the planet refused to the rocket you take 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.060
 milk in it you put a little bit 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.289
 of spices walt kills but a little bit 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.760
 of onions a little bit of 40 a little 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.929
 little pierce a little bit of thyme 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.070
 can after adding 1 and son located 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.329
 so there are people too who puts 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.739
 why not some orange zest 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.140
 it's very good we're going to put a 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.670
 little bit of vanilla it's really this 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.350
 solar rocket milk that would wait for the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.430
 character of your job and that's it 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.020
 it's exactly this important fact 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.280
 exactly because we're going to have 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.700
 you can have pork 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.050
 shoulder 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.579
 we'll see a little bit of fat is 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.899
 not fundamentally what will give 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.879
 all he gave the taste is that 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.500
 so that's like a tc the fusion 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.030
 exactly we take a pod of 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.770
 vanilla cut it in half or 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.270
 recover the grains and we have but 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.350
 also to spread that you do a 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.609
 white pudding come 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.750
 banier it will be nice to have the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.100
 legs and envied but we could 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.609
 put orange peel really play 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.979
 make you happy 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.080
 ah yes then the fault why not 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.280
 the human being is christmas here is the crisis 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.479
 deep after for the english fusion 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.979
 have little to infuse in the let 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.930
 there four years to flavor also agree 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.369
 excellent and to infuse properly 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.619
 look we're going to put just a little 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.000
 piece of movies feed on and 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.229
 after that we'll put some 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.640
 minutes in the microwave okay that's it 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.720
 our microwave do not have well 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.580
 obviously do it with pans 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.110
 also of course of course of course 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.070
 essential gones it's still if we 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.360
 was in a saucepan you put a 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.680
 food film on because the idea 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.329
 is that the flavors she stays in the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.799
 milk small goal and who will fall back 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.439
 and all around and inside it's 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.240
 so here is the he is perfectly 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.560
 infuse look inside we want 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.170
 to have the vanilla pod that smells good 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.820
 it's beautiful it's beautiful 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.840
 owl then to systra tension but one 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.399
 pass Chinese but he'll have to 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.200
 keep at a higher temperature 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.729
 at 45 degrees to favor our 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.259
 emulsion that's important 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.720
 these resignations shifted his ambitions to 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.710
 ok ok super ok so here 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.110
 now you will be able 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.759
 season your white meat while 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.920
 fans like that goes with salt here is 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.450
 for weighing our salt deposited there or 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.799
 no yes she is no longer her prestige 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.710
 but there is no problem we could 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.210
 to put what 15 grams per kilometer 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.920
 fifteen grams per kilo the total mass 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.200
 okay now you come to put 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.729
 first, your white meat in emulsion 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.500
 What is the white meat and walking 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.610
 of the shoulder agree and to cut it 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.470
 in small cubes or fail a cut in 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:22.730
 tic and there you will buy a first 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:24.650
 time went well after the wood on 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.300
 will put our seed sown of all then 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.380
 it is that we dismantle the great barrier 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.250
 I work a lot and we are worth 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.569
 not to say I find it ungrateful 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.730
 Quenum it is a little harder than 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.590
 the others to work but it is 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.850
 precious kangoo its walls have held its 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.519
 best sons frankly it's a beautiful 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.170
 product talent and here we go 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.640
 now we will slowly pour 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.080
 a little bit the little people and a 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.360
 little bit a little bit the ages and 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.440
 at a show at 45.52 that's the ideal 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.870
 agree ideal hotel tac tac 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.890
 that's how we see brics is ready and 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.330
 there we look at the mixture it is good 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.519
 homogeneous we see that we have something 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.450
 which is well connected there are no worries but 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.550
 still we will put in 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.630
 now the port and an egg okay 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.819
 so a little daf 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.530
 ap and door to door to the white doors 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.650
 white the color we had go it's 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.650
 left 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.720
 here we look we are very good we 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.670
 is not liquid we are not too 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.950
 thick to the arts this mini greece consisting 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.730
 pastry cream exactly and it 's fine 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.900
 to be great because we will be able to 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.829
 correctly the mold is a film 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.540
 food to make a beautiful sausage 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.310
 so we will not use the hose 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.239
 natural not because I had more 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.470
 convenient for sir sir all the 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.930
 world is watching them 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:31.940
 we will take our product not that I 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.260
 see here and we'll put it like this and 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.850
 there we could add why not 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.110
 some of the truffles one could even 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.530
 why not rap a few zests 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.549
 orange top hello she sells 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.510
 customize a father exercises everyone 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:47.959
 okay here and the idea now that 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:52.700
 is going to be of molds and like that hop and we 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.040
 will make a nice tac toe choose 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.280
 between novara 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.500
 there we roll our boudin and after on 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.599
 the ends two solutions be you 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.400
 Waltz with a string to roast 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.959
 each side is finally small is not we 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.959
 makes a little knot if we have enough 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.730
 of length at the level of the film one makes a 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.510
 little knot on each side so 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:18.139
 to have our one-year-old hose between 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.789
 quotes synthetic gut this is it 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.410
 so how do you make your leather then 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.600
 we will blame him in another 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.680
 that's going to be a 70 80 degrees Thursday at the 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.389
 room shudders it's perfect it's not 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.830
 it's perfect frankly it's not afraid 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.220
 great thing it is important not that it 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.590
 end 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.880
 Simeon on the other hand we can leave fifteen 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.690
 twenty minutes no problem what is 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.500
 great is that all the flavors 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.530
 stay inside 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.780
 ok here is delicately in the water of 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.699
 cooking and we'll leave fifteen minutes 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.050
 like that quietly quivering 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.520
 first fruits separate me 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.050
 for cooking to finish a small 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.039
 quarter of an hour up who are doing the hall 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.349
 and put them in water and well 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:50.419
 glossy no bruce importance then that 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.860
 keeps the product cold will have 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.750
 stop cooking also a cat laps the 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.880
 cooking this is only about it 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.139
 and then saint mathieu halls too 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.520
 a little white very white we will wait 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.960
 ten minutes we wait a 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.220
 about ten minutes and then after 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.380
 we can take it out of the movie see it 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.460
 very good go look we're going out of the 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.050
 movie we listen properly cock well 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.330
 to do but it is well to make an exit 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:16.849
 thurgovian och town bout i know that 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:18.169
 you're hungry for bikes are probative says 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.940
 to govern a logic 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.550

 angles here we will spend it in the pan 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.699
 then the ideal is to go to the pan 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.960
 or so the paseo always deceives with 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.009
 a nice little ball of butter and 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.389
 colorful sandals a little bit everything 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.340
 around and then to take and without worry 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.720
 I had there the white pudding really 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.460
