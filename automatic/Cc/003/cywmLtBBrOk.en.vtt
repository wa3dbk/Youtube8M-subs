Antonis video when he used an orange I
really<00:06:41.280> kind<00:06:41.460> of<00:06:41.520> dug<00:06:41.729> that<00:06:41.910> patina<00:06:42.180> had<00:06:42.419> come

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
really kind of dug that patina had come

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.480 
really kind of dug that patina had come
a<00:06:42.630> neat<00:06:42.870> effect<00:06:43.289> there<00:06:43.770> are<00:06:43.919> lots<00:06:44.190> of<00:06:44.340> other

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
a neat effect there are lots of other

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.950 
a neat effect there are lots of other
things<00:06:44.610> you<00:06:44.940> can<00:06:45.090> do<00:06:45.240> too<00:06:45.389> as<00:06:45.479> far<00:06:45.660> as<00:06:45.750> trying

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
things you can do too as far as trying

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.140 
things you can do too as far as trying
to<00:06:46.139> put<00:06:46.319> patterns<00:06:46.740> on<00:06:46.979> like<00:06:47.460> tiger<00:06:47.849> stripes

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
to put patterns on like tiger stripes

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.969 
to put patterns on like tiger stripes
and<00:06:48.330> stuff<00:06:48.509> like<00:06:48.630> that<00:06:48.840> I<00:06:48.990> may<00:06:49.349> experiment

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
and stuff like that I may experiment

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:50.710 
and stuff like that I may experiment
with<00:06:50.099> that

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
with that

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.029 
with that
but<00:06:51.720> I<00:06:51.780> do<00:06:51.840> find<00:06:52.080> it<00:06:52.259> kind<00:06:52.440> of<00:06:52.470> interesting<00:06:52.740> to

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 
but I do find it kind of interesting to

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:54.920 
but I do find it kind of interesting to
show<00:06:53.190> the<00:06:53.340> contrast<00:06:53.880> in<00:06:54.120> these<00:06:54.300> two<00:06:54.569> blades

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
show the contrast in these two blades

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.400 
show the contrast in these two blades
how<00:06:55.710> one<00:06:55.979> is<00:06:56.160> mirror<00:06:56.789> mirror<00:06:57.330> image<00:06:57.690> shiny<00:06:58.080> and

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
how one is mirror mirror image shiny and

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.409 
how one is mirror mirror image shiny and
the<00:06:59.099> other<00:06:59.250> one<00:06:59.430> now<00:06:59.639> is<00:07:00.410> has<00:07:01.410> a<00:07:01.440> deep<00:07:02.419> patina

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 
the other one now is has a deep patina

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.540 
the other one now is has a deep patina
to<00:07:04.110> it<00:07:04.139> I<00:07:04.500> think<00:07:04.860> that's<00:07:05.039> really<00:07:05.190> kind<00:07:05.430> of

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
to it I think that's really kind of

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.210 
to it I think that's really kind of
interesting<00:07:06.120> and<00:07:07.110> let<00:07:07.470> me<00:07:07.560> know<00:07:07.740> to<00:07:07.800> by<00:07:08.160> the

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
interesting and let me know to by the

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.339 
interesting and let me know to by the
way<00:07:08.400> how<00:07:08.849> your<00:07:09.120> how<00:07:09.660> the<00:07:09.720> lighting<00:07:09.960> is<00:07:10.110> working
