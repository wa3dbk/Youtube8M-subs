00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.460
 I came here to Cairo in pursuit 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.350
 start a relationship between us and 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.350
 Muslims of the world from scratch 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.420
 these words filled the entire region with hope 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.610
 but here is Obama the second time he entered 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.500
 Presidency critics continue 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.380
 condemn him for the first time during 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.609
 which he never fulfilled the promise 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.890
 resolving issues of peace 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.810
 between israel and Palestine not 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.119
 the promise has moved 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.519
 economic development in afghanistan so 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.499
 and there is no relationship between us 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.110
 and Egypt after the departure of Mubarak 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:35.880
 worsened 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.160
 since the fifties the intelligence services 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.810
 the United States remained relatively confident 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.210
 what keeps the muslim brothers under 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.770
 control because they managed to transfer from 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.930
 egypt saudi arabia 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.390
 America thought it could just 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.280
 pull them out and put in power like that 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.070
 having enlisted this loyalty 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.330
 powerful party and now the us understand that 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.370
 only than that of the faithful 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.970
 Muslim brothers this is your own goals 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.770
 and for the United States supported the invasion on you and 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.840
 his allies in Libya disguised 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.850
 establishing global security and 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.219
 protection of human rights however subsequently 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.670
 this led to the death of the American ambassador 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:14.579
 3 and his staff and the people should have their 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.859
 frc us pretty unfair and dangerous 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.499
 its so-called victory tails 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.170
 over al-qaida they didnâ€™t even think 

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:25.020
 that al-Qaeda is not in other regions 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.329
 just still strong but stronger with 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.539
 every day precisely because 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:33.689
 political policy which the United States is 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.520
 and stuck dressed you can 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.679
 Washington also did not really try 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.840
 put the Palestinians on the side of Obama 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.719
 the United States opposed raising the status 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.119
 Palestine won that Palestinians angry 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:50.219
 but not surprised, but I would say that people 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.829
 as a whole, they no longer see him 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.369
 will meet us at least in something they 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.139
 believed that he was extremely honest about 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.389
 American and other interests of such 

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:03.029
 like the Israeli lobby 

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:06.090
 but not in relation to us and we 

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:09.959
 understood that all our great expectations on 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.510
 business reduced to zero islam usa grows 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.000
 Islamophobia is not without help from all 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.680
 more negative image 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.390
 the wife of the Muslim world in the media and 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.910
 Hollywood recent public survey 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.550
 opinions show that faith in the president 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.440
 Obama as a whole declined especially in 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.630
 Muslim countries where its rating 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.990
 fell 9 percent in the last three 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.850
 of the year 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.850
 the same goes for global 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.280
 support and in foreign policy in 2009 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.520
 year it was 34 percent in 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.640
 the Muslim world in 2012 is only 15 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.560
 percent u ba ba ba we just tinted 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.120
 the ugly face that left push 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.010
 American presidents are always 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.690
 pursued only American interests 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.130
 the only difference is that one 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.180
 the president is smiling and the other is not 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.530
 american system and american 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.870
 interests in the middle east 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.730
 this problem is not a personal question but 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.520
 political that's why i didn't feed 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.440
 high hopes and this antipathy from 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.870
 Arab world did not and smoothed 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.310
 Obama's Arab Spring Support and Conclusion 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.989
 little American troops from Iraq 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.790
 the president has ever lost his favor 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.709
 the arab world is as fast as 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.019
 Obama and now to recover 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.660
 confidence in america alone promises new 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.110
 the beginning will be clearly not enough sex 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.070
