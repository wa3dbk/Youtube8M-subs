00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.709 
definitely gonna go and change it for a
more<00:00:33.270> yellowy<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.469> which<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.980> think<00:00:35.600> it<00:00:36.600> would

be like a 300 I got this foundation and

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.950 
be like a 300 I got this foundation and
I've<00:00:40.020> never<00:00:40.350> tried<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.920> cream<00:00:41.460> foundation<00:00:41.960> with

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
I've never tried a cream foundation with

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.170 
I've never tried a cream foundation with
foundation<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.969> to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
foundation so I was just like I have to

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.930 
foundation so I was just like I have to
get<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.899> when<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.770> pay<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.730> price

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
get it and when I pay for it the price

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.490 
get it and when I pay for it the price
was<00:00:48.149> cheap<00:00:48.180> i<00:00:48.690> thought<00:00:49.110> i<00:00:49.140> was<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.440> be

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
was cheap i thought i was going to be

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.880 
was cheap i thought i was going to be
like<00:00:49.620> 10<00:00:49.920> 12<00:00:50.129> hours<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.090> 694<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.620> that's

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
like 10 12 hours it was 694 so that's

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.979 
like 10 12 hours it was 694 so that's
not<00:00:53.129> bad<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> foundation<00:00:54.210> but<00:00:54.690> then<00:00:54.840> again

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
not bad for a foundation but then again

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.410 
not bad for a foundation but then again
it<00:00:55.350> only<00:00:55.469> comes<00:00:55.770> with<00:00:55.980> point<00:00:56.280> 6<00:00:56.550> fluid<00:00:57.030> ounces

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
it only comes with point 6 fluid ounces

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.689 
it only comes with point 6 fluid ounces
so<00:00:57.989> that's<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.440> little<00:00:58.649> bit<00:00:58.829> more<00:00:59.070> than<00:00:59.309> half<00:00:59.550> of

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
so that's a little bit more than half of

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.000 
so that's a little bit more than half of
the<00:00:59.879> regular<00:01:00.239> foundation<00:01:00.449> i'm<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.800> test

I<00:02:39.380> definitely<00:02:39.650> think<00:02:40.130> it's<00:02:40.370> too<00:02:40.760> late<00:02:41.090> for<00:02:41.360> my

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
I definitely think it's too late for my

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.450 
I definitely think it's too late for my
skin<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:44.080> it's<00:02:45.080> kind<00:02:45.320> of<00:02:45.380> making<00:02:45.560> me<00:02:45.800> little

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
skin so it's kind of making me little

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:55.270 
skin so it's kind of making me little
pill<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:54.020> little<00:02:54.350> bit<00:02:54.440> goes<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.890> long<00:02:54.920> way

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
pill and a little bit goes a long way

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.870 
pill and a little bit goes a long way
honestly<00:02:56.800> actually<00:02:57.800> no<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.280> stuff<00:02:58.670> my

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
honestly actually no I I stuff my

honestly actually no I I stuff my
facebook<00:02:59.300> foundation<00:02:59.810> but<00:02:59.990> yeah<00:03:00.740> but<00:03:00.920> I'm

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
facebook foundation but yeah but I'm

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:09.940 
facebook foundation but yeah but I'm
saying<00:03:06.670> this<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.940> result<00:03:08.240> after<00:03:08.950> one

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
saying this is the result after one

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.220 
saying this is the result after one
layer<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.400> foundation<00:03:10.610> and<00:03:11.270> this<00:03:11.720> side<00:03:11.960> of<00:03:12.110> my

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
layer of foundation and this side of my

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.200 
layer of foundation and this side of my
face<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:12.710> then<00:03:12.890> this<00:03:13.160> side<00:03:13.400> doesn't<00:03:13.730> have<00:03:13.970> any

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
face and then this side doesn't have any

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.960 
face and then this side doesn't have any
so<00:03:15.050> from<00:03:15.350> what<00:03:15.380> I<00:03:15.560> can<00:03:15.710> see<00:03:15.920> it's<00:03:16.220> definitely

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
so from what I can see it's definitely

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.940 
so from what I can see it's definitely
has<00:03:17.300> a<00:03:17.330> really<00:03:17.840> nice<00:03:18.710> coverage<00:03:20.260> as<00:03:21.260> for<00:03:21.740> the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
has a really nice coverage as for the

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.190 
has a really nice coverage as for the
tone<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:22.550> actually<00:03:22.880> think<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.600> matches<00:03:23.780> my<00:03:24.140> skin

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
tone I actually think it matches my skin

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.560 
tone I actually think it matches my skin
tone<00:03:24.470> pretty<00:03:25.090> nicely<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:27.680> feels<00:03:28.460> really<00:03:28.640> do<00:03:29.360> we

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
tone pretty nicely it feels really do we

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.980 
tone pretty nicely it feels really do we
kind<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:30.050> I'm<00:03:31.000> guessing<00:03:32.000> it's<00:03:32.300> still<00:03:32.600> setting

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
kind of I'm guessing it's still setting

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.310 
kind of I'm guessing it's still setting
but<00:03:33.490> the<00:03:34.490> foundation<00:03:35.090> is<00:03:35.210> rubbing<00:03:35.750> off<00:03:35.870> in<00:03:36.170> my

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
but the foundation is rubbing off in my

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.960 
but the foundation is rubbing off in my
head<00:03:36.530> like<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.280> said<00:03:37.340> I'm<00:03:37.580> guessing<00:03:37.880> it's

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
head like I said I'm guessing it's

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.420 
head like I said I'm guessing it's
because<00:03:38.000> it's<00:03:38.390> still<00:03:38.660> setting<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:40.160> I'm<00:03:40.250> gonna

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
because it's still setting so I'm gonna

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.000 
because it's still setting so I'm gonna
let<00:03:40.760> it<00:03:40.910> set<00:03:41.150> for<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.390> little<00:03:41.570> bit<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.110> I'll<00:03:42.770> be

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
let it set for a little bit and I'll be

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.950 
let it set for a little bit and I'll be
right<00:03:43.190> back<00:03:43.430> okay<00:03:43.700> guys<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:44.360> it<00:03:44.450> does<00:03:44.660> take<00:03:44.930> a

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
right back okay guys so it does take a

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.660 
right back okay guys so it does take a
little<00:03:45.230> bit<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:45.680> say<00:03:45.890> it<00:03:46.130> probably<00:03:46.490> took<00:03:46.610> about

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
little bit to say it probably took about

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.090 
little bit to say it probably took about
a<00:03:46.940> minute<00:03:47.230> now<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.380> just<00:03:48.410> feels<00:03:48.710> about<00:03:49.040> right
