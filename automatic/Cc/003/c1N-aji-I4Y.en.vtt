 let's make pancakes with sweet of 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.960
 milk these are the ingredients that 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.059
 we are going to need 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.940
 I have prepared my crepes here 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.039
 pancakes that I do not know if they remember that 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.869
 we have the video made but for the 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.359
 that he has not seen them I will leave 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.859
 here the side of the screen the 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.649
 video so they can learn it to 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.409
 do we also need sugar 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:32.680
 dulce de leche a mint leaf for 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:34.150
 decorate and a little ice cream that in 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.910
 this moment I have it in the freezer for 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.380
 that does not get it right now what 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.950
 let's do is put the sweet of 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.950
 crepe milk 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.500
 very well and we are going to put the sweet 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.070
 of milk everywhere the amount that 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.070
 like it 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.090
 with this is more than enough 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.110
 so let's screw it do not squeeze 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.510
 too much for it to be chubby ok and what 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.780
 let's put on top of the plate 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.690
 and I have the change plate ready for 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.530
 prepare milestone to plate and we're going 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.690
 the second perfect so let's screw 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.220
 the second and so we will accommodate 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.220
 in the little dish 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.620
 let's put them together juntitos well 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.689
 this as it is already we could 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.430
 serve and eat as for example for 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.729
 accompany the mate in Argentina or a coffee 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.710
 it would be ideal but I what I want 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.729
 to do today is to present it dessert type 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.130
 so that you have the opportunity 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.289
 of a pancake to make an exquisite 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.700
 dessert for a dinner or a meal 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.979
 important 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.189
 this part that is coming now has to be 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.070
 fast because because I'm going to bring 30 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.380
 seconds this bread that maybe and armaditos 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.750
 to the microwave so that the dulce de leche 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.690
 and the bread that they take temperature 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.160
 very well I already got the pancakes from 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.830
 microwave and the ones you want to tell them 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.600
 one thing when we take it out of 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.300
 microwave what we achieve is that the bread 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.330
 that seems freshly made then what 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.680
 let's do is put white sugar 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.350
 up like this and we're going to burn it and if 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.900
 you do not have a burner cited as 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.750
 this does not matter they can put sugar 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.970
 glas up impalpable sugar and this 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.989
 step or you would be avoided another of the 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.180
 things would be to make a candy and do 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.610
 some candy strips and stretching the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.080
 and tintÃ­n team has the candy that 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.870
 it's going to give you the very rich part very 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.590
 crispy ok ok we 're going to burn it 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.270
 this is a wonder me when I do not 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.370
 used at first I had a little 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.000
 scary because I thought it was a 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.580
 thing or mother of mine with this but the truth 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.630
 that when you get used to it is a 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.630
 foolishness to use it 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.970
 well let's caramelize everything 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.580
 in that I burned the dough a little bit and 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.540
 although this lie seems to be a lie 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.870
 Quemadito gives him a flavor among the 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:22.090
 burnt sugar the pancake and the sweet 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.090
 of milk and do not miss it 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.120
 perfect like that would be 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.099
 well the ideal is because if you do not remember 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.160
 that if they burn the candy then it remains 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.490
 bitter 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.520
 good ready let's continue I have 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.560
 prepared here ice cream in this case is 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.900
 an ice cream with chocolate chips 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.750
 cream chocolate chips you 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.250
 they can put any flavor elsa mayon 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.260
 for example that would be spectacular 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.720
 that has that touch of liquor cited 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.640
 that would be great so we're going to 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.690
 make a little boche on the side and we're going to 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.180
 accommodate on the plate 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.860
 and if we take our bochitas and do not have 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.380
 a teaspoon of ice cream does not matter 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.630
 You can quietly do it 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.920
 spoonful of very rustic ice cream and and what 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:19.430
 let's accommodate in a corner here 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.430
 from the dish 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.379
 perfect 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.110
 Now what we are going to do is put you 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:28.590
 a mint leaf that gives a little 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.590
 of flavor color and aroma 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.590
 spectacular 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.580
 they saw that it's a super easy dish what 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.930
 what is good about this that we have 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.820
 time to do it the day before 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.199
 leave it in the refrigerator to have everything 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.139
 prepared for last moment when 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:47.050
 we finished dinner we put everything together 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.509
 microwave ice cream bag that we go a 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.220
 little or impalpable sugar or if they want 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.580
 they can also throw chocolate at him 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.430
 what they want to put and I lied is already 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.380
 serve to be like a good dukes 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.810
