then you go to the one you want
um<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.260> believe<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.780> one<00:02:01.010> yes<00:02:02.010> this

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
um I believe it is that one yes this

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.220 
um I believe it is that one yes this
very<00:02:02.730> large<00:02:04.130> green<00:02:05.130> thing<00:02:05.580> here<00:02:06.120> is<00:02:06.300> the

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
very large green thing here is the

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.590 
very large green thing here is the
copied<00:02:07.910> version<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.000> my<00:02:09.090> world

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
copied version of my world

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.930 
copied version of my world
as<00:02:09.930> you<00:02:10.710> can<00:02:10.800> see<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.010> shows<00:02:11.100> like<00:02:11.550> what<00:02:11.820> it'll

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
as you can see it shows like what it'll

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.140 
as you can see it shows like what it'll
look<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.080> ground<00:02:13.110> when<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.740> copy<00:02:13.950> it

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
look like on the ground when you copy it

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.180 
look like on the ground when you copy it
it's<00:02:15.150> much<00:02:16.020> easier<00:02:16.440> if<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.650> clear<00:02:17.040> out<00:02:17.070> a

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
it's much easier if you clear out a

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.100 
it's much easier if you clear out a
large<00:02:17.490> section<00:02:17.850> of<00:02:18.090> land<00:02:18.330> with<00:02:18.570> Minecraft

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
large section of land with Minecraft

large section of land with Minecraft
edit<00:02:19.440> before<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:19.860> put<00:02:20.010> your<00:02:20.130> world<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.580> and

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
edit before you put your world in and

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.990 
edit before you put your world in and
you<00:02:21.810> can<00:02:22.040> mess<00:02:23.040> with<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.280> details<00:02:23.700> later<00:02:23.850> on

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
you can mess with the details later on

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.230 
you can mess with the details later on
but<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:25.290> just<00:02:25.440> simply<00:02:25.740> click<00:02:26.010> once<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:27.120> found

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
but you just simply click once you found

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.360 
but you just simply click once you found
the<00:02:27.360> right<00:02:27.420> area<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.870> want<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:29.010> can<00:02:29.220> hit

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
the right area you want you can hit

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.470 
the right area you want you can hit
import<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.480> imports<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:32.130> can<00:02:32.310> take<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:33.060> while

import it imports it it can take a while

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.440 
import it imports it it can take a while
sometimes<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.110> have<00:02:34.140> bigger<00:02:34.530> areas<00:02:35.450> but

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
sometimes if you have bigger areas but

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.400 
sometimes if you have bigger areas but
with<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:37.230> one<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.500> doesn't<00:02:37.830> take<00:02:37.920> too<00:02:38.040> long

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
with this one it doesn't take too long

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.080 
with this one it doesn't take too long
as<00:02:40.410> you<00:02:40.620> can<00:02:40.740> see<00:02:40.920> it's<00:02:41.040> just<00:02:41.370> building<00:02:41.970> it

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
as you can see it's just building it

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.470 
as you can see it's just building it
over<00:02:42.540> what<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:43.500> already<00:02:43.680> here<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.390> can

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
over what is already here and it can

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.410 
over what is already here and it can
take<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.690> minute<00:02:45.900> or<00:02:46.110> two<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.230> do<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:47.420> because

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
take a minute or two to do this because

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.810 
take a minute or two to do this because
of<00:02:48.660> large<00:02:49.350> amount<00:02:49.709> of<00:02:49.830> blocks<00:02:50.190> it's<00:02:50.459> loading

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
of large amount of blocks it's loading

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.949 
of large amount of blocks it's loading
in<00:02:51.830> but<00:02:52.830> yet<00:02:53.040> everything<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.940> saw<00:02:54.180> beforehand

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
in but yet everything you saw beforehand

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.890 
in but yet everything you saw beforehand
this<00:02:55.080> large<00:02:55.380> building<00:02:55.890> is<00:02:56.120> now<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.450> this

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
this large building is now in this

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.860 
this large building is now in this
different<00:02:58.410> world<00:03:01.459> this<00:03:02.459> will<00:03:02.790> increase<00:03:03.750> your

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
different world this will increase your

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.500 
different world this will increase your
file<00:03:04.290> size<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:05.370> set<00:03:05.550> amount<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.239> if<00:03:06.360> you're

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
file size a set amount so if you're

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.570 
file size a set amount so if you're
looking<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:07.019> copy<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:08.010> whole<00:03:08.190> world<00:03:08.430> I'd

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
looking to copy a whole world I'd

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.030 
looking to copy a whole world I'd
suggest<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:11.340> other<00:03:11.780> link<00:03:12.890> rather<00:03:13.890> than

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
suggest the the other link rather than

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.670 
suggest the the other link rather than
minecraft<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.820> edit<00:03:15.120> because<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:16.470> would

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
minecraft to edit because it would

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.070 
minecraft to edit because it would
probably<00:03:16.950> work<00:03:17.250> better<00:03:17.459> but<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.810> won't<00:03:19.019> work

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
probably work better but it won't work

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.780 
probably work better but it won't work
on<00:03:19.290> my<00:03:19.410> computer's<00:03:19.860> up<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.190> forced<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.670> do

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
on my computer's up and forced to do

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.550 
on my computer's up and forced to do
this<00:03:21.320> but<00:03:22.320> this<00:03:22.500> works<00:03:22.769> pretty<00:03:23.100> well<00:03:23.220> too
