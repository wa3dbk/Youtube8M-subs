00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.699 

this<00:00:00.390> is<00:00:00.539> how<00:00:00.659> to<00:00:00.719> lubricate<00:00:01.050> your<00:00:01.410> cube

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
this is how to lubricate your cube

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.880 
this is how to lubricate your cube
brought<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.159> you<00:00:02.280> by<00:00:02.460> speed<00:00:02.730> cube<00:00:02.970> calm<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.480> you

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:03.890 
brought to you by speed cube calm to you

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.530 
brought to you by speed cube calm to you
okay<00:00:04.890> so<00:00:04.950> this<00:00:05.190> first<00:00:05.250> method<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:06.060> lubrication

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
okay so this first method of lubrication

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.049 
okay so this first method of lubrication
is<00:00:06.870> very<00:00:07.319> simple<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:07.859> easy<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.250> do<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.610> it's

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
is very simple and easy to do and it's

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.339 
is very simple and easy to do and it's
something<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.360> pretty<00:00:09.750> much<00:00:09.900> all<00:00:10.080> speed

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
something that pretty much all speed

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.770 
something that pretty much all speed
cubers<00:00:10.740> would<00:00:10.920> do<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.309> their<00:00:11.490> cube<00:00:11.759> so<00:00:12.660> the

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
cubers would do to their cube so the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.839 
cubers would do to their cube so the
first<00:00:13.019> step<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.650> simply<00:00:13.950> take<00:00:14.130> out<00:00:14.370> an<00:00:14.519> edge

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
first step is to simply take out an edge

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.330 
first step is to simply take out an edge
piece<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> cube<00:00:15.780> now<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.830> do<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.039> by

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
piece of the cube now you do that by

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.290 
piece of the cube now you do that by
rotating<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.970> one<00:00:18.869> side<00:00:19.170> 45<00:00:19.770> degrees

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
rotating the one side 45 degrees

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.820 
rotating the one side 45 degrees
inserting<00:00:21.300> your<00:00:21.420> thumb<00:00:22.080> underneath<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.710> edge

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
inserting your thumb underneath the edge

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.839 
inserting your thumb underneath the edge
piece<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.750> prying<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.930> out<00:00:25.220> now<00:00:26.220> some<00:00:26.550> cubes

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
piece and prying it out now some cubes

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.790 
piece and prying it out now some cubes
it<00:00:27.150> can<00:00:27.539> be<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.960> know<00:00:28.050> rather<00:00:28.289> difficult<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
it can be you know rather difficult to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.560 
it can be you know rather difficult to
do<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.070> sometimes<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.609> may<00:00:29.730> be<00:00:29.789> easier<00:00:30.269> it

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
do this sometimes it may be easier it

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.740 
do this sometimes it may be easier it
depends<00:00:31.019> on<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.260> brand<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> cube<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
depends on the brand of the cube and the

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.299 
depends on the brand of the cube and the
mechanism<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.530> once<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:34.980> piece

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
mechanism so once you have that piece

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.819 
mechanism so once you have that piece
out<00:00:35.489> all<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.239> need<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.420> do<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.750> take<00:00:37.230> our<00:00:37.469> more

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
out all we need to do is take our more

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.430 
out all we need to do is take our more
Lube<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.450> actually<00:00:39.750> two<00:00:39.989> types<00:00:40.230> of

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
Lube so we have actually two types of

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.350 
Lube so we have actually two types of
lubricant<00:00:40.860> here<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> Maru<00:00:41.610> lubricant

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
lubricant here we have a Maru lubricant

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.810 
lubricant here we have a Maru lubricant
and<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.899> Mario<00:00:43.170> axis<00:00:43.590> oil<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.579> core

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
and we have the Mario axis oil the core

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.600 
and we have the Mario axis oil the core
lubricant<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.829> actually<00:00:47.039> use<00:00:47.370> either

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
lubricant so we can actually use either

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.700 
lubricant so we can actually use either
of<00:00:47.820> these<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.390> drop<00:00:48.840> put<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> couple<00:00:49.649> of

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
of these to just drop put a couple of

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.430 
of these to just drop put a couple of
drops<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.039> here<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:51.480> effects<00:00:51.809> are<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.199> little

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
drops in here the effects are a little

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.709 
drops in here the effects are a little
bit<00:00:52.620> different<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.820> example<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.300> milky

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
bit different so for example this milky

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.290 
bit different so for example this milky
substance<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.410> more<00:00:55.620> Lube<00:00:55.920> if<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.000> put<00:00:57.149> one

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
substance the more Lube if you put one

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.090 
substance the more Lube if you put one
or<00:00:57.329> two<00:00:57.449> drops<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.260> designed<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.680> really

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
or two drops in it's designed to really

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.340 
or two drops in it's designed to really
speed<00:00:59.399> up<00:00:59.430> your<00:00:59.670> rubik's<00:01:00.000> cube<00:01:00.270> as<00:01:00.420> opposed<00:01:01.170> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
speed up your rubik's cube as opposed to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.680 
speed up your rubik's cube as opposed to
this<00:01:01.859> axis<00:01:02.460> oil<00:01:02.699> lubricant<00:01:03.210> which<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.449> more<00:01:03.629> of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
this axis oil lubricant which is more of

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.899 
this axis oil lubricant which is more of
a<00:01:03.809> differential<00:01:04.439> oil<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.949> that's<00:01:05.700> designed

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
a differential oil and that's designed

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.760 
a differential oil and that's designed
to<00:01:06.180> actually<00:01:06.510> help<00:01:06.750> make<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.320> cube<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> lot

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
to actually help make you cube a lot

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.859 
to actually help make you cube a lot
smoother<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.400> may<00:01:08.580> not<00:01:08.790> necessarily<00:01:08.939> know

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
smoother and it may not necessarily know

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.359 
smoother and it may not necessarily know
make<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.380> faster<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.130> will<00:01:11.189> definitely

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
make it faster but it will definitely

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.690 
make it faster but it will definitely
make<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.760> smoother<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.020> all<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.710> take

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
make it smoother so all we do is take

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:24.020 
make it smoother so all we do is take
our<00:01:14.939> Marro<00:01:15.240> lube<00:01:18.229> insert<00:01:21.049> there's<00:01:22.049> two<00:01:22.259> drops

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
our Marro lube insert there's two drops

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.430 
our Marro lube insert there's two drops
put<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.180> paste<00:01:25.570> back<00:01:25.780> in<00:01:25.960> and<00:01:27.960> then<00:01:28.960> work<00:01:29.260> it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
put the paste back in and then work it

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.970 
put the paste back in and then work it
around<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.800> tube<00:01:34.260> now<00:01:35.260> you'll<00:01:35.440> notice<00:01:35.650> pretty

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
around the tube now you'll notice pretty

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.650 
around the tube now you'll notice pretty
much<00:01:36.190> immediately<00:01:36.610> that<00:01:36.880> you<00:01:37.000> cube<00:01:37.300> will<00:01:37.480> have

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
much immediately that you cube will have

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.030 
much immediately that you cube will have
a<00:01:37.690> different<00:01:38.020> feel<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.230> it<00:01:38.410> and<00:01:38.680> it<00:01:38.800> will<00:01:38.890> be<00:01:39.010> a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
a different feel to it and it will be a

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.700 
a different feel to it and it will be a
little<00:01:39.340> bit<00:01:39.430> faster<00:01:39.850> as<00:01:39.970> well<00:01:43.410> you<00:01:44.410> can<00:01:44.530> also

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
little bit faster as well you can also

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.500 
little bit faster as well you can also
use<00:01:45.040> this<00:01:45.250> method<00:01:45.640> with<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:45.910> morrow<00:01:46.120> access

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
use this method with the morrow access

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.500 
use this method with the morrow access
oil<00:01:46.630> core<00:01:47.080> lubricant<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:49.030> second<00:01:49.390> way<00:01:49.480> to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
oil core lubricant the second way to

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.360 
oil core lubricant the second way to
lubricate<00:01:50.050> your<00:01:50.110> Rubik's<00:01:50.530> Cube<00:01:50.800> is<00:01:50.950> to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
lubricate your Rubik's Cube is to

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.100 
lubricate your Rubik's Cube is to
lubricate<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.880> core<00:01:52.210> itself<00:01:52.540> using<00:01:53.020> the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
lubricate the core itself using the

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.050 
lubricate the core itself using the
morrow<00:01:53.350> access<00:01:53.800> oil<00:01:53.920> core<00:01:54.340> lubricant<00:01:54.880> and

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
morrow access oil core lubricant and

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.840 
morrow access oil core lubricant and
this<00:01:55.540> is<00:01:55.720> a<00:01:55.750> longer<00:01:56.620> process<00:01:56.740> but<00:01:57.400> it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
this is a longer process but it

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.940 
this is a longer process but it
definitely<00:01:58.240> has<00:01:58.420> its<00:01:58.450> benefits<00:01:58.750> so<00:01:59.740> once

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
definitely has its benefits so once

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.570 
definitely has its benefits so once
again<00:02:00.100> we<00:02:00.490> take<00:02:00.700> out<00:02:00.940> an<00:02:01.090> edge<00:02:01.270> piece<00:02:01.540> and<00:02:02.580> this

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
again we take out an edge piece and this

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.830 
again we take out an edge piece and this
time<00:02:03.790> we<00:02:03.910> have<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:04.150> disassemble<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.810> entire

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
time we have to disassemble the entire

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.020 
time we have to disassemble the entire
cube<00:02:05.590> now<00:02:05.770> once<00:02:05.980> you<00:02:06.130> get<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.280> few<00:02:06.550> pieces<00:02:06.730> out

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
cube now once you get a few pieces out

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
cube now once you get a few pieces out
it'll<00:02:07.480> fall<00:02:07.720> apart<00:02:08.020> pretty<00:02:08.260> easily<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:13.050> make

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
it'll fall apart pretty easily and make

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.720 
it'll fall apart pretty easily and make
sure<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.440> have<00:02:14.620> some<00:02:14.890> sort<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.130> surface<00:02:15.550> or

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
sure you have some sort of surface or

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.030 
sure you have some sort of surface or
paper<00:02:16.000> towel<00:02:16.330> on<00:02:16.570> which<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.200> do<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:17.830> because

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
paper towel on which to do this because

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.680 
paper towel on which to do this because
it<00:02:18.220> can<00:02:18.430> be<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.610> little<00:02:18.910> bit<00:02:19.030> messy<00:02:19.240> sometimes

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.720 

okay<00:02:26.500> now<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.860> we're<00:02:26.980> down<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.430> core<00:02:27.700> of

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
okay now that we're down to the core of

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.090 
okay now that we're down to the core of
the<00:02:27.970> Rubik's<00:02:28.300> Cube<00:02:28.570> we<00:02:29.380> can<00:02:29.530> see<00:02:29.710> that<00:02:29.890> in<00:02:30.070> fact

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
the Rubik's Cube we can see that in fact

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.330 
the Rubik's Cube we can see that in fact
if<00:02:30.640> we<00:02:30.820> pull<00:02:31.090> away<00:02:31.210> the<00:02:31.480> center<00:02:31.870> from<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.170> core

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
if we pull away the center from the core

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.250 
if we pull away the center from the core
it<00:02:33.340> reveals<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.880> screw<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.330> all<00:02:34.810> we<00:02:34.900> need<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.140> do

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
it reveals a screw and all we need to do

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.310 
it reveals a screw and all we need to do
to<00:02:35.440> every<00:02:35.710> single<00:02:35.890> piece<00:02:36.250> is<00:02:36.490> to<00:02:37.300> put<00:02:37.930> one<00:02:38.140> drop

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
to every single piece is to put one drop

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.470 
to every single piece is to put one drop
of<00:02:38.530> Mario<00:02:38.860> access<00:02:39.190> oil<00:02:39.310> core<00:02:39.730> lubricant<00:02:40.210> on<00:02:40.330> it

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
of Mario access oil core lubricant on it

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.770 
of Mario access oil core lubricant on it
hold<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.500> hold<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:42.040> with<00:02:42.190> one<00:02:42.220> hand<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.820> then

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
hold it hold it with one hand and then

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:56.240 
hold it hold it with one hand and then
simply<00:02:44.170> apply<00:02:44.200> one<00:02:44.800> drop<00:02:44.830> on<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.120> piece

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.370 

and<00:02:56.730> now<00:02:57.240> what<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.510> want<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.690> do<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:58.050> go<00:02:58.260> ahead

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
and now what you want to do is go ahead

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.910 
and now what you want to do is go ahead
and<00:02:58.590> do

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
and do

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.620 
and do
is<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.130> every<00:02:59.400> single<00:02:59.610> side<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.270> can<00:03:00.480> be<00:03:00.599> a

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
is to every single side it can be a

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.120 
is to every single side it can be a
little<00:03:00.840> bit<00:03:00.959> messy<00:03:01.170> hence<00:03:01.590> why<00:03:01.770> we<00:03:01.890> have<00:03:02.010> the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
little bit messy hence why we have the

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:10.590 
little bit messy hence why we have the
paper<00:03:02.340> tail

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.030 

importantly<00:03:11.600> just<00:03:11.930> try<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.260> make<00:03:12.440> sure<00:03:12.470> the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
importantly just try and make sure the

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.010 
importantly just try and make sure the
the<00:03:13.370> lubricant<00:03:13.790> actually<00:03:14.120> gets<00:03:14.600> onto<00:03:14.810> the

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
the lubricant actually gets onto the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.540 
the lubricant actually gets onto the
springs<00:03:15.320> as<00:03:15.500> well<00:03:15.650> by<00:03:15.920> just<00:03:16.100> pulling<00:03:16.340> the

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
springs as well by just pulling the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:29.710 
springs as well by just pulling the
pieces<00:03:16.700> out<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.300> here

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.300 

so<00:03:30.720> once<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:31.020> process<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.560> complete<00:03:31.920> we<00:03:32.100> can

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
so once this process is complete we can

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:43.940 
so once this process is complete we can
simply<00:03:32.640> reassemble<00:03:33.300> our<00:03:33.480> rubik's<00:03:33.870> cube

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.470 

keep<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.129> mind<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.430> this<00:03:44.610> can<00:03:44.790> be<00:03:44.910> very<00:03:45.239> messy

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
keep in mind that this can be very messy

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.820 
keep in mind that this can be very messy
process<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:46.140> what<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.349> want<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.560> do<00:03:46.680> is

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
process so what you want to do is

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.729 
process so what you want to do is
obviously<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.550> use<00:03:47.790> tissue<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.420> wipe<00:03:48.569> down

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
obviously to use tissue and wipe down

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.550 
obviously to use tissue and wipe down
externally<00:03:49.739> all<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.129> the<00:03:50.250> lubricant<00:03:50.700> that

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
externally all of the lubricant that

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.930 
externally all of the lubricant that
comes<00:03:52.560> onto<00:03:52.950> your<00:03:53.190> cube<00:03:53.580> because<00:03:53.819> obviously

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
comes onto your cube because obviously

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.729 
comes onto your cube because obviously
you<00:03:54.239> don't<00:03:54.360> want<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:54.629> greasy<00:03:54.989> feel<00:03:55.379> on<00:03:55.620> the

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
you don't want that greasy feel on the

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.100 
you don't want that greasy feel on the
external<00:03:56.129> part<00:03:56.459> of<00:03:57.030> your<00:03:57.150> cube<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.599> also

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
external part of your cube and also

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.479 
external part of your cube and also
remember<00:03:58.349> to<00:03:58.440> wash<00:03:58.560> your<00:03:58.680> hands<00:03:58.890> very<00:03:59.099> well<00:03:59.220> as

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
remember to wash your hands very well as

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.030 
remember to wash your hands very well as
well

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.660 

so<00:04:05.760> once<00:04:05.909> you've<00:04:06.030> done<00:04:06.180> all<00:04:06.239> of<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:06.569> your<00:04:06.780> cue

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
so once you've done all of that your cue

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.640 
so once you've done all of that your cue
Pleakley<00:04:07.819> different<00:04:08.240> feel<00:04:08.420> to<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:08.660> it'll<00:04:09.470> feel

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
Pleakley different feel to it it'll feel

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.460 
Pleakley different feel to it it'll feel
a<00:04:09.680> lot<00:04:09.920> smoother<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:10.610> this<00:04:10.910> this<00:04:11.390> access<00:04:12.349> oil

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
a lot smoother and this this access oil

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.559 
a lot smoother and this this access oil
core<00:04:12.860> lubricant<00:04:13.310> is<00:04:13.430> designed<00:04:13.819> to<00:04:14.030> last<00:04:14.330> a

long time as well just be sure to

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.120 
long time as well just be sure to
obviously<00:04:18.079> remove<00:04:18.500> all<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:18.859> excess

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
obviously remove all the excess

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.740 
obviously remove all the excess
lubricant<00:04:19.609> from<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:20.060> outer<00:04:20.239> layer<00:04:20.540> of<00:04:20.570> the

particular when you're applying it

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.590 
particular when you're applying it
remember<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.330> use<00:04:26.510> just<00:04:26.720> minimal<00:04:27.169> amounts
