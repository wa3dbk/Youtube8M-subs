00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
is easy to spread on top of our bread so

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.429 
is easy to spread on top of our bread so
just<00:02:02.060> mix<00:02:02.329> it<00:02:02.539> and<00:02:03.039> that's<00:02:04.039> it<00:02:04.219> so<00:02:04.639> here<00:02:04.969> is<00:02:05.149> our
