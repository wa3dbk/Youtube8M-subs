degree<00:01:16.540> Celsius<00:01:16.810> day<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.950> whole<00:01:18.130> idea<00:01:18.550> of

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
degree Celsius day the whole idea of

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.910 
degree Celsius day the whole idea of
reradiating<00:01:19.480> what<00:01:19.870> that<00:01:20.020> means<00:01:20.260> is<00:01:20.470> so<00:01:20.680> this

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
reradiating what that means is so this

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.340 
reradiating what that means is so this
is<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.100> surface<00:01:21.400> of<00:01:21.640> your<00:01:21.760> vehicle<00:01:22.350> generally

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
is the surface of your vehicle generally

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.680 
is the surface of your vehicle generally
what<00:01:23.500> happens<00:01:23.800> is<00:01:23.980> the<00:01:24.130> heat<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.550> from<00:01:25.540> the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
what happens is the heat and from the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.450 
what happens is the heat and from the
Sun<00:01:25.870> hits<00:01:26.140> those<00:01:26.320> metal<00:01:26.650> servers<00:01:26.980> and<00:01:27.220> then<00:01:27.340> it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
Sun hits those metal servers and then it

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.360 
Sun hits those metal servers and then it
radiates<00:01:27.850> inside<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.900> vehicle<00:01:29.350> by<00:01:29.890> stopping

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
radiates inside the vehicle by stopping

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.070 
radiates inside the vehicle by stopping
it<00:01:30.490> from<00:01:30.520> penetrating<00:01:31.150> in<00:01:31.390> through<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.780> into

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
it from penetrating in through the into

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.500 
it from penetrating in through the into
the<00:01:32.170> metal<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.560> begin<00:01:32.860> with<00:01:33.070> by<00:01:33.520> radiating<00:01:34.270> it

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
the metal to begin with by radiating it

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.050 
the metal to begin with by radiating it
back<00:01:34.720> out<00:01:34.960> that<00:01:35.740> then<00:01:36.070> therefore<00:01:36.280> is<00:01:36.790> how<00:01:37.000> you

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
back out that then therefore is how you

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.840 
back out that then therefore is how you
keep<00:01:37.390> your<00:01:37.540> vehicle<00:01:38.020> cool<00:01:38.350> well<00:01:39.310> I'll<00:01:39.640> just

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
keep your vehicle cool well I'll just

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.090 
keep your vehicle cool well I'll just
scrub<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.270> entire<00:01:40.300> roof<00:01:41.080> of<00:01:41.320> a<00:01:41.500> coaster<00:01:41.920> bus

any time for a million bucks

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.469 
any time for a million bucks
particularly<00:01:56.320> in<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.560> Motorhome<00:01:56.979> you've<00:01:57.190> got

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
particularly in a Motorhome you've got

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.940 
particularly in a Motorhome you've got
solar<00:01:58.479> panels<00:01:58.540> on<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.080> roof<00:01:59.229> so<00:01:59.470> you<00:01:59.530> don't<00:01:59.860> to

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
solar panels on the roof so you don't to

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.410 
solar panels on the roof so you don't to
be<00:01:59.979> parked<00:02:00.250> in<00:02:00.369> shade<00:02:00.610> all<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.910> time<00:02:01.150> and

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
be parked in shade all the time and

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.270 
be parked in shade all the time and
there's<00:02:01.930> not<00:02:02.170> always<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.650> time<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:03.040> be<00:02:03.160> able

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
there's not always the time to be able

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.550 
there's not always the time to be able
to<00:02:03.400> be<00:02:03.490> parked<00:02:03.729> in<00:02:03.910> the<00:02:04.000> shade<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.780> so<00:02:05.229> the

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
to be parked in the shade and so the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.810 
to be parked in the shade and so the
idea<00:02:05.800> is<00:02:05.860> to<00:02:05.950> keep<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.250> heat<00:02:06.399> out<00:02:06.429> of<00:02:06.729> the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
idea is to keep the heat out of the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.460 
idea is to keep the heat out of the
vehicle<00:02:07.210> this<00:02:07.479> will<00:02:07.660> lower<00:02:07.840> your<00:02:07.929> costs

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
vehicle this will lower your costs

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.109 
vehicle this will lower your costs
minimize<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.369> amount<00:02:09.490> of<00:02:09.580> time<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.910> need<00:02:10.060> to

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
minimize the amount of time you need to

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.850 
minimize the amount of time you need to
use<00:02:10.270> an<00:02:10.479> air<00:02:10.600> conditioning<00:02:11.080> unit<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.620> also

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
use an air conditioning unit it also

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.560 
use an air conditioning unit it also
protects<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.490> roof<00:02:12.640> of<00:02:12.820> your<00:02:12.850> vehicle<00:02:13.000> as

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
protects the roof of your vehicle as

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.630 
protects the roof of your vehicle as
well<00:02:13.750> there's<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.620> nice<00:02:14.770> tough<00:02:15.070> coating<00:02:15.490> and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
well there's a nice tough coating and

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.760 
well there's a nice tough coating and
it's<00:02:16.030> got<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.300> other<00:02:16.510> coating<00:02:16.960> here<00:02:17.170> which

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
it's got this other coating here which

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.590 
it's got this other coating here which
then<00:02:17.920> goes<00:02:18.100> on<00:02:18.280> top<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.610> heat<00:02:18.760> reradiating

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
then goes on top of the heat reradiating

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.690 
then goes on top of the heat reradiating
paint<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.620> product<00:02:21.010> there<00:02:21.190> helps<00:02:21.550> to

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
paint and that product there helps to

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.780 
paint and that product there helps to
make<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:21.910> easy<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.330> keep<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:23.170> roof<00:02:23.560> clean<00:02:23.950> it's

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
make it easy to keep the roof clean it's

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.300 
make it easy to keep the roof clean it's
kind<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.030> like<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.360> on<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.570> clear<00:02:25.870> coat<00:02:26.310> surface
