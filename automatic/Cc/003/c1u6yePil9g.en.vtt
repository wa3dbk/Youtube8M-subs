00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
I've got it you know 12 by 12 then it'll

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.620 
I've got it you know 12 by 12 then it'll
fit<00:01:48.980> right<00:01:49.220> in<00:01:49.370> there<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:49.700> if<00:01:49.820> not<00:01:50.090> it's<00:01:50.330> okay

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
fit right in there and if not it's okay

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.040 
fit right in there and if not it's okay
too

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
too

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.710 
too
the<00:01:51.800> price<00:01:52.190> difference<00:01:52.640> was<00:01:52.970> I<00:01:53.300> think<00:01:53.659> just

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
the price difference was I think just

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.830 
the price difference was I think just
change<00:01:54.230> it<00:01:54.530> wasn't<00:01:54.860> very<00:01:55.130> big<00:01:55.640> difference<00:01:56.000> so

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
change it wasn't very big difference so

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.610 
change it wasn't very big difference so
what<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.200> did<00:01:57.650> was<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:59.479> first<00:01:59.810> night<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:00.080> went<00:02:00.500> to

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
what I did was the first night I went to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.080 
what I did was the first night I went to
the<00:02:00.710> site<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.130> saw<00:02:01.310> their<00:02:01.490> display<00:02:01.909> and

thought I have to have that but then I

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.130 
thought I have to have that but then I
started<00:02:04.820> thinking<00:02:05.150> about<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.450> price<00:02:05.720> and
