 I would love the gods but there is no

 nothing still talked to anyone until the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.820
 moment we have not been told 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.200
 in such a company this does not depend 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.450
 of many more things 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.700
 the arrival of coconut in the Japanese cinemas 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.020
 it was quite an event from the day of his 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.420
 premiere releases 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.190
 the guide of that country for three weeks 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.650
 and although the tickets were sold to 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.840
 lower price to encourage the public 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.720
 to see the movie it is said that dragon 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.910
 ball has managed to raise more than 24 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.160
 millions of dollars with more than 2 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.360
 millions of tickets sold only in 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.670
 Japan 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.950
 the dubbing of every movie of all 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.830
 series of everything you want is made 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.590
 to sell because they have not seen the 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.810
 market or the business in doubling the 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.000
 Dragon Ball movies that have come out 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.360
 after the series ended I do not know 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.550
 now there is dragon ball kai if not 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.260
 they double the movie but if in the 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.600
 200 chapters of which it is said that 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.630
 I speak Akira Toriyama are not going to double with 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.470
 the dragon ball can team is another 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.130
 beautiful 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.920
 who knows just like mario castañeda like 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.960
 René García have been firm in expressing 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.630
 your willingness to be part of the 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.550
 cast of voices of dragon ball z always 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.360
 and when this happens under the conditions 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.650
 economic conditions that they demand 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.830
 but I also understand that my 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.690
 personality is very pragmatic various 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.100
 to record dragon ball you will record to a 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.530
 coach and I arranged financially if 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.690
 like crazy but I'm not going to do anything 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.820
 beyond that I'm not going to look for the 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.520
 I'm not going to offer myself for 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.580
 do it I'm not going to tell you even if 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.100
 they want to do a discount but no 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.140
 think about the fans I'm going to decide if 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.640
 I have the opportunity what is best 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.770
 for me 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.650
 and if it's better for the series than good 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.709
 but if it's not better for me it's not going to 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.740
 be for the sixth then if not what 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.610
 can understand I'm very sorry but it 's 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.770
 well the reality dragon ball z the battle 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.720

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.700
 dragon ball in which he has participated in 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.520
 filled the creator of these characters 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.700
 akira toriyama from the hand of toy 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.380
 animation and the latest in technology and it's 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.320
 not in vain the tape could have been 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.739
 view in ultra high definition and there is more 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.739
 in Japan 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.000
 on the other hand this episode that is located 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.150

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.789

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.490
 presence of cri link and color and vegueta 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:32.590
