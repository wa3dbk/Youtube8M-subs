bottom<00:03:03.459> floor<00:03:03.610> is<00:03:03.790> called<00:03:04.060> ground<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.850> /

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
bottom floor is called ground so /

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
bottom floor is called ground so /
elevator<00:03:07.450> go<00:03:07.840> ground<00:03:09.209> then<00:03:10.209> just<00:03:10.450> punch<00:03:10.750> the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
elevator go ground then just punch the

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.920 
elevator go ground then just punch the
button<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.650> off<00:03:11.799> we<00:03:12.040> go<00:03:12.480> down<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.720> bottom

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
button and off we go down to the bottom

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.400 
button and off we go down to the bottom
floor<00:03:14.489> no<00:03:15.489> stopping<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.269> middle<00:03:19.410> so

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
floor no stopping in the middle so

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.180 
floor no stopping in the middle so
that's<00:03:20.650> how<00:03:21.100> you<00:03:21.160> make<00:03:22.260> an<00:03:23.260> elevator<00:03:23.769> for<00:03:23.980> more

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
that's how you make an elevator for more

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.330 
that's how you make an elevator for more
than<00:03:24.340> two<00:03:24.940> stories<00:03:25.540> it's<00:03:26.440> pretty<00:03:26.739> simple<00:03:29.340> also

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
than two stories it's pretty simple also

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.509 
than two stories it's pretty simple also
you<00:03:30.400> can<00:03:32.970> make<00:03:34.019> automatic<00:03:35.019> glass<00:03:35.769> doors<00:03:36.190> and

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
you can make automatic glass doors and

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.050 
you can make automatic glass doors and
that's<00:03:36.670> when<00:03:36.880> we're<00:03:37.000> going<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.150> show<00:03:37.329> you<00:03:37.390> now

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
that's when we're going to show you now

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.930 
that's when we're going to show you now
so<00:03:41.160> what<00:03:42.160> you<00:03:42.280> do<00:03:42.549> is<00:03:42.910> you<00:03:43.690> get<00:03:43.870> your<00:03:44.049> glass

simple
so<00:05:42.389> all<00:05:42.479> you<00:05:42.540> got<00:05:42.900> to<00:05:43.050> do<00:05:44.570> then<00:05:46.610> something

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
so all you got to do then something

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.999 
so all you got to do then something
that's<00:05:47.820> good<00:05:48.060> to<00:05:48.210> do<00:05:48.389> with<00:05:48.840> glass<00:05:49.350> doors<00:05:49.680> is

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
that's good to do with glass doors is

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:56.330 
that's good to do with glass doors is
when<00:05:50.190> you<00:05:50.280> do<00:05:50.430> that<00:05:50.990> /<00:05:51.990> elevator<00:05:53.900> glass<00:05:55.340> door

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
when you do that / elevator glass door

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.840 
when you do that / elevator glass door
command<00:05:56.940> you<00:05:57.630> specify<00:05:58.470> a<00:05:58.500> floor<00:05:59.370> name<00:05:59.610> like

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
command you specify a floor name like

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.930 
command you specify a floor name like
this<00:06:00.060> would<00:06:00.330> be<00:06:00.560> top<00:06:01.560> so<00:06:02.070> Sasha<00:06:02.340> elevator

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
this would be top so Sasha elevator

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.990 
this would be top so Sasha elevator
glass<00:06:03.360> door<00:06:03.750> top<00:06:04.190> so<00:06:05.190> that<00:06:05.220> it<00:06:05.520> knows<00:06:05.699> that

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
glass door top so that it knows that

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.400 
glass door top so that it knows that
it's<00:06:06.180> for<00:06:06.419> the<00:06:06.570> top<00:06:06.780> floor<00:06:07.139> otherwise<00:06:09.169> it<00:06:10.169> can

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
it's for the top floor otherwise it can

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.560 
it's for the top floor otherwise it can
get<00:06:10.560> messed<00:06:10.860> up<00:06:11.100> sometimes<00:06:11.699> but<00:06:11.910> this<00:06:12.210> time<00:06:12.389> it

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
get messed up sometimes but this time it

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.150 
get messed up sometimes but this time it
didn't<00:06:12.840> but<00:06:12.990> sometimes<00:06:13.620> it<00:06:13.860> does<00:06:15.949> so<00:06:16.949> that's

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
didn't but sometimes it does so that's

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.020 
didn't but sometimes it does so that's
how<00:06:17.310> you<00:06:17.370> do<00:06:17.550> that<00:06:18.860> all<00:06:19.860> right<00:06:20.070> that's<00:06:20.370> it<00:06:20.699> for

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
how you do that all right that's it for

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.230 
how you do that all right that's it for
this<00:06:21.840> video<00:06:22.220> next<00:06:23.220> one<00:06:23.370> I'll<00:06:23.550> make<00:06:23.850> a<00:06:23.880> bigger

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
this video next one I'll make a bigger

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.189 
this video next one I'll make a bigger
elevator<00:06:24.930> and<00:06:25.940> do<00:06:26.940> some<00:06:27.180> more<00:06:27.389> advanced

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 
elevator and do some more advanced
