00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 Welcome to opel tv today 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.740
 is it again a review for me 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.720
 I have two external batteries here 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.340
 I would like to introduce you 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.330
 these things tested for a month and 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.370
 I have to say pretty game 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.750
 convinced of it and my cell phones have 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.280
 meanwhile no sockets you 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.230
 Do not even know any outlet anymore 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.250
 Crisis of the battery already empty 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.250
 biggest outlet 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.820
 Unfortunately, I did not have that much time 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.920
 to make baby i hope you like it 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.269
 anyway and an important note please 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.070
 switch expensive smartphones while 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.779
 This video from interfering too 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.300
 avoid 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.950
 By the way, air outlets are there so me 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.329
 my side necessarily to the end 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.149
 stay at one in the wall a little 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:52.649
 gamble on you as loud as it gets that way 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:53.640
 a lot you will know that for sure 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.899
 here you want to be comfortable with yours 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.850
 make a smartphone walk and 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.710
 sudden battery empty and far and wide 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.879
 there is no outlet or he can see 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.890
 Just sitting comfortably on the couch 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.530
 But the outlet is too far away for that 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.159
 There is now a solution of the willing 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.299
 expert for external batteries and such are 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.650
 the batteries off when they come to you 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.570
 come home here we'll see the one 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.220
 slightly weaker momentum and power bank 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.350
 A man of 10,000 milliamps 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.540
 slightly stronger of the items restore bank 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.740
 with 10,000 4 billion we come to 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.780
 the packaging is actually quite 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.299
 normal and simple from a few logo 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.040
 here a few ruda so now unboxing 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.960
 from something stronger battery as you see 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.520
 I'm new to the boxing scene right now 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.720
 times the packaging bishops tremendously 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.430
 but I hope that it is not so bad 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.530
 So let's have a look 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.180
 then we put on page and first 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.950
 first devote the rest of the things 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.479
 for if I condemn him here again 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.810
 get out there so is ours 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.810
 jewel 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.700
 Here we have some more reading 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.290
 and the warranty card thus wakes you up 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.450
 scope of delivery are still two 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.770
 Micro USB cable and a towel though 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.180
 Honestly what should I please with 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.500
 a glove my hand fits anyway 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.110
 not pure 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.899
 armand away with it and plastic can do that 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.219
 throw it away 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.600
 So he finally comes to the device that comes 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.759
 beautifully welded a beautiful 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.560
 transparent film we get 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.539
 you 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.880
 roman just try again 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.900
 so come to the device gets boss 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.340
 wise in a beautiful 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.780
 transparent film we now 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.220
 Carefully turn off 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.450
 to the fore now comes a right 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.160
 go out in black 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.510
 piano lacquer lumps something so big 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.280
 is like two iphone 4 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.510
 if you put them on top of each other the device 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.310
 each has three connections two 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.170
 outputs and an input and the device 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.880
 to load yourself a criticism is that 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.080
 There is no extra power adapter included 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.840
 so you have to with your smartphone 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.580
 power supplies flames output 1 has 1 each 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.050
 ampere that is perfect smartphone too 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.760
 but if you need more juice 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.650
 for example from ipad then you should 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.299
 car two besides he delivers whole 2 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.799
 amps are located on the upper side 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.750
 a button if you press on it 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.760
 Battery status is in the form of a battery 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.239
 blue led the more the more 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.190
 better 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.930
 So now we are dedicating something 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.380
 weaker of the two so first 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.380
 unpacking 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.569
 in the end, both differ 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.430
 Devices only one performance and the 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.230
 supplied cable with this device 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.880
 will be a usb cable with different 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.099
 smartphone adapter included but 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.660
 no power adapter so see here 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.400
 Once again we settled in direct 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.660
 comparison the stronger device is clear 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.250
 smaller in appearance 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.810
 But I think the weaker one 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.470
 much nicer but that's also true 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.180
 a matter of taste 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.769
 And besides, batteries are not around 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.730
 to look beautiful you should just mine 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.769
 smartphone loading 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.120
 i have all sorts of smartphones and 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.560
 Try tablets and it works 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.060
 everything is impeccable it is all equipment 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.859
 compatible and also like in this video 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.540
 You can use several devices at the same time 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.940
 then without problems in this 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.319
 case it is now 2 0 2 the devices are 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.079
 can be extremely powerful 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.299
 galaxy s 45 to six times preloading galaxy 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.209
 load and load note 2 four to five times 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.739
 ipad 2 to 3 times full on the battery itself 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.160
 It takes about six hours to get there 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.510
 learn 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.040
 Furthermore , both devices can be used 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.780
 very good transport and also in 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.230
 every trouser pocket stowed as would 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.260
 you have two smartphones with you 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.549
 The expert for external batteries people that 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.959
 was my review i hope it has you 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.280
 I liked a little salt 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.109
 produce but it somehow has 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.519
 redound to get good insight I 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.739
 personally, I'm pretty sure of it 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.510
 use the device almost every day and 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.040
 I find that particularly helpful 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.090
 I'm traveling by car or 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.620
 just somewhere 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.060
 that is not home on the way that 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.650
 I do not always have cases with me 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.370
 I could spend a pretty long time then 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.629
 to survive 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.329
 though they would starve to death or die of thirst 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.010
 but main thing is mobile phone I have running 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.570
 you promised a quarter more to what 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.340
 I always try 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.320
 knock it out and this time it has 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.760
 worked again and here it comes to the 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.410
 winning play there you learn as you 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.330
 you can attend and here you come 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.250
 another review and in the video 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.720
 describes you all sounds and sounds 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.979
 we'll put it to you left and 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.300
 on the right you will find the whole social 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.470
 medias and directly below you can you 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.270
 subscribe to me for free with it 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.900
 no reviews missed so then 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.900
 people until then
