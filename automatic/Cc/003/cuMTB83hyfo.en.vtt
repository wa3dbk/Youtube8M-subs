00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
bit weird and philosophical oh yeah did

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.130 
bit weird and philosophical oh yeah did
at<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.150> point<00:02:15.510> see<00:02:15.930> if

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
at this point see if

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.710 
at this point see if
pheasants<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:17.520> field<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.300> tried<00:02:18.690> to

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
pheasants in this field so I tried to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.630 
pheasants in this field so I tried to
quickly<00:02:19.319> kayak<00:02:19.890> across<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.490> edge<00:02:20.610> here

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
quickly kayak across to the edge here

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.790 
quickly kayak across to the edge here
see<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.660> how<00:02:21.780> shallow<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.350> at<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.650> end

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
see just how shallow it is at the end

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.040 
see just how shallow it is at the end
there<00:02:23.069> but<00:02:23.550> unfortunately<00:02:24.360> by<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.600> time<00:02:24.750> I've

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
there but unfortunately by the time I've

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.900 
there but unfortunately by the time I've
actually<00:02:25.200> scrambled<00:02:26.100> up<00:02:26.160> on<00:02:26.370> through<00:02:26.550> here<00:02:26.670> if

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
actually scrambled up on through here if

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.960 
actually scrambled up on through here if
you<00:02:27.390> see<00:02:27.660> in<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.900> next<00:02:28.050> shot<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.880> pheasant

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
you see in the next shot the pheasant

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.580 
you see in the next shot the pheasant
I've<00:02:30.060> managed<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.420> make<00:02:30.510> his<00:02:30.750> way<00:02:30.780> he's<00:02:31.319> right

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
I've managed to make his way he's right

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.020 
I've managed to make his way he's right
by<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.830> fence<00:02:32.160> they're<00:02:32.459> just<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.910> the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
by the fence they're just in the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.150 
by the fence they're just in the
distance<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:33.990> that<00:02:34.290> was<00:02:34.500> not<00:02:34.709> my<00:02:34.860> greatest

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
distance so that was not my greatest

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.190

a<00:02:37.770> video<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.180> tried<00:02:39.720> at<00:02:39.930> least<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.920> moving

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
a video but I tried at least so moving

this<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.690> as<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.050> say<00:02:43.260> just<00:02:43.760> everything<00:02:44.760> that

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
this is as I say just everything that

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.660 
this is as I say just everything that
the<00:02:45.600> sort<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:45.959> canal<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.500> stereotypical<00:02:47.430> and

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
the sort of canal is stereotypical and

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.449 
the sort of canal is stereotypical and
known<00:02:48.180> for<00:02:48.590> especially<00:02:49.590> when<00:02:49.860> you're<00:02:50.070> under<00:02:50.130> a

known for especially when you're under a
sky<00:02:50.760> like<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.540> with<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.810> Sun<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.380> the

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
sky like this and with the Sun and the

sky like this and with the Sun and the
tiny<00:02:53.280> bit<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.730> breeze<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.239> there<00:02:54.360> was<00:02:54.510> behind

tiny bit of breeze that there was behind

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.350 
tiny bit of breeze that there was behind
you<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.100> made<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.610> even<00:02:56.730> easier<00:02:57.030> to

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
you so that it made it even easier to

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.210 
you so that it made it even easier to

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.199 
upon a time in years to come I would be
kayaking<00:03:31.110> under<00:03:31.829> that<00:03:31.950> bridge<00:03:32.220> down<00:03:32.820> to<00:03:33.060> my

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
kayaking under that bridge down to my

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.390 
kayaking under that bridge down to my
little<00:03:33.480> boat<00:03:33.660> just<00:03:34.079> around<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.560> corner<00:03:34.950> that

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
little boat just around the corner that

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.000 
little boat just around the corner that
I<00:03:35.519> like<00:03:35.850> we<00:03:36.060> excite<00:03:36.420> again<00:03:37.010> fascinations

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
I like we excite again fascinations

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.060 
I like we excite again fascinations
anyway<00:03:38.670> this<00:03:39.090> video<00:03:39.360> is<00:03:39.870> quite<00:03:40.530> an<00:03:40.739> odd<00:03:40.860> one

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
anyway this video is quite an odd one

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.220 
anyway this video is quite an odd one
really<00:03:41.549> because<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.180> wasn't<00:03:42.570> intending<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.200> to

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
really because I wasn't intending it to

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.789 
really because I wasn't intending it to
be<00:03:43.470> longer<00:03:44.100> than<00:03:44.310> about<00:03:44.730> either<00:03:45.180> say<00:03:45.799> probably

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
be longer than about either say probably

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.160 
be longer than about either say probably
three<00:03:47.220> minutes<00:03:47.579> or<00:03:47.730> so<00:03:47.970> but<00:03:48.570> in<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.049> very

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
three minutes or so but in the very

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.990 
three minutes or so but in the very
short<00:03:49.560> distance<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.100> we've<00:03:50.370> carry<00:03:50.670> active

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
short distance that we've carry active

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.270 
short distance that we've carry active
which<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.209> literally<00:03:51.870> maybe<00:03:52.230> 10<00:03:52.980> minutes

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
which is literally maybe 10 minutes

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.979 
which is literally maybe 10 minutes
walking<00:03:53.579> maybe<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.239> know<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.390> few<00:03:54.750> more

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
walking maybe you know a few more

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.020 
walking maybe you know a few more
minutes<00:03:55.320> than<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:55.799> not<00:03:56.280> very<00:03:56.549> much<00:03:56.820> at

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
minutes than that but not very much at

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.080 
minutes than that but not very much at
all<00:03:57.209> but<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:58.170> ended<00:03:58.650> up<00:03:58.739> with<00:03:58.980> 18<00:03:59.459> minutes<00:03:59.730> of

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
all but I ended up with 18 minutes of

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.690 
all but I ended up with 18 minutes of
footage<00:04:00.329> from<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.900> tiny<00:04:01.230> trip<00:04:01.650> because<00:04:02.340> just

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
footage from that tiny trip because just

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.030 
footage from that tiny trip because just
everything<00:04:03.420> was<00:04:03.930> perfect<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.650> there's<00:04:04.829> so

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
everything was perfect and there's so

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.440 
everything was perfect and there's so
many<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.459> these<00:04:05.549> little<00:04:05.910> moments<00:04:06.060> of

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
many of these little moments of

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.840 
many of these little moments of
perfectly<00:04:07.230> framed<00:04:07.560> shots<00:04:07.980> of<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.370> canal<00:04:08.670> but

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850
