00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 not enough on the battles you can not buy 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.480
 imagine counter-strike go steam again 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.370
 picks up the last money 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.800
 there is a store games bank dot ru 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.019
 with chic prices link in description 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.670
 hello gangsters with you panda for your 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.760
 multiple requests rampagi will be 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.619
 come out more often and start this release 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.750
 venomancer top hero on the very fact 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.340
 I didn't understand a little bit why 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.380
 wards are not pumped by this guy on 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.470
 visually knows some say 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.160
 I do not want to see wards but this guy 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.320
 apparently wants to collect a nigga so 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.840
 ignores wards but I don't know for one 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.700
 once a ward to pump who is always worth it 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.129
 gives useful swept but this is mine 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.780
 old man's say so much grumbling 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.510
 in time, the master makes four wines 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.719
 kilo in a row and and shine paris and sit on 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.699
 not a terrible target for the evil viper 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.210
 the media and but still death overtakes him 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.780
 ska time we are another sound of young heroes 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.219
 let's see how it will look 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.150
 worth far from kneading all right 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.360
 it is not necessary to meddle in time gives ulta and 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.520
 reliably starts a fight 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.380
 storm spirit lutuet Oscar will master 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.090
 quietly on the principle of crystal 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.119
 guns that hides behind puts 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.159
 mad damage quietly spurring 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.350
 his team but he also tries 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.869
 kill opponents apparently storm no 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.250
 mana himself so leads 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.720
 dropping looking at is still there and the most 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.729
 the main thing is the soul ring which in case 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.610
 what will help whom she recover so 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.890
 that the chances of the storm is not very much and he 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.070
 in general, nobody goes anywhere at all 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.829
 does not go away but remains quite a bit 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.829
 quite a bit and rampaga already in your pocket 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.159
 our next hero or top 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.780
 character definitely again i dont 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.530
 I understand why there has never been pumped 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.270
 third skill 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.850
 Well, I do not know how I can probably play lina but 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.619
 nevertheless, the heroes are mad 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.009
 Demage and I think that you have suffered more than once 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.350
 from lina and in the opposing team will 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.049
 the evil zombies just go nowhere 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.119
 help or manage to blow epc 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.399
 shaker and he becomes the third frag 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.929
 and the sweet collection opens from 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.280
 battles in principle there is still lasso 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.959
 opportunity to fight but again I don't 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.410
 I understand why the third skill appears in 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.600
 her only 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.220
 now they can kill for that 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.610
 bounty hunter asked for himself as 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.200
 a viper who is not very far gone 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.630
 more that salov catch or on of course 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.040
 risks now but for rampagi 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.600
 indeed it was well worth it 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.900
 exchange ling with might and main to command of course 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.490
 very cool incredibly cool mipo 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.020
 quite a while this character was not one 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.340
 time we did not take a ramp speaker and themes 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.530
 no less would discrimination not take 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.350
 them now the more this rampag done 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.230
 fast fun and enough 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.790
 provocatively four in a row and wait 5 which 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.470
 resorts himself of course this is a shaker 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.450
 sworn enemy mipo and especially nice 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.640
 that mipo is his now and destroy 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.860
 as you already understood funny rampaga 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.420
 really and most importantly quickly doing 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.000
 almost all of us rampagi by enough 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.510
 fast but really a long time ago we 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.260
 they were not taken 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.500
 it was a principled position that 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.280
 Juggernaut and moms continue 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.330
 for a while it was right 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.310
 classic sharpness 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.080
 everyone was doing jagernaut with mom now 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.280
 thank god jagernaut began to pick 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.780
 less evidence of this and 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.310
 statistics are generally so personal 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.140
 watching the game 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.150
 but no less a hero is still hot 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.420
 good and especially if in the beginning of his time 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.730
 see then the guy can give it all 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.970
 head I do not know why there is not Peter 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.700
 could kill jaggernut but i think they 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.890
 just cancer I have a very strong feeling 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.420
 that they are just stupid rocho 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.010
 scary here this character which I always 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.190
 respected really powerful strong 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.790
 underestimated certainly arriving only 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.470
 apparatus unpleasant yes but nonetheless 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.830
 fight under the board scared it is 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.840
 Especially for casters yes it flies well 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.880
 Magnus is here but again you can live 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.160
 shut down and suck all life out of it 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.260
 forces in the meantime and the first skill scares 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.410
 great rampaga that's sweet 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:06.860
 really true hero die too 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:09.390
 but the rampag is made mentally fuzzy 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.260
 leshrac 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.320
 enigma under bkb sky castes worth 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:20.370
 only the mono crustacean runs 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.989
 opportunity to fight now sunbeds 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.060
 a lot has become a lot 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.190
 leshrak 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.600
 worthy hero doesn't annoy me like 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.010
 every troller sniper so let 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.580
 Better on the loungers playing honestly 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.700
 than we Lark bozhesh're my okay 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.190
 next we have a hero whose portrait 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.950
 It does not reflect this screeching masthead 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.980
 character in all respects and most importantly 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.010
 deals good damage to its second 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.440
 ability and can catch up and get 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.200
 even vicious soup is such a daisy on 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.260
 visp cool but not the first 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.280
 filthy special issue as you noticed here 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.810
 unhealthy love for this character and on 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.190
 spawn especially often falls rampagi 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.950
 only good ulta release but sewn cheat 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.540
 the guarantee of victory is all the more when the team 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.100
 made it possible to collect all the enemies in 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.020
 one heap for 1 party on one 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.180
 party and ulta lich respectively 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.310
 just so here we expose parses 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.200
 four but little dead visp 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.570
 is a terrible obstacle to 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.040
 getting a rampagi on your shoulder really not 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.960
 I understand this team that ran to 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:26.790
 to settle why to lay rampagus from larvae 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.070
 makes it weird ok guys thanks 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.140
 for watching 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.760
 ramps will now go out more often in 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.830
 head we will not let out what 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.360
 they are kind of muddy come boring but 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.330
 you can send your rampag dmitry 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.430
 on the link in the description write to him as you 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.930
 love him write the number of the match and 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.310
 actually write the time in which 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.870
 made rampag and than your rampag 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.850
 I wonder who the hero like her at all 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.160
 why should get into release 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.289
 what is different from others thanks for 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.120
 view subscribe to the channel and 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:01.910
 You see so much more interesting and 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.910
 also a lot of cool frames
