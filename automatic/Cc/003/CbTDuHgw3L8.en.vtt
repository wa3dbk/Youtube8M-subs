work with tiny subtle nuance stuff did
you<00:01:06.620> have<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:06.860> train<00:01:07.310> as<00:01:07.550> an<00:01:07.700> astronaut<00:01:08.120> no<00:01:08.690> I

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
you have to train as an astronaut no I

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.560 
you have to train as an astronaut no I
mean<00:01:09.140> you<00:01:09.230> can't<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:09.860> mean<00:01:10.760> how<00:01:10.940> how<00:01:11.330> do<00:01:11.390> you

astronauts asked bizarre things I mean I

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.720 
astronauts asked bizarre things I mean I
just<00:01:17.990> wanted<00:01:18.260> to<00:01:18.290> know<00:01:18.470> physically<00:01:19.310> what<00:01:19.610> we

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
just wanted to know physically what we

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.760 
just wanted to know physically what we
are<00:01:19.820> limitations<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:20.720> once<00:01:21.260> you<00:01:21.410> realize

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
are limitations and once you realize

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.430 
are limitations and once you realize
that<00:01:22.100> when<00:01:22.970> your<00:01:23.090> body<00:01:23.300> pushes<00:01:23.900> off<00:01:24.050> something

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
that when your body pushes off something

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.080 
that when your body pushes off something
in<00:01:24.530> gravity<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:25.130> doesn't<00:01:25.610> do<00:01:25.700> what<00:01:25.820> it<00:01:25.940> goes

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
in gravity it doesn't do what it goes

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.280 
in gravity it doesn't do what it goes
down<00:01:26.240> on<00:01:26.420> here<00:01:26.630> on<00:01:26.690> earth<00:01:26.810> when<00:01:27.050> you<00:01:27.140> hit

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
down on here on earth when you hit

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.990 
down on here on earth when you hit
something<00:01:27.590> like<00:01:27.860> what<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:28.580> you<00:01:28.670> had<00:01:28.850> to

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
something like what so you had to

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.380 
something like what so you had to
retrain<00:01:29.420> your<00:01:29.600> body<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:30.830> react<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.640> work<00:01:31.910> in<00:01:32.210> a

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
retrain your body to react and work in a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.550 
retrain your body to react and work in a
natural<00:01:32.630> way<00:01:32.870> that<00:01:33.230> was<00:01:33.320> completely

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
natural way that was completely

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.430 
natural way that was completely
unnatural<00:01:34.190> to<00:01:34.970> what<00:01:35.150> you<00:01:35.270> know<00:01:35.420> being<00:01:36.230> here<00:01:36.410> on

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
unnatural to what you know being here on

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.830 
unnatural to what you know being here on
earth<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:36.860> with<00:01:37.340> gravity<00:01:37.760> so<00:01:37.970> that<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.660> me<00:01:38.690> was

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
earth and with gravity so that to me was

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.080 
earth and with gravity so that to me was
the<00:01:39.110> most<00:01:39.290> important<00:01:39.800> part<00:01:40.010> the<00:01:40.730> emotional

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
the most important part the emotional

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.600 
the most important part the emotional
life<00:01:41.300> was<00:01:41.510> her<00:01:41.690> story<00:01:41.960> but<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:42.950> whole<00:01:43.100> how

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
life was her story but the whole how

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.160 
life was her story but the whole how
