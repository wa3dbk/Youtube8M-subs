00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
picking sides and you know there's not

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.870 
picking sides and you know there's not
religion<00:06:10.430> sort<00:06:10.760> of<00:06:12.190> pushing<00:06:13.190> a<00:06:13.310> diplomatic

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
religion sort of pushing a diplomatic

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.219 
religion sort of pushing a diplomatic
game<00:06:14.030> anymore<00:06:14.300> like<00:06:14.630> influence<00:06:15.080> and

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:16.990 
game anymore like influence and
diplomacy<00:06:15.680> so<00:06:15.860> much<00:06:16.040> but<00:06:16.520> I<00:06:16.550> think<00:06:16.790> that's<00:06:16.910> a

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
diplomacy so much but I think that's a

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.270 
diplomacy so much but I think that's a
good<00:06:17.120> thing<00:06:17.180> yeah<00:06:18.020> I<00:06:18.290> don't<00:06:18.500> know<00:06:18.680> it<00:06:19.220> was

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
good thing yeah I don't know it was

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.920 
good thing yeah I don't know it was
great<00:06:19.790> that<00:06:19.820> it<00:06:20.090> generated<00:06:20.450> so<00:06:20.600> much<00:06:20.660> tension

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
great that it generated so much tension

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.360 
great that it generated so much tension
but<00:06:21.169> the<00:06:21.260> problem<00:06:21.530> is<00:06:21.590> it<00:06:21.860> created<00:06:22.250> these

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
but the problem is it created these

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.050 
but the problem is it created these
crazy<00:06:22.729> blocks<00:06:23.210> so<00:06:23.720> early<00:06:24.080> and<00:06:24.820> you<00:06:25.820> didn't

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
crazy blocks so early and you didn't

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.210 
crazy blocks so early and you didn't
really<00:06:26.120> have<00:06:26.330> much<00:06:26.360> in<00:06:26.660> a<00:06:26.720> way<00:06:26.840> of<00:06:26.960> an<00:06:27.890> option

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
really have much in a way of an option

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.040 
really have much in a way of an option
of<00:06:28.280> picking<00:06:28.460> sides<00:06:28.790> other<00:06:29.330> than<00:06:29.660> switching

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
of picking sides other than switching

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.870 
of picking sides other than switching
religions<00:06:30.620> it<00:06:30.770> was<00:06:30.860> just<00:06:31.010> too<00:06:31.340> dominant

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
religions it was just too dominant

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.240 
religions it was just too dominant
religiously<00:06:32.360> speaking<00:06:32.830> or<00:06:33.830> diploma

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
religiously speaking or diploma

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.920 
religiously speaking or diploma
diplomatically<00:06:35.060> speaking<00:06:35.450> so<00:06:35.600> maybe<00:06:35.780> it

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
diplomatically speaking so maybe it

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.080 
diplomatically speaking so maybe it
should<00:06:36.110> have<00:06:36.200> had<00:06:37.130> less<00:06:37.370> of<00:06:37.490> an<00:06:37.550> effect<00:06:37.640> may<00:06:38.030> be

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
should have had less of an effect may be

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.300 
should have had less of an effect may be
half<00:06:38.360> as<00:06:38.539> much<00:06:38.720> I<00:06:38.990> don't<00:06:39.979> know<00:06:40.039> but<00:06:40.220> now

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
half as much I don't know but now

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.800 
half as much I don't know but now
there's<00:06:40.520> no<00:06:40.610> diplomacy<00:06:41.060> but

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
there's no diplomacy but

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.950
