00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
 not 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.710
 video now 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.870
 to prepare our espresso 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.629
 we check the filter holder key 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.940
 nabiha drops of water moisture or whatever you read them first and let's go to 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.580
 put two doses of coffee 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.659
 I recommend every time to stop hanging 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:24.080
 dose then every beat 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.170
 zara composed of 7 8 grams of ground coffee we go to level it so 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.840
 to take it perfectly level and we go with the manual press ad 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.840
 apply a pressure of about 12 kilograms 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.750
 we now have to disconnect 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.790
 the filter holder we take the cups I always recommend from the handle 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.630
 let's go to deliver let's remember 25 millimeters in 25 seconds from when 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.999
 we press button with a water temperature - 88 and 90 degrees 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.059
 and a pump pressure b9 atmospheres 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.920
 we see that the coffee must come down in a rat's tail in order to get to 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.770
 fill up 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.960
 what 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.450
 the correct quantity of the cup 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.680
 the coffee has dropped in about 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.850
 18 seconds this means that the grinding was not 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.950
 correct then we go to slightly tighten a pair of heels and the 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.950
 our grinder-doser is what we bring 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.140
 juxtaposition we eliminate 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.830
 this coffee we had inside with the ground coffee with the saturated letter 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.040
 adriana sklenarikova 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.040
 I want to go to school 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.160
 we have just made therefore transparent colored grinding not perfect 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.120
 well we are going to eliminate the residues I always recommend brushing 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.040
 the filter holder and when we go to beat it is not enough on metal but to beat 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.080
 correctly on the wood of the beat funds 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.580
 redo 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.040
 the dose 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.040
 reveal 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.849
 pressure 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.069
 expressed 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.059
 and now here is yours 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:57.270
 perfect coffee 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.779
 obviously cost 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.309
 we saw it now as the bartender's hand 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:05.779
 two perfect expressions can be made graziano domicella but the same identical 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:06.629
 by hand 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.810
 with an eye to mixture, unfortunately, can be used to express 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.369
 far from good we go to see two typical examples of expressed ahahah 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:20.339
 badly. first you do not clean the filter holder you do not check if the dose 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:21.870
 correct or not 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.680
 for example the grinding was pits 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.850
 too big 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.080
 and we are going to make an espresso that is technically called 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.780
 underlay therefore swimming with a vanishing essence essence the features 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.109
 of good Italian espresso 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.269
 here we are going to serve an espresso of this type 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.890
 you see in this case we have a coffee that practically has almost no cream on 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.359
 laundry and does not look good 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.009
 let's see if instead 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:55.309
 the coffee 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:58.699
 typically only on the right 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.339
 in this case 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.679
 the reason for the above and station 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:04.979
 it might be 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:09.909
 different and opposite to that of the first or rather dose of excessive coffee 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.109
 omaha still wobbles too fine or even machine with temperature 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.269
 too high and therefore heat the coffee just going to 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.980
 make an oversteer of the coffee also 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.980
 in quantity of liquid 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.840
 and here is another example of how coffee should not be served 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.350
 an over coffee with a persistent dark cream and like 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.850
 you can see with the classic speck called white button 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.850
 present on the coffee typical sign of administration 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:44.219
 if you followed all the rules 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:48.560
 in this way you will get a perfect espresso to serve our customer 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.980
 which will present itself 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.900
 with a nice room temperature the hazelnut cream 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.550
 compact and persistent that does not open 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.090
 not even turning the task and I highly recommend summer kitchen gym hands 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.570
 taxes on the car always twice 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.099
 with the opening of Saturday so by grandmother 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.700
 pustiana re your customer's lips 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.099
 and so here you go 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:11.210
 great posted
