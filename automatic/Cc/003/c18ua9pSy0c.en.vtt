00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
not on them so it's not that big of a

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.280 
not on them so it's not that big of a
deal

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
deal

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.670 
deal
oh<00:02:54.349> my<00:02:55.129> like<00:02:56.120> type<00:02:56.329> a<00:02:56.540> man<00:02:56.780> don't<00:02:57.140> leer<00:02:57.290> it's

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
cars on the left-hand side of the road

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.610 
cars on the left-hand side of the road
you<00:03:36.659> know<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.840> can<00:03:36.959> barely<00:03:37.110> make<00:03:37.319> them<00:03:37.470> out

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
you know you can barely make them out

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.490 
you know you can barely make them out
because<00:03:37.769> you're<00:03:38.069> blinded<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.989> those<00:03:40.230> cars

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
because you're blinded and those cars

they can see perfectly well in front in
this<00:03:42.180> direction<00:03:42.480> so<00:03:42.810> they<00:03:42.900> think<00:03:42.959> why<00:03:43.230> should

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
this direction so they think why should

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:44.869 
this direction so they think why should
i<00:03:43.440> have<00:03:43.500> my<00:03:43.620> headlight<00:03:43.890> on<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.610> answer<00:03:44.849> of

i have my headlight on and the answer of
