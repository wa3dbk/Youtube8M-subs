trying to keep certain aspects in focus
now<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.399> keep<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.180> majority<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.780> the

now I like to keep the majority of the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.400 
now I like to keep the majority of the
face<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.500> focus<00:00:46.969> and<00:00:47.969> unless<00:00:48.600> I'm<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:49.199> for

face and focus and unless I'm going for

a certain angle in which a little bit of

a certain angle in which a little bit of
fall-off<00:00:52.109> blur<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.980> okay<00:00:53.429> and<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:54.179> can<00:00:54.359> do

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
fall-off blur is okay and you can do

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.439 
fall-off blur is okay and you can do
that<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.350> your<00:00:55.500> camera<00:00:55.920> settings<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.879> my

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
that all with your camera settings so my

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.150 
that all with your camera settings so my
standard<00:00:57.839> settings<00:00:58.500> when<00:00:58.710> shooting<00:00:58.920> a

standard settings when shooting a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.939 
standard settings when shooting a

and<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.999> try<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.269> stay<00:01:03.600> somewhere<00:01:03.960> between<00:01:04.400> f5

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
and I try to stay somewhere between f5

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.760 
and I try to stay somewhere between f5
point<00:01:05.730> four<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.330> eight<00:01:06.870> somewhere<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.740> that

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
point four and eight somewhere in that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.760 
point four and eight somewhere in that
range<00:01:08.360> for<00:01:09.360> my<00:01:09.540> aperture<00:01:10.050> I<00:01:10.260> don't

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
range for my aperture I don't

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.670 
range for my aperture I don't
necessarily<00:01:10.950> mind<00:01:11.700> if<00:01:11.940> I<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.390> go<00:01:12.680> higher

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
necessarily mind if I have to go higher

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.010 
necessarily mind if I have to go higher
on<00:01:13.950> my<00:01:13.980> aperture<00:01:14.460> number<00:01:14.670> like<00:01:15.300> a<00:01:15.330> nine<00:01:15.720> or<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
on my aperture number like a nine or a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.770 
on my aperture number like a nine or a
ten<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> try<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> keep<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> down<00:01:18.240> because<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
ten but I try to keep it down because I

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.420 
ten but I try to keep it down because I
like<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.350> keep<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.650> little<00:01:19.800> bit<00:01:20.010> of<00:01:20.100> depth<00:01:20.310> of

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
like to keep a little bit of depth of

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.030 
like to keep a little bit of depth of
field<00:01:20.700> if<00:01:21.240> I'm<00:01:21.540> shooting<00:01:21.780> outdoors<00:01:22.410> depth<00:01:22.890> of

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
field if I'm shooting outdoors depth of

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.160 
field if I'm shooting outdoors depth of
field<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.460> important<00:01:23.940> to<00:01:24.060> me<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.780> like

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
field is important to me because I like

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.960 
field is important to me because I like
the<00:01:25.440> background<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> little<00:01:26.670> bit<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.910> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the background to have a little bit of a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.390 
the background to have a little bit of a
blur<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.680> when<00:01:28.680> I'm<00:01:28.800> shooting<00:01:29.010> like

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
blur to it when I'm shooting like

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.400 
blur to it when I'm shooting like
indoors<00:01:29.910> on<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.300> background<00:01:30.900> or<00:01:31.050> something

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
indoors on a background or something

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.010 
indoors on a background or something
like<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> solid<00:01:32.730> color<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.510> not<00:01:33.750> so

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
like that like a solid color it's not so

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.260 
like that like a solid color it's not so
important<00:01:34.620> to<00:01:34.800> have<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.610> depth<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.000> field

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
important to have that depth of field

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.750 
important to have that depth of field
because<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.230> only<00:01:37.470> depth<00:01:38.190> of<00:01:38.340> field<00:01:38.550> you're

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
because the only depth of field you're

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.210 
because the only depth of field you're
going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.150> see<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:40.140> person<00:01:40.470> from

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
going to see is on the person from

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.640 
going to see is on the person from
what's<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:42.030> focus<00:01:42.510> on<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.810> front<00:01:43.050> of<00:01:43.170> them<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
what's in focus on the front of them to

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.280 
what's in focus on the front of them to
what's<00:01:43.890> out<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.130> focus<00:01:44.520> more<00:01:45.300> so<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:45.870> you<00:01:46.140> go

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
what's out of focus more so as you go

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.210 
what's out of focus more so as you go
further<00:01:46.560> through<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.550> person<00:01:48.090> beyond<00:01:48.840> them

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
further through the person beyond them

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.940 
further through the person beyond them
so<00:01:50.690> typically<00:01:51.690> like<00:01:51.870> I<00:01:51.900> said<00:01:52.260> my<00:01:52.470> settings

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
so typically like I said my settings

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.690 
so typically like I said my settings
with<00:01:53.520> my<00:01:53.730> camera<00:01:54.240> are<00:01:54.420> 125th<00:01:55.430> sometimes<00:01:56.430> one

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
with my camera are 125th sometimes one

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.060 
with my camera are 125th sometimes one
sixtieth<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.990> fear<00:01:58.410> that<00:01:58.440> there's<00:01:58.830> going<00:01:59.010> to

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
sixtieth if I fear that there's going to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.980 
sixtieth if I fear that there's going to
be<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.220> little<00:01:59.460> bit<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.760> movement<00:01:59.940> I<00:02:00.330> will<00:02:00.750> try

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
be a little bit of movement I will try

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.410 
be a little bit of movement I will try
to<00:02:01.020> shoot<00:02:01.350> at<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:01.650> sixtieth<00:02:02.160> instead<00:02:02.700> because

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
to shoot at one sixtieth instead because

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.420 
to shoot at one sixtieth instead because
while<00:02:03.750> I'm<00:02:03.930> holding<00:02:04.170> my<00:02:04.500> camera<00:02:04.560> trying<00:02:05.310> to

while I'm holding my camera trying to

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.400

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
take that portrait if the person's

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.469 
take that portrait if the person's
moving<00:02:07.800> around<00:02:08.039> or<00:02:08.399> if<00:02:08.489> I'm<00:02:08.640> moving<00:02:08.849> around<00:02:09.239> a

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
moving around or if I'm moving around a

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.570 
moving around or if I'm moving around a
little<00:02:09.599> bit<00:02:09.899> or<00:02:10.259> if<00:02:10.319> I'm<00:02:10.590> unable<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> hold<00:02:11.400> my

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
little bit or if I'm unable to hold my

little bit or if I'm unable to hold my
camera<00:02:11.660> extremely<00:02:12.660> still<00:02:13.019> I<00:02:13.319> may<00:02:14.040> get<00:02:14.430> a

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
camera extremely still I may get a

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.820 
camera extremely still I may get a
little<00:02:14.849> bit<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.239> blurriness<00:02:15.629> out<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.080> 125th<00:02:16.680> of

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
little bit of blurriness out of 125th of

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.480 
little bit of blurriness out of 125th of
a<00:02:16.950> second<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.670> really<00:02:18.269> is<00:02:18.830> hard<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:20.040> tell<00:02:20.220> and

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
a second it really is hard to tell and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.000 
a second it really is hard to tell and
so<00:02:20.940> as<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> fail-safe<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:22.050> will<00:02:22.320> try<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.800> shoot

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
so as a fail-safe I will try and shoot

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.430 
so as a fail-safe I will try and shoot
at<00:02:23.190> one<00:02:23.340> sixtieth<00:02:23.880> if<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.720> can

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
at one sixtieth if I can

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.460 
at one sixtieth if I can
and<00:02:25.530> still<00:02:26.070> have<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.610> good<00:02:27.320> range<00:02:28.320> of

adjustment left in my aperture and now

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.040

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.199 
have a low f-stop or a wide aperture

which means a low f-stop number I may

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.759 
which means a low f-stop number I may
end<00:04:09.480> up<00:04:09.660> having<00:04:10.019> something<00:04:10.260> out<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.500> focus

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
end up having something out of focus

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.210 
end up having something out of focus

unless I have the time available and the

patience of the person for me to make
sure<00:04:16.260> that<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.709> focus<00:04:17.160> is<00:04:17.340> super<00:04:17.640> sharp<00:04:17.910> and

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
sure that that focus is super sharp and

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.509 
sure that that focus is super sharp and
on<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> little<00:04:19.049> tiny<00:04:19.320> screen<00:04:19.799> on<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.130> back<00:04:20.250> your

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
on a little tiny screen on the back your

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.120 
on a little tiny screen on the back your
camera<00:04:21.000> sometimes<00:04:21.480> it's<00:04:21.690> hard<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.620> see<00:04:22.890> if

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
camera sometimes it's hard to see if

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.850 
camera sometimes it's hard to see if
something<00:04:23.550> is<00:04:23.640> in<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:24.720> focus<00:04:25.230> and<00:04:25.410> so<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.620> have

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
something is in in focus and so you have

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.400 
something is in in focus and so you have
to<00:04:26.040> zoom<00:04:26.280> in<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.760> look<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.480> see<00:04:27.720> if<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:28.200> item

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
to zoom in and look and see if that item

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.430 
to zoom in and look and see if that item
is<00:04:28.680> in<00:04:28.830> focus<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:30.180> this<00:04:30.419> all<00:04:30.600> takes<00:04:30.630> time<00:04:31.169> and

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
is in focus and this all takes time and

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.190 
is in focus and this all takes time and
if<00:04:32.100> you<00:04:32.220> don't<00:04:32.460> have<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.970> patience<00:04:33.419> of<00:04:33.630> your

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
if you don't have the patience of your

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.890 
if you don't have the patience of your
subject<00:04:34.740> then<00:04:35.310> it<00:04:35.490> becomes<00:04:35.850> kind<00:04:36.510> of<00:04:36.630> annoying

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
subject then it becomes kind of annoying

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.200 
subject then it becomes kind of annoying
to<00:04:37.169> that<00:04:37.320> person<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:38.729> you<00:04:38.970> want

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
to that person and you want

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.420 
to that person and you want
prevent<00:04:39.479> that<00:04:39.630> of<00:04:39.930> course<00:04:40.199> so<00:04:40.530> I<00:04:40.740> typically

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
prevent that of course so I typically

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.969 
prevent that of course so I typically
try<00:04:41.729> to<00:04:41.759> stay<00:04:42.060> within<00:04:42.270> those<00:04:42.509> ranges<00:04:42.780> now<00:04:43.620> if

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
try to stay within those ranges now if

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.100 
try to stay within those ranges now if
it's<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.310> real<00:04:44.520> low<00:04:44.759> light<00:04:45.030> situation<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.020> I'm

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
it's a real low light situation and I'm

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.920 
it's a real low light situation and I'm

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
try to make up with it make up for it

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.279 
try to make up with it make up for it
with<00:04:51.060> an<00:04:51.180> on-camera<00:04:51.569> flash<00:04:51.750> or<00:04:52.349> I<00:04:53.160> will<00:04:54.289> widen

my<00:04:55.319> aperture<00:04:56.039> you<00:04:56.400> know<00:04:56.520> go<00:04:56.729> to<00:04:56.789> a<00:04:56.910> lower

my aperture you know go to a lower

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
if I have to to get to get that

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.800 
if I have to to get to get that
additional<00:05:04.440> light<00:05:04.889> into<00:05:05.220> my<00:05:05.340> camera

additional light into my camera

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.999 
additional light into my camera
alternatively<00:05:06.810> you<00:05:06.990> can<00:05:07.139> also<00:05:07.259> increase<00:05:07.860> your

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
alternatively you can also increase your

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.460 
alternatively you can also increase your
ISO<00:05:08.340> as<00:05:08.940> long<00:05:09.449> as<00:05:09.569> you're<00:05:09.690> not<00:05:09.840> increasing<00:05:10.259> it

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
ISO as long as you're not increasing it

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.010 
ISO as long as you're not increasing it
so<00:05:10.680> much<00:05:10.860> that<00:05:11.099> you<00:05:11.220> end<00:05:11.250> up<00:05:11.520> getting

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
so much that you end up getting

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.870 
so much that you end up getting
graininess<00:05:13.020> because<00:05:13.590> graininess<00:05:14.490> on<00:05:14.849> a

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
graininess because graininess on a

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.779 
graininess because graininess on a
person's<00:05:15.449> face<00:05:15.949> the<00:05:16.949> only<00:05:17.070> way<00:05:17.280> to<00:05:17.340> get<00:05:17.550> rid<00:05:17.669> of

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
person's face the only way to get rid of

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.430 
person's face the only way to get rid of
that<00:05:17.910> in<00:05:18.000> post-production<00:05:18.720> is<00:05:18.870> to<00:05:19.020> smooth<00:05:19.320> it

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
that in post-production is to smooth it

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.140 
that in post-production is to smooth it
out<00:05:19.560> and<00:05:19.830> then<00:05:20.370> you're<00:05:20.490> starting<00:05:20.880> to<00:05:21.000> lose

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
out and then you're starting to lose

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.689 
out and then you're starting to lose
detail<00:05:21.720> in<00:05:21.990> their<00:05:22.139> skin<00:05:22.530> and<00:05:22.710> all<00:05:23.190> that<00:05:23.400> stuff

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
detail in their skin and all that stuff

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.659 
detail in their skin and all that stuff
so<00:05:23.759> you<00:05:24.539> want<00:05:24.750> to<00:05:24.840> avoid<00:05:25.259> you<00:05:26.039> know<00:05:26.070> having<00:05:26.550> to

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
so you want to avoid you know having to

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.990 
so you want to avoid you know having to
make<00:05:26.849> up<00:05:27.030> for<00:05:27.270> things<00:05:27.479> in<00:05:27.810> ISO<00:05:28.759> you<00:05:29.759> know<00:05:29.880> as

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
make up for things in ISO you know as

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.810 
make up for things in ISO you know as
much<00:05:30.150> as<00:05:30.210> possible<00:05:30.389> so<00:05:31.250> there's<00:05:32.250> obviously

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
much as possible so there's obviously

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.570 
much as possible so there's obviously
some<00:05:33.090> challenges<00:05:33.630> there<00:05:33.659> either<00:05:34.110> way<00:05:34.580> but

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
some challenges there either way but

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.149 
some challenges there either way but
with<00:05:35.820> portraits<00:05:36.349> hopefully<00:05:37.349> you<00:05:37.470> have<00:05:37.680> kind

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.159 
with portraits hopefully you have kind

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:40.279 
with portraits hopefully you have kind
of<00:05:38.280> a<00:05:38.370> controlled<00:05:38.819> situation<00:05:39.050> you're<00:05:40.050> either

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
of a controlled situation you're either

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.110 
of a controlled situation you're either
indoors<00:05:40.770> and<00:05:41.130> you<00:05:41.190> have<00:05:41.370> some<00:05:41.639> lights<00:05:41.880> that

indoors and you have some lights that

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.879 
indoors and you have some lights that
you<00:05:42.240> could<00:05:42.389> point<00:05:42.599> at<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.840> person<00:05:42.960> or<00:05:43.409> you're

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
you could point at the person or you're

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.920 
you could point at the person or you're
outdoors<00:05:44.070> and<00:05:44.669> you<00:05:44.699> have<00:05:44.909> relatively<00:05:45.599> decent
