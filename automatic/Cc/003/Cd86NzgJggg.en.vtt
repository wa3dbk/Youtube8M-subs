we<00:00:54.820> discovered<00:00:55.510> in<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:56.350> in<00:00:56.530> map<00:00:57.160> tutorial<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
we discovered in the in map tutorial and

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.639 
we discovered in the in map tutorial and
if<00:00:59.860> you<00:01:00.010> haven't<00:01:00.220> seen<00:01:01.180> how<00:01:01.420> I<00:01:01.449> arrived<00:01:01.870> to

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
if you haven't seen how I arrived to

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.889 
if you haven't seen how I arrived to
finding<00:01:03.370> this<00:01:03.460> exploit<00:01:03.909> then<00:01:04.149> you<00:01:04.239> can<00:01:04.420> do<00:01:04.629> so

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
finding this exploit then you can do so

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.850 
finding this exploit then you can do so
at<00:01:05.229> hacking<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:06.220> learn<00:01:06.430> calm<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.750> then<00:01:08.500> go<00:01:08.800> to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
at hacking to learn calm and then go to

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.420 
at hacking to learn calm and then go to
the<00:01:09.220> information<00:01:10.000> gathering<00:01:10.630> link<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.430> then

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
the information gathering link and then

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.550 
the information gathering link and then
there's<00:01:12.640> an<00:01:12.759> nmap<00:01:13.090> link<00:01:13.420> that<00:01:14.200> will<00:01:14.290> bring<00:01:14.440> you

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
there's an nmap link that will bring you

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.169 
there's an nmap link that will bring you
to<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.770> video<00:01:17.039> okay<00:01:18.039> so<00:01:18.070> now<00:01:18.520> all<00:01:18.729> on<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:19.000> same

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:25.230 
to the video okay so now all on the same
page<00:01:19.539> I<00:01:20.050> will<00:01:20.770> show<00:01:21.160> you<00:01:21.220> this<00:01:22.030> exploits<00:01:22.720> I<00:01:24.240> do

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
page I will show you this exploits I do

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.510 
page I will show you this exploits I do
know<00:01:25.509> it's<00:01:25.660> called<00:01:25.869> MSO<00:01:26.410> eight<00:01:26.619> zero<00:01:27.250> six

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
know it's called MSO eight zero six

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.529 
know it's called MSO eight zero six
seven<00:01:28.149> but<00:01:29.190> not<00:01:30.190> many<00:01:30.429> people<00:01:30.490> would<00:01:31.030> remember

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
seven but not many people would remember

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.870 
seven but not many people would remember
it<00:01:31.840> by<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.050> export<00:01:32.380> name<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:32.920> if<00:01:33.190> you<00:01:33.310> can't

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
it by the export name so if you can't

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.130 
it by the export name so if you can't
remember<00:01:34.060> it<00:01:34.179> off<00:01:34.300> and<00:01:34.509> you<00:01:34.630> could<00:01:34.780> just<00:01:34.960> do<00:01:35.110> a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
remember it off and you could just do a

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.980 
remember it off and you could just do a
search<00:01:35.470> for<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.119> for<00:01:37.119> SMB<00:01:37.539> as<00:01:37.659> you<00:01:37.750> know<00:01:37.869> it's

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
search for and for SMB as you know it's

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.690 
search for and for SMB as you know it's
an<00:01:38.050> SMB<00:01:38.319> exploit

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.859 

okay<00:01:46.299> and<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:48.280> can<00:01:48.430> see

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
okay and you can see

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.209 
okay and you can see
I<00:01:49.899> can<00:01:50.439> see<00:01:50.649> actually<00:01:51.100> it's<00:01:51.640> this<00:01:51.850> one<00:01:52.060> here

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
I can see actually it's this one here

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:58.859 
I can see actually it's this one here
just<00:01:54.539> exploit<00:01:55.539> winners<00:01:56.380> SP<00:01:56.880> MSO<00:01:57.880> eight<00:01:58.060> six

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
just exploit winners SP MSO eight six

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.069 
just exploit winners SP MSO eight six
seven<00:01:59.189> also<00:02:00.189> recognized<00:02:00.700> it<00:02:00.880> because<00:02:01.329> it's

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
seven also recognized it because it's

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.640 
seven also recognized it because it's
rate<00:02:02.289> is<00:02:02.500> great<00:02:04.289> which<00:02:05.289> means

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
rate is great which means

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.109 
rate is great which means
probably<00:02:07.220> pretty<00:02:07.760> reliable

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
probably pretty reliable

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.400 
probably pretty reliable
okay<00:02:09.690> so

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.160 

just<00:02:14.010> go<00:02:14.160> ahead<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.930> copy<00:02:15.930> that

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
just go ahead and copy that

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.240 
just go ahead and copy that
and<00:02:18.800> then<00:02:19.040> we<00:02:19.160> just<00:02:19.310> go<00:02:19.490> use

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.130 

and<00:02:24.610> then<00:02:24.820> the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.820 

field<00:02:31.850> magnifying<00:02:32.850> glass<00:02:33.150> as<00:02:33.540> well<00:02:33.720> just

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
field magnifying glass as well just

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.470 
field magnifying glass as well just
case<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.610> very<00:02:35.940> clear<00:02:36.210> when<00:02:36.390> it

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
case this is very clear when it

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:58.809 
case this is very clear when it
publishes

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.990 

okay<00:02:59.420> here<00:02:59.719> we<00:02:59.840> go<00:03:00.459> okay<00:03:01.459> so<00:03:01.670> we're<00:03:01.819> going<00:03:01.909> to

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
okay here we go okay so we're going to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.069 
okay here we go okay so we're going to
use<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:02.360> exploit<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.299> can<00:03:05.480> see<00:03:05.719> it's

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
use this exploit and you can see it's

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:15.089 
use this exploit and you can see it's
loaded<00:03:06.700> then<00:03:07.700> we<00:03:07.849> go<00:03:08.769> show<00:03:09.769> options

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.220 

and<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.610> can<00:03:15.790> see

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.910 

we<00:03:19.010> need<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.430> set<00:03:20.050> first<00:03:21.050> of<00:03:21.230> all<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.710> our

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
and then you can go shop shins again you

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:50.790 
and then you can go shop shins again you
can<00:03:41.720> see<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:42.670> it's<00:03:43.670> been<00:03:43.910> set<00:03:44.150> right<00:03:44.390> there

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.310 

it's<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.700> currently<00:03:52.030> set<00:03:52.270> to<00:03:52.320> automatic

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
it's a currently set to automatic

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.420 
it's a currently set to automatic
targeting<00:03:54.750> I've<00:03:55.750> read<00:03:56.200> somewhere<00:03:56.440> that<00:03:56.620> it

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
targeting I've read somewhere that it

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.630 
targeting I've read somewhere that it
can<00:03:57.700> be<00:03:57.850> a<00:03:57.880> problem<00:03:58.090> if

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.640 

if<00:04:02.090> you<00:04:02.240> do<00:04:02.420> use<00:04:02.630> automatic<00:04:03.050> targeting

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
if you do use automatic targeting

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.460 
if you do use automatic targeting
however<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:04.430> have<00:04:05.060> managed<00:04:05.420> to<00:04:05.510> achieve<00:04:06.050> this

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
however I have managed to achieve this

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.620 
however I have managed to achieve this
by<00:04:06.710> by<00:04:07.340> just<00:04:07.580> not<00:04:08.330> changing<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:09.640> so<00:04:10.640> all<00:04:10.790> it

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
by by just not changing that so all it

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.440 
by by just not changing that so all it
was<00:04:11.750> just<00:04:11.960> go<00:04:12.290> ahead<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:12.620> see<00:04:12.740> if<00:04:12.770> it<00:04:12.920> works<00:04:13.450> so

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
was just go ahead and see if it works so

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.880 
was just go ahead and see if it works so
next<00:04:14.630> what<00:04:14.810> we<00:04:14.870> have<00:04:14.960> to<00:04:15.050> do<00:04:15.170> is<00:04:15.410> just<00:04:15.680> type

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
next what we have to do is just type

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:22.820 
next what we have to do is just type
exploit

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.800 

and<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:24.120> can<00:04:24.270> see<00:04:24.479> that<00:04:25.169> is<00:04:25.319> triggered

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
and you can see that is triggered

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.690 
and you can see that is triggered
the<00:04:27.430> exploit<00:04:28.430> right<00:04:28.639> there<00:04:28.880> so<00:04:31.450> this<00:04:32.650> machine

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
the exploit right there so this machine

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.150 
the exploit right there so this machine
XP<00:04:34.700> machines<00:04:35.030> now<00:04:35.270> been<00:04:35.510> compromised<00:04:37.360> so<00:04:39.160> just

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
XP machines now been compromised so just

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.940 
XP machines now been compromised so just
say<00:04:40.700> some<00:04:41.169> some<00:04:42.169> stuff<00:04:42.440> that<00:04:42.530> we<00:04:42.620> can<00:04:42.650> do

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
say some some stuff that we can do

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.190 
say some some stuff that we can do
quickly<00:04:43.310> you've<00:04:44.030> got<00:04:44.180> little<00:04:44.510> types<00:04:44.870> this

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
quickly you've got little types this

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.020 
quickly you've got little types this
info<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.900> that<00:04:48.200> will<00:04:48.350> show<00:04:48.380> that<00:04:49.070> we've<00:04:49.280> we're

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
info and that will show that we've we're

another<00:04:56.060> cool<00:04:56.810> thing<00:04:57.140> that<00:04:57.170> we<00:04:57.350> can<00:04:57.560> also<00:04:57.710> do

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
another cool thing that we can also do

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.959 
another cool thing that we can also do
is<00:04:59.990> if<00:05:00.050> you<00:05:00.200> type<00:05:02.260> screenshot

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:05.969 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:08.779 

you<00:05:06.029> can<00:05:06.179> have<00:05:06.360> a<00:05:06.409> quick<00:05:07.409> look<00:05:07.769> at<00:05:08.009> what's<00:05:08.399> that

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
you can have a quick look at what's that

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:15.760 
you can have a quick look at what's that
person<00:05:09.149> is<00:05:09.269> up<00:05:09.389> to<00:05:10.489> zoom<00:05:11.489> out<00:05:11.610> for<00:05:11.819> this

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.510 

okay<00:05:16.430> and<00:05:17.259> there<00:05:18.259> you<00:05:18.319> go<00:05:18.470> that's<00:05:18.650> a<00:05:18.919> quick

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
okay and there you go that's a quick

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.700 
okay and there you go that's a quick
screenshot<00:05:19.910> of<00:05:20.360> our<00:05:21.520> XP<00:05:22.520> machine<00:05:22.819> right<00:05:23.000> there

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
screenshot of our XP machine right there

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.110 
screenshot of our XP machine right there
okay

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.050 

now<00:05:28.690> there<00:05:29.199> is<00:05:29.350> loads<00:05:29.949> of<00:05:30.220> things<00:05:30.370> you<00:05:30.639> can<00:05:30.850> do

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
now there is loads of things you can do

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.350 
now there is loads of things you can do
with<00:05:31.300> interpreter

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.050 

so<00:05:35.020> I<00:05:35.530> couldn't<00:05:36.280> really<00:05:36.370> cover<00:05:36.759> it<00:05:36.909> all<00:05:37.030> in

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
so I couldn't really cover it all in

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.309 
so I couldn't really cover it all in
this<00:05:37.330> video<00:05:37.629> so<00:05:37.780> I'll<00:05:37.870> probably<00:05:38.050> make<00:05:38.259> a

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 
this video so I'll probably make a

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:41.399 
this video so I'll probably make a
separate<00:05:38.800> interpretive<00:05:39.340> video<00:05:40.199> this<00:05:41.199> just

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
separate interpretive video this just

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:42.749 
separate interpretive video this just
shows<00:05:41.530> you<00:05:41.590> all<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:41.800> kind<00:05:42.370> of<00:05:42.460> cool<00:05:42.610> stuff

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 
shows you all the kind of cool stuff

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.450 
shows you all the kind of cool stuff
that<00:05:43.000> you<00:05:43.060> can<00:05:43.180> do<00:05:43.330> once<00:05:43.569> you<00:05:43.689> actually<00:05:43.840> have

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
that you can do once you actually have

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.089 
that you can do once you actually have
compromised<00:05:45.460> the<00:05:45.580> machine<00:05:46.740> so<00:05:47.740> there<00:05:47.889> you<00:05:47.949> go

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
compromised the machine so there you go

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.619 
compromised the machine so there you go
that's<00:05:48.370> the<00:05:49.169> Windows<00:05:50.169> XP<00:05:50.349> service<00:05:50.830> pack<00:05:50.979> to

that's the Windows XP service pack to

I hope you enjoyed it I enjoyed making

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:31.110 
I hope you enjoyed it I enjoyed making
it<00:05:57.779> so<00:05:58.819> Cheers<00:05:59.879> peace<00:06:00.330> out
