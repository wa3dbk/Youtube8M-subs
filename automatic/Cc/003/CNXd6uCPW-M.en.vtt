00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
but in this one I mean the tracks are so

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.110 
but in this one I mean the tracks are so
short<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.219> they're<00:00:32.309> all<00:00:32.399> random<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.000> you

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
short and they're all random so you

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.069 
short and they're all random so you
don't<00:00:33.270> know<00:00:33.360> what's<00:00:33.510> when<00:00:33.630> you're<00:00:33.719> gonna<00:00:33.809> get

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
but I mean the more you play it the more

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.540 
but I mean the more you play it the more
you're<00:00:36.870> gonna<00:00:37.050> recognize<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> tracks<00:00:38.190> mean<00:00:38.430> I

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
get to around 15 for it but the weird

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.939

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
complete one when it says rounds 15 the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.539 
complete one when it says rounds 15 the
top<00:01:07.680> left<00:01:07.890> corner<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.189> have<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.400> complete

top left corner you have to complete
that<00:01:08.970> round<00:01:09.270> after<00:01:09.630> because<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:11.070> think

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
that round after because you think

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.590 
that round after because you think
because<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> very<00:01:11.880> beginning<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.360> starts

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
because at the very beginning it starts

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.880 
because at the very beginning it starts
at<00:01:12.689> around<00:01:12.750> zero<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.380> beat<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.799> you

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
at around zero and you beat it and you

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.289 
at around zero and you beat it and you
get<00:01:14.070> one<00:01:14.250> round<00:01:14.490> say<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.880> would<00:01:15.000> think<00:01:15.119> you

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
get one round say you would think you

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.780 
get one round say you would think you
beat<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.960> beat<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:16.409> round<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> treatment

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
beat we beat one round and the treatment

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.749 
beat we beat one round and the treatment
you<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.150> past<00:01:18.420> level<00:01:18.689> 15<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.920> when

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
I was I said rounds 15 like that would

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.230 
I was I said rounds 15 like that would
be<00:01:23.100> how<00:01:23.220> many<00:01:23.369> rounds<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.700> complete<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.210> I

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
be how many rounds you complete so I

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.600 
be how many rounds you complete so I
figured<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.780> one<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.680> my<00:01:25.740> other<00:01:25.860> tries<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.369> got

in the fort I got to round 14 it's at 14

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.069 
in the fort I got to round 14 it's at 14

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
rounds which I beat and then I beat it I

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.420 
rounds which I beat and then I beat it I
got<00:01:31.530> excited<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.220> never<00:01:32.820> got<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.500> it

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
got excited and I never got it so is it

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.490 
got excited and I never got it so is it
you<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.119> get<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.420> round<00:01:36.720> 15<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.409> then

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
you have to get to round 15 and then

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.630 
you have to get to round 15 and then
beat<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.829> track<00:01:38.100> than<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.369> get<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
beat that track than to get the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.399 
beat that track than to get the
achievement<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.210> it'll<00:01:39.450> say<00:01:39.540> 16<00:01:40.020> rounds<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
achievement so it'll say 16 rounds the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.140 
achievement so it'll say 16 rounds the
top<00:01:40.470> left<00:01:40.829> corner<00:01:41.040> then<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.369> get<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.700> finally

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
top left corner then you get it finally

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.899 
top left corner then you get it finally

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
I'll start recording in this case I get

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.860 
I'll start recording in this case I get
the<00:02:30.989> achievement<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:32.519> so<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:33.060> ended<00:02:33.599> up

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
the achievement and so I ended up

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.420 
the achievement and so I ended up
getting<00:02:34.049> there<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.290> got<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.650> around<00:02:34.799> 15<00:02:35.190> see

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
getting there I got to around 15 see

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.190 
getting there I got to around 15 see
when<00:02:35.579> I<00:02:35.610> got<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:35.970> hear<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.209> thought<00:02:36.480> when<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:36.989> did

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
when I got to hear I thought when I did

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.809 
when I got to hear I thought when I did
it<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.410> other<00:02:37.440> time<00:02:37.890> because<00:02:38.400> I've<00:02:38.549> gotten

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
it the other time because I've gotten

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.339 
it the other time because I've gotten
around<00:02:38.970> 14<00:02:39.420> beat<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.750> before<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:40.049> thought<00:02:40.319> I

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
around 14 beat it before I thought I

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.809 
around 14 beat it before I thought I
would<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.769> got<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.040> achievement<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.579> never

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
would have got the achievement I never

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.520 
would have got the achievement I never
got<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:43.010> he<00:02:44.010> gets<00:02:44.190> around<00:02:44.340> 16<00:02:45.230> there<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.440> is

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
got it he gets around 16 there it is

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.750 
got it he gets around 16 there it is
ultimate<00:02:47.220> endurance<00:02:47.370> too<00:02:48.049> so<00:02:49.049> this<00:02:49.500> one<00:02:49.760> it's

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
ultimate endurance too so this one it's

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.220 
ultimate endurance too so this one it's
definitely<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.239> think<00:02:51.390> it's<00:02:51.599> harder<00:02:51.900> than<00:02:51.930> like

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
definitely I think it's harder than like

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.319 
definitely I think it's harder than like
the<00:02:52.380> extreme<00:02:52.799> tracks<00:02:53.459> like<00:02:53.790> achievement

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
the extreme tracks like achievement

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.210 
the extreme tracks like achievement
whatever<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.989> don't<00:02:55.620> remember<00:02:55.739> what<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.099> was

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
whatever I don't remember what it was

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.009 
whatever I don't remember what it was
but<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.819> probably<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.959> hardest

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
but this is probably the hardest

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.930 
but this is probably the hardest
achievement<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:58.860> think<00:02:58.920> it's<00:02:59.489> harder<00:02:59.730> than<00:02:59.760> the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
achievement I think it's harder than the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.050 
achievement I think it's harder than the
marathon<00:03:00.360> one<00:03:00.599> from<00:03:00.930> trials<00:03:01.379> a<00:03:01.470> GD<00:03:02.000> where<00:03:03.000> you

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
marathon one from trials a GD where you

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.640 
marathon one from trials a GD where you
had<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.209> like<00:03:03.450> complete<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.870> 20<00:03:04.109> tracks<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.620> a

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
had to like complete the 20 tracks and a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.099 
had to like complete the 20 tracks and a
tournament<00:03:05.100> without<00:03:05.370> falling<00:03:06.000> sound<00:03:06.569> so<00:03:06.870> hard

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109
