00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 and well my person on the move my great I know 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.770
 How are you waiting? 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.540
 well because also today we are in another 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.160
 tutorial of another ebook champion 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.260
 legens this time I bring you up 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.730
 and well let's start by explaining the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.019
 passive the skills you have to buy 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.700
 initially the first thing we're going to 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.580
 buy are the objects and breasts 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.680
 eating 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.040
 and good the passive decide 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.210
 is that when we attack with magic four 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.960
 attacks we gain some speed 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.540
 movement the q is the frisbee for 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.239
 precious life because we unlocked 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.850
 first it has quite a range and it is not 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.950
 a clip and that throws at us what 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:46.610
 let's go back just like that but 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.610
 it does not give you an enemy hit a little more 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.540
 no w is the river che you're going with that man 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.540
 river because he has to see say with the 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.620
 last chet river activates us 3 auto 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.330
 attacks that what they will do in the 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.430
 following 3 auto attacks is that 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.020
 we throw a subject and start shooting 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.360
 towards the next will be the hydra itself 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.860
 bouncing is worth a few times and 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.660
 you can active during the following 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.250
 three auto attacks and there is a filter the 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.390
 year of 50 percent it does not surprise that 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.670
 it's worth this cause 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.500
 If we have 300 after 50 percent 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.580
 of 300 dollars we will hit it with the river 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.280
 set 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.740
 it's pretty broken to place against 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.509
 very many lane like kylie is that 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.310
 we can stop about 280 weeks worth 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:32.550
 but we can stop the last one nor a 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.550
 alone but any champion the ultimate 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.240
 it gives us enough speed movement to 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.820
 us and everyone who is in this 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.860
 term circle that you see here and separately if 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.250
 we have the river activated when we are 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.250
 giving 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:58.430
 66 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:58.430
 you will see that when we have 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.520
 thanks to someone 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.450
 deactivated 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.450
 informative 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.020
 yes 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.030
 and then there is the collateral of people 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.030
 of carrie until the competitor 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.250
 and remember the guard 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.680
 and a cactus the game or any 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.680
 little thing of those save it because 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.190
 because this has no cost 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.810
 and on top of that, it is satisfied with reality 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.010
 and now I'm going to teach and I'll complete it 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.650
 and runes as spies 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.780
 and it is full of civil the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.519
 bloodthirsty boots see the candles 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.680
 it must be that the infinite the dancing and the 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.480
 Society words of guardian angel 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.250
 in this order others have to buy 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.319
 this is a great jul to serve as 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.970
 I always say we can not do dagger 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.980
 static like we do this because 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.470
 there is a magician who takes away a lot and many 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.799
 turns we want to remove everything is 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.799
 possible 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.840
 he was teaching the current year 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.840
 and that's it 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.520
 A) Yes 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.520
 remember that last in faith is to get 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.380
 you have to always be a little bit 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.780
 start a lot is an installation back and 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.730
 save the kings for when the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.180
 team is in a hurry or to start 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.209
 You can take both as now 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.970
 all at once therefore save as 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.180
 to say now that one escapes to 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.180
 behind 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.299
 the same 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.489
 receive always try to save it 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.019
 because as always you are going to kill the 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.830
 of carrey especially if it's a civil 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.750
 well, you win 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.520
 why 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.520
 imagine that you can remove it 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:22.520
 the twine is popularly popular 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.070
 masters and nothing these weapons that I dared 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.320
 get the DNA girls of life 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.090
 also how these were delivered 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.130
 they can go just for some karbi 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.350
 good to get I do not know but good always 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.450
 is the option for which is that it also 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.370
 can with critical and good especially 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.199
 armor penetration 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.199
 Well with these real 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.310

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.800
