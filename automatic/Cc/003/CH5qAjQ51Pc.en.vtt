00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.210 
cardigan and a cream one and I prefer
the<00:02:26.910> cream<00:02:27.209> for<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:28.470> know<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.739> fall<00:02:29.010> and

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
the cream for you know the fall and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.490 
the cream for you know the fall and
winter<00:02:29.370> time<00:02:29.519> but<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.329> think<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.810> white<00:02:31.049> goes

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.190 
winter time but I think the white goes
perfect<00:02:31.980> for<00:02:32.280> more<00:02:32.549> of<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.760> warmer<00:02:33.090> months
