00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
at the elf one that I find that I like

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.010 
at the elf one that I find that I like
these<00:02:22.319> pencils<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.980> lot<00:02:23.160> better<00:02:23.450> after<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.720> have

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
these pencils a lot better after I have

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.840 
these pencils a lot better after I have
sharpened<00:02:25.680> them<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.130> here<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.400> what<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.640> looks

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
sharpened them so here is what it looks

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.400 
sharpened them so here is what it looks
like<00:02:27.000> after<00:02:27.360> sharpening<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.110> with<00:02:28.260> that

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.199 
little sharpener so if you do own any of
these<00:02:30.989> ones<00:02:31.470> from<00:02:32.069> Physicians<00:02:32.640> Formula<00:02:32.730> if

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
these ones from Physicians Formula if

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.970 
these ones from Physicians Formula if
you<00:02:33.330> have<00:02:33.480> them<00:02:33.600> just<00:02:33.750> lying<00:02:34.020> around<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.830> your

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
you have them just lying around and your

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
makeup collection pop off the bottom

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.870 
makeup collection pop off the bottom
because<00:02:37.650> there's<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.160> sharpener<00:02:38.700> on<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
because there's a sharpener on the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.979 
because there's a sharpener on the
bottom<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.239> really<00:02:39.450> quickly<00:02:39.660> I'm<00:02:39.840> gonna

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
bottom so really quickly I'm gonna

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.780 
bottom so really quickly I'm gonna
mention<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.440> formula<00:02:40.950> these<00:02:41.430> are<00:02:41.610> the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
mention the formula these are the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.240 
mention the formula these are the
perfect<00:02:42.330> consistency<00:02:42.780> they're<00:02:43.380> not<00:02:43.530> too<00:02:43.769> dry

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
perfect consistency they're not too dry

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.570 
perfect consistency they're not too dry
they're<00:02:44.910> not<00:02:45.180> too<00:02:45.690> creamy<00:02:46.320> they<00:02:47.070> do<00:02:47.130> have<00:02:47.550> a

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
they're not too creamy they do have a

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.000 
they're not too creamy they do have a
nice<00:02:47.850> sort<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.420> smooth<00:02:48.900> texture<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:49.890> they

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
nice sort of smooth texture so they

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.150 
nice sort of smooth texture so they
glide<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:50.370> really<00:02:50.940> easily<00:02:52.130> unfortunately<00:02:53.130> I

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
glide on really easily unfortunately I

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160 
glide on really easily unfortunately I
don't<00:02:53.310> think<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:53.910> these<00:02:54.000> are<00:02:54.209> gonna<00:02:54.300> be<00:02:54.510> good

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
don't think that these are gonna be good

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.350 
don't think that these are gonna be good
