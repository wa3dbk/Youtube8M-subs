00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 good evening good morning or good 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.960
 noon depending on when you use this 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.230
 Battlefield 3 comments on the topic 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.000
 windows 10 see i want you today 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.219
 simply see my opinion too used 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.920
 explain a little bit why me 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.480
 upgrade or not from straight and 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.789
 I like the future of it 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.710
 a little bit you have to look that 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.990
 is not really a simple question 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.010
 I try that relatively well now 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.439
 get across 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.869
 in the background something bed 43 like me 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.820
 already said on lotter channels 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.739
 Rewinded because the beginning of a round 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.630
 is just a bit boring you can 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.960
 the gameplay and i would say catch 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.670
 We directly to the ten wants as well 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.430
 I got it out first in 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.890
 my laptop updated because I have the 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.289
 anyway rarely used reason now extra 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.230
 make virtual machine only -10 too 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.239
 Somehow I had too much work to test 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.640
 then, and that's why I said 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.680
 I pictured come laptop pictured there 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.090
 windows 7 rarely use on it 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.370
 can you give it a try if that 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.260
 Sport does not matter 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.049
 and I have to say I'm already on the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.840
 a side positively surprised but how 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.930
 maybe some people know 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.340
 I also have a gaming pc and it falls 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.640
 me the decision whether I am now 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.939
 should upgrade or not already relative 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.369
 severe 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.170
 I want to come almost every day or 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.439
 all second part of this message here you 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.290
 it can be update makes blablabla 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.390
 but i think this decision is 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.159
 pretty difficult I explain you 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.930
 later why, but before, I ask you 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.720
 First of all, who of you already had 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.409
 If you are logged out , you are satisfied or 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.390
 Not 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.189
 but now why is this decision 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.799
 very difficult I have windows 10 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.369
 already tested on my laptop that is 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.610
 simply because you never know if everything 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.369
 then still works as before 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.460
 I have here this computer so my 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.719
 I now use gaming pc since euro or 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.299
 I have to think for a moment 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.299
 For about three years, I think so 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.799
 I have never had anything new on the windows 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.009
 installed or something works 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.520
 just great everything I have with it 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.910
 never really serious problems 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.680
 and I just have to 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.890
 left that if I have windows 10 now 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.130
 do not upgrade any printer driver 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.390
 more works or any 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.190
 games stop working or 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.230
 any scores are gone or 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.110
 maybe even the whole system broken 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.450
 Of course, walking is really great 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.150
 unlikely that's what happens 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.250
 but never change a running system 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.300
 that's kind of my way of thinking about me 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.580
 would be interested 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.950
 can you understand that or not 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.650
 because windows 10 clearly has many good ones 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.720
 innovations but none of this innovation 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.400
 is so good now that I say so 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.860
 I really need that now 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.860
 I have to have windows 10 necessarily 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.980
 so that i can work this and that 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.880
 I can use my clear cortina 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.890
 nice and so on, it has something new 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.500
 off in the styles in cooler is yes too 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.110
 very nice i actually use almost 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.590
 my whole life windows 7 except on 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.050
 at the beginning where I do not have not everyone 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.110
 day at the computer was windows 2000 and 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.480
 in the very early days - 96 on the laptop 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.430
 when I painted only in pentrup 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.310
 or just in word somehow with these 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.590
 fonts because of what bored 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.980
 you have done half an hour 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.980
 on the day that was allowed but afterwards 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.910
 I always use windows xp so used 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.190
 For 12 years and then I mean 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.080
 first correct pc had 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.540
 or laptop I had that yes 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.220
 I still have that with me too 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.230
 could play games a bit 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.040
 I had more computational power 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.570
 actually almost my complete one now 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.850
 computer life let me say windows 7 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.040
 used and I think that actually 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.470
 I just think it's such a huge one 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.480
 switch to windows now that see 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.450
 i make that decision clear i will 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.500
 definitely within the current 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.920
 first year 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.230
 that's wise, because it's free 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.200
 is and eventually you need windows 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.160
 10 stop for something but 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.220
 It's not that way yet 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.970
 function where i say i need that 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.930
 upgrade necessarily clear war for games 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.030
 maybe interesting but still 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.979
 i have no performance problems in 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.020
 any games that I say 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.610
 I really need that now 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.419
 sometimes you are interested if you already 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.250
 have signed off the sorrow bugged have 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.919
 simply because it's just the new one because 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.380
 it looks better or maybe has 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.030
 yes somebody said so i have 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.259
 now a windows phone that works 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.509
 everything very nice together 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.639
 I have unfortunately so it unfortunately I 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.900
 just do not have windows phone but 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.240
 i think if i have a windows phone 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.930
 I would and would use that 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.840
 my windows he upgrade because the whole 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.250
 apps then collaborate on portans 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.830
 working together and so on 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.870
 I am not clear but portaner nick 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.000
 is a nice thing you can do now 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.620
 nothing against saying the new browser 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.669
 It would be nice, but you need it 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.410
 I realize I do not have it now 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.729
 really the innovations and the me 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.889
 says i need this upgrade now 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.039
 and it just bothers me a few 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.229
 things about windows 10 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.729
 for example, that there is one 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.139
 calculator app that was yes 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.919
 windows 8 already like that and there are 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:35.810
 This calculator application of 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:38.180
 Windows itself you have no idea 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.889
 So I know her since xp gave 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.199
 it also already before you stop 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.270
 since always knows and what me 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.220
 he notices the calculator he needs 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.940
 Just stay on my laptop for much longer 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.220
 start 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.750
 as that windows calculated the 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.220
 since ever is there any question 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.470
 I wonder what you need this app for 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.780
 clearly for tablet users, that's just fine 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.720
 that they are now between the pc mode and 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.300
 I can change my tablet mode 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.060
 windows 10 just feels more 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.990
 I have to look like a cellphone 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.970
 say of my experience and also the photo 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.620
 app when i picture with the photo app 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.680
 opens which is supplied by windows 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.590
 that takes longer than if I just 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.789
 with the windows photo display with the 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.310
 windows mother display the one off 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:24.199
 windows 7 could open a picture and me 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.680
 think something like that just can not be that 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:29.240
 what's new what better so what's new 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.490
 should always be better 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.740
 and if there is something like that then I understand 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.920
 not like microsoft and immediately as well 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.410
 can sell 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.150
 I think seriously who wants 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:42.200
 not now either way or so 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:45.360
 somehow talk microsoft bad though 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.430
 how is he the point why me 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.140
 current should not like 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.000
 As I said I also want a little bit of 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.130
 you know what your point 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.470
 why did you update or why have you? 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.260
 it is not reported again to 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.920
 to sum up I'm already talking 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.410
 seven minutes 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:05.250
 my point why I is not straight off 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.960
 simply the risk that someday something 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.610
 on the pc broken by the upgrade 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.300
 might or may not work like this anymore 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.250
 as previously 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.200
 and that's just too much 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.720
 time then needs that again 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.370
 Clearly repair if that breaks 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.280
 you can reinstall everything and everything 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.080
 but honestly, I am too 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.360
 lazy for me there for three four hours 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.160
 to put it down and all that 100 again 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.500
 percent as I set it up 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.450
 It had already been that before 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.460
 Thanks for watching as I said 

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.800
 Your opinion would interest me 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.000
 and then we'll see each other or see and 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.200
 you do not know it the next time 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.200
 video until then
