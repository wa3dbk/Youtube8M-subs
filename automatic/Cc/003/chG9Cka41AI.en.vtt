get videos up while I was away due to

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.449 
get videos up while I was away due to
the<00:02:31.780> lovely<00:02:32.110> schedule<00:02:32.530> publishing<00:02:33.099> feature

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
the lovely schedule publishing feature

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.850 
the lovely schedule publishing feature
that<00:02:33.819> YouTube<00:02:34.180> offers<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.660> apparently<00:02:35.019> seems

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
that YouTube offers it apparently seems

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.770 
that YouTube offers it apparently seems
to<00:02:35.950> work<00:02:36.099> pretty<00:02:36.130> well<00:02:36.370> now<00:02:36.670> in<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.330> past<00:02:37.540> it

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
to work pretty well now in the past it

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.270 
to work pretty well now in the past it
was<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.900> little<00:02:38.080> bit<00:02:38.200> buggy<00:02:38.380> but<00:02:38.680> for<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.130> most

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
was a little bit buggy but for the most

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.430 
was a little bit buggy but for the most
part<00:02:39.430> as<00:02:39.849> far<00:02:40.060> as<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.239> can<00:02:40.360> tell<00:02:40.599> it<00:02:40.870> seems<00:02:41.140> that

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
part as far as I can tell it seems that

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.309 
part as far as I can tell it seems that
most<00:02:42.430> people<00:02:42.940> are<00:02:43.090> getting<00:02:43.450> videos<00:02:43.930> sent<00:02:44.230> out

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
most people are getting videos sent out

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.190 
most people are getting videos sent out
to<00:02:44.560> their<00:02:44.739> subscription<00:02:45.580> lists<00:02:46.180> boxes<00:02:46.900> things

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
to their subscription lists boxes things

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.039 
to their subscription lists boxes things
so<00:02:47.560> that's<00:02:48.549> that's<00:02:48.940> good<00:02:49.239> um<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:51.160> anyway

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
so that's that's good um so anyway

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.839 
so that's that's good um so anyway
content<00:02:53.049> like<00:02:53.530> my<00:02:53.709> scheduling<00:02:54.310> when<00:02:54.610> I'm<00:02:54.730> out

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
content like my scheduling when I'm out

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.380 
content like my scheduling when I'm out
of<00:02:54.880> town<00:02:55.120> can<00:02:55.510> get<00:02:56.260> at<00:02:56.349> least<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:57.190> me<00:02:57.400> get<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.209> bit

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
of town can get at least to me get a bit

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.690 
of town can get at least to me get a bit
monotonous<00:02:58.810> seeing<00:02:59.769> as<00:02:59.980> it's<00:03:00.160> like<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.459> have<00:03:00.579> to

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
monotonous seeing as it's like I have to

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.699 
monotonous seeing as it's like I have to
prep<00:03:00.970> double<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.569> videos<00:03:01.900> videos<00:03:02.440> for<00:03:02.620> now

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
prep double the videos videos for now

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.710 
prep double the videos videos for now
and<00:03:02.920> videos<00:03:03.160> for<00:03:03.400> later<00:03:03.940> while<00:03:04.209> I'm<00:03:04.329> at<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.480> town

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
and videos for later while I'm at a town

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.710 
and videos for later while I'm at a town
so<00:03:05.590> it's<00:03:05.829> hard<00:03:06.099> to<00:03:06.190> do<00:03:06.430> like<00:03:06.730> two<00:03:07.090> video<00:03:07.390> days

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
so it's hard to do like two video days

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.300 
so it's hard to do like two video days
while<00:03:08.079> you're<00:03:08.290> out<00:03:08.410> of<00:03:08.560> town<00:03:08.739> because<00:03:08.980> it's

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
while you're out of town because it's

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.699 
while you're out of town because it's
like<00:03:09.489> that<00:03:10.030> requires<00:03:10.420> prepping<00:03:10.930> three<00:03:11.500> times

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
like that requires prepping three times

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.309 
like that requires prepping three times
the<00:03:11.980> amount<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:12.280> videos<00:03:12.579> sell<00:03:13.450> more<00:03:14.019> four

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
the amount of videos sell more four

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.280 
the amount of videos sell more four
times<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.799> amount<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.099> videos<00:03:15.459> so<00:03:15.930> anyway<00:03:16.930> now

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
times the amount of videos so anyway now

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.280 
times the amount of videos so anyway now
that<00:03:17.440> I'm<00:03:17.530> back<00:03:17.709> hopefully<00:03:18.430> we'll<00:03:18.609> do<00:03:19.389> it<00:03:19.569> the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
that I'm back hopefully we'll do it the

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.379 
that I'm back hopefully we'll do it the
the<00:03:20.319> two<00:03:20.739> video<00:03:21.010> days<00:03:21.310> here<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:21.819> there<00:03:21.880> so<00:03:22.299> on

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
the two video days here and there so on

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.379 
the two video days here and there so on
and<00:03:22.540> so<00:03:22.660> forth<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.200> it's<00:03:23.709> actually<00:03:24.269> it's<00:03:25.269> a

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
and so forth and it's actually it's a

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.390 
and so forth and it's actually it's a
goal<00:03:25.630> of<00:03:25.660> mine<00:03:26.079> on<00:03:26.410> into<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:26.859> future<00:03:27.010> to

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
goal of mine on into the future to

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.270 
goal of mine on into the future to
hopefully<00:03:28.120> get<00:03:28.420> into<00:03:28.630> like<00:03:29.410> two<00:03:29.680> videos<00:03:29.829> a<00:03:30.069> day

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
hopefully get into like two videos a day

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.970 
hopefully get into like two videos a day
as<00:03:30.760> like<00:03:31.120> a<00:03:31.150> regular<00:03:31.720> thing<00:03:32.079> I'd<00:03:32.350> like<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.829> do

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
as like a regular thing I'd like to do

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.500 
as like a regular thing I'd like to do
that

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
that

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.660 
that
and<00:03:34.750> hopefully<00:03:35.410> down<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:35.859> road<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:36.430> will<00:03:36.519> be

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
and hopefully down the road it will be

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.360 
and hopefully down the road it will be
possible<00:03:37.180> I<00:03:37.420> think<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.139> I<00:03:38.530> think<00:03:39.100> that<00:03:39.220> most

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
possible I think that I think that most

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.050 
possible I think that I think that most
people<00:03:39.489> would<00:03:39.910> kind<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:40.950> like<00:03:41.950> that<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.519> don't

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
people would kind of like that I don't

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.520 
people would kind of like that I don't
think<00:03:43.239> that's<00:03:43.420> like<00:03:43.600> too<00:03:43.840> many<00:03:43.989> I<00:03:44.139> think<00:03:44.230> most

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
think that's like too many I think most

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.670 
think that's like too many I think most
people<00:03:44.680> would<00:03:44.889> be<00:03:45.069> happy<00:03:45.970> with<00:03:46.319> two<00:03:47.319> videos<00:03:47.650> a

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
people would be happy with two videos a

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.440 
people would be happy with two videos a
day<00:03:47.829> especially<00:03:48.100> if<00:03:48.519> that<00:03:48.670> meant<00:03:48.910> like<00:03:49.120> more

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
day especially if that meant like more

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.800 
day especially if that meant like more
Hunger<00:03:50.290> Games<00:03:50.500> or<00:03:50.739> more<00:03:50.980> modded<00:03:51.639> survival<00:03:51.810> so

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
Hunger Games or more modded survival so
