this<00:00:04.230> is<00:00:04.380> my<00:00:04.529> elementary<00:00:06.379> milling<00:00:07.379> machine

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
this is my elementary milling machine

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.770 
this is my elementary milling machine
I'm<00:00:08.780> I've<00:00:09.780> been<00:00:10.050> doing<00:00:10.530> some<00:00:11.420> work<00:00:12.420> today<00:00:12.980> I

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
I'm I've been doing some work today I

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.160 
I'm I've been doing some work today I
bolted<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.070> control<00:00:17.070> panel<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:19.580> motor

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
bolted the control panel for the motor

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.670 
bolted the control panel for the motor
just<00:00:22.170> some<00:00:22.619> simple<00:00:23.060> screws<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.560> bolted<00:00:25.560> it

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
just some simple screws and bolted it

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.210 
just some simple screws and bolted it
here<00:00:25.890> nicely<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.580> tight<00:00:27.320> so<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.980> was

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
here nicely and tight so it was

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.060 
here nicely and tight so it was
somewhere<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:30.240> before<00:00:30.689> very<00:00:33.950> difficult<00:00:34.950> to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
somewhere here before very difficult to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.069 
somewhere here before very difficult to
use

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
use

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:44.540 
use
so<00:00:37.340> today<00:00:38.340> I've<00:00:38.520> been<00:00:38.790> working<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:43.550> little

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
so today I've been working on a little

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.319 
so today I've been working on a little
advice<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.780> want<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:48.860> build<00:00:49.860> all<00:00:50.430> out<00:00:51.090> of

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
advice that I want to build all out of

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.880 
advice that I want to build all out of
some<00:00:51.539> scrap<00:00:52.140> materials<00:00:53.210> um<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.920> have<00:00:55.920> some<00:00:56.190> more

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
some scrap materials um I have some more

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.380 
some scrap materials um I have some more
parts<00:00:58.890> over<00:00:59.039> here<00:01:01.940> this<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.000> going<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.300> be

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
parts over here this is going to be

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.740 
parts over here this is going to be
basically<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.559> three-piece<00:01:05.100> vise<00:01:08.750> to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
basically just a three-piece vise to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.929 
basically just a three-piece vise to
will<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.229> fit<00:01:10.710> fixed<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:13.070> these<00:01:14.070> two<00:01:14.490> will<00:01:14.729> be

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
will be fit fixed so these two will be

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.760 
will be fit fixed so these two will be
the<00:01:15.090> jaws<00:01:15.830> which<00:01:16.830> will<00:01:17.360> clamp<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.630> piece<00:01:18.930> so

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the jaws which will clamp the piece so

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.300 
the jaws which will clamp the piece so
let's<00:01:20.430> say<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.390> piece<00:01:21.710> work<00:01:22.710> piece<00:01:22.950> I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
let's say this is the piece work piece I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.670 
let's say this is the piece work piece I
will<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.790> put<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.659> here<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.290> will<00:01:25.500> be

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
will just put it here this will be

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.030 
will just put it here this will be
screwed<00:01:26.240> bolted<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.530> onto<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.560> table

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
screwed bolted on the onto the table

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.380 
screwed bolted on the onto the table
like<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.700> one<00:01:30.409> and<00:01:32.000> then<00:01:33.409> with<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:35.390> screws

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
like this one and then with this screws

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.580 
like this one and then with this screws
I<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.840> here<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.380> will<00:01:37.740> just<00:01:39.020> tighten<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.350> jaw

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
I have here I will just tighten the jaw

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.620 
I have here I will just tighten the jaw
onto<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.799> go<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> other<00:01:44.909> fix<00:01:46.909> so<00:01:47.909> it's

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
onto the go on to the other fix so it's

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.310 
onto the go on to the other fix so it's
a<00:01:48.750> very<00:01:48.990> basic<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.920> rudimentary<00:01:50.960> device<00:01:51.960> but

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
a very basic and rudimentary device but

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.850 
a very basic and rudimentary device but
I'm<00:01:53.149> hoping<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.450> will<00:01:54.659> ease<00:01:55.140> up<00:01:55.200> my<00:01:55.619> work<00:01:56.540> as

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
I'm hoping this will ease up my work as

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.749 
I'm hoping this will ease up my work as
you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.610> some<00:01:59.939> screws<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.079> go

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
you can see I have some screws that go

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.709 
you can see I have some screws that go
down<00:02:02.759> through<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:04.219> fixed<00:02:05.219> part<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.759> vise

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
down through the fixed part of the vise

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.979 
down through the fixed part of the vise
and<00:02:08.229> into<00:02:08.709> some<00:02:08.950> these<00:02:09.369> slots<00:02:09.700> this<00:02:10.690> law

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
and into some these slots this law

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.320 
and into some these slots this law
t-nuts

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
t-nuts

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.020 
t-nuts
that<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.450> made<00:02:14.050> with<00:02:14.290> this<00:02:14.470> machine<00:02:14.830> as<00:02:15.040> well<00:02:15.069> in

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
that I made with this machine as well in

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.860 
that I made with this machine as well in
another<00:02:16.269> video<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:21.310> thing<00:02:21.489> that<00:02:21.519> I'm<00:02:21.940> not

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
another video so one thing that I'm not

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:31.520 
another video so one thing that I'm not
sure<00:02:23.410> yet<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:24.010> how<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:25.590> make<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:26.830> face<00:02:27.580> here

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.570 

perfectly<00:02:32.530> Square<00:02:33.099> to<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.459> table<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:35.799> also

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
perfectly Square to the table and also

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.970 
perfectly Square to the table and also
how<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.680> face<00:02:38.680> off<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.629> so<00:02:40.629> that<00:02:40.810> it's<00:02:40.989> nice

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
how to face off this so that it's nice

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.410 
how to face off this so that it's nice
and<00:02:42.040> six<00:02:42.579> type<00:02:43.500> nicely<00:02:44.500> on<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.829> table<00:02:45.430> because

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
and six type nicely on the table because

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.270 
and six type nicely on the table because
I<00:02:46.750> don't<00:02:47.110> have<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.260> grinding<00:02:47.739> machine<00:02:47.890> I'm

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
I don't have a grinding machine I'm

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.839 
I don't have a grinding machine I'm
thinking<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.700> made<00:02:52.360> some<00:02:52.629> tests<00:02:53.500> today<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:54.250> it

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
thinking I made some tests today and it

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.699 
thinking I made some tests today and it
seems<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.329> this<00:02:55.989> little<00:02:56.769> tool<00:02:57.069> can<00:02:57.489> cut

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
seems that this little tool can cut

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.830 
seems that this little tool can cut
quite<00:02:59.709> nicely<00:03:00.450> vertical<00:03:02.310> faces<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.629> this<00:03:04.629> is

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
quite nicely vertical faces and this is

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.920 
quite nicely vertical faces and this is
I'm<00:03:05.560> not<00:03:05.620> sure<00:03:05.829> if<00:03:06.069> you<00:03:06.220> can<00:03:06.370> see<00:03:06.670> this<00:03:06.930> this

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
I'm not sure if you can see this this

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.920 
I'm not sure if you can see this this
place<00:03:08.170> over<00:03:08.590> here<00:03:10.319> ended<00:03:11.319> up<00:03:11.440> quite<00:03:11.709> nicely

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
place over here ended up quite nicely

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.589 
place over here ended up quite nicely
yeah<00:03:13.930> but<00:03:14.639> this<00:03:15.639> one<00:03:15.930> here<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:18.010> flat<00:03:18.880> surfaces

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
yeah but this one here so flat surfaces

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.990 
yeah but this one here so flat surfaces
I<00:03:19.870> have<00:03:20.170> problems<00:03:20.859> with<00:03:20.950> flat<00:03:21.430> surfaces<00:03:21.849> as

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
I have problems with flat surfaces as

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.050 
I have problems with flat surfaces as
you<00:03:22.090> can<00:03:22.299> see<00:03:22.889> this<00:03:23.889> machine<00:03:24.280> is<00:03:24.430> not<00:03:24.639> rigid

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
you can see this machine is not rigid

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.309 
you can see this machine is not rigid
enough<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:26.579> to<00:03:27.579> allow<00:03:27.760> me<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:27.970> make<00:03:28.319> really

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
enough to to allow me to make really

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.640 
enough to to allow me to make really
nice<00:03:29.470> surfaces<00:03:30.329> and<00:03:31.329> also<00:03:31.810> this<00:03:31.989> tool<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.470> not

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
nice surfaces and also this tool is not

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.110 
nice surfaces and also this tool is not
very<00:03:32.859> good<00:03:33.069> either<00:03:33.310> it's<00:03:33.910> just<00:03:34.660> some<00:03:34.900> scrap

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
very good either it's just some scrap

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.690 
very good either it's just some scrap
material<00:03:37.120> tool<00:03:37.419> but<00:03:37.950> this<00:03:38.950> is<00:03:39.099> just<00:03:39.250> my<00:03:39.430> hobby
