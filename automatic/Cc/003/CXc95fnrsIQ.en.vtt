00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.920
 at 39 review minecraft it's about 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.839
 anime mode player is a mode of 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.359
 aesthetic that will add us some 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:21.220
 super cool animations to our 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.990
 minecraft character so 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.599
 I will quickly explain to you in what 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.669
 consists this mod and then I will teach you to 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.189
 to install what's worth kids, so 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.529
 let's start first of all I 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.970
 I'm going to put here on f5 and you see there's 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.010
 a small change you can see I'm flying 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.230
 because I'm creative but the 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.570
 position the animations of the character 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.390
 of my skin are already different ways that 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.340
 they are moving their arms and 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.630
 legs too very well guys we are going to 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.250
 start watching the animations as 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.740
 you have taken off my boots to not 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.880
 walk very fast and the first of all 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.070
 will be walking 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.530
 let's start walking and how today 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.720
 it moves our joints to the height 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.970
 of the knee and at the elbow 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.100
 you see wearing soft slightly and go 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.259
 synchronized so 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.270
 really handsome guys I wear it for 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.729
 true in the third person because in 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.530
 First person does not see difference 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.750
 This is going to be noticed by people who 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.970
 are playing on our server or if 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.770
 we recorded a video in the third person very 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.780
 well apart from walking we will be able to 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.360
 run now we are walking and if 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.180
 we run you see arms move and 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.180
 the legs the quicker the truth is that 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.270
 he's very handsome, look kids what 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.759
 cool is this animation what else are we going 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.159
 to be able to run or jump forgiveness 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.780
 when we jump we see that we are going to 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.780
 doing this animation is going to move us 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.940
 slightly and if we are running or 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.590
 we're walking the animation is also going 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.970
 to vary a little is that we are now 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:52.990
 Running and jumping We have more time 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.330
 let's jump and see how to raise 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.190
 legs worth kids very well what else 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.530
 we will be able to do what 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.480
 animations we are going to have already seen 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.300
 to run and jump we are going to have 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.510
 also the one of nothing we are going to put and 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.970
 you see that automatically is we get 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.250
 to the water and start moving the arms 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.400
 as if we were swimming in life 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.580
 real and at the same time we are moving the feet 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.710
 very well let's go down and let's go up 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.950
 a little bit upwards that almost not 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.950
 it looks 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.810
 from here he is very handsome so another 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.200
 of the animations that we are going to have 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.800
 when we are crouched, it is worth snake veis 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.660
 If we bend changes the position is 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.000
 very handsome olea and it looks like he's about 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.520
 to start running and when we 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 let's start moving let's go more 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.450
 slowly it's worth it, it seems like we do not 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.450
 noise 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.920
 very handsome very well we would have the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.650
 snake as we are seeing we could 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.049
 to run, we jump, we make the 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.819
 snake wow 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.500
 we can make many combinations let's 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.900
 to have as you see I have a horse 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.140
 animation of being riding because that 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.390
 a horse a pig whatever we are going to 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.420
 see her like that and her legs are going to get 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.000
 right click now left click you see 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.260
 that the legs are separated much more 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.610
 and that's why it's very good because 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.739
 we have that animation that other 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.569
 animations we are going to have seen 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.599
 all of jumping but we also have 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.790
 the climb so put here you are 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.390
 stairs we are going to approach and as 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.549
 you see we are climbing and also to 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.160
 descend now because we have two but 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.859
 if we go straight you see that it is moving the 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.810
 hands and feet and it's great that we 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.519
 we are standing, he stays in that 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.650
 position is valid in the position that we are 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.980
 in that moment we keep going up 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.540
 Well here we are and as you can see then that 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.219
 we will run again 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.799
 and let's jump we have seen 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:05.019
 also the one to climb so we're going to 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.359
 select or we will now take a 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.730
 tools so you can see that we're going to 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:12.430
 have also a sword a bow and a 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.280
 because we are going to see these we are going to 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.160
 place us like this 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.560
 because we're going to have a new action or 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.540
 a new animation to defend if now 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.030
 we are defending you see that it puts us 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.830
 in this way right click 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.850
 we are defending could we defend 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.850
 also being crouched 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.550
 very well and we are also going to have a 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.610
 new action a new animation when 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.190

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.800

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.650
 escapes 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.710
 that escapes me how difficult it is to give them and 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.890
 good kids you see like others 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.260
 animations we will have as you see 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.000
 we had the hit and the block 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.550
 but we will also have a new 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.680
 animation when we have the bow when 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.840
 let's have the arc and we're firing already 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.190

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.270
 we go to ourselves from kids and 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.160
 You see that while we are spinning it is rotating 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.990
 also the arms so it's 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.849

00:05:56.369 --> 00:06:02.699
 So right now we already would 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:05.249

 there will be another folder called mod where 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.810
 we are going to have to copy these two 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.960

 we just created our world so 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:16.470
 we are going to give it to f 5 so we can see 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:19.020
 that the animations are those of the mod and 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:22.259

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.590
 I know we're going to pick up an equation the 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.280
 potion we should make a gesture with the 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.710

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.180
 We can say that we have urged 

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.190
 correctly we would just have to 

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.870
 enjoy so I do not expect anything that you 

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.150
