eseries laptop via the modular Bay and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.579 
eseries laptop via the modular Bay and
the<00:00:17.330> modular<00:00:17.810> Bay<00:00:18.050> is<00:00:18.320> just<00:00:18.859> a<00:00:19.359> drive<00:00:20.359> bay<00:00:20.690> used

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:21.589 
the modular Bay is just a drive bay used

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:23.529 
the modular Bay is just a drive bay used
to<00:00:21.740> house<00:00:21.919> the<00:00:22.189> optical<00:00:22.640> drive<00:00:22.789> of<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.179> del<00:00:23.359> e

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
to house the optical drive of the del e

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.859 
to house the optical drive of the del e
series<00:00:23.869> now<00:00:24.619> there<00:00:24.800> are<00:00:24.859> two<00:00:25.310> versions<00:00:26.269> of<00:00:26.660> the

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
series now there are two versions of the

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.650 
series now there are two versions of the
modular<00:00:27.679> Bay<00:00:27.890> from<00:00:28.699> there's<00:00:28.939> the<00:00:29.060> older<00:00:29.449> one

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
modular Bay from there's the older one

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.880 
modular Bay from there's the older one
which<00:00:30.230> is<00:00:30.890> was<00:00:31.730> used<00:00:31.970> for<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.329> e60<00:00:32.930> 510<00:00:33.620> and<00:00:34.780> e

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
which is was used for the e60 510 and e

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.000 
which is was used for the e60 510 and e
6500<00:00:37.000> 6400<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:38.180> then<00:00:39.020> there's<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.380> newer<00:00:39.680> one

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
6500 6400 and then there's the newer one

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.660 
6500 6400 and then there's the newer one
so<00:00:40.160> a<00:00:40.190> charge<00:00:40.430> for<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.760> e65<00:00:42.310> 2060<00:00:43.310> 530<00:00:43.970> is<00:00:44.510> e<00:00:45.670> 65

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
so a charge for the e65 2060 530 is e 65

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.700 
so a charge for the e65 2060 530 is e 65
or<00:00:47.420> 64<00:00:48.200> 30

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
or 64 30

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.840 
or 64 30
is<00:00:48.980> 64<00:00:49.550> 20<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:51.320> difference<00:00:51.710> is<00:00:51.980> one<00:00:52.820> is

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
is 64 20 and the difference is one is

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.550 
is 64 20 and the difference is one is
the<00:00:53.120> latching<00:00:53.480> mechanism<00:00:53.510> is<00:00:54.170> a<00:00:54.230> bit

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
the latching mechanism is a bit

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.910 
the latching mechanism is a bit
different<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:55.540> second<00:00:56.540> is<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:57.380> contour<00:00:57.890> of

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
different and second is the contour of

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.670 
different and second is the contour of
the<00:00:58.130> faceplate<00:00:58.760> let's<00:00:59.240> see<00:01:00.080> and<00:01:00.380> try<00:01:00.620> to

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
the faceplate let's see and try to

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.179 
the faceplate let's see and try to
compare<00:01:01.100> both<00:01:01.370> here<00:01:03.339> okay<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:05.979> older<00:01:06.979> one

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
compare both here okay so the older one

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.239 
compare both here okay so the older one
had<00:01:07.369> a<00:01:07.400> flatter<00:01:08.530> optical<00:01:09.530> drive<00:01:09.740> faceplate

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:10.249 
had a flatter optical drive faceplate

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:13.080 
had a flatter optical drive faceplate
the<00:01:10.850> newer<00:01:11.149> one<00:01:11.359> has<00:01:11.570> a<00:01:11.600> more<00:01:11.960> contoured<00:01:12.619> one

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
the newer one has a more contoured one

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.359 
the newer one has a more contoured one
so<00:01:15.759> so<00:01:16.759> if<00:01:17.329> you<00:01:17.630> have<00:01:17.810> an<00:01:17.929> older<00:01:18.409> series<00:01:18.979> then

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
so so if you have an older series then

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.450 
so so if you have an older series then
you<00:01:19.490> would<00:01:19.609> use<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:19.850> different<00:01:20.409> device<00:01:21.409> to<00:01:22.310> add

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
you would use a different device to add

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.090 
you would use a different device to add
a<00:01:22.490> second<00:01:23.030> drive<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:23.509> if<00:01:24.289> you<00:01:24.439> have<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.890> new

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
a second drive and if you have the new

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.399 
a second drive and if you have the new
one<00:01:25.340> of<00:01:25.460> course<00:01:25.729> you'd<00:01:25.880> use<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.960> one<00:01:27.140> with<00:01:27.259> the

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
one of course you'd use the one with the

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.090 
one of course you'd use the one with the
put<00:01:27.590> toward<00:01:27.920> faceplate<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:29.679> to<00:01:30.679> remove<00:01:30.979> the

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
put toward faceplate and to remove the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.809 
put toward faceplate and to remove the
optical<00:01:31.219> drive<00:01:31.640> it<00:01:32.420> is<00:01:32.689> just<00:01:32.929> a<00:01:33.079> matter<00:01:33.350> of

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
optical drive it is just a matter of

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.120 
optical drive it is just a matter of
pressing<00:01:34.819> the<00:01:35.090> eject<00:01:35.479> mechanism<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:36.229> pulling

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
pressing the eject mechanism and pulling

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.739 
pressing the eject mechanism and pulling
it<00:01:37.249> out<00:01:39.759> adding<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:40.939> second<00:01:41.420> drive<00:01:41.569> is<00:01:41.719> a

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
it out adding the second drive is a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:43.569 
it out adding the second drive is a
fairly<00:01:42.439> simple<00:01:42.740> as<00:01:42.979> long<00:01:43.159> as<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:43.369> have<00:01:43.490> the

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
fairly simple as long as you have the

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.599 
fairly simple as long as you have the
proper<00:01:43.969> drive<00:01:44.210> caddy<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:45.100> this<00:01:46.100> drive<00:01:46.340> caddy

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
proper drive caddy and this drive caddy

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:49.179 
proper drive caddy and this drive caddy
has<00:01:47.119> your<00:01:47.420> SATA<00:01:47.659> connector<00:01:48.170> that<00:01:48.590> made<00:01:48.740> with

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
has your SATA connector that made with

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.029 
has your SATA connector that made with
the<00:01:49.340> laptop<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:50.719> decided<00:01:51.319> connector<00:01:51.649> inside

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
the laptop and decided connector inside

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.789 
the laptop and decided connector inside
and<00:01:52.700> all<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:53.270> would<00:01:53.420> need<00:01:53.600> is<00:01:53.780> a<00:01:53.869> SATA<00:01:54.530> hard

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
and all you would need is a SATA hard

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.389 
and all you would need is a SATA hard
drive<00:01:55.039> or<00:01:55.280> SATA<00:01:55.929> SSD<00:01:56.929> and<00:01:57.139> this<00:01:57.950> is<00:01:58.100> two<00:01:58.249> and<00:01:58.340> a

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
drive or SATA SSD and this is two and a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:59.949 
drive or SATA SSD and this is two and a
half<00:01:58.549> inch<00:01:58.759> you<00:01:58.939> can<00:01:59.060> always<00:01:59.209> use<00:01:59.479> one<00:01:59.509> half

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
half inch you can always use one half

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.160 
half inch you can always use one half
inch<00:02:00.310> so<00:02:01.310> this<00:02:01.459> goes<00:02:01.759> in<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:02.600> just<00:02:02.749> slide<00:02:03.020> it

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
inch so this goes in you just slide it

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.230 
inch so this goes in you just slide it
into<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.469> caddy<00:02:03.999> connect<00:02:04.999> with<00:02:05.119> the

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
into the caddy connect with the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.910 
into the caddy connect with the
connector<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:07.630> secure<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:09.020> hard<00:02:09.440> drive<00:02:09.709> at

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
connector and secure the hard drive at

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.960 
connector and secure the hard drive at
the<00:02:10.039> bottom<00:02:10.340> of<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.550> caddy

this<00:02:18.409> here<00:02:18.709> is<00:02:18.799> a<00:02:18.890> close-up<00:02:19.129> view<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.459> the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
this here is a close-up view of the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.009 
this here is a close-up view of the
eject<00:02:21.170> mechanism<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:22.700> like<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.299> original

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
eject mechanism just like the original

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.300 
eject mechanism just like the original
and<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.590> was<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:24.920> sign<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:26.030> work<00:02:26.319> with<00:02:27.319> the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
and this was the sign to work with the

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.930 
and this was the sign to work with the
modular<00:02:28.549> Bay<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:30.640> once<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.790> slide<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.209> in<00:02:33.940> lock

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
modular Bay so once you slide it in lock

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.839 
modular Bay so once you slide it in lock
it<00:02:35.090> into<00:02:35.239> place<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.739> have<00:02:37.069> two<00:02:37.610> hard

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
it into place and you have two hard

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.300 
it into place and you have two hard
drives<00:02:37.970> in<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.360> laptop<00:02:38.799> as<00:02:39.799> I<00:02:39.950> mentioned

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
drives in the laptop as I mentioned

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.059 
drives in the laptop as I mentioned
earlier<00:02:40.670> there<00:02:41.569> are<00:02:41.599> two<00:02:42.200> different<00:02:42.920> versions

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
earlier there are two different versions

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.910 
earlier there are two different versions
of<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.459> modular<00:02:43.819> Bay<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.239> this<00:02:44.989> is<00:02:45.379> for<00:02:45.829> the

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
of the modular Bay and this is for the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.330 
of the modular Bay and this is for the
newer<00:02:46.250> one<00:02:46.900> for<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:47.989> new<00:02:48.140> latitude<00:02:48.590> series

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.380 
which had a flatter face plate and this
is<00:02:59.569> a<00:02:59.599> drug<00:02:59.930> caddy<00:03:00.370> for<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.519> previous<00:03:01.970> version

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
is a drug caddy for the previous version

is a drug caddy for the previous version
of<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.870> email<00:03:03.019> you<00:03:03.349> obey<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.859> same<00:03:04.579> principle
