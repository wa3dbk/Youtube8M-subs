00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
probably pulling it from here but you're

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.560 
probably pulling it from here but you're
putting<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.739> down<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.430> you're<00:02:30.150> really

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
putting this down and you're really

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.460 
putting this down and you're really
pulling<00:02:30.799> from<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.860> second<00:02:32.459> card<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.780> they

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
pulling from the second card and so they

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.509 
pulling from the second card and so they
pick<00:02:34.739> so<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:36.030> seems<00:02:36.690> like<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.350> that's<00:02:38.250> your

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
pick so it seems like it and that's your

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.199 
pick so it seems like it and that's your
card<00:02:38.700> right<00:02:38.760> there<00:02:39.320> so<00:02:40.320> then<00:02:40.549> for<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.670> rest<00:02:42.030> of

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.000 
card right there so then for the rest of
the<00:02:42.299> other<00:02:42.420> two<00:02:42.660> cards<00:02:43.109> it<00:02:43.350> doesn't<00:02:43.920> even
