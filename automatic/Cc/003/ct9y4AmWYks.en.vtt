 five men some of their children this year 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.560
 like the duel 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.410
 about the mystery 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.540
 calm 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.470
 the study

 He came from Saint Benedict. 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.700
 the food we eat 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.570
 it's not just me 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.970
 power supply 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.049
 also deserve emotions and that is why the jury - 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.780
 in 2003 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.170

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 My wife and I lived with the darlings of the kitchen of my life. 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.460
 the food making four internal 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.360
 episodes of our life 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.340
 when we want to be stressed 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.780
 we made the exchange 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.700
 in moments of distress for the attacks 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.510
 but when we're in love 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.450
 in this year 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.930
 food is not only a source of gnr 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.249
 is what moves the emotions he surfed years 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:09.419
 choice 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.619
 I'm even afraid it's common for people with life 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:14.899
 and this prevents the bracelets 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.269
 at the same time as breastfeeding 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.689
 the dead harpy 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.339

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.999
 have ended a coercion 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.549
 can change choosing foods that improve nutrition 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.889
 and the spirit of debt there with this summer 3 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.799
