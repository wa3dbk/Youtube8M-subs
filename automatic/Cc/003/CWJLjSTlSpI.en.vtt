confused about hardwood flooring
I<00:00:28.890> really<00:00:29.490> would<00:00:29.609> advise<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.090> think<00:00:30.359> about

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
I really would advise you to think about

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.110 
I really would advise you to think about
your<00:00:30.689> floor<00:00:30.960> as<00:00:31.170> one<00:00:31.590> main<00:00:32.040> element<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.820> runs

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
your floor as one main element that runs

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.540 
your floor as one main element that runs
through<00:00:33.510> your<00:00:33.719> home<00:00:34.020> now<00:00:34.680> obviously<00:00:35.190> if

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
through your home now obviously if

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.340 
through your home now obviously if
you've<00:00:35.670> got<00:00:35.910> hardwood<00:00:36.329> floors<00:00:36.630> some<00:00:37.079> rooms

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
you've got hardwood floors some rooms

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.830 
you've got hardwood floors some rooms
may<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.829> carpet<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.969> may<00:00:39.180> divide<00:00:39.600> your

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
may have carpet and that may divide your

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.229 
may have carpet and that may divide your
space<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> bit<00:00:40.530> but<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.190> really<00:00:41.820> don't<00:00:41.940> suggest

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
space a bit but I really don't suggest

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.450 
space a bit but I really don't suggest
having<00:00:42.690> multiple<00:00:43.260> types<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.739> hardwood<00:00:44.190> floor
