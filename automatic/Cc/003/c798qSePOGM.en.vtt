00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
not too thick one of the things that you

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.099 
not too thick one of the things that you
can<00:03:17.680> do<00:03:17.859> is<00:03:18.100> very<00:03:18.459> with<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.269> thickness<00:03:19.480> of<00:03:19.870> the

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
can do is very with the thickness of the

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.699 
can do is very with the thickness of the
croco<00:03:20.380> fever<00:03:21.209> if<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:22.420> apply<00:03:22.810> a<00:03:22.840> thinner<00:03:23.380> coat

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
croco fever if you apply a thinner coat

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.030 
croco fever if you apply a thinner coat
you<00:03:24.070> quite<00:03:24.340> often<00:03:24.579> see<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.530> smaller<00:03:26.530> croco

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
you quite often see a smaller croco

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.440 
you quite often see a smaller croco
pattern<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:28.950> then<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:30.250> thicker<00:03:30.819> coat<00:03:30.940> of

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
pattern and then a thicker coat of

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.130 
pattern and then a thicker coat of
krakow<00:03:31.959> will<00:03:32.410> yield<00:03:33.299> typically<00:03:34.299> somewhat<00:03:34.959> of

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
krakow will yield typically somewhat of

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.819 
krakow will yield typically somewhat of
a<00:03:35.260> thicker<00:03:35.560> pattern<00:03:37.019> so<00:03:38.019> this<00:03:38.170> is<00:03:38.319> the<00:03:38.500> croco

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
a thicker pattern so this is the croco

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.069 
a thicker pattern so this is the croco
top<00:03:39.160> red<00:03:39.639> rescue<00:03:39.940> being<00:03:40.480> applied<00:03:40.780> over

the<00:04:08.920> croco<00:04:09.160> top<00:04:09.519> we're<00:04:10.299> going<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:10.540> let<00:04:10.840> the

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
the croco top we're going to let the

nails process the processing time for

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.909 
nails process the processing time for
the<00:04:14.139> effect<00:04:14.769> to<00:04:15.609> fully<00:04:16.600> be<00:04:16.810> realized<00:04:17.229> this<00:04:17.799> is

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
the effect to fully be realized this is

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.940 
the effect to fully be realized this is
around<00:04:18.160> four<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.639> five<00:04:18.849> minutes<00:04:20.880> depending<00:04:21.880> on

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
around four to five minutes depending on

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.100 
around four to five minutes depending on
you

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
you

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.409 
you
body<00:04:24.469> heat<00:04:24.770> will<00:04:24.830> help<00:04:25.219> dry<00:04:25.460> it<00:04:25.520> one<00:04:26.240> of<00:04:26.330> the

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
body heat will help dry it one of the

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.619 
body heat will help dry it one of the
things<00:04:26.629> that<00:04:26.719> you<00:04:26.870> want<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.080> ensure<00:04:27.349> not<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.979> do

00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:28.629 
things that you want to ensure not to do

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:33.999 
things that you want to ensure not to do
is<00:04:29.629> to<00:04:30.050> artificially<00:04:30.860> dry<00:04:31.219> the<00:04:32.210> kraków<00:04:32.479> top<00:04:33.009> it

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
is to artificially dry the kraków top it

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.749 
is to artificially dry the kraków top it
really<00:04:34.490> needs<00:04:34.759> to<00:04:34.939> to<00:04:35.900> dry<00:04:36.199> on<00:04:36.469> its<00:04:36.530> own<00:04:37.310> so

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
really needs to to dry on its own so

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.790 
really needs to to dry on its own so
that<00:04:38.360> you<00:04:38.569> can<00:04:38.810> realize<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:40.580> full<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:42.620> full

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
that you can realize the full the full

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.529 
that you can realize the full the full
effect<00:04:43.219> the<00:04:43.430> full<00:04:43.610> croco<00:04:43.969> effect<00:04:47.439> okay<00:04:48.439> so<00:04:48.860> now

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
effect the full croco effect okay so now

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.790 
effect the full croco effect okay so now
as<00:04:50.539> we<00:04:51.379> can<00:04:51.500> see<00:04:51.879> the<00:04:52.879> croco<00:04:53.659> top<00:04:54.020> has

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
as we can see the croco top has

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.089 
as we can see the croco top has
processed<00:04:55.599> it's<00:04:56.599> taken<00:04:58.029> approximately<00:05:00.099> four

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
processed it's taken approximately four

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.550 
processed it's taken approximately four
minutes<00:05:01.279> for<00:05:02.029> this<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.419> fully<00:05:02.659> process<00:05:02.930> and

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
minutes for this to fully process and

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.300 
minutes for this to fully process and
each<00:05:04.400> one<00:05:04.729> comes<00:05:05.150> out<00:05:05.479> in<00:05:05.810> its<00:05:06.379> own<00:05:06.529> pattern

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
each one comes out in its own pattern

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.260 
each one comes out in its own pattern
this<00:05:07.580> is<00:05:07.879> a<00:05:07.939> great<00:05:08.689> almost<00:05:09.969> giraffe<00:05:10.969> tight

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
this is a great almost giraffe tight

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.670 
this is a great almost giraffe tight
pattern<00:05:11.599> you<00:05:11.659> may<00:05:11.779> be<00:05:11.840> difficult<00:05:12.110> to<00:05:12.409> see<00:05:12.560> what

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
pattern you may be difficult to see what

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.929 
pattern you may be difficult to see what
the<00:05:12.770> camera<00:05:13.039> will<00:05:13.340> be<00:05:13.460> posting<00:05:13.849> these

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:13.939 
the camera will be posting these

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:16.269 
the camera will be posting these
pictures<00:05:14.360> on<00:05:14.740> facebook<00:05:15.740> so<00:05:15.889> you<00:05:15.979> can<00:05:16.099> have<00:05:16.250> a

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:16.279 
pictures on facebook so you can have a

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:18.519 
pictures on facebook so you can have a
better<00:05:16.460> look<00:05:16.759> and<00:05:17.029> it's<00:05:17.930> hard<00:05:18.050> to<00:05:18.259> see<00:05:18.409> the

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:18.529 
better look and it's hard to see the

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:20.920 
better look and it's hard to see the
subtlety<00:05:18.830> with<00:05:19.099> the<00:05:19.250> camera<00:05:19.610> but<00:05:19.849> the<00:05:20.479> look<00:05:20.719> is

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
subtlety with the camera but the look is

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.869 
subtlety with the camera but the look is
definitely<00:05:21.439> a<00:05:22.400> very<00:05:22.900> unique<00:05:23.900> very<00:05:24.879> reptile

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:25.879 
definitely a very unique very reptile
