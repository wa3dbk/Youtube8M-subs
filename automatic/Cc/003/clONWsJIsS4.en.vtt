00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.560 
important thing when finger detangling
is<00:03:02.340> pretty<00:03:02.640> much<00:03:02.760> treated<00:03:03.090> like<00:03:03.240> your<00:03:03.420> wide

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
is pretty much treated like your wide

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.000 
is pretty much treated like your wide
tooth<00:03:03.600> comb<00:03:03.810> starting<00:03:04.350> from<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.590> ends<00:03:04.769> and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
tooth comb starting from the ends and

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.759 
tooth comb starting from the ends and
going<00:03:05.250> up<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:06.780> makes<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.590> lot<00:03:07.709> easier

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
going up and it makes it a lot easier

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.550 
going up and it makes it a lot easier
because<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.580> can<00:03:08.760> focus<00:03:09.000> on<00:03:09.420> those<00:03:09.900> knots<00:03:10.320> and

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
because I can focus on those knots and

00:03:10.560 --> 00:04:09.730 
because I can focus on those knots and
tangles<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.220> get<00:03:11.670> closer<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.330> my<00:03:12.600> root

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.980 

so<00:04:10.740> when<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:11.190> am<00:04:11.490> done<00:04:11.700> washing<00:04:12.030> my<00:04:12.390> hair<00:04:12.630> I<00:04:12.780> like
