 and television more environment but more 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.950
 beyond our planet space 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.990
 always has always provoked us 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.059
 mystery curiosity and of course all 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.429
 kind of fascination all kinds of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.529
 imaginations stories and what to 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.109
 Human gender can happen to you without 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.010
 But beyond assumption there 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.560
 reliable proofs of the beautiful and 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:29.410
 surprising that is the universe 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.230
 the space keeps millions of secrets to 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.900
 those that are rarely accessed in 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.760
 part is thanks the nasa organization 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.040
 specialized American in topics 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.590
 spatial by which we can know 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.559
 unique shows I want to water the 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.470
 universe for example in this image it 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.620
 You can see how it looked 11,000 ago 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.960
 millions of years the Milky Way is a 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.510
 anti ion after this is the image of 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.909
 how the night sky looks now 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.979
 is dominated by the white glow 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.559
 of innumerable stars of medium 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.860
 age with a few pink nebulas of 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.450
 star formation and pollution 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.210
 interstellar 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.700
 the other is a young milky way of 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.950
 11,000 million years ago we can see the 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.259
 central bulge of stars that 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.240
 they are smaller and fainter because 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.719
 the galaxy is in an initial phase of 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.719
 building 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.840
 another of the discoveries is a 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.670
 natural - color image of Saturn this 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.030
 it's the first time that its moons and 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.130
 rings as well as earth venus and mars 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.829
 they come out in one take the incredible 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.170
 panoramic was made thanks to 141 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.409
 images taken by the spacecraft 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.509
 cassini from the nasa as we can see it 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.450
 appreciates the tiny size that the 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.789
 Earth and the moon seen from saturno well 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.950
 like Mars and venus right in this race 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.500
 to know more about what surrounds us 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.289
 NASA will launch the mission made Monday 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.360
 in the voyage will last 10 months until its 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.679
 arrival to the red planet she 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.740
 will commission to study the atmosphere 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.259
 superior of Mars the ionosphere and the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.420
 interactions with the solar wind in addition 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.420
 to calculate the Martian atmosphere 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.920
 Although progress has been made in 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.110
 investigations and explorations still 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.250
 there is much to know and with security 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.230
 will continue to amaze the world
