back<00:00:47.579> into<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.210> computer<00:00:49.219> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.399> see<00:00:50.610> that

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
back into the computer you can see that

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.510 
back into the computer you can see that
it<00:00:50.910> opens<00:00:51.270> up<00:00:51.449> iTunes<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> background

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
it opens up iTunes in the background

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.970 
it opens up iTunes in the background
here<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.719> iPhone<00:00:55.140> shows<00:00:55.469> right<00:00:55.739> up

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
here and the iPhone shows right up

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.099 
here and the iPhone shows right up
that's<00:00:56.520> because<00:00:57.000> when<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.390> installs<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.960> has

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
that's because when it installs it has

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.740 
that's because when it installs it has
Apple<00:00:58.559> mobile<00:00:58.710> support<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.460> basically<00:01:00.359> it's

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
Apple mobile support and basically it's

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.979 
Apple mobile support and basically it's
meant<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.170> work<00:01:01.469> with<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.100> iTunes<00:01:02.930> okay<00:01:03.930> so

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
meant to work with the iTunes okay so

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.469 
meant to work with the iTunes okay so
