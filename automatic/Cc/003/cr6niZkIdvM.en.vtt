00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hi guys, I'm going to show you something today. 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.600
 I really like that it's an eye I found 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.500
 Another time to show it to me. 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.170
 you 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.300
 and this one is covered in chocolate makes 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.990
 time I'm looking for and no 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.600
 I found it coming in a box like that 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.020
 I think we have four or six 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.910
 packs of itself something like this 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.189
 here when I went to buy from a 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.480
 catharsis to sell the last box only 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.939
 she had an open 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.880
 so I thought it was good too because 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.430
 I think it 's a box we cost 27 and 30 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.739
 real and I paid 4 bit per 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.340
 Packet then, to prove it's better. 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.890
 huh 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.440
 I think it's a little pricey so $ 30 a 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.350
 box of oil because in the United States 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.300
 She's really cheap so try to show. 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.940
 I bought for you by continued 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.070
 separated so I think 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.079
 usually does not come apart because they 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.879
 they had a squeeze and that's what you 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.800
 ask I found at the mall Curitiba 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.110
 what is there is a wine store 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.780
 then it was there that I found 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.790
 I always encounter different things there in the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.130
 Christmas find those balls of 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.200
 sugar so from time to time so 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.180
 different things appear there and it seems 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.840
 that he always has these eyes covered 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.330
 there has also not white late drive 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.729
 I'm going to open the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.119
 to taste this chocolate covered hour 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.610
 it to you just as I have said is not 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.890
 well a little box and I do not know how many 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.329
 come the researcher I write in my pocket 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.220
 information from people who have 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:41.630
 box with it is rather covered with 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.610
 Same chocolate is a little melted 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:50.750
 and it's not so hot it 's really stuck 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.750
 so and so then the likely 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.240
 Serious people, it's very, very good, I'm super. 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.440
 I regret now that I have not bought 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.090
 the 4 little packs that I had because 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.180

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.340

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.450

 Sergio is perfect, it's not even sweet. 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.220
 It's not bitter chocolate but it's also 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.620
 is not so sweet and just chocolate goes 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:06.070

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:08.470
 People were going to layer chocolate is just fine. 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.310

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.290
