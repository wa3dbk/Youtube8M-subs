00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.950
 you often come across while knitting 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:12.150
 so that you need to connect wide 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.690
 stripes of different colors and not at all convenient 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.620
 then refill the tips of the threads peak shift 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.170
 colors 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.380
 so now we will see how 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:27.450
 you can do it easily and simply in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:35.160
 knitting process and so I knit firms 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:40.699
 cool and I have to tie 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:46.559
 a wide strip of a different color I trim 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:48.030
 thread tail is sent to the clamp on 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.059
 thread tensioners 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.679
 and before you insert into the carriage 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.230
 thread of a different color i immediately 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:01.530
 I will remove this tip so that I 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.089
 then did not have to crochet it 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.089
 or sing no trap 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.960
 I put some needles on the edge 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:18.150
 forward non-working position and then 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.500
 I lay this thread alternately under 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.240
 a needle or 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.000
 above the needle I insert into the carriage not 2 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:35.730
 tail color hold it so that it does not 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.210
 interfered and knit 1 year you see 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.820
 red thread neatly hidden 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.410
 tom will remain after the end of knitting 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:50.010
 just cut the tail but we have the second 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.210
 the problem is we have a new tail and therefore with 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.050
 of the same side 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:00.660
 despite the fact that it is rarely 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:04.310
 on the left I lay a thread 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:07.680
 2 colors and knit 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:16.230
 you see the threads hidden perfectly 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:21.630
 imperceptibly right after or after graduation 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:26.130
 knitting I remove the tail same I 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.940
 do with all the other colors how many 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.460
 I didn't need you to knit them 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.060
 the main thing that you lay the tail 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:39.450
 over the same color that is if i 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.260
 Now I will fill again for example 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.830
 red color I will not lay an hour 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:03:02.130
 a thread of red I will tie one 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:03:06.390
 row in red and after that over 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:13.739
 red row, I'll build a red ponytail 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:17.360
 and so on and now you see the edge 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:20.360
 which we have turned out very 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.360
 orderly
