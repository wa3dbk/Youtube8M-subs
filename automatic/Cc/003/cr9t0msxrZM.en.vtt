00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.059 
year and it's normally a regular on a GP
circuit<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:35.420> i<00:01:35.659> know<00:01:36.229> what<00:01:36.439> it's<00:01:36.560> like<00:01:36.619> I<00:01:36.890> quite

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
circuit so i know what it's like I quite

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:38.889 
circuit so i know what it's like I quite
enjoy<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.520> there<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.090> obviously<00:01:38.420> we've<00:01:38.749> got

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
enjoy it there and obviously we've got

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.230 
enjoy it there and obviously we've got
Tommy<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.409> Jake<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:40.189> a<00:01:40.219> team<00:01:40.429> alongside<00:01:40.819> me

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
Tommy and Jake and a team alongside me

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.200 
Tommy and Jake and a team alongside me
so<00:01:41.450> I<00:01:41.810> think<00:01:42.560> we<00:01:42.770> can<00:01:42.890> do<00:01:43.009> a<00:01:43.039> good<00:01:43.399> job<00:01:43.460> I<00:01:43.880> mean

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
so I think we can do a good job I mean

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.690 
so I think we can do a good job I mean
not<00:01:44.810> going<00:01:45.319> to<00:01:45.409> blow<00:01:45.770> out<00:01:45.979> proportion<00:01:46.520> but<00:01:46.640> I

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
not going to blow out proportion but I

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.889 
not going to blow out proportion but I
think<00:01:46.939> we<00:01:47.030> should<00:01:47.179> just<00:01:47.210> go<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:47.569> do<00:01:47.719> our<00:01:47.749> own

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
think we should just go and do our own

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.440 
think we should just go and do our own
race<00:01:48.319> and<00:01:49.130> each<00:01:49.249> class<00:01:49.549> and<00:01:49.850> I<00:01:49.880> think<00:01:50.090> if<00:01:50.179> we<00:01:50.299> do

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
race and each class and I think if we do

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.809 
race and each class and I think if we do
how<00:01:51.319> we<00:01:51.350> should<00:01:51.829> do<00:01:52.009> in<00:01:52.159> each<00:01:52.249> class<00:01:52.549> then<00:01:52.759> I

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
how we should do in each class then I

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:53.980 
how we should do in each class then I
think<00:01:52.999> we<00:01:53.060> should<00:01:53.090> be<00:01:53.329> in<00:01:53.389> for<00:01:53.539> a<00:01:53.600> good<00:01:53.630> result

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
think we should be in for a good result

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.719 
think we should be in for a good result
so<00:01:54.200> should<00:01:54.710> be<00:01:54.770> good<00:01:54.859> do<00:01:55.219> you<00:01:55.280> have<00:01:55.369> any<00:01:55.520> plans

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
so should be good do you have any plans

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.629 
so should be good do you have any plans
