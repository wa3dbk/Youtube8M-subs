that I can find in there

that I can find in there
so<00:03:04.150> that's<00:03:04.390> how<00:03:04.570> I<00:03:04.600> organize<00:03:05.640> my<00:03:06.640> under<00:03:07.210> the

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
so that's how I organize my under the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.510 
so that's how I organize my under the
sink<00:03:07.690> my<00:03:08.530> recommendation<00:03:09.250> would<00:03:09.340> be<00:03:09.400> to

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
sink my recommendation would be to

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.460 
sink my recommendation would be to
measure<00:03:10.360> it<00:03:10.600> just<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.900> make<00:03:10.990> sure<00:03:11.170> you<00:03:11.290> have

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
measure it just to make sure you have

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.820 
measure it just to make sure you have
enough<00:03:11.770> room<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:13.050> hopefully<00:03:14.050> this<00:03:14.230> helped<00:03:14.650> if

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
enough room and hopefully this helped if

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.420 
enough room and hopefully this helped if
