 to be in the shadow of the aid of a 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.600
 area professional in the case of a 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.270
 landscaper is key to the creation of 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.180
 garden that works well 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.219

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.430
 water with water as silly and giving a 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.950
 very interesting effect 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.119

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.119
 nice little noise 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.950

 I lived with flowers 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.390

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.370

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.370
 stones vases jars composing the environment 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.770

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.800

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.869
 vegetation to wood and tile 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.020
