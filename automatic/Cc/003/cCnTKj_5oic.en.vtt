unique situation here having not brought
the<00:00:20.230> trucks<00:00:20.530> so<00:00:21.220> we've<00:00:21.340> had<00:00:21.370> to<00:00:21.490> pile

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
the trucks so we've had to pile

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.400 
the trucks so we've had to pile
everything<00:00:21.940> into<00:00:22.360> the<00:00:22.450> containers<00:00:22.990> outside

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
everything into the containers outside

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.200 
everything into the containers outside

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
pretty generous in size so basically by

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.109
