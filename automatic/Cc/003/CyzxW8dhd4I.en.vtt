water<00:00:38.520> course<00:00:38.880> starts<00:00:39.390> with<00:00:39.480> some<00:00:40.320> theory<00:00:40.740> it

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
water course starts with some theory it

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.000 
water course starts with some theory it
then<00:00:42.150> moves<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.630> to<00:00:42.690> some<00:00:43.050> practical<00:00:43.410> work<00:00:43.680> by

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
then moves on to some practical work by

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.180 
then moves on to some practical work by
learning<00:00:44.490> by<00:00:44.610> doing<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:45.630> lot<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.260> repetition<00:00:46.410> so

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
learning by doing a lot of repetition so

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.610 
learning by doing a lot of repetition so
that<00:00:47.370> you're<00:00:47.970> confident<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.600> all<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
that you're confident with all the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.850 
that you're confident with all the
equipment<00:00:49.860> or<00:00:50.490> the<00:00:50.520> theory<00:00:51.060> and<00:00:51.650> being<00:00:52.650> in<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
equipment or the theory and being in the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.720 
equipment or the theory and being in the
water<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.400> then<00:00:54.680> after<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> academics<00:00:56.460> part

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
water and then after the academics part

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.570 
water and then after the academics part
you<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.150> the<00:00:57.800> training<00:00:58.800> part<00:00:59.010> where<00:00:59.370> we<00:00:59.430> go

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
you have the training part where we go

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:22.300 
you have the training part where we go
in<00:00:59.700> the<00:00:59.790> water

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.940 

the<00:01:22.730> mass<00:01:22.910> clearing<00:01:23.330> underwater<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:24.230> can<00:01:24.830> be

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
the mass clearing underwater I can be

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.080 
the mass clearing underwater I can be
the<00:01:25.040> most<00:01:25.160> difficult<00:01:25.670> for<00:01:25.910> some<00:01:26.060> people

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
the most difficult for some people

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.210 
the most difficult for some people
having<00:01:26.660> water<00:01:26.990> around<00:01:27.260> your<00:01:27.440> nose<00:01:27.590> it's<00:01:28.040> a

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
having water around your nose it's a

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.250 
having water around your nose it's a
little<00:01:28.880> bit<00:01:29.000> awkward<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.510> it's<00:01:29.630> not<00:01:29.840> natural

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
little bit awkward and it's not natural

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.660 
little bit awkward and it's not natural
so<00:01:31.040> we<00:01:31.580> practice<00:01:31.760> putting<00:01:33.190> water<00:01:34.190> into<00:01:34.490> the

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
so we practice putting water into the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.370 
so we practice putting water into the
mask<00:01:34.880> small<00:01:35.330> amounts<00:01:35.720> first<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.260> then<00:01:36.350> a

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
mask small amounts first and then a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.620 
mask small amounts first and then a
little<00:01:36.590> bit<00:01:36.740> more<00:01:36.800> a<00:01:37.010> little<00:01:37.340> bit<00:01:37.370> more<00:01:37.670> until

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
little bit more a little bit more until

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.450 
little bit more a little bit more until
you're<00:01:38.870> completely<00:01:39.050> confident<00:01:39.770> having<00:01:40.220> water

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
you're completely confident having water

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.480 
you're completely confident having water
in<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.790> mask<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:42.140> mask<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.530> flood<00:01:42.800> for<00:01:43.070> any

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
in the mask the mask and flood for any

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.640 
in the mask the mask and flood for any
reason<00:01:43.910> with<00:01:44.150> it<00:01:44.300> malfunctioning<00:01:45.080> or<00:01:45.260> with

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
reason with it malfunctioning or with

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.260 
reason with it malfunctioning or with
some<00:01:45.950> cream<00:01:46.160> too<00:01:46.430> much<00:01:46.610> Sun<00:01:46.820> cream<00:01:47.000> on<00:01:47.150> your

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
some cream too much Sun cream on your

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.140 
some cream too much Sun cream on your
face<00:01:47.300> can<00:01:48.110> cause<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.410> massive<00:01:49.100> flood<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:50.030> as

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
face can cause a massive flood so as

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.660 
face can cause a massive flood so as
long<00:01:50.300> as<00:01:50.450> you're<00:01:50.570> confident<00:01:50.990> with<00:01:51.470> water<00:01:52.400> you

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
long as you're confident with water you

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.880 
long as you're confident with water you
can<00:01:52.850> confidently<00:01:53.390> remove<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.470> water<00:01:54.650> is

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
can confidently remove the water is

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.480 
can confidently remove the water is

wealth and mask yep when you recover the
regulator<00:01:59.180> in<00:01:59.360> case<00:01:59.540> someone<00:01:59.810> was<00:01:59.930> to<00:02:00.050> knock<00:02:00.290> a

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
regulator in case someone was to knock a

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.680 
regulator in case someone was to knock a
regulator<00:02:00.860> from<00:02:01.160> your<00:02:01.340> mouth<00:02:01.550> or<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:02.510> to

laugh<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.200> spit<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:03.590> out<00:02:03.710> by<00:02:04.040> accident<00:02:04.270> we

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
laugh and spit it out by accident we

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.060 
laugh and spit it out by accident we
show<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.510> how<00:02:05.660> to<00:02:05.720> recover<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.380> confidently

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
show you how to recover it confidently

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.580 
show you how to recover it confidently
nice<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:07.910> slow<00:02:08.149> but<00:02:08.810> meanwhile<00:02:09.290> always

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
nice and slow but meanwhile always

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.740 
nice and slow but meanwhile always
blowing<00:02:09.800> small<00:02:10.160> bubbles<00:02:10.520> from<00:02:11.090> your<00:02:11.270> mouth<00:02:11.390> so

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
blowing small bubbles from your mouth so

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
blowing small bubbles from your mouth so
that<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.960> don't<00:02:12.170> hold<00:02:12.320> your<00:02:12.590> breath

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
that you don't hold your breath

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.130 
that you don't hold your breath
underwater<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.150> we<00:02:14.420> practice<00:02:14.780> this<00:02:14.930> until

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
underwater and we practice this until

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.650 
underwater and we practice this until
it's<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.500> slick<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.400> confident<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.270> learn<00:02:17.480> by

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
it's a slick and confident you learn by

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.430 
it's a slick and confident you learn by
doing<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:19.430> out<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.790> air<00:02:19.970> as<00:02:20.120> well<00:02:20.380> out<00:02:21.380> of

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
doing and the out of air as well out of

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.550 
doing and the out of air as well out of
air<00:02:21.770> drill<00:02:22.100> would<00:02:22.400> be<00:02:22.870> practicing<00:02:23.870> if<00:02:24.170> you're

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
air drill would be practicing if you're

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.550 
air drill would be practicing if you're
not<00:02:24.770> paying<00:02:25.280> attention<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.760> your<00:02:25.970> air<00:02:26.560> then

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
not paying attention to your air then

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.430 
not paying attention to your air then
you<00:02:27.890> can<00:02:28.280> run<00:02:28.489> out<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.700> air<00:02:29.060> it's<00:02:29.959> very<00:02:30.170> rare

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
you can run out of air it's very rare

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.479 
you can run out of air it's very rare
but<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.890> could<00:02:31.070> happen

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
but it could happen

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.670 
but it could happen
so<00:02:31.910> we<00:02:32.239> go<00:02:32.420> through<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.690> drill<00:02:33.020> where<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:33.500> would

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
so we go through a drill where you would

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.949 
so we go through a drill where you would
use<00:02:33.950> your<00:02:34.580> body's<00:02:34.880> air<00:02:35.150> source<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.630> share<00:02:35.840> the

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
use your body's air source and share the

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.470 
use your body's air source and share the
same<00:02:36.170> tank<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.800> do<00:02:36.920> an<00:02:37.040> ascent<00:02:37.400> there<00:02:38.090> are<00:02:38.239> five

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
same tank to do an ascent there are five

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.500 
same tank to do an ascent there are five

we<00:02:53.480> have<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.660> assessment<00:02:54.500> dives<00:02:54.770> where<00:02:55.070> we<00:02:55.250> have

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
we have a assessment dives where we have

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.370 
we have a assessment dives where we have
four<00:02:55.640> dives<00:02:55.880> where<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.420> prove<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.959> me<00:02:57.080> that

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
four dives where you prove to me that

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:14.259 
four dives where you prove to me that
you<00:02:57.500> can<00:02:57.680> do<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.220> dives

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.229 

okay<00:03:15.269> around<00:03:15.629> here<00:03:15.840> we<00:03:15.959> get<00:03:16.079> a<00:03:16.140> lot<00:03:16.349> of<00:03:17.239> turtles

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
okay around here we get a lot of turtles

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.800 
okay around here we get a lot of turtles
we<00:03:19.109> get<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.319> lot<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.879> angelfish<00:03:20.879> some

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
we get a lot of angelfish some

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.879 
we get a lot of angelfish some
triggerfish<00:03:22.700> some<00:03:23.700> spiders<00:03:24.269> with<00:03:24.420> big<00:03:24.629> heads

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
triggerfish some spiders with big heads

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:30.110 
triggerfish some spiders with big heads
and<00:03:25.889> some<00:03:26.370> crabs<00:03:28.159> but<00:03:29.159> various<00:03:29.549> aquatic<00:03:29.790> life

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
and some crabs but various aquatic life

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.920 
and some crabs but various aquatic life
and<00:03:30.650> you'll<00:03:31.650> be<00:03:31.769> assessed<00:03:32.069> on<00:03:32.250> all<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.489> dives

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
and you'll be assessed on all the dives

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.390 
and you'll be assessed on all the dives
hopefully<00:03:33.930> afterwards<00:03:34.319> if<00:03:34.889> you<00:03:35.250> get<00:03:35.370> a

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
hopefully afterwards if you get a

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.460 
hopefully afterwards if you get a
hundred<00:03:35.639> percent<00:03:35.790> on<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.359> exam<00:03:36.689> you've<00:03:37.319> got<00:03:37.439> a

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
hundred percent on the exam you've got a

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.919 
hundred percent on the exam you've got a
free<00:03:37.680> beer
