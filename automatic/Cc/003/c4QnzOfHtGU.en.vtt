00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.420
 we can see that we also have what 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.820
 is the whatsapp so if we have 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.520
 other friends or family members who

 gps that we can download from the market 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.510
 or leave thousands of gps forgiveness being the 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.450
 gps is as much as it is for this 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.709
 cellular continues to rise and as with 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.530
 other applications that can lower 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.090
 games and others that now we are going to go 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.980
