00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
new interface for the crane world so as

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.090 
new interface for the crane world so as
you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.110> see<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> name<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.740> seed<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
you can see the name and seed on the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.039 
you can see the name and seed on the
left<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.670> much<00:01:38.970> easier<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.479> type<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.930> there

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
left it's much easier to type in there

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.270 
left it's much easier to type in there
now<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.770> used<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.130> where

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280

now it's not like it used to be where
you<00:01:41.670> got<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> seed<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.570> would<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.840> to

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you got the seed and it would like to

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.300 
you got the seed and it would like to
get<00:01:43.170> all<00:01:43.320> glitchy<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.829> things<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.189> can

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
get all glitchy and things and you can

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.200 
get all glitchy and things and you can
change<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.610> from<00:01:44.700> creative<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.180> survival

the right that's the hardest level so
that<00:02:23.880> will<00:02:24.060> make<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.660> know<00:02:24.690> relatively

difficult with a lot of creatures around

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.430 
difficult with a lot of creatures around
and<00:02:27.600> if<00:02:27.720> you've<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.020> middle<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.260> know

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
and if you've in the middle you know

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.290 
and if you've in the middle you know
it's<00:02:28.590> like<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.740> normal<00:02:29.130> mode<00:02:29.250> there's<00:02:30.000> also<00:02:30.150> the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
it's like a normal mode there's also the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.430 
it's like a normal mode there's also the
third<00:02:30.450> person<00:02:30.600> view<00:02:31.020> which<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.320> now

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
third person view which is now

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.620 
third person view which is now
accessible<00:02:31.770> from<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.220> options<00:02:32.700> menu<00:02:32.850> like

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
accessible from the options menu like

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.630 
accessible from the options menu like
you<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:33.870> see<00:02:33.990> right<00:02:34.020> there<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.440> d-pad<00:02:35.280> size

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
you can see right there the d-pad size

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.070 
you can see right there the d-pad size
so<00:02:35.970> maybe<00:02:36.209> your<00:02:36.360> hands<00:02:36.630> are<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.840> little<00:02:36.870> bit

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
so maybe your hands are a little bit

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.540 
so maybe your hands are a little bit
smaller<00:02:37.290> than<00:02:37.440> normal<00:02:37.650> people<00:02:37.830> well<00:02:38.370> not

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
smaller than normal people well not

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.370 
smaller than normal people well not
normal<00:02:38.940> necessarily<00:02:39.570> but<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:40.050> know<00:02:40.170> just

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
normal necessarily but you know just

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.979 
normal necessarily but you know just
smaller<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.920> um<00:02:41.670> some<00:02:42.569> of<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.780> want<00:02:42.930> to

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
smaller and um some of you want to

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.420 
smaller and um some of you want to
shrink<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.260> size<00:02:43.440> there<00:02:43.770> or<00:02:43.950> maybe<00:02:44.220> your

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
shrink the size there or maybe your

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.710 
shrink the size there or maybe your
hands<00:02:44.730> are<00:02:44.820> bigger<00:02:45.030> maybe<00:02:45.209> just<00:02:45.390> want<00:02:45.510> out<00:02:45.690> of

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
hands are bigger maybe just want out of

not<00:02:52.170> your<00:02:52.530> single-player<00:02:52.920> words<00:02:53.280> are<00:02:53.459> local

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
not your single-player words are local

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.360 
not your single-player words are local
so<00:02:54.000> people<00:02:54.360> can<00:02:54.450> join<00:02:54.660> now<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.500> next<00:02:55.620> setting

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
so people can join now the next setting

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.340 
so people can join now the next setting
down<00:02:56.519> is<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:56.910> controls<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:57.600> here's<00:02:58.290> a

sensitivity on the top see it's by

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.420 
sensitivity on the top see it's by
default<00:03:01.410> in<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.620> middle<00:03:01.890> that's<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.220> default

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
left out now play metuchen split

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.500 
left out now play metuchen split
controls<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.850> used<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.090> be<00:03:27.239> where<00:03:27.360> you<00:03:27.420> could

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
controls it used to be where you could

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.539 
controls it used to be where you could
only<00:03:27.630> select<00:03:28.019> split<00:03:28.350> controls<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:28.950> play<00:03:29.400> with

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
only select split controls and play with

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.100 
only select split controls and play with
touch<00:03:29.760> was<00:03:30.000> actually<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.570> default<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.049> it

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
touch was actually the default so it

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.630 
touch was actually the default so it
didn't<00:03:31.320> even<00:03:31.380> show<00:03:31.590> up<00:03:31.620> but<00:03:32.190> now<00:03:32.310> it's<00:03:32.489> showing

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
didn't even show up but now it's showing

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.850 
didn't even show up but now it's showing
it<00:03:32.820> more<00:03:33.090> of<00:03:33.150> an<00:03:33.239> equalized<00:03:33.660> level<00:03:34.110> or<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.709> can

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
it more of an equalized level or you can

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.680 
it more of an equalized level or you can
actually<00:03:35.010> see<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.790> know<00:03:35.820> select<00:03:36.239> which<00:03:36.480> one

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
actually see you know select which one

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.229 
actually see you know select which one
you<00:03:36.840> want<00:03:37.140> rather<00:03:37.680> than<00:03:37.829> having<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.850> default

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
you want rather than having the default

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.060 
you want rather than having the default
if<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.570> don't<00:03:39.750> pick<00:03:40.079> so<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.530> get<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.739> pick<00:03:40.860> now

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
if you don't pick so you get to pick now

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.699 
if you don't pick so you get to pick now
I<00:03:41.310> believe<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.090> default<00:03:42.510> will<00:03:42.750> be<00:03:43.019> play<00:03:43.560> with

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
I believe the default will be play with

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.890 
I believe the default will be play with
touch<00:03:43.950> but<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:45.299> know<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.480> lot<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.810> people

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
touch but you know a lot of people

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.960 
touch but you know a lot of people
prefer<00:03:46.350> split<00:03:46.799> controls<00:03:47.220> not<00:03:47.640> only<00:03:47.850> for

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
prefer split controls not only for

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.670 
prefer split controls not only for
recording<00:03:48.450> before<00:03:48.630> actual<00:03:49.019> gameplay<00:03:49.230> and

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
recording before actual gameplay and

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.800 
recording before actual gameplay and
also<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.760> feedback<00:03:51.120> button<00:03:51.360> then<00:03:51.540> it's<00:03:51.690> not

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
also the feedback button then it's not

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.050 
also the feedback button then it's not
feedback<00:03:52.230> like<00:03:52.500> develop<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.549> few<00:03:53.760> packets

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
feedback like develop a few packets

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.850

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
devices like a phone with a vibrational

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.530 
devices like a phone with a vibrational

fancy graphics and got the sky and
maximize<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.890> view<00:04:29.010> distance<00:04:29.460> or<00:04:29.900> you've<00:04:30.900> got

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
maximize the view distance or you've got

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.530 
maximize the view distance or you've got
nose<00:04:31.830> view<00:04:32.310> distance<00:04:32.670> and<00:04:32.820> no<00:04:33.000> scar<00:04:33.360> you

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
nose view distance and no scar you

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.540 
nose view distance and no scar you
couldn't<00:04:33.840> select<00:04:34.260> interval<00:04:35.070> based<00:04:35.250> on<00:04:35.460> your

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
couldn't select interval based on your

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.800 
couldn't select interval based on your
device<00:04:35.790> but<00:04:36.060> now<00:04:36.180> it's<00:04:36.390> been<00:04:36.510> completely

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
device but now it's been completely

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.840 
device but now it's been completely
revamped<00:04:37.230> so<00:04:37.500> everyone<00:04:38.010> with<00:04:38.160> every<00:04:38.550> sort<00:04:38.790> of

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
revamped so everyone with every sort of

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.940 
revamped so everyone with every sort of
device<00:04:39.180> can<00:04:39.840> choose<00:04:40.080> specifically<00:04:40.680> what<00:04:40.830> they

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
device can choose specifically what they

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.010 
device can choose specifically what they
like<00:04:41.190> obviously<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.240> fancy<00:04:42.540> graphics<00:04:42.720> is

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
like obviously the fancy graphics is

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.690 
like obviously the fancy graphics is
still<00:04:43.230> available<00:04:43.680> that<00:04:44.070> basically<00:04:44.250> includes

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
still available that basically includes

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.360 
still available that basically includes
some<00:04:45.630> minimal<00:04:46.290> tweaks<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.710> how<00:04:46.830> it's<00:04:47.010> rendered

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
some minimal tweaks to how it's rendered

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.910 
some minimal tweaks to how it's rendered
along<00:04:47.880> with<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:49.020> trees<00:04:49.320> and<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.620> leaves

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
along with the the trees and the leaves

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.310 
along with the the trees and the leaves
and<00:04:50.340> how<00:04:50.520> they're<00:04:50.790> seeable<00:04:51.240> also<00:04:52.170> with

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
and how they're seeable also with

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.980 
and how they're seeable also with
shading<00:04:53.040> and<00:04:53.190> shadowing<00:04:53.520> very<00:04:54.360> little<00:04:54.930> of

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
shading and shadowing very little of

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.200 
shading and shadowing very little of
that<00:04:55.140> but<00:04:55.410> also<00:04:55.710> beautiful<00:04:56.610> skies<00:04:56.820> you<00:04:57.060> now

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
that but also beautiful skies you now

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.030 
that but also beautiful skies you now
toggle<00:04:57.540> that<00:04:57.600> on<00:04:57.780> and<00:04:57.960> off<00:04:58.140> depending<00:04:58.590> on<00:04:58.950> what

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
toggle that on and off depending on what

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.560 
toggle that on and off depending on what
you<00:04:59.130> like<00:04:59.280> few<00:04:59.550> device<00:04:59.850> doesn't<00:05:00.120> matter<00:05:00.420> if

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
you like few device doesn't matter if

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.700 
you like few device doesn't matter if
you're<00:05:00.600> on<00:05:00.810> fancy<00:05:01.020> graphics<00:05:01.290> are<00:05:01.590> not

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
you're on fancy graphics are not

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.210 
you're on fancy graphics are not
animated<00:05:02.490> water<00:05:02.840> same<00:05:03.840> idea<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.560> smooth

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.130

actually<00:05:09.360> launches<00:05:10.140> is<00:05:10.290> still<00:05:10.770> unknown<00:05:11.040> to

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
actually launches is still unknown to

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.330 
actually launches is still unknown to
this<00:05:11.580> time<00:05:11.880> and<00:05:12.470> basically<00:05:13.470> it<00:05:13.860> works<00:05:14.010> a<00:05:14.160> lot

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
this time and basically it works a lot

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.740 
this time and basically it works a lot
of<00:05:14.460> devices<00:05:14.910> but<00:05:15.030> some<00:05:15.240> devices<00:05:15.480> that<00:05:15.660> have

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
of devices but some devices that have

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.630 
of devices but some devices that have
been<00:05:15.870> tested<00:05:16.020> it<00:05:16.320> simply<00:05:16.710> didn't<00:05:17.040> work<00:05:17.220> so

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
been tested it simply didn't work so

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.520 
been tested it simply didn't work so
that's<00:05:18.300> why<00:05:18.510> it's<00:05:18.540> a<00:05:18.720> sort<00:05:18.900> of<00:05:19.020> experimental

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
that's why it's a sort of experimental

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.650 
that's why it's a sort of experimental
it's<00:05:19.860> not<00:05:20.010> guaranteed<00:05:20.250> some<00:05:20.760> devices<00:05:21.030> your

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
it's not guaranteed some devices your

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.480 
it's not guaranteed some devices your
turn<00:05:21.840> on<00:05:22.020> looks<00:05:22.440> gorgeous<00:05:22.770> looks<00:05:23.190> just<00:05:23.370> like

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
turn on looks gorgeous looks just like

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.960 
turn on looks gorgeous looks just like
the<00:05:23.610> pc<00:05:24.060> version<00:05:24.590> really<00:05:25.590> quite<00:05:25.920> nice<00:05:26.220> but

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
the pc version really quite nice but

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.850 
the pc version really quite nice but
some<00:05:27.150> devices<00:05:27.480> you<00:05:27.780> turn<00:05:27.990> it<00:05:28.110> on<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:28.500> there's

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
some devices you turn it on and there's

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.130 
some devices you turn it on and there's
literally<00:05:29.310> no<00:05:29.669> difference<00:05:30.210> so<00:05:30.480> that's<00:05:30.870> why

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
literally no difference so that's why

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.220 
literally no difference so that's why
it's<00:05:31.169> listed<00:05:31.620> there<00:05:31.890> it's<00:05:32.430> kind<00:05:32.760> of<00:05:32.880> a<00:05:33.230> you

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
it's listed there it's kind of a you

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.230 
it's listed there it's kind of a you
know<00:05:34.260> it's<00:05:34.560> kind<00:05:34.710> of<00:05:34.820> not<00:05:35.820> completely

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
know it's kind of not completely

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.760 
know it's kind of not completely
finished<00:05:36.450> button<00:05:37.020> but<00:05:37.260> hopefully<00:05:37.650> the

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
finished button but hopefully the

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.920 
finished button but hopefully the
toggling<00:05:38.190> does<00:05:38.430> work<00:05:38.669> following<00:05:39.330> by<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:39.690> time

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
toggling does work following by the time

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.230 
toggling does work following by the time
it's<00:05:40.080> launched<00:05:40.470> entirely<00:05:41.460> now<00:05:42.000> when<00:05:42.150> I<00:05:42.180> go

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
it's launched entirely now when I go

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.590 
it's launched entirely now when I go
back<00:05:42.419> to<00:05:42.480> the<00:05:42.630> menu<00:05:42.810> and<00:05:44.000> that<00:05:45.000> is<00:05:45.180> basically

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
back to the menu and that is basically

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.450 
back to the menu and that is basically
all<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:46.169> zero<00:05:46.500> point<00:05:46.650> seven<00:05:46.830> pi<00:05:47.010> know<00:05:47.160> now

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
all the zero point seven pi know now

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.200 
all the zero point seven pi know now
we're<00:05:47.550> going<00:05:47.640> to<00:05:47.700> talk<00:05:47.820> about<00:05:47.940> it<00:05:48.120> real

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
we're going to talk about it real

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.230 
we're going to talk about it real
quickly<00:05:48.390> um<00:05:48.660> it<00:05:49.290> will<00:05:49.620> be<00:05:50.190> launched<00:05:50.550> in<00:05:50.700> May

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
quickly um it will be launched in May

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.080 
quickly um it will be launched in May
first<00:05:51.540> it<00:05:52.169> will<00:05:52.410> be<00:05:52.560> um<00:05:54.770> from<00:05:55.770> for<00:05:56.760> all<00:05:56.880> devices

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
first it will be um from for all devices

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.210 
first it will be um from for all devices
Apple<00:05:57.630> and<00:05:57.720> Android<00:05:57.810> Apple<00:05:58.650> has<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:58.770> approve

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
Apple and Android Apple has to approve

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.040 
Apple and Android Apple has to approve
so<00:05:59.520> we<00:05:59.610> don't<00:05:59.760> know<00:05:59.820> exactly<00:05:59.970> the<00:06:00.450> date<00:06:00.720> yeah

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
so we don't know exactly the date yeah

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.260 
so we don't know exactly the date yeah
all<00:06:01.260> right<00:06:01.410> so<00:06:01.680> once<00:06:01.860> Apple<00:06:02.250> is<00:06:02.340> one<00:06:02.940> under

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
all right so once Apple is one under

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.270 
all right so once Apple is one under
approval<00:06:03.690> from<00:06:03.750> Apple<00:06:04.140> we<00:06:04.770> will<00:06:04.890> be<00:06:04.980> able<00:06:05.130> to

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
approval from Apple we will be able to

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.280 
approval from Apple we will be able to
tell<00:06:05.580> you<00:06:05.730> exactly<00:06:06.419> what<00:06:06.660> day<00:06:06.840> it's<00:06:07.140> going<00:06:07.260> to

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
tell you exactly what day it's going to

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.780 
tell you exactly what day it's going to
come<00:06:07.410> out<00:06:07.530> because<00:06:08.040> they<00:06:08.220> can<00:06:08.370> tell<00:06:08.490> us<00:06:08.610> once

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
come out because they can tell us once

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.250 
come out because they can tell us once
they're<00:06:08.910> half<00:06:09.030> with<00:06:09.240> the<00:06:09.270> process<00:06:09.810> roughly

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
they're half with the process roughly

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.670 
they're half with the process roughly
and<00:06:11.540> that<00:06:12.540> it<00:06:12.630> will<00:06:12.720> be<00:06:12.780> available<00:06:13.020> in<00:06:13.290> buckets
