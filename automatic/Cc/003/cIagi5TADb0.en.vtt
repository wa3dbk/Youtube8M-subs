and did a CT scan and right away because
how<00:00:30.990> they<00:00:31.230> had<00:00:31.470> an<00:00:31.769> acoustic<00:00:32.250> neuroma<00:00:32.540> an

how they had an acoustic neuroma an

how they had an acoustic neuroma an
acoustic<00:00:33.990> neuroma<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.650> a<00:00:34.680> tumor<00:00:35.130> that

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
acoustic neuroma is a tumor that

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.360 
acoustic neuroma is a tumor that
gradually<00:00:36.330> takes<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.110> hearing<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.650> the<00:00:38.040> tumor

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
gradually takes the hearing as the tumor

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.700 
gradually takes the hearing as the tumor
grows<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.820> causes<00:00:39.300> balance<00:00:39.810> problems<00:00:40.350> and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
grows that causes balance problems and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.160 
grows that causes balance problems and
for<00:00:41.070> her<00:00:41.250> her<00:00:41.640> tumor<00:00:42.030> started<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.600> get<00:00:42.780> large

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
for her her tumor started to get large

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.380 
for her her tumor started to get large
enough<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.550> started<00:00:44.880> to<00:00:44.940> cause<00:00:45.180> some

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
enough that it started to cause some

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.660 
enough that it started to cause some
numbness<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> face<00:00:46.290> so<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.800> pushing<00:00:47.370> on

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
numbness in the face so it's pushing on

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.220 
numbness in the face so it's pushing on
a<00:00:47.700> nerve<00:00:48.090> called<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> trigeminal<00:00:48.660> nerve

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
a nerve called the trigeminal nerve

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.930 
a nerve called the trigeminal nerve
which<00:00:49.440> gives<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.800> sensation<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.520> your<00:00:50.670> face

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
which gives you sensation to your face

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.810 
which gives you sensation to your face
so<00:00:51.210> she<00:00:51.470> not<00:00:52.470> only<00:00:52.680> had<00:00:52.770> hearing<00:00:53.070> loss<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.580> had

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
so she not only had hearing loss but had

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.370 
so she not only had hearing loss but had
other<00:00:54.240> what<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.630> call<00:00:54.660> cranial<00:00:55.200> nerve

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
other what we call cranial nerve

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.030 
other what we call cranial nerve
findings<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.880> we<00:00:57.120> went<00:00:57.450> with<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:58.140> doctor<00:00:58.620> in

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
findings and so we went with a doctor in

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.420 
findings and so we went with a doctor in
our<00:00:59.370> area<00:00:59.760> had<00:01:00.480> an<00:01:00.840> operation<00:01:01.290> that<00:01:02.010> didn't<00:01:02.280> go

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
our area had an operation that didn't go

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.939 
our area had an operation that didn't go
very<00:01:02.640> well<00:01:02.960> unfortunately<00:01:03.960> they<00:01:04.080> were<00:01:04.170> unable

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
very well unfortunately they were unable

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.819 
very well unfortunately they were unable
to<00:01:05.189> remove<00:01:05.789> much<00:01:06.539> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> tumor<00:01:07.049> at<00:01:07.350> all<00:01:07.500> I

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
to remove much of the tumor at all I

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.160 
to remove much of the tumor at all I
knew<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.310> had<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.759> another<00:01:09.060> surgery<00:01:09.420> she

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
knew I had to have another surgery she

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.919 
knew I had to have another surgery she
was<00:01:10.380> obviously<00:01:11.340> desperate<00:01:11.969> enough<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.509> come

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:12.929 
was obviously desperate enough to come

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:14.569 
was obviously desperate enough to come
all<00:01:13.109> the<00:01:13.200> way<00:01:13.229> across<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.859> country<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.340> try<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
all the way across the country to try to

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.599 
all the way across the country to try to
get<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.119> solution<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.990> her<00:01:16.049> problem

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
get a solution to her problem

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.340 
get a solution to her problem
originally<00:01:17.609> when<00:01:17.789> I<00:01:17.820> did<00:01:18.060> my<00:01:18.240> research<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:19.049> dr.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
originally when I did my research on dr.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.569 
originally when I did my research on dr.
Janata<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.249> dr.<00:01:20.579> Friedman<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.469> knew<00:01:22.469> that<00:01:23.009> they

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
Janata and dr. Friedman I knew that they

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.370 
Janata and dr. Friedman I knew that they
were<00:01:23.969> the<00:01:24.240> best<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.749> that<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:24.990> could<00:01:25.170> help

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
were the best and that they could help

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.730 
were the best and that they could help
me<00:01:25.560> both<00:01:26.070> dr.<00:01:26.429> Friedman<00:01:26.789> and<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:26.999> saw<00:01:27.420> her

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
me both dr. Friedman and I saw her

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.950 
me both dr. Friedman and I saw her
evaluated<00:01:28.740> her<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.310> saw<00:01:30.060> how<00:01:30.270> much<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.689> tumor

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
evaluated her and saw how much the tumor

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.830 
evaluated her and saw how much the tumor
had<00:01:31.109> grown<00:01:31.380> since<00:01:31.740> her<00:01:31.950> previous<00:01:32.460> surgery<00:01:32.840> we

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
had grown since her previous surgery we

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.840 
had grown since her previous surgery we
thought<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.289> her<00:01:34.409> tumor<00:01:34.649> was<00:01:34.920> too<00:01:35.159> large<00:01:35.399> for

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
thought that her tumor was too large for

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.459 
thought that her tumor was too large for
the<00:01:36.210> alternative<00:01:36.689> treatment<00:01:37.109> which<00:01:37.259> is

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
the alternative treatment which is

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.219 
the alternative treatment which is
stereotactic<00:01:38.009> radiosurgery<00:01:38.539> using<00:01:39.539> for<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
stereotactic radiosurgery using for the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.649 
stereotactic radiosurgery using for the
most<00:01:40.409> part<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.770> Gamma<00:01:40.950> Knife<00:01:41.069> she<00:01:41.880> had<00:01:42.329> what

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
most part the Gamma Knife she had what

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.690 
most part the Gamma Knife she had what
we<00:01:42.780> call<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> microscopic<00:01:43.829> total<00:01:44.219> removal<00:01:44.490> of

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
we call a microscopic total removal of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.910 
we call a microscopic total removal of
her<00:01:44.789> tumor<00:01:45.149> which<00:01:45.299> means<00:01:45.630> by<00:01:46.619> all<00:01:46.649> accounts

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
her tumor which means by all accounts

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.639 
her tumor which means by all accounts
she's<00:01:47.340> had<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> surgical<00:01:47.819> cure<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.569> was<00:01:49.380> really

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
she's had a surgical cure I was really

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.709 
she's had a surgical cure I was really
concerned<00:01:49.829> about<00:01:50.069> my<00:01:50.310> facial<00:01:50.700> nerves<00:01:50.909> he<00:01:51.539> and

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
concerned about my facial nerves he and

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.289 
concerned about my facial nerves he and
facial<00:01:52.380> paralysis<00:01:52.530> which<00:01:53.369> really<00:01:54.090> is

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
facial paralysis which really is

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.989 
facial paralysis which really is
probably<00:01:55.079> at<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.799> top<00:01:55.950> concern<00:01:56.429> of<00:01:56.579> everyone

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:56.999 
probably at the top concern of everyone

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:59.989 
probably at the top concern of everyone
who<00:01:57.149> has<00:01:57.359> an<00:01:57.600> acoustic<00:01:58.049> neuroma<00:01:58.159> when<00:01:59.159> we<00:01:59.399> do

00:01:59.989 --> 00:01:59.999 
who has an acoustic neuroma when we do

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.989 
who has an acoustic neuroma when we do
this<00:02:00.179> surgery<00:02:00.469> we<00:02:01.469> exercise<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.429> judgment

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999 
this surgery we exercise that judgment

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:06.169 
this surgery we exercise that judgment
as<00:02:03.270> far<00:02:03.569> as<00:02:04.009> balancing<00:02:05.009> getting<00:02:05.369> as<00:02:05.579> much<00:02:05.909> or

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
as far as balancing getting as much or

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.240 
as far as balancing getting as much or
all<00:02:06.359> the<00:02:06.569> tumor<00:02:06.869> out<00:02:06.899> versus<00:02:07.590> doing<00:02:07.889> something

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
all the tumor out versus doing something

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.300 
all the tumor out versus doing something
permanent<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.150> facial<00:02:09.330> nerve<00:02:09.570> and<00:02:10.010> so<00:02:11.010> we

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
permanent to the facial nerve and so we

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.210 
permanent to the facial nerve and so we
were<00:02:11.370> able<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.610> preserve<00:02:12.030> her<00:02:12.180> facial<00:02:12.540> nerve

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
were able to preserve her facial nerve

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.300 
were able to preserve her facial nerve
and<00:02:13.340> within<00:02:14.290> several<00:02:15.290> days<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.890> week<00:02:15.950> her

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
and within several days to a week her

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.590 
and within several days to a week her
facial<00:02:16.610> nerve<00:02:16.760> function<00:02:17.090> was<00:02:17.180> back<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.570> normal

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
facial nerve function was back to normal

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.110 
facial nerve function was back to normal
to<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.620> point<00:02:18.890> where<00:02:19.070> she<00:02:19.760> was<00:02:19.790> posting

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
to the point where she was posting

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.420 
to the point where she was posting
selfie<00:02:20.990> pictures<00:02:21.380> which<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.920> always<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.250> good

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
selfie pictures which is always a good

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.450 
selfie pictures which is always a good
sign<00:02:22.460> since<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:24.290> surgery<00:02:24.800> it's<00:02:25.010> been<00:02:25.220> about<00:02:25.400> a

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
sign since the surgery it's been about a

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.590 
sign since the surgery it's been about a
week<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.630> would<00:02:26.780> say<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.230> feel<00:02:28.210> almost<00:02:29.210> a

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
week and I would say I feel almost a

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.560 
week and I would say I feel almost a
hundred<00:02:29.720> percent<00:02:29.960> normal<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:31.160> that's<00:02:31.730> huge<00:02:32.210> I

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
hundred percent normal so that's huge I

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.750 
hundred percent normal so that's huge I
just<00:02:32.630> I<00:02:33.110> feel<00:02:33.380> like<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.620> have<00:02:33.740> my<00:02:33.890> life<00:02:34.100> back
