00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.900
 you already lost sharing with you and 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.880
 they are children 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.420
 hi how about i just read and that's japan 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.150
 and keep sharing with you one day 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.520
 pretty chilled here in the metropolis of 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.699
 tokyo and good without wasting time let's go 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.470
 to the subject of the video that I want to talk about today 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.900
 I really want to live in Japan that is 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.050
 the theme of this video I think japan 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.060
 has everything a little for everyone 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.279
 if you are gamer good japan has a 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.100
 culture in that if you like the anime 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.180
 well what better place than japan for the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.160
 anime manga 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.040
 if you are interested in history, Japan has 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.290
 quite history and art and good to the 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.490
 list continued by the usual 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.430
 a culture that is totally different 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.620
 to yours is a challenge to live 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.780
 long term in this country in many of 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.420
 our countries part of our culture 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.590
 is to be expressive something that you have to 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.290
 to tone it down here in my opinion is not 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.540
 easy to adapt the life of this country and 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.680
 there may be some who are not 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.170
 hard 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.409
 in Japan they have a work system 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.929
 different hierarchies are 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.390
 respected and that someone is greater 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:17.509
 that you are in the highest position 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.119
 that you put you in the position that you do not 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.450
 You can express your ideas or try to 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.359
 do something different even if your mode or 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.170
 method is better or more efficient and these 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:30.319
 you can tell them from experience 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.479
 own to some of my acquaintances 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.459
 Japanese prefer to work for 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.219
 foreign companies that companies 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:39.619
 Japanese by the pressure or level of 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.359
 commitment that is asked is from the 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.060
 company 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:46.299
 Japanese and of course, work for 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.409
 a Japanese company has its advantages 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:54.469
 yes, not everything is bad, but work is going 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.689
 to be part of your life in this country and 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.520
 you have to have mind in that you have to have 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.310
 mind that not everything is going to be so 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.709
 practical and simple here takes time 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.759
 get used to it and we do not all have the 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.780
 Same level of adaptation and tolerance 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.899
 this heard from many foreigners 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.849
 living 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.819
 that you can live for many years in this 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.099
 country speak in Japanese perfectly by 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.689
 what will never stop being a foreigner 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.270
 in this country 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:25.190
 a company of work 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.190
 was born and grew up here in this country 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.000
 that is not right 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.900
 the Japanese because she has lived all her 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.900
 life in this country 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.920
 that by their appearance there are situations in 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.290
 the ones that people treat them differently and not 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.849
 they include him as part of the group of the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.110
 same way as someone who is Japanese 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.330
 by blood some of the difficulties 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.120
 to live in this country is to get a 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.950
 credit card that is not easy 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.739
 especially for us foreigners 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.560
 get a phone line is not so 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.870
 simple either sometimes do you have to 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.870
 have someone to endorse you in certain 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.260
 things how to get a place to 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.110
 rent 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.849
 sometimes it gives the impression that there is 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.129
 as a distrust of the 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.880
 foreigners by the system 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.720
 Japanese 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.430
 and if you Japanese is basic you can still 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.950
 that you go through situations in which 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.530
 some people already do your work or 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.650
 social circle as they turn around 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.400
 to see you because they are done as much 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.730
 inconvenient 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.590
 - there is trying to establish 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.350
 conversation when neither the two 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.470
 they understand very well and in some people 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.510
 You may feel stressed that you are not 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.520
 they speak English or their English is not what 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.520
 good enough to practice with you 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.360
 some people comment that almost all 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.480
 those who subscribe to this channel what 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.209
 they do because they are interested in coming to japan 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.060
 only for the anime or manga but the truth 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.280
 it does not matter no matter what the reason 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.260
 whereby people are interested in 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.020
 know about japan through this 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.080
 channel but if you're from the people who 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.660
 are seriously thinking of coming to 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.040
 live to japan just for everything you've done 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.030
 seen in the anime or manga you 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.330
 I would recommend you to come to 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.510
 japan first and see if you really 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.900
 like to live here and you get used to 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.820
 to the life of a foreigner in Japan who 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.370
 it's going to be very different from the life of a 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.229
 Anime or manga character too 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.530
 I am often asked if life in 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:44.250
 Japanese as shown in the animes and 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.490
 manga and good landscapes and activities 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.790
 and customs that show the animes 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.650
 and manga is quite a process but your life 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.169
 in Japan it will not be equal to that of a 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.110
 anime or manga character unless 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.780
 be 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.210
 to me your life in japan is going to be that of a 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.400
 foreigner living in japan so if 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.960
 you're really thinking of coming to live 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:10.720
 Japan, I recommend reading and searching 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.970
 material either in the form of blog or video 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.970
 videos of foreigners living in japan 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.590
 telling their experiences because they are 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.960
 these experiences where you are going to 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.600
 see the most precise thing about living in this country 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.210
 if you have the opportunity come to japan 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.600
 for a time either as a student of 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.360
 Japanese would be great for you to see if 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.469
 they are willing 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.750
 to build your bridge to come here 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:42.180
 indefinitely also what 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.120
 staff has not been easy reach 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.490
 point to which I am now and it is obvious 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.379
 that I have interest in this country of another 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.139
 way I would not have this channel to 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:54.629
 share with you not everything has been 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:57.000
 wonderful there are many things that has 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:06:00.300
 learned there are things that I like things 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.830
 no, and I think it's not easy to do 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.919
 video in japan you have to have 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.930
 pretty eager to be here after 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.000
 two years because around that time 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.270
 is when you realize many things 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.340
 positive negative how to make your life 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:19.740
 working here for the rest of the rest 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.949
 of your life for the rest of the time that 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.689
 be here either indefinitely or not 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.789
 this is not a video to discourage 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:29.250
 nobody but to put your feet in the 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:31.590
 land and share with you my 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.319
 points of view according to my 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.539
 experiences that can be very different 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:39.200
 to other people living here so 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:40.370
 do not take what I think of as 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.800
 because we all have different 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.170
 experiences and you can have a 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.930
 experience different from mine living 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:50.390
 in this good country I am leo and it is japan 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.980
 eastick shared with you take care and 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.310
 see you in the next see you later 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.310
 bye 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.010
 and more 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.300
 internally formative
