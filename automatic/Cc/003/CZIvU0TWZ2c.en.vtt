00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.930 
complete with snowballs at all those a
lot<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.890> fun<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.280> lot<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.430> reasons<00:00:47.789> though

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
lot of fun for a lot of reasons though

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.400 
lot of fun for a lot of reasons though
one<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> reasons<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.379> because

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
one of the reasons I like it is because

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.439 
one of the reasons I like it is because
each<00:00:49.950> snowflake<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.760> different<00:00:51.000> each<00:00:51.270> one

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
each snowflake is so different each one

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.910 
each snowflake is so different each one
is<00:00:51.570> unique<00:00:51.840> when<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.110> catch<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.379> snowflake<00:00:52.559> in

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
is unique when you catch a snowflake in

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.340 
is unique when you catch a snowflake in
your<00:00:53.010> hand<00:00:53.219> not<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.120> single<00:00:54.629> snowflake<00:00:54.870> is

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
your hand not a single snowflake is

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.139 
your hand not a single snowflake is
exactly<00:00:55.949> like<00:00:56.129> any<00:00:56.340> other<00:00:56.460> snowflake<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
exactly like any other snowflake and

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.410 
exactly like any other snowflake and
each<00:00:58.079> one<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.379> us<00:00:58.500> are<00:00:58.800> different<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.850> yet<00:01:00.270> we

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
each one of us are different and yet we

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.849 
each one of us are different and yet we
can<00:01:00.600> appreciate<00:01:00.840> differences<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.680> each

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
can appreciate differences in each

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.219 
can appreciate differences in each
difference<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.840> gift<00:01:04.080> from
