I<00:01:43.049> don't<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.229> about<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.590> case<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.979> that

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
I don't like about this case is that

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.830 
I don't like about this case is that
it's<00:01:44.220> very<00:01:44.310> light<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:45.149> would<00:01:45.329> only<00:01:45.450> wear<00:01:45.659> this

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it's very light I would only wear this

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.560 
it's very light I would only wear this
if<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.079> really<00:01:46.320> trust<00:01:46.530> myself<00:01:46.759> because<00:01:47.759> it's

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
if I really trust myself because it's

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.560 
if I really trust myself because it's
not<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.710> if<00:01:49.920> if<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.700> fell<00:01:51.060> with<00:01:51.420> your

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
not that like if if this fell with your

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.999 
not that like if if this fell with your
phone<00:01:51.750> case<00:01:51.990> they<00:01:52.140> probably<00:01:52.350> would<00:01:52.590> break<00:01:52.799> and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
phone case they probably would break and
