00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.830
 production that 30 million buy 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.710
 disclosure happens that the film yielded 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.930
 US $ 46 million in total 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.550
 american and international box office 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.199
 less than 30 million of them 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.940
 expected in the original plan 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.829
 Of course there are other ways they 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.309
 these three viruses but it seems that 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.350
 this time the north Koreans win and to 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.270
 vary look had extremely 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.000
 predictable output is now a matter of 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.550
 time to see blair's witch 3 in the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.590

 Poltergeist Cursed Cemetery Friday 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.960
 Wednesday 13 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.170
 And hey, there are people saying that 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.840

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.250
 hollywood only has 10 brilliants like 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.240
 make a white solo hunter movie 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.159
 of serious snow will get the flash going 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.900
 break the time barrier of space 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.270
 episode 15 of the first season that 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.560
 will accidentally discover that you can 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.390
 time travel 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.340
 in comics that possibility has changed 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.500
 a lot on the liberators and we'll see 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.270
 what will yield in the fox series will not 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.280
 seems satisfied with the work of 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.390
 jorge grande in the direction of quartet 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.330
 Fantastic 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.000
 or the movie is probably going to week 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.680
 debut and directed chronic power without 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.810
 limits that for me is one of the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.700
 most honest hero, keep the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.340
 success has gained direction to make 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.720
 Fantastic quartet about the executives 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.820
 fox complained that their son is 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.729
 seeming more like a power to emit 2 of the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.630
 Fantastic quartet what for me is not 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.670
 bad 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.170
 fifteen minutes of chronic is better than 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.850
 that the two previous films of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.880
 fantastic quartet together 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.850
 fox just does shit and probably they 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.540
 They'll mess with the movie that they have 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.850
 producers usually get a war 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.710
 let's hope looks like it will come out a 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.690
 trailer the day before we 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.910
