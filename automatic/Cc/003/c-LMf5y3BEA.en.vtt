through<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.079> there<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> smart<00:00:41.489> fill<00:00:41.700> cursor

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
through it there is a smart fill cursor

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.490

and soon you'll wonder how you did

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.420 
and soon you'll wonder how you did
without<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.780> when<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.680> see<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> number<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.309> the
