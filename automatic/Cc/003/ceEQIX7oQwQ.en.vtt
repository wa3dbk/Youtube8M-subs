we<00:00:13.339> were<00:00:13.459> calling<00:00:13.669> this<00:00:13.849> series<00:00:14.240> of<00:00:14.389> Pro

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
we were calling this series of Pro

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.330 
we were calling this series of Pro
Series<00:00:14.870> for<00:00:15.259> a<00:00:15.290> long<00:00:15.440> time<00:00:15.679> it<00:00:15.860> stood<00:00:16.129> for

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
Series for a long time it stood for

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.390 
Series for a long time it stood for
proto<00:00:16.580> but<00:00:17.210> we<00:00:17.450> would<00:00:17.600> just<00:00:17.630> call<00:00:18.560> it<00:00:18.680> Pro<00:00:18.920> the

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
proto but we would just call it Pro the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.400 
proto but we would just call it Pro the
term<00:00:19.790> prototype<00:00:20.300> gets<00:00:20.510> thrown<00:00:20.690> around<00:00:20.840> kind

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
term prototype gets thrown around kind

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.500 
term prototype gets thrown around kind
of<00:00:21.440> loosely<00:00:21.680> sometimes<00:00:22.280> and<00:00:22.520> so<00:00:22.670> we<00:00:23.210> really

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
of loosely sometimes and so we really

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.540 
of loosely sometimes and so we really
wanted<00:00:23.720> to<00:00:23.780> make<00:00:23.960> it<00:00:24.140> a<00:00:24.470> platform<00:00:25.190> that<00:00:25.340> we<00:00:25.430> can

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
wanted to make it a platform that we can

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.790 
wanted to make it a platform that we can
try<00:00:25.790> different<00:00:25.850> stuff<00:00:26.420> on<00:00:26.680> experiment<00:00:27.680> with

try different stuff on experiment with
different<00:00:28.100> things<00:00:28.310> put<00:00:28.730> features<00:00:29.120> on<00:00:29.270> that<00:00:29.300> we

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
different things put features on that we

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.700 
different things put features on that we
get<00:00:29.600> requests<00:00:30.020> for<00:00:30.170> master<00:00:30.530> build

instruments<00:00:30.980> so<00:00:31.430> that<00:00:31.550> people<00:00:31.820> had<00:00:32.029> a<00:00:32.210> real

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
instruments so that people had a real

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.170 
instruments so that people had a real
good<00:00:32.750> feel<00:00:33.230> of<00:00:33.260> how<00:00:33.590> things<00:00:34.190> work<00:00:34.340> together<00:00:34.670> or

electronics<00:00:38.110> parts<00:00:39.110> all<00:00:39.410> that<00:00:39.680> stuff<00:00:39.950> so<00:00:40.130> it

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
electronics parts all that stuff so it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.160 
electronics parts all that stuff so it
just<00:00:40.400> gives<00:00:40.550> us<00:00:40.700> a<00:00:40.850> platform<00:00:41.450> to<00:00:41.600> kind<00:00:41.870> of<00:00:41.990> play

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
just gives us a platform to kind of play

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.389 
just gives us a platform to kind of play
around<00:00:42.290> with

of an interesting guy he approaches

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.580 
of an interesting guy he approaches
things<00:00:59.120> differently<00:00:59.840> instead<00:01:00.140> of<00:01:00.350> the

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
things differently instead of the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.229 
things differently instead of the
traditional<00:01:01.370> way<00:01:01.489> he'll<00:01:01.730> kind<00:01:01.910> of<00:01:02.000> look<00:01:02.120> at

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
traditional way he'll kind of look at

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.790 
traditional way he'll kind of look at
things<00:01:02.329> ago<00:01:02.600> well<00:01:02.750> what<00:01:02.899> if<00:01:02.989> we<00:01:03.079> did<00:01:03.230> this<00:01:03.440> he's

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
things ago well what if we did this he's

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.530 
things ago well what if we did this he's
made<00:01:04.040> some<00:01:04.250> really<00:01:04.460> interesting<00:01:04.790> instruments

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
made some really interesting instruments

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.600 
made some really interesting instruments
out<00:01:05.659> of<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:06.440> fender<00:01:06.710> Custom<00:01:07.040> Shop<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:07.490> we

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
out of the fender Custom Shop and so we

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.090 
out of the fender Custom Shop and so we
wanted<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:07.940> give<00:01:08.360> him<00:01:08.570> kind<00:01:08.899> of<00:01:09.020> an<00:01:09.170> area<00:01:09.409> that

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
wanted to give him kind of an area that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.460 
wanted to give him kind of an area that
he<00:01:10.310> could<00:01:10.490> kind<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:10.960> experiment<00:01:11.960> with<00:01:12.080> so

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
he could kind of experiment with so

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.310 
he could kind of experiment with so
Scott<00:01:13.130> came<00:01:13.490> up<00:01:13.580> with<00:01:13.700> his<00:01:13.820> design<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:14.540> when

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
Scott came up with his design and when

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.780 
Scott came up with his design and when
he<00:01:15.409> came<00:01:15.530> up<00:01:15.649> with<00:01:15.680> design<00:01:16.100> we<00:01:16.250> started<00:01:16.700> doing

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
he came up with design we started doing

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.969 
he came up with design we started doing
it<00:01:17.060> in<00:01:17.149> fabricating<00:01:17.990> in<00:01:18.110> different<00:01:18.470> materials

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
it in fabricating in different materials

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.490 
it in fabricating in different materials
like<00:01:19.190> stainless<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:20.119> a<00:01:20.509> regular<00:01:20.810> steel<00:01:21.110> and

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
like stainless and a regular steel and

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.350 
like stainless and a regular steel and
then<00:01:21.770> I<00:01:22.100> think<00:01:22.310> he<00:01:22.429> made<00:01:22.550> one<00:01:22.700> out<00:01:22.789> of<00:01:22.880> aluminum

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
then I think he made one out of aluminum

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.540 
then I think he made one out of aluminum
and<00:01:23.539> we<00:01:24.229> tried<00:01:24.470> different<00:01:24.679> ones<00:01:25.009> and<00:01:25.250> we

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
and we tried different ones and we

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.040 
and we tried different ones and we
always<00:01:25.940> kept<00:01:26.270> coming<00:01:26.479> back<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.810> brass<00:01:27.020> the

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
always kept coming back to the brass the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.499 
always kept coming back to the brass the
brass<00:01:27.320> was<00:01:27.710> a<00:01:27.770> really<00:01:28.160> great<00:01:28.940> sound<00:01:29.149> bridge

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
brass was a really great sound bridge

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.450 
brass was a really great sound bridge
the<00:01:29.840> design<00:01:30.350> of<00:01:30.530> this<00:01:30.649> bridge<00:01:30.890> is<00:01:31.039> really<00:01:31.280> kind

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
the design of this bridge is really kind

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.529 
the design of this bridge is really kind
of<00:01:31.490> cool<00:01:31.670> because<00:01:31.850> he's<00:01:32.060> got<00:01:32.210> this<00:01:32.300> nice

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
of cool because he's got this nice

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.690 
of cool because he's got this nice
contouring<00:01:33.170> on<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.380> side<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:34.190> top<00:01:34.429> of<00:01:34.580> its

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
contouring on the side the top of its

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.999 
contouring on the side the top of its
contoured<00:01:35.119> really<00:01:35.360> neat<00:01:35.649> but<00:01:36.649> I<00:01:36.710> think<00:01:36.950> the

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
contoured really neat but I think the

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.560 
contoured really neat but I think the
most<00:01:37.190> significant<00:01:37.759> thing<00:01:37.880> about<00:01:37.910> this<00:01:38.240> base

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
most significant thing about this base

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.389 
most significant thing about this base
bridge<00:01:38.869> is<00:01:39.050> there's<00:01:39.409> two<00:01:39.590> ways<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.800> use<00:01:40.009> it

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
bridge is there's two ways to use it

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.190 
bridge is there's two ways to use it
there's<00:01:40.610> there's<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:41.000> string<00:01:41.509> through<00:01:41.780> bridge

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
there's there's a string through bridge

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.850 
there's there's a string through bridge
design<00:01:42.830> or<00:01:43.630> strings<00:01:44.630> through<00:01:44.840> body<00:01:45.050> you<00:01:45.710> can

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
design or strings through body you can

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.660 
design or strings through body you can
do<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.039> either<00:01:46.159> way

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
do it either way

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.809 
do it either way
or<00:01:46.940> you<00:01:47.750> can<00:01:47.899> do<00:01:48.319> combinations<00:01:48.619> of<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:49.729> you

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
or you can do combinations of it so you

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.580 
or you can do combinations of it so you
can<00:01:50.000> have<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.210> ena<00:01:50.569> go<00:01:50.990> through<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.350> bridge

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
can have the ena go through the bridge

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.420

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.880 
get this real punch out of the base that
that<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:52.240> don't<00:03:52.450> get<00:03:52.630> a<00:03:52.690> lot<00:03:53.080> of<00:03:53.260> other<00:03:53.350> bases

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890
