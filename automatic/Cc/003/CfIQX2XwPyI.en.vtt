00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
think it would have worked cuz it's

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.290 
think it would have worked cuz it's
politically<00:00:47.570> incorrect<00:00:48.230> in<00:00:48.620> America<00:00:49.159> so<00:00:49.339> and

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
politically incorrect in America so and
