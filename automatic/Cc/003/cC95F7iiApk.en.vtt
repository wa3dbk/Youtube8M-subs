00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280
 I go to the market I cook vitamins that 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:12.360
 we are in the end to the sidewalk 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.309
 welcome once again to sow the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.390
 Panic in the kitchen 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.250
 why are we here I wonder why 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.750
 what do we say we look like the costs of 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.550
 these of the small children that always 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.529
 they are behind and have those 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.930
 The fact is that we want to 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.050
 cook and do rich things that we 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.579
 they do exactly now we look old 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.700
 of the curtain after our great 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.170
 success of the bananas springs that were 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.149
 very rich 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.040
 but today we have decided to do something 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.720
 different 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.080
 it's something that I like a lot 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.810
 I think it's very 99 to 9% of the 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.760
 world population but the ingredients 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.510
 specials that girls also like 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.510
 in those times 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.390
 exact begins with chocolate 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.370
 chocolate with your chocolate practice 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.400
 there are usually chocolate chocolates 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.170
 like milk in the cases that today we're going 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.850
 to do something very rich and we hope that you 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.290
 encourage us to do it with us so that 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.880
 us not first us and then 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.190
 we obviously 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.600
 you are going to lose some step and it can not be 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.700
 we are panicking but not 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.930
 we want you to be alarmed 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.910
 but we want you to continue 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.560
 after keeping your texas makes 66 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.720
 and of course if we owe them 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.530
 to do is that it's a quick easy recipe 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.770
 very cheap and above all 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.229
 today we make chocolate pizza pizza if 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.119
 you do not like you are not nice 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:56.340
 so without further ado and without further 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:56.340
 procrastination and no more no more the recipe 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.180
 plus 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.479
 first we must preheat the oven to 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.039
 about 250 degrees later we put all the 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.050
 cream in a saucepan we add the 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.940
 chocolate fondant chopped and we discuss 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.470
 all the concoction can melt the 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.209
 microwave or even simmer 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.190
 when we see that more or less everything is 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.230
 we removed it from the fire and 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.970
 add 2 tablespoons of butter and 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.470
 a pinch of salt now we mix the 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.590
 melted chocolate with cream 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.330
 chocolate already gets the nocilla or the one that 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.160
 ye we are going to use in 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.230
 a cloth 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.340
 and it takes an increase in spreading the mass of 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.470
 pizza that is not yet done 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.910
 obviously so we count our mass 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.040
 of pizza with a little butter 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.670
 and then we put together the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.670
 melted chocolate 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:56.629
 introduced we introduce the piece in the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.690
 oven and we had it for about 10 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.690
 minutes 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.049
 the time came for the free rein in 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.879
 our creativity and remember our 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.489
 piece as you like, we sprinkle 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.989
 the chocolate sparks the lacasitos or 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.099
 what you want to put and something that 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.019
 it's very good are the almonds 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.450
 chopped but we can also 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.400
 throw fruits like pagan strawberries or what 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.090
 that they are that to the taste of the consumer and 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.650
 It is done 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:27.379
 you saw how rich it looks and 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.970
 there 's the challenge today 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.680
 you already know that you can leave us 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.209
 comments what is similar about this 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.340
 track and if you have done it do not forget 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.799
 to attach us in your photos and 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.739
 upload them with the hashtag has not counted 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.440
 with a Chinese kitchen imagine solving 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.790
 but to give it plot emphasis we do not 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.319
 It makes me very happy that you share with 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.730
 we all what you think to say and 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.200
 being in comments in photos and in 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.909
 everything you want and as always 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.159
 You can also give us more ideas for 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.510
 recipes and others cost although we are 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.740
 thinking about making a rich mania with 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.170
 friends 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:04.190
 so if you liked it you already know how to give 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:08.390
 I like it and we where we see each other and 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.390
 See you at the next one
