00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.990 

and<00:00:05.680> then<00:00:05.890> they<00:00:06.010> had<00:00:06.220> that<00:00:06.310> stripper<00:00:06.580> moves

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.000 
and then they had that stripper moves

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.910 
and then they had that stripper moves
captured<00:00:07.690> in<00:00:07.870> the<00:00:07.990> loop<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:09.490> then<00:00:09.730> you<00:00:09.910> pull

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
captured in the loop and then you pull

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.650 
captured in the loop and then you pull
so<00:00:11.920> what<00:00:12.040> you<00:00:12.100> get<00:00:12.309> is<00:00:12.490> just<00:00:12.520> rolling<00:00:13.000> movement

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
so what you get is just rolling movement

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.330 
so what you get is just rolling movement
from<00:00:13.809> the<00:00:13.930> thread<00:00:14.170> and<00:00:14.350> it<00:00:14.440> rolls<00:00:14.680> to<00:00:14.920> hair<00:00:15.129> out

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
from the thread and it rolls to hair out

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:23.960 
from the thread and it rolls to hair out
with<00:00:15.610> it

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.300 

it's<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.690> lot<00:00:24.810> gentler<00:00:25.080> than<00:00:25.410> waxing<00:00:25.710> because

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
it's a lot gentler than waxing because

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.760 
it's a lot gentler than waxing because
you're<00:00:26.400> not<00:00:26.490> actually<00:00:26.940> ripping<00:00:27.180> off<00:00:27.450> the<00:00:28.350> top

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
you're not actually ripping off the top

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.280 
you're not actually ripping off the top
layer<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.040> skin<00:00:29.460> you're<00:00:29.670> only<00:00:30.030> capturing<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
layer of skin you're only capturing the

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.250 
layer of skin you're only capturing the
hairs<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.830> need<00:00:32.010> to<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.160> removed<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
hairs that need to be removed and it's a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:50.160 
hairs that need to be removed and it's a
very<00:00:37.470> accurate<00:00:37.770> way<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.430> removing<00:00:39.060> hair

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.740 

so<00:00:51.070> you<00:00:51.130> do<00:00:51.399> a<00:00:51.430> down<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.210> middle<00:00:52.480> of<00:00:52.570> the

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
so you do a down the middle of the

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.350 
so you do a down the middle of the
eyebrows<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:54.670> over<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.030> top

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
eyebrows just over the top

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.180 
eyebrows just over the top
you<00:00:55.570> wouldn't<00:00:55.840> generally<00:00:56.050> take<00:00:56.680> from<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.040> top

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
you wouldn't generally take from the top

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.830 
you wouldn't generally take from the top
of<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.460> eyebrow<00:00:57.610> because<00:00:58.239> it<00:00:58.390> takes<00:00:58.629> off<00:00:58.809> that

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
of the eyebrow because it takes off that

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.960 
of the eyebrow because it takes off that
the<00:00:59.110> natural<00:00:59.500> shape<00:00:59.739> but<00:01:00.280> if<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.430> therapist<00:01:00.850> is

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
the natural shape but if a therapist is

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.430 
the natural shape but if a therapist is
doing<00:01:01.210> it<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:01.420> has<00:01:01.540> a<00:01:01.570> bird's-eye<00:01:02.020> view<00:01:02.050> you

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
doing it and has a bird's-eye view you

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.290 
doing it and has a bird's-eye view you
can<00:01:02.649> actually<00:01:02.680> take<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.430> top<00:01:03.640> down<00:01:03.670> ahead

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
can actually take the top down ahead

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:23.810 
can actually take the top down ahead
just<00:01:04.570> to<00:01:04.659> give<00:01:04.809> it<00:01:04.839> a<00:01:04.960> sharp<00:01:05.199> a<00:01:05.409> bit

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.520 

so<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.600> see<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.990> there's<00:01:25.200> slight

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
so you can see that there's slight

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.950 
so you can see that there's slight
pinkness<00:01:25.980> but<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:26.610> as<00:01:26.730> much<00:01:26.910> from<00:01:27.300> as<00:01:27.630> on

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
pinkness but it's not as much from as on

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.810 
pinkness but it's not as much from as on
your<00:01:28.140> waxing<00:01:28.650> you're<00:01:29.220> not<00:01:29.370> taking<00:01:29.700> off<00:01:29.790> that

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
your waxing you're not taking off that

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.580 
your waxing you're not taking off that
top<00:01:30.150> layer<00:01:30.330> of<00:01:30.390> skin<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.140> very<00:01:31.320> very

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
top layer of skin so it's very very

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.830 
top layer of skin so it's very very
gentle<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.310> for<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.550> sensitive<00:01:33.090> skin<00:01:33.420> person

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
gentle so for a sensitive skin person

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.180 
gentle so for a sensitive skin person
this<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.170> better<00:01:34.380> method<00:01:34.620> of<00:01:34.830> hair

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
this is the better method of hair

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:43.670 
this is the better method of hair
removal<00:01:41.690> it<00:01:42.690> feels<00:01:42.900> like<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> little<00:01:43.410> pin

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
removal it feels like the little pin

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.040 
removal it feels like the little pin
pricks<00:01:44.010> on<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.370> skin<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.450> sensation

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
pricks on the skin and the sensation

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.790 
pricks on the skin and the sensation
goes<00:01:46.200> away<00:01:46.410> after<00:01:46.620> about<00:01:46.920> five<00:01:47.190> minutes<00:01:47.220> so

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.620 

I'm<00:01:52.800> just<00:01:53.100> getting<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.490> hold<00:01:53.760> your<00:01:54.060> side

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
I'm just getting you to hold your side

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.240 
I'm just getting you to hold your side
of<00:01:54.780> your<00:01:54.900> eye<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.110> your<00:01:55.530> forehead<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:55.920> now

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
of your eye and your forehead for now

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:23.670 
of your eye and your forehead for now
just<00:01:56.790> pull<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.479> skin<00:01:57.690> taut

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.100 

it's<00:02:24.489> obviously<00:02:24.760> quite<00:02:25.000> close<00:02:25.390> treatment<00:02:25.930> so

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
it's obviously quite close treatment so

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.509 
it's obviously quite close treatment so
it's<00:02:26.260> only<00:02:26.409> the<00:02:26.590> facial<00:02:27.010> hair<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.220> can<00:02:27.459> be

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
it's only the facial hair that can be

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.130 
it's only the facial hair that can be
removed<00:02:27.670> with<00:02:28.180> reading<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.569> couldn't<00:02:28.930> do<00:02:29.019> an

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
removed with reading you couldn't do an

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.080 
removed with reading you couldn't do an
egg<00:02:29.379> because<00:02:29.799> it<00:02:29.920> takes<00:02:30.159> you<00:02:30.310> long<00:02:30.519> and

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
egg because it takes you long and

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.580 
egg because it takes you long and
obviously<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:31.450> could<00:02:31.629> go<00:02:31.810> do<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.290> bikini

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
obviously you could go do the bikini

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.190 
obviously you could go do the bikini
area<00:02:32.739> because<00:02:33.220> it's<00:02:33.370> too<00:02:34.000> much<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.450> delicate

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
area because it's too much of a delicate

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.660 
area because it's too much of a delicate
area<00:02:35.439> and<00:02:35.799> you<00:02:35.920> shouldn't<00:02:36.159> really<00:02:36.310> have<00:02:36.640> a

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
area and you shouldn't really have a

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.729 
area and you shouldn't really have a
face<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.239> close<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.659> a<00:02:37.720> kind

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.660

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
bring this hand up a little bit more

00:02:51.579 --> 00:03:00.820

perfect<00:02:52.150> thank<00:02:52.390> you

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.260 

so<00:03:01.830> this<00:03:02.040> thread<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.459> actually<00:03:02.610> from<00:03:03.060> Asia

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
so this thread is actually from Asia

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.750 
so this thread is actually from Asia
it's<00:03:04.260> slightly<00:03:04.709> thicker<00:03:04.950> than<00:03:05.190> cotton<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.730> has

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
it's slightly thicker than cotton it has

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.610 
it's slightly thicker than cotton it has
an<00:03:05.970> antiseptic<00:03:06.450> coating<00:03:07.170> on<00:03:07.319> it<00:03:09.080> you<00:03:10.080> can<00:03:10.350> use

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
an antiseptic coating on it you can use

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.130 
an antiseptic coating on it you can use
cotton<00:03:11.190> but<00:03:11.520> it<00:03:11.610> does<00:03:11.790> snap<00:03:12.120> very<00:03:12.569> regularly

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
cotton but it does snap very regularly

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.080 
cotton but it does snap very regularly
so<00:03:13.410> it's<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:14.160> doesn't<00:03:14.400> really<00:03:14.670> work<00:03:14.880> as<00:03:15.390> well
