in<00:00:04.290> today's<00:00:04.859> project<00:00:05.339> we're<00:00:05.430> going<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.609> be

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
in today's project we're going to be

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.220 
in today's project we're going to be
looking<00:00:05.819> at<00:00:06.029> double<00:00:06.299> glazing<00:00:06.509> windows<00:00:06.810> or

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
looking at double glazing windows or

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.980 
looking at double glazing windows or

secondary glazing double glazing works

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.690 
secondary glazing double glazing works
by<00:00:10.200> trapping<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.620> layer<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.889> still<00:00:11.190> air<00:00:11.400> between

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
by trapping a layer of still air between

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.539 
by trapping a layer of still air between
two<00:00:12.059> panes<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.509> glass<00:00:12.769> or<00:00:13.769> in<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.130> case<00:00:14.340> a

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
two panes of glass or in this case a

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.510 
two panes of glass or in this case a
layer<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.880> glass<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.690> layer<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:15.990> plastic

layer of glass and a layer of plastic
still<00:00:17.520> air<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> great<00:00:18.150> insulator<00:00:18.720> because

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
still air is a great insulator because

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.410 
still air is a great insulator because
windows<00:00:19.619> by<00:00:19.830> their<00:00:20.010> nature<00:00:20.220> are<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.090> worst

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
windows by their nature are the worst

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.109 
windows by their nature are the worst
insulators<00:00:22.369> now<00:00:23.369> surely<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.699> can<00:00:23.820> get<00:00:23.970> your

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
insulators now surely you can get your

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.759 
insulators now surely you can get your
house<00:00:24.269> double<00:00:24.630> glazed<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.470> get<00:00:25.590> all<00:00:25.710> the

all on the tape now this next week is

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.830 
all on the tape now this next week is
really<00:03:03.000> important

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
really important

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.440 
really important
basically<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.769> want<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.069> bond<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.940> ste<00:03:06.180> tape

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
basically you want to bond the ste tape

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.899 
basically you want to bond the ste tape
to<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.110> plastic<00:03:07.590> if<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.430> do<00:03:08.579> that<00:03:08.700> with<00:03:08.819> the

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
to the plastic if you do that with the

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.020 
to the plastic if you do that with the
back<00:03:09.060> thumbnail<00:03:09.780> or<00:03:10.140> back<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.769> spoon<00:03:11.040> and

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
back thumbnail or back of the spoon and

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.020 
back thumbnail or back of the spoon and
just<00:03:12.299> press<00:03:12.930> really<00:03:13.470> hard<00:03:14.329> every<00:03:15.329> single<00:03:16.260> area

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
just press really hard every single area

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.920 
just press really hard every single area
where<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.150> sticky<00:03:18.420> tape

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
where the sticky tape

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.229 
where the sticky tape
it's<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.620> plastic<00:03:19.829> it's<00:03:20.459> boring<00:03:20.909> it's

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
it's the plastic it's boring it's

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.259 
it's the plastic it's boring it's
laborious<00:03:21.590> it's<00:03:22.590> essential<00:03:23.010> like<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.000> many<00:03:24.120> of

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
laborious it's essential like so many of

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.210 
laborious it's essential like so many of
these<00:03:25.010> all<00:03:26.010> done<00:03:26.280> now<00:03:26.790> for<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.150> funby<00:03:27.980> do<00:03:28.980> not

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
these all done now for the funby do not

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.580 
these all done now for the funby do not
get<00:03:29.549> carried<00:03:29.849> away

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
get carried away

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.800 
get carried away
basically<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.459> hair<00:03:32.700> dry<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.000> dries<00:03:33.480> the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
basically the hair dry and dries the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.569 
basically the hair dry and dries the
plastic<00:03:34.260> taut<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:35.129> it's<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.280> bit<00:03:35.430> like<00:03:35.459> a

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
plastic taut so it's a bit like a

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.649 
plastic taut so it's a bit like a
trampoline<00:03:36.180> but<00:03:36.780> if<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.019> overdrive<00:03:37.769> the

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
trampoline but if you overdrive the

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.030 
trampoline but if you overdrive the
plastic<00:03:39.659> or<00:03:39.780> peel<00:03:39.959> away<00:03:40.109> from<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.440> tape<00:03:40.650> and

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
plastic or peel away from the tape and

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.890 
plastic or peel away from the tape and
basically<00:03:41.430> you've<00:03:41.760> got<00:03:41.879> a<00:03:41.909> shabby<00:03:42.180> useless

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
basically you've got a shabby useless

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:51.439 
basically you've got a shabby useless
bit<00:03:43.379> of<00:03:43.970> plastic<00:03:44.970> on<00:03:45.239> your<00:03:45.480> window<00:03:50.209> if<00:03:51.209> it's

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
bit of plastic on your window if it's

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.119 
bit of plastic on your window if it's
looking<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.720> bit<00:03:51.750> ripped<00:03:52.019> or<00:03:52.169> all<00:03:52.410> wrinkled

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
looking a bit ripped or all wrinkled

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.720 
looking a bit ripped or all wrinkled
anyway<00:03:53.519> just<00:03:53.940> give<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.239> bit

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.490 

it's<00:03:59.730> time<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.600> can<00:04:00.750> hardly<00:04:00.959> even<00:04:01.140> see

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
it's time and you can hardly even see

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.620 
it's time and you can hardly even see
it's<00:04:01.800> there<00:04:02.010> now<00:04:02.790> we've<00:04:03.000> just<00:04:03.030> got<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.420> trim

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
it's there now we've just got to trim

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.830 
it's there now we've just got to trim
off<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:04.620> debris<00:04:05.069> around<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.550> outside<00:04:08.840> you

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
off the debris around the outside you

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.640 
off the debris around the outside you
see<00:04:10.050> it<00:04:10.730> probably<00:04:11.730> not<00:04:12.170> that's<00:04:13.170> why<00:04:13.350> it's<00:04:13.470> so

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
see it probably not that's why it's so

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.180 
see it probably not that's why it's so
