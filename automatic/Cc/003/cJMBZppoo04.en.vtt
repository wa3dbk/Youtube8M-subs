time the way to fight ended it was very
incomplete<00:04:34.060> I<00:04:34.630> thought<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.710> way<00:04:35.890> Donaire

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
incomplete I thought the way Donaire

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.640 
incomplete I thought the way Donaire
walked<00:04:36.850> away<00:04:37.060> in<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.450> fourth<00:04:37.660> round<00:04:37.810> while

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
walked away in the fourth round while

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.190 
walked away in the fourth round while
the<00:04:38.830> round<00:04:39.070> was<00:04:39.370> still<00:04:39.640> in<00:04:39.910> progress<00:04:40.210> that

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
the round was still in progress that

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.010 
the round was still in progress that
made<00:04:41.500> Donaire<00:04:41.980> look<00:04:42.220> really<00:04:42.550> bad<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:43.750> know<00:04:43.870> he

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
made Donaire look really bad you know he

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.380 
made Donaire look really bad you know he
still<00:04:44.260> has<00:04:44.410> an<00:04:44.620> uphill<00:04:44.980> battle<00:04:45.040> but<00:04:45.880> that<00:04:46.120> left

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
still has an uphill battle but that left

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.040 
still has an uphill battle but that left
hook<00:04:46.660> is<00:04:46.900> very<00:04:47.680> dangerous<00:04:48.210> Donaire<00:04:49.210> is<00:04:49.480> a<00:04:49.510> very

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
hook is very dangerous Donaire is a very

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.630 
hook is very dangerous Donaire is a very
good<00:04:50.170> counter-puncher<00:04:50.680> I<00:04:51.100> will<00:04:51.340> give<00:04:51.490> him

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
counter-puncher with either the left

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.630 
counter-puncher with either the left
hook<00:04:55.060> or<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.360> right<00:04:56.020> hand<00:04:56.350> he<00:04:56.980> still<00:04:57.280> has<00:04:57.460> the

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
hook or the right hand he still has the

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.659 
hook or the right hand he still has the
speed<00:04:57.940> he<00:04:58.510> still<00:04:58.810> has<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.230> power<00:04:59.470> I<00:04:59.890> mean

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
speed he still has the power I mean

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.000 
speed he still has the power I mean
don't<00:05:01.090> ever<00:05:01.330> have<00:05:01.450> so<00:05:01.660> much<00:05:01.840> power<00:05:02.200> I'm

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
don't ever have so much power I'm

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.100 
don't ever have so much power I'm
thinking<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:03.730> he<00:05:04.210> probably<00:05:04.540> will<00:05:04.900> in<00:05:05.080> his

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
thinking that he probably will in his

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.040 
thinking that he probably will in his
career<00:05:05.620> at<00:05:05.800> welterweight<00:05:06.220> I<00:05:06.640> truly<00:05:07.120> don't<00:05:07.270> air

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
career at welterweight I truly don't air

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.860 
career at welterweight I truly don't air
is<00:05:08.230> a<00:05:08.260> big<00:05:08.770> feather<00:05:09.430> way<00:05:09.700> all<00:05:10.300> right<00:05:10.570> he's<00:05:10.840> a

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
is a big feather way all right he's a

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.930 
is a big feather way all right he's a
big<00:05:11.200> feather<00:05:11.440> way<00:05:11.710> he's<00:05:12.220> brought<00:05:12.520> his<00:05:12.669> power

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
big feather way he's brought his power

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.930 
big feather way he's brought his power
up<00:05:13.240> pretty<00:05:13.660> well<00:05:13.750> and<00:05:14.260> I<00:05:14.320> think<00:05:15.160> Donaire<00:05:15.730> he

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
up pretty well and I think Donaire he

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.430 
up pretty well and I think Donaire he
