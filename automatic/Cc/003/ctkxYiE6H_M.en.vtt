over a year now and how this works two

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.690 
over a year now and how this works two
basic<00:02:21.380> pulling<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.470> red<00:02:22.709> button<00:02:22.950> down<00:02:23.370> right

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
basic pulling this red button down right

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.380 
basic pulling this red button down right
here<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:25.440> just<00:02:25.470> flies<00:02:25.890> right<00:02:26.190> open<00:02:26.580> you

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390

have<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.569> half<00:02:28.140> serrated<00:02:28.560> edge<00:02:28.890> here<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.569> then

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
have a half serrated edge here and then

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.720 
have a half serrated edge here and then
of<00:02:30.690> course<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:31.050> sharp<00:02:31.319> friend<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.459> think

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
of course the sharp friend and I think

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.910 
of course the sharp friend and I think
the<00:02:32.880> whole<00:02:33.060> knife-fight<00:02:33.300> not<00:02:34.230> mistaken<00:02:34.739> like

the whole knife-fight not mistaken like

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.729 
the whole knife-fight not mistaken like
three<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.310> half<00:02:35.340> inches<00:02:36.200> on<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.500> side

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
three and a half inches on this side

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.090 
three and a half inches on this side
over<00:02:37.920> here<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:39.030> do<00:02:39.270> have<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.900> bottle<00:02:40.770> opener

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
over here you do have the bottle opener

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.550 
over here you do have the bottle opener
which<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.580> can<00:02:42.570> claim<00:02:42.810> does<00:02:43.050> not<00:02:43.260> work<00:02:43.530> very

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
which I can claim does not work very

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.270 
which I can claim does not work very
well<00:02:43.970> it<00:02:44.970> probably<00:02:45.840> would<00:02:45.989> take<00:02:46.890> three<00:02:47.160> or

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
well it probably would take three or

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.210 
well it probably would take three or
four<00:02:47.550> different<00:02:47.850> tries<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.540> get<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:49.010> top<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.160> a
