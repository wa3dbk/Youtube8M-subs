2017 spider-man um but me and especially
since<00:01:11.860> this<00:01:12.100> is<00:01:12.369> probably<00:01:13.360> one<00:01:13.960> of<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.229> most

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
since this is probably one of the most

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.440 
since this is probably one of the most
yet<00:01:15.250> him<00:01:16.080> he's<00:01:17.080> well<00:01:17.409> he<00:01:17.619> it<00:01:17.860> may<00:01:18.250> be<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:19.420> most

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440

I would highly suggest Logan Lerman yes
the<00:06:28.159> BIR<00:06:28.340> Zeit<00:06:28.580> jackson<00:06:29.030> movie<00:06:29.180> sucked<00:06:29.719> but

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
the BIR Zeit jackson movie sucked but

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.080 
the BIR Zeit jackson movie sucked but
Logan<00:06:30.979> Lerman<00:06:31.159> was<00:06:31.669> the<00:06:31.940> best<00:06:32.330> part<00:06:32.990> of<00:06:33.259> them<00:06:33.560> I

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
Logan Lerman was the best part of them I

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.670 
Logan Lerman was the best part of them I
think<00:06:35.090> that<00:06:35.210> though<00:06:35.360> percy<00:06:35.840> jackson<00:06:36.380> movies

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
think that though percy jackson movies

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.740 
think that though percy jackson movies
really<00:06:37.099> gave<00:06:37.340> him<00:06:37.639> an<00:06:37.789> adventurous<00:06:38.479> side

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
really gave him an adventurous side

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.439 
really gave him an adventurous side
which<00:06:39.169> could<00:06:39.650> really<00:06:39.860> be<00:06:40.190> good<00:06:40.490> uh<00:06:40.909> when<00:06:41.300> he's

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
which could really be good uh when he's

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:44.140 
which could really be good uh when he's
playing<00:06:41.630> spiderman<00:06:42.349> time<00:06:42.740> he<00:06:43.250> also<00:06:43.490> starred

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.490 
in The Perks of Being a Wallflower which

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.850 
in The Perks of Being a Wallflower which

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
would add some awkwardness which would

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.899 
would add some awkwardness which would
work<00:06:49.070> into<00:06:49.969> his<00:06:50.419> side<00:06:50.900> of<00:06:51.169> Peter<00:06:51.440> Parker<00:06:51.909> but

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:52.909
